14630,microplastics originate from the physical chemical or biological degradation of plastics in the environment once ingested by organisms at the bottom of the food chain microplastics are passed on to organisms at higher trophic levels posing a threat to human health the distribution of microplastics and the metabolic pathways involved in their microbial degradation in surface sediments of drinking water reservoirs are still poorly understood this study analyzed the occurrence patterns of microplastics and microbial community structure associated with microplastic biodegradation in surface sediments from a deep reservoir at various hydrostatic pressures based on the results of fourier transform and laser direct infrared spectroscopy elevating the pressure resulted in altered sizes and shapes of microplastics in sediment samples with the presence of microorganisms the influence of hydrostatic pressure on small sized microplastics 20 500 μm was pronounced for instance high pressure accelerated the breakdown of fibers pellets and fragments into smaller sized microplastics in particular the mean size of polyethylene terephthalate microplastics decreased from 425 78 μm at atmospheric pressure to 366 62 μm at 0 7 mpa metagenomic analysis revealed an increase in the relative abundances of plastic degrading genera such as rhodococcus flavobacterium and aspergillus in response to elevated pressures eight functional genes for biodegradation of polystyrene polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate microplastics were annotated including paak lada tpha3 of these tpha3 gene abundance was negatively influenced by hydrostatic pressure providing direct evidence for the pathway by which microbial metabolism of polyethylene terephthalate led to decreased microplastic size under high pressure conditions this study presents novel insights into hydrostatic pressure driven microbial community structure functional gene abundance and key metabolic pathways

microplastics reservoir sediment 1 introduction microplastics also known as a trojan horse for particulate matter and trace metals in water hildebrandt et al 2021 are plastic fragments and pellets less than 5 mm in diameter siegfried et al 2017 microplastics originate from the physical chemical or biological degradation of larger plastics used in industrial products and cosmetics ivleva et al 2017 they are widely present in water atmosphere and soil environments wright et al 2020 enders et al 2015 and even found in fish digestive tract parker et al 2020 and human blood leslie et al 2022 since microplastics can adsorb heavy metals antibiotics and organic pollutants zuo et al 2019 li et al 2018 brennecke et al 2016 exposure to microplastics leads to chronic toxicity and digestive system obstruction zimmermann et al 2020 in addition microplastics are difficult to degrade and persist in the environment for a long time therefore unraveling the distribution patterns of microplastics in environmental media is essential for decision making in pollution control polymer type determines the buoyancy and density of plastics most plastics are less dense than water and float on the water surface however weathering and biodegradation of plastics lead to changes in their buoyancy and density allowing them to spread into the water column and sediment maes et al 2017 microplastics have been found in aquatic sediments around the world such as surface sediments in the european arctic choudhary et al 2022 bottom sediments of anchar lake in the kashmir valley northwestern himalaya neelavannan et al 2022 seafloor sediments in the baltic sea zobkov et al 2017 and coastal sediments depth 43 154 m along the spanish mediterranean continental shelf filgueiras et al 2019 numerous studies have shown that fibers and fragments are the most frequently detected shapes of microplastics in sediments firdaus et al 2020 niu et al 2021 with polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps being the dominant polymer types pojar et al 2021 xu et al 2020 the size of microplastics detected ranges from 5 to 5 mm which may be related to the type of instruments used for microplastic characterization for instance fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy has a limit of detection of 10 20 μm wright et al 2020 it is difficult to make a horizontal comparison of microplastic data from different studies because of inconsistent methods used for sampling and analysis furthermore the majority of previous studies have collected sediment samples from the 0 0 5 m surface layer pojar et al 2021 liu et al 2021 phuong et al 2018 and effective information is still lacking on the environmental behaviors of microplastics at various depths microplastics provide natural surfaces for biofilm formation owing to their unique physical properties microbial communities colonizing microplastic surfaces are distinct from those in the soil matrix as a result of various carbon sources and inherent microplastic characteristics kirstein et al 2019 deposited microplastics are preferentially exposed to pollutant rich environments such as water bodies and unique microbial communities develop after the adsorption of pollutants onto microplastics frias et al 2010 microplastics broken down by weathering also release additional carbon aravinthan et al 2016 green et al 2016 which is a potential factor for microbial colonization consequently microplastics entering the sediment influence native microbial community composition with polymer type and geographic factors affecting microbial diversity amaral et al 2015 in addition the presence of microplastics alters the abundances of nitrogen cycling related genes nifh aobamoa and nirk rong et al 2021 on the other hand plastic degrading microorganisms such as members of the genera aspergillus pseudomonas comamonas paenibacillus and flavobacterium are identified in diverse environments table s2 furthermore some microbial functional genes such as tpha1 tphb lada and paak are found to be associated with biodegradation of microplastics made of particular polymer types neelavannan et al 2022 zobkov et al 2017 therefore to further understand the occurrence patterns of microplastics in aquatic sediments it is pertinent to clarify the interactions of microplastics and microorganisms from the community structure and gene function perspective microplastic pollution in aquatic sediments has been extensively studied in natural water bodies such as oceans rivers and lakes as a matter of fact microplastics can easily enter drinking water reservoirs through surface runoff and atmospheric deposition cole et al 2011 moreover there is a potential pathway for microplastics in tap water to enter the human body tong et al 2020 as reservoirs are usually deep their bottom hydrostatic pressure varies considerably with water depth it has been found that hydrostatic pressure has an effect on cell gene expression tan et al 2021 high hydrostatic pressure promotes phosphorus transformation in and release from reservoir sediments by regulating ppk phod and pqqc gene expression zhuo et al 2021 currently there is insufficient information on how hydrostatic pressure influences microbial communities and functional genes associated with microplastic biodegradation in surface sediments of drinking water reservoirs filling this knowledge gap is essential for uncovering microbe mediated behaviors of microplastics in aquatic environments therefore we hypothesized that differences in the hydrostatic pressure would drive shifts in microbial community structure and gene function thereby influencing the biodegradation of microplastics in reservoir sediments to verify the hypothesis we conducted simulation experiments to ascertain the distribution patterns of microplastics and their coupling mechanisms with microbial diversity community composition and functional gene abundance in surface sediments from a drinking water reservoir at various hydrostatic pressures the results of this study could provide evidence for the key metabolic pathways involved in microbial degradation of microplastics in reservoir sediments under different pressure conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sediment sampling was conducted in a deep reservoir 34 3 25 2 n 108 12 28 8 e located 86

until all microplastic particles were transferred to the membrane the microplastics were observed under a stereomicroscope and recorded for their color size and shape the experimental apparatus and

software originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 occurrence patterns and size distribution of microplastics microplastics were observed in all incubated sediment samples fig 2 the ftir results showed that pet 28 0 on average ps 23 2 and pe 19 6 were the major polymer types of microplastics other polymer types included polycaprolactone pcl 8 8 polyamide pa 8 6 polyurethane pu 5 1 poly butyleneadipate co terephthalate pbat 4 1 and polylactic acid pla 2 6 fig 3 a in addition transparent microplastics accounted for an average of 58 3 in the samples whereas yellow and white microplastics accounted for 15 9 and 15 4 respectively fig 3 the most dominant shape of microplastics was fibers 36 8 on average followed by pellets 35 8 fig 3b the abundance of microplastics ranged between 3050 and 6250 particle kg dry mass the mean size of total microplastics was 474 5 μm and the mean size in the non antimicrobial and antimicrobial groups was 471 3 and 477 1 μm respectively up to 68 6 of microplastics were distributed in the size range of 20 500 μm including 29 6 in the 250 500 μm size class and the remaining 31 4 fell in the size range of 500 5000 μm the proportion of 250 500 μm microplastics was highest in both the au 34 7 and fu 32 8 groups whereas 500 1000 μm and 100 250 μm microplastics took up the highest proportion in the tu 33 3 and su 35 2 groups respectively fig 3c the ldir results showed that chlorinated polyethylene cpe 37 6 on average and pu 32 17 were the major polymer types of microplastics accompanied by silicon resin sr 10 1 acrylics acr 3 8 polypropylene pp 2 2 and pe 2 3 fig 3d the most dominant shape of microplastics was pellets 60 4 on average followed by fragments 33 7 fig 3e the abundance of microplastics ranged between 1100 and 12 500 particles kg dry mass the mean size of total microplastics was 53 8 μm and the mean size of microplastics in the non antimicrobial and antimicrobial groups was 49 54 and 59 20 μm respectively overall the microplastics after incubation with non antimicrobial treatment were smaller than those after incubation with antimicrobial treatment and were dominated by small sized particles 20 500 μm 67 2 fig 3f based on the ftir results the mean size of microplastics at various pressures was 418 54 595 29 376 54 and 392 69 μm in the au tu fu and su groups respectively fig 4 a there were more abundant microplastics in the non antimicrobial group than in the antimicrobial group at the same pressure level p 0 05 we then merged the microplastic size data from the two treatment groups under the same pressure conditions fig 4b and integrated all microplastic size data from the non antimicrobial and antimicrobial groups fig 4c in both cases the number of microplastics in the size range of 20 1000 μm was remarkably larger than that of 1000 3000 μm particles within the range of 20 1000 μm the number of 20 500 µm particles was larger than that of 500 1000 μm particles the results indicate that elevating the hydrostatic pressure altered the size and shape of microplastics especially small particles 20 500 μm based on the ldir results the mean size of microplastics at various pressures was 54 64 44 93 50 64 μ and 42 54 μm in the au tu fu and su groups respectively fig 4d we also incorporated the microplastic size data from the two treatment groups under the same pressure conditions fig 4e and merged all microplastic size data from the non antimicrobial and antimicrobial groups fig 4f the particles were distinctly clustered in the size range of 20 100 μm and the number of 20 50 μm particles always ranked the highest in terms of their proportion within the 20 100 μm range elevation of the hydrostatic pressure from low to high levels resulted in a downward trend in microplastic size with the smallest mean size observed in the su group although ftir based mean size of microplastics was smallest in the fu group 376 54 μm the collective results of ftir and ldir spectroscopy indicate that hydrostatic pressure influenced the size and shape of microplastics and the influence on small sized particles was more pronounced than that on large sized particles 3 2 microbial community structure and functional gene abundance despite the inconsistent results of ftir and ldir both analyses revealed that the presence of microorganisms in sediment samples led to variable decrease in the mean size of microplastics under various pressure conditions further we analyzed the possible mechanisms and pathways by which microbial communities and functional genes mediate the changes in microplastic size based on metagenomic sequencing results a total of 33 780 otus were retrieved from 12 sediment samples four pressure groups three parallel samples among the top 20 most abundant otus acidobacteria accounted for the largest proportion 12 05 followed by rokubacteria 6 51 and verrucomicrobia 2 36 fig 5 other abundant otus included planctomycetes 1 44 gemmatimonadetes 1 31 chloroflexi 1 18 proteobacteria 1 02 geothrix 0 78 alphaproteobacteria 0 76 and rhodoplanes 0 67 the relative abundance of rokubacteria was highest in the au group 7 44 and lowest in the fu group 5 92 importantly acidobacteria bacterium acidobacteria bacterium rifcsplowo2 12 full 67 14b gemmatimonadetes bacterium and geothrix fermentans decreased in relative abundance with increasing hydrostatic pressure which indicates the influence of different hydrostatic pressures on the dominant microbial species α diversity analysis revealed that the mean chao1 index and shannon index of microbial communities under various pressure conditions were 27 654 281 and 9 81 0 07 respectively table s1 overall the α diversity indices were higher in the au group compared with those of the other three pressure groups elevation of the pressure led to a decrease in community richness otu number and species diversity albeit not significant among various pressure groups in addition pcoa analysis of microbial community structure revealed variable overlap among sediment samples incubated at various pressures fig s1 this suggests that there were no distinct differences in microbial community structure among the four different pressure groups consistent with the results of α diversity analysis we compared previously reported plastic degrading microbial genera table s2 with the metagenomic sequencing results of microbial communities in various sample groups under the experimental conditions on this basis the abundance information of functional genera for microbial degradation of microplastics was selected fig 6 a in terms of their relative abundance the top 10 genera ranked in descending order of flavobacterium pseudomonas arthrobacter paenibacillus rhodococcus bacillus chitinophaga achromobacter stenotrophomonas and comamonas these plastic degrading genera were present in considerably low proportions even the most abundant genus flavobacterium only took up 0 014 and the second most abundant genus pseudomonas accounted for 0 009 in addition we calculated the abundance of previously reported functional genes for plastic biodegradation table s3 using the rpkm method based on metagenomic data there were two functional genes each for biodegradation of ps paak feab and pe alkb1 lada and four functional genes for biodegradation of pet microplastics pcah pcag tpha2 tpha3 of these paak was the most abundant accounting for 73 47 of the total abundance of the eight functional genes and pcah was the second most abundant 8 87 whereas tpha3 was the least abundant 0 17 fig 6b further we analyzed the abundance of the top 10 taxa carrying the functional genes fig 6c among them rokubacteria was the most abundant accounting for 42 05 of the total abundance of the 10 taxa and betaproteobacteria was the second most abundant 13 44 whereas gammaproteobacteria was the least abundant 2 84 the abundance of pe degrading genes in the au tu fu and su groups was 120 94 94 and 119 respectively fig 6b and comparing the mean size of pe microplastics revealed no significant upward and downward trends among the four groups table s4 the abundance of ps degrading microorganisms in the au tu fu and su groups was 1272 1222 1113 and 1268 respectively with a relatively noticeable decrease in the fu group comparison of the mean size of ps microplastics table s4 led to a conclusion consistent with that obtained for pe microplastics with an elevation of hydrostatic pressure the abundance of pet degrading genes increased from 210 au to 220 su by 4 76 fig 6b which resulted in a 13 66 decrease in the particle size of pet microplastics fig 6d that is the su group showed the highest abundance of pet degrading genes 27 2 and the smallest mean size of pet microplastics 366 62 μm this allowed us to speculate that hydrostatic pressure coupled with microbial action reduced the particle size of pet which was further verified in the subsequent functional contribution analysis fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 influence of hydrostatic pressure on microplastic size and shape this study found that the microplastics in reservoir sediments incubated under non antimicrobial treatment had smaller sizes than those under antimicrobial treatment in the antimicrobial group the number of 20 100 μm microplastics continuously decreased as a result of elevated hydrostatic pressures whereas the opposite trend was observed for 500 1000 μm microplastics the pattern of microplastic shape mirrored that of microplastic size fig 2 these results indicate that in the absence of microorganisms changing the hydrostatic pressure led to alterations in both the size and shape of microplastics in sediment samples but the degree of alterations was variable for instance the influence of hydrostatic pressure was more pronounced on small sized microplastics 20 500 μm than on large sized microplastics 500 5000 µm in the non antimicrobial group the number of 20 500 µm microplastics all decreased first and then increased with an elevation of hydrostatic pressure despite no evident changes in microplastic shape fig 2 these results indicate that in the presence of microorganisms elevating the hydrostatic pressure contributed to a decrease in microplastic size and had a certain influence on microplastic shape such as accelerating the fragmentation of fibers pellets and fragments to form smaller particles it should be noted that ldir can identify particles of 3 μm in size when using the agilent technologies clarity software and attenuated total reflection analysis this technique can also detect particles of 10 μm in size with normal methods which is below the limit of detection of ftir i e 20 μm agilent technologies 2019 therefore in terms of quantity ldir can detect more microplastics than ftir additionally ldir analysis can eliminate the impact of operational errors using the particle finder software and avoid errors caused by man made operation when using fitr zhang et al 2022 furthermore different spectral libraries are used for ftir and ldir technologies 2019 yielding variable results despite the inconsistent results obtained by ldir and fitr both demonstrated the same variation pattern in microplastic size that is microplastic size decreased in response to elevated hydrostatic pressures microplastics that enter the water column can settle into the sediment wang et al 2019 niu et al 2021 the occurrence patterns and spatiotemporal distributions of microplastics in aquatic sediments have been documented peng et al 2020 mughini et al 2021 for instance pe pet and ps are the major polymer types of microplastics in sediments pojar et al 2021 xu et al 2020 with films fragments fibers and pellets being the dominant shapes xu et al 2020 the size of microplastics in sediments mainly ranged from 20 to 500 μm zuo et al 2020 all these findings are compatible with our results obtained from reservoir sediments 4 2 microbial community responses to hydrostatic pressure this study deciphered the role of hydrostatic pressure in altering microplastic shape and size in reservoir sediments by taking into account microorganisms as an influencing factor rong et al 2021 investigated the influence of low density pe on microbial communities in the soil environment finding that the proportion of the dominant bacterial phylum rokubacteria in the control and treatment groups ranged from 0 7 to 1 8 there is a huge gap between the previous result and the proportion of rokubacteria carrying plastic degrading genes reported in the present study 42 05 rong et al 2021 most likely a result of the distinct environmental media our results confirmed that the major microbial taxa in sediment samples included plastic degrading genera such as rhodoplanes non plastic degrading major taxa also took part in microplastic biodegradation or they had an indirect influence on the biodegradation process in recent years plastic degrading bacterial strains have been isolated from diverse environments li et al 2020 tu et al 2020 including members of the genera pseudomonas and bacillus identified in the present study moreover plastic degrading genes have been annotated based on metagenomic sequencing wright et al 2021 experimental evidence suggests that bacteria can secrete hydrolases to hydrolyze plastic macromolecules into micromolecules that can be used by other cells biundo et al 2018 schmidt et al 2017 based on the metagenomic sequencing results we obtained the relative abundances fig 6a of 24 plastic degrading genera table s1 in sediment samples from different treatment groups plastic degrading bacteria such as the most abundant genera flavobacterium and pseudomonas only accounted for 0 01 each this indicates that plastic degrading bacteria were present in considerably low proportions of microbial communities and lacked significant differences in community composition at various hydrostatic pressures in contrast flavobacterium chitinophaga rhodococcus arthrobacter staphylococcus and aspergillus showed a slight upward trend in their relative abundance at elevated hydrostatic pressures it has been suggested that microplastics can recruit flavobacterium spp and pseudomonas spp hu et al 2021 both of which are able to biodegrade plastic polymers veethahavya et al 2016 especially pe and pet despite low taxa abundance there were no marked differences in microbial community composition in sediment samples under various pressure conditions this is consistent with the conclusion based on α diversity and pcoa analyses thus supporting the authenticity and validity of the results importantly we detected the presence of barophilic microorganisms such as shewanella colwellia moritella and psychromonas yan 2017 in sediment samples under different pressure conditions we then searched the literature and found the pressure sensitive gene asd and the omph gene encoding pressure inducible protein mentré et al 2001 the relative abundance of the top 10 microbial taxa harboring the two barophilic genes was analyzed fig 6e by comparing the 10 barophilic taxa with those taxa carrying plastic degrading genes fig 6e we found that one barophilic genus bradyrhizobium also contains plastic degrading genes this genus accounted for 2 5 of the total microbial community harboring barophilic genes ranking the fourth its proportion in the total microbial community carrying plastic degrading genes was 5 20 ranking the third additionally bradyrhizobium ranked the second among the total microbial community carrying pet degrading genes overall bradyrhizobium accounted for 2 5 of the total microbial community despite this relatively low abundance the results still provided evidence that hydrostatic pressure drove the microbial community structure and microbe mediated degradation of pet microplastics in reservoir sediments 4 3 microbial gene function driven by hydrostatic pressure to further identify the association between plastic degrading genes and relevant taxa we conducted taxonomic genus level and functional contribution analysis for eight functional genes involved in pet pe and ps biodegradation table s3 among them rokubacteria and betaproteobacteria were the top two major contributors to plastic degrading genes fig 7a rokubacteria was also the second most abundant taxon based on metagenomic sequencing data fig 5 we found that rokubacteria contributed most to tpha2 87 95 whereas alphaproteobacteria was the largest contributor to tpha3 100 the relative contributions of rokubacteria to the functional genes for pet pe and ps biodegradation were 32 12 24 08 and 21 62 respectively fig 7b taking into account microplastic size we found no remarkable changes in the size of pe and ps microplastics under different pressure conditions table s4 despite the high abundances of functional genes for ps and pe biodegradation it is worth noting that fewer functional genes for ps and pe biodegradation two each were annotated compared with those for pet biodegradation therefore incomplete biodegradation function of the annotated genes might be responsible for the minimal change in the size of ps and pe microplastics at various hydrostatic pressures on the other hand there were as many as four functional genes for pet biodegradation which contributed to a 13 66 decrease in the mean size of pet microplastics from atmospheric pressure au to 0 7 mpa su therefore fewer functional genes associated with biodegradation of microplastics might be responsible for the minimal change in the size of ps and pe microplastics at various hydrostatic pressures based on multiple comparisons the relative abundance of k18075 i e the tpha3 gene for pet biodegradation was significantly different among the four pressure groups p 0 05 in addition pairwise comparisons revealed that the relative abundance of tpha3 was significantly different between the au and fu groups p 0 05 or between the tu and fu groups p 0 01 fig 8 a the pet biodegradation process is illustrated in map00624 based on the kegg database fig 8c which involves the tpha2 tpha3 pacg and pach genes annotated in the present study this biodegradation process mainly consists of the binding of petase active site to the ester bond of pet and subsequent biodegradation of plastics catalyzed by the active site wright et al 2021 based on the metabolic pathways involved in pet biodegradation pacg and pach participate in 3 4 dihydroxy benzoate metabolism and both genes had considerably high relative abundances in various groups in addition tpha2 and tpha3 take part in terephthalate metabolism and both genes had substantially low relative abundances in all groups further we re analyzed these two groups of functional genes fig 8b when the hydrostatic pressure was elevated a slight increase occurred in the relative abundances of pacg and pach whereas the relative abundances of tpha2 and tpha3 variably decreased the mean size of pet microplastics also decreased as a result of elevated hydrostatic pressures but the decrease mainly occurred between the tu and fu groups meanwhile the tu group showed the lowest relative abundance of the functional genes which corroborated that the mean size of pet microplastics was larger in the tu group than in the other groups accordingly changing the hydrostatic pressure influenced the abundance of tpha2 tpha3 pacg and pach genes in other words hydrostatic pressure drove plastic degrading microorganisms at the functional gene level to cause changes in microplastic size in reservoir sediments 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the occurrence patterns of microplastics in surface sediments of a drinking water reservoir as influenced by hydrostatic pressure the ftir and ldir results indicated that the major shapes of microplastics were fibers pellets films and fragments with sizes in the range of 20 2860 μm the polymer types of microplastics mainly included pet ps pe cpe and pu in transparent yellow and white colors in the presence of microorganisms the shape and size of microplastics were influenced by elevating hydrostatic pressure for instance the microplastic size decreased and the microplastic shape was broken down from fragments into smaller particles this phenomenon was particularly evident for small sized microplastics 20 500 μm the metagenomic sequencing results of sediment samples showed that plastic degrading genera such as rhodococcus flavobacterium and aspergillus were enriched at higher hydrostatic pressures eight functional genes for ps pe and pet biodegradation such as paak lada and tpha2 were annotated by the kegg database of these the abundance of the tpha3 gene for pet degradation was significantly influenced by hydrostatic pressure and the mean size of pet microplastics decreased under elevated pressure conditions this led to the conclusion that high hydrostatic pressure drove plastic degrading microorganisms at the functional gene level to cause changes in microplastic size this study presents novel insights into the mechanisms how hydrostatic pressure regulates microbial gene function in the biodegradation of microplastics in reservoir sediments findings of this study provide a new idea for identifying the response patterns of microbial communities and functional genes to various hydrostatic pressures and associated metabolic pathways in deep reservoirs metatranscriptomic studies are warranted to verify

sizes and shapes of microplastics in sediment samples with the presence of microorganisms the influence of hydrostatic pressure on small sized microplastics 20 500 μm was pronounced for instance high pressure accelerated the breakdown of fibers pellets and fragments into smaller sized microplastics in particular the mean size of polyethylene terephthalate microplastics decreased from 425 78 μm at atmospheric pressure to 366 62 μm at 0 7 mpa metagenomic analysis revealed an increase in the relative abundances of plastic degrading genera such as rhodococcus flavobacterium and aspergillus in response to elevated pressures eight functional genes for biodegradation of polystyrene polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate microplastics were annotated including paak lada tpha3 of these tpha3 gene abundance was negatively influenced by hydrostatic pressure providing direct evidence for the pathway by which microbial metabolism of polyethylene terephthalate led to decreased microplastic size under high pressure conditions this study presents novel insights into hydrostatic pressure driven microbial community structure functional gene abundance and key metabolic pathways

microplastics reservoir sediment 1 introduction microplastics also known as a trojan horse for particulate matter and trace metals in water hildebrandt et al 2021 are plastic fragments and pellets less than 5 mm in diameter siegfried et al 2017 microplastics originate from the physical chemical or biological degradation of larger plastics used in industrial products and cosmetics ivleva et al 2017 they are widely present in water atmosphere and soil environments wright et al 2020 enders et al 2015 and even found in fish digestive tract parker et al 2020 and human blood leslie et al 2022 since microplastics can adsorb heavy metals antibiotics and organic pollutants zuo et al 2019 li et al 2018 brennecke et al 2016 exposure to microplastics leads to chronic toxicity and digestive system obstruction zimmermann et al 2020 in addition microplastics are difficult to degrade and persist in the environment for a long time therefore unraveling the distribution patterns of microplastics in environmental media is essential for decision making in pollution control polymer type determines the buoyancy and density of plastics most plastics are less dense than water and float on the water surface however weathering and biodegradation of plastics lead to changes in their buoyancy and density allowing them to spread into the water column and sediment maes et al 2017 microplastics have been found in aquatic sediments around the world such as surface sediments in the european arctic choudhary et al 2022 bottom sediments of anchar lake in the kashmir valley northwestern himalaya neelavannan et al 2022 seafloor sediments in the baltic sea zobkov et al 2017 and coastal sediments depth 43 154 m along the spanish mediterranean continental shelf filgueiras et al 2019 numerous studies have shown that fibers and fragments are the most frequently detected shapes of microplastics in sediments firdaus et al 2020 niu et al 2021 with polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps being the dominant polymer types pojar et al 2021 xu et al 2020 the size of microplastics detected ranges from 5 to 5 mm which may be related to the type of instruments used for microplastic characterization for instance fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy has a limit of detection of 10 20 μm wright et al 2020 it is difficult to make a horizontal comparison of microplastic data from different studies because of inconsistent methods used for sampling and analysis furthermore the majority of previous studies have collected sediment samples from the 0 0 5 m surface layer pojar et al 2021 liu et al 2021 phuong et al 2018 and effective information is still lacking on the environmental behaviors of microplastics at various depths microplastics provide natural surfaces for biofilm formation owing to their unique physical properties microbial communities colonizing microplastic surfaces are distinct from those in the soil matrix as a result of various carbon sources and inherent microplastic characteristics kirstein et al 2019 deposited microplastics are preferentially exposed to pollutant rich environments such as water bodies and unique microbial communities develop after the adsorption of pollutants onto microplastics frias et al 2010 microplastics broken down by weathering also release additional carbon aravinthan et al 2016 green et al 2016 which is a potential factor for microbial colonization consequently microplastics entering the sediment influence native microbial community composition with polymer type and geographic factors affecting microbial diversity amaral et al 2015 in addition the presence of microplastics alters the abundances of nitrogen cycling related genes nifh aobamoa and nirk rong et al 2021 on the other hand plastic degrading microorganisms such as members of the genera aspergillus pseudomonas comamonas paenibacillus and flavobacterium are identified in diverse environments table s2 furthermore some microbial functional genes such as tpha1 tphb lada and paak are found to be associated with biodegradation of microplastics made of particular polymer types neelavannan et al 2022 zobkov et al 2017 therefore to further understand the occurrence patterns of microplastics in aquatic sediments it is pertinent to clarify the interactions of microplastics and microorganisms from the community structure and gene function perspective microplastic pollution in aquatic sediments has been extensively studied in natural water bodies such as oceans rivers and lakes as a matter of fact microplastics can easily enter drinking water reservoirs through surface runoff and atmospheric deposition cole et al 2011 moreover there is a potential pathway for microplastics in tap water to enter the human body tong et al 2020 as reservoirs are usually deep their bottom hydrostatic pressure varies considerably with water depth it has been found that hydrostatic pressure has an effect on cell gene expression tan et al 2021 high hydrostatic pressure promotes phosphorus transformation in and release from reservoir sediments by regulating ppk phod and pqqc gene expression zhuo et al 2021 currently there is insufficient information on how hydrostatic pressure influences microbial communities and functional genes associated with microplastic biodegradation in surface sediments of drinking water reservoirs filling this knowledge gap is essential for uncovering microbe mediated behaviors of microplastics in aquatic environments therefore we hypothesized that differences in the hydrostatic pressure would drive shifts in microbial community structure and gene function thereby influencing the biodegradation of microplastics in reservoir sediments to verify the hypothesis we conducted simulation experiments to ascertain the distribution patterns of microplastics and their coupling mechanisms with microbial diversity community composition and functional gene abundance in surface sediments from a drinking water reservoir at various hydrostatic pressures the results of this study could provide evidence for the key metabolic pathways involved in microbial degradation of microplastics in reservoir sediments under different pressure conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sediment sampling was conducted in a deep reservoir 34 3 25 2 n 108 12 28 8 e located 86

digest organic matter for 24 h stanton et al 2020 after that the digested solution was filtered through a stainless steel filter membrane and the beaker was repeatedly rinsed with distilled water until all microplastic particles were transferred to the membrane the microplastics were observed under a stereomicroscope and recorded for their color size and shape the experimental apparatus and

addition a laser direct infrared ldir imaging spectrometer agilent 8700ldir agilent technologies santa clara ca usa was operated in the particle analysis mode with a size range of 20 500 μm the ldir spectra with a match of 65 were used to determine the polymer type 2 5 metagenomic sequencing total genomic dna was extracted from 0 2 g of sediment samples using the omega dna kit m5635 02 omega bio

software originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 occurrence patterns and size distribution of microplastics microplastics were observed in all incubated sediment samples fig 2 the ftir results showed that pet 28 0 on average ps 23 2 and pe 19 6 were the major polymer types of microplastics other polymer types included polycaprolactone pcl 8 8 polyamide pa 8 6 polyurethane pu 5 1 poly butyleneadipate co terephthalate pbat 4 1 and polylactic acid pla 2 6 fig 3 a in addition transparent microplastics accounted for an average of 58 3 in the samples whereas yellow and white microplastics accounted for 15 9 and 15 4 respectively fig 3 the most dominant shape of microplastics was fibers 36 8 on average followed by pellets 35 8 fig 3b the abundance of microplastics ranged between 3050 and 6250 particle kg dry mass the mean size of total microplastics was 474 5 μm and the mean size in the non antimicrobial and antimicrobial groups was 471 3 and 477 1 μm respectively up to 68 6 of microplastics were distributed in the size range of 20 500 μm including 29 6 in the 250 500 μm size class and the remaining 31 4 fell in the size range of 500 5000 μm the proportion of 250 500 μm microplastics was highest in both the au 34 7 and fu 32 8 groups whereas 500 1000 μm and 100 250 μm microplastics took up the highest proportion in the tu 33 3 and su 35 2 groups respectively fig 3c the ldir results showed that chlorinated polyethylene cpe 37 6 on average and pu 32 17 were the major polymer types of microplastics accompanied by silicon resin sr 10 1 acrylics acr 3 8 polypropylene pp 2 2 and pe 2 3 fig 3d the most dominant shape of microplastics was pellets 60 4 on average followed by fragments 33 7 fig 3e the abundance of microplastics ranged between 1100 and 12 500 particles kg dry mass the mean size of total microplastics was 53 8 μm and the mean size of microplastics in the non antimicrobial and antimicrobial groups was 49 54 and 59 20 μm respectively overall the microplastics after incubation with non antimicrobial treatment were smaller than those after incubation with antimicrobial treatment and were dominated by small sized particles 20 500 μm 67 2 fig 3f based on the ftir results the mean size of microplastics at various pressures was 418 54 595 29 376 54 and 392 69 μm in the au tu fu and su groups respectively fig 4 a there were more abundant microplastics in the non antimicrobial group than in the antimicrobial group at the same pressure level p 0 05 we then merged the microplastic size data from the two treatment groups under the same pressure conditions fig 4b and integrated all microplastic size data from the non antimicrobial and antimicrobial groups fig 4c in both cases the number of microplastics in the size range of 20 1000 μm was remarkably larger than that of 1000 3000 μm particles within the range of 20 1000 μm the number of 20 500 µm particles was larger than that of 500 1000 μm particles the results indicate that elevating the hydrostatic pressure altered the size and shape of microplastics especially small particles 20 500 μm based on the ldir results the mean size of microplastics at various pressures was 54 64 44 93 50 64 μ and 42 54 μm in the au tu fu and su groups respectively fig 4d we also incorporated the microplastic size data from the two treatment groups under the same pressure conditions fig 4e and merged all microplastic size data from the non antimicrobial and antimicrobial groups fig 4f the particles were distinctly clustered in the size range of 20 100 μm and the number of 20 50 μm particles always ranked the highest in terms of their proportion within the 20 100 μm range elevation of the hydrostatic pressure from low to high levels resulted in a downward trend in microplastic size with the smallest mean size observed in the su group although ftir based mean size of microplastics was smallest in the fu group 376 54 μm the collective results of ftir and ldir spectroscopy indicate that hydrostatic pressure influenced the size and shape of microplastics and the influence on small sized particles was more pronounced than that on large sized particles 3 2 microbial community structure and functional gene abundance despite the inconsistent results of ftir and ldir both analyses revealed that the presence of microorganisms in sediment samples led to variable decrease in the mean size of microplastics under various pressure conditions further we analyzed the possible mechanisms and pathways by which microbial communities and functional genes mediate the changes in microplastic size based on metagenomic sequencing results a total of 33 780 otus were retrieved from 12 sediment samples four pressure groups three parallel samples among the top 20 most abundant otus acidobacteria accounted for the largest proportion 12 05 followed by rokubacteria 6 51 and verrucomicrobia 2 36 fig 5 other abundant otus included planctomycetes 1 44 gemmatimonadetes 1 31 chloroflexi 1 18 proteobacteria 1 02 geothrix 0 78 alphaproteobacteria 0 76 and rhodoplanes 0 67 the relative abundance of rokubacteria was highest in the au group 7 44 and lowest in the fu group 5 92 importantly acidobacteria bacterium acidobacteria bacterium rifcsplowo2 12 full 67 14b gemmatimonadetes bacterium and geothrix fermentans decreased in relative abundance with increasing hydrostatic pressure which indicates the influence of different hydrostatic pressures on the dominant microbial species α diversity analysis revealed that the mean chao1 index and shannon index of microbial communities under various pressure conditions were 27 654 281 and 9 81 0 07 respectively table s1 overall the α diversity indices were higher in the au group compared with those of the other three pressure groups elevation of the pressure led to a decrease in community richness otu number and species diversity albeit not significant among various pressure groups in addition pcoa analysis of microbial community structure revealed variable overlap among sediment samples incubated at various pressures fig s1 this suggests that there were no distinct differences in microbial community structure among the four different pressure groups consistent with the results of α diversity analysis we compared previously reported plastic degrading microbial genera table s2 with the metagenomic sequencing results of microbial communities in various sample groups under the experimental conditions on this basis the abundance information of functional genera for microbial degradation of microplastics was selected fig 6 a in terms of their relative abundance the top 10 genera ranked in descending order of flavobacterium pseudomonas arthrobacter paenibacillus rhodococcus bacillus chitinophaga achromobacter stenotrophomonas and comamonas these plastic degrading genera were present in considerably low proportions even the most abundant genus flavobacterium only took up 0 014 and the second most abundant genus pseudomonas accounted for 0 009 in addition we calculated the abundance of previously reported functional genes for plastic biodegradation table s3 using the rpkm method based on metagenomic data there were two functional genes each for biodegradation of ps paak feab and pe alkb1 lada and four functional genes for biodegradation of pet microplastics pcah pcag tpha2 tpha3 of these paak was the most abundant accounting for 73 47 of the total abundance of the eight functional genes and pcah was the second most abundant 8 87 whereas tpha3 was the least abundant 0 17 fig 6b further we analyzed the abundance of the top 10 taxa carrying the functional genes fig 6c among them rokubacteria was the most abundant accounting for 42 05 of the total abundance of the 10 taxa and betaproteobacteria was the second most abundant 13 44 whereas gammaproteobacteria was the least abundant 2 84 the abundance of pe degrading genes in the au tu fu and su groups was 120 94 94 and 119 respectively fig 6b and comparing the mean size of pe microplastics revealed no significant upward and downward trends among the four groups table s4 the abundance of ps degrading microorganisms in the au tu fu and su groups was 1272 1222 1113 and 1268 respectively with a relatively noticeable decrease in the fu group comparison of the mean size of ps microplastics table s4 led to a conclusion consistent with that obtained for pe microplastics with an elevation of hydrostatic pressure the abundance of pet degrading genes increased from 210 au to 220 su by 4 76 fig 6b which resulted in a 13 66 decrease in the particle size of pet microplastics fig 6d that is the su group showed the highest abundance of pet degrading genes 27 2 and the smallest mean size of pet microplastics 366 62 μm this allowed us to speculate that hydrostatic pressure coupled with microbial action reduced the particle size of pet which was further verified in the subsequent functional contribution analysis fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 influence of hydrostatic pressure on microplastic size and shape this study found that the microplastics in reservoir sediments incubated under non antimicrobial treatment had smaller sizes than those under antimicrobial treatment in the antimicrobial group the number of 20 100 μm microplastics continuously decreased as a result of elevated hydrostatic pressures whereas the opposite trend was observed for 500 1000 μm microplastics the pattern of microplastic shape mirrored that of microplastic size fig 2 these results indicate that in the absence of microorganisms changing the hydrostatic pressure led to alterations in both the size and shape of microplastics in sediment samples but the degree of alterations was variable for instance the influence of hydrostatic pressure was more pronounced on small sized microplastics 20 500 μm than on large sized microplastics 500 5000 µm in the non antimicrobial group the number of 20 500 µm microplastics all decreased first and then increased with an elevation of hydrostatic pressure despite no evident changes in microplastic shape fig 2 these results indicate that in the presence of microorganisms elevating the hydrostatic pressure contributed to a decrease in microplastic size and had a certain influence on microplastic shape such as accelerating the fragmentation of fibers pellets and fragments to form smaller particles it should be noted that ldir can identify particles of 3 μm in size when using the agilent technologies clarity software and attenuated total reflection analysis this technique can also detect particles of 10 μm in size with normal methods which is below the limit of detection of ftir i e 20 μm agilent technologies 2019 therefore in terms of quantity ldir can detect more microplastics than ftir additionally ldir analysis can eliminate the impact of operational errors using the particle finder software and avoid errors caused by man made operation when using fitr zhang et al 2022 furthermore different spectral libraries are used for ftir and ldir technologies 2019 yielding variable results despite the inconsistent results obtained by ldir and fitr both demonstrated the same variation pattern in microplastic size that is microplastic size decreased in response to elevated hydrostatic pressures microplastics that enter the water column can settle into the sediment wang et al 2019 niu et al 2021 the occurrence patterns and spatiotemporal distributions of microplastics in aquatic sediments have been documented peng et al 2020 mughini et al 2021 for instance pe pet and ps are the major polymer types of microplastics in sediments pojar et al 2021 xu et al 2020 with films fragments fibers and pellets being the dominant shapes xu et al 2020 the size of microplastics in sediments mainly ranged from 20 to 500 μm zuo et al 2020 all these findings are compatible with our results obtained from reservoir sediments 4 2 microbial community responses to hydrostatic pressure this study deciphered the role of hydrostatic pressure in altering microplastic shape and size in reservoir sediments by taking into account microorganisms as an influencing factor rong et al 2021 investigated the influence of low density pe on microbial communities in the soil environment finding that the proportion of the dominant bacterial phylum rokubacteria in the control and treatment groups ranged from 0 7 to 1 8 there is a huge gap between the previous result and the proportion of rokubacteria carrying plastic degrading genes reported in the present study 42 05 rong et al 2021 most likely a result of the distinct environmental media our results confirmed that the major microbial taxa in sediment samples included plastic degrading genera such as rhodoplanes non plastic degrading major taxa also took part in microplastic biodegradation or they had an indirect influence on the biodegradation process in recent years plastic degrading bacterial strains have been isolated from diverse environments li et al 2020 tu et al 2020 including members of the genera pseudomonas and bacillus identified in the present study moreover plastic degrading genes have been annotated based on metagenomic sequencing wright et al 2021 experimental evidence suggests that bacteria can secrete hydrolases to hydrolyze plastic macromolecules into micromolecules that can be used by other cells biundo et al 2018 schmidt et al 2017 based on the metagenomic sequencing results we obtained the relative abundances fig 6a of 24 plastic degrading genera table s1 in sediment samples from different treatment groups plastic degrading bacteria such as the most abundant genera flavobacterium and pseudomonas only accounted for 0 01 each this indicates that plastic degrading bacteria were present in considerably low proportions of microbial communities and lacked significant differences in community composition at various hydrostatic pressures in contrast flavobacterium chitinophaga rhodococcus arthrobacter staphylococcus and aspergillus showed a slight upward trend in their relative abundance at elevated hydrostatic pressures it has been suggested that microplastics can recruit flavobacterium spp and pseudomonas spp hu et al 2021 both of which are able to biodegrade plastic polymers veethahavya et al 2016 especially pe and pet despite low taxa abundance there were no marked differences in microbial community composition in sediment samples under various pressure conditions this is consistent with the conclusion based on α diversity and pcoa analyses thus supporting the authenticity and validity of the results importantly we detected the presence of barophilic microorganisms such as shewanella colwellia moritella and psychromonas yan 2017 in sediment samples under different pressure conditions we then searched the literature and found the pressure sensitive gene asd and the omph gene encoding pressure inducible protein mentré et al 2001 the relative abundance of the top 10 microbial taxa harboring the two barophilic genes was analyzed fig 6e by comparing the 10 barophilic taxa with those taxa carrying plastic degrading genes fig 6e we found that one barophilic genus bradyrhizobium also contains plastic degrading genes this genus accounted for 2 5 of the total microbial community harboring barophilic genes ranking the fourth its proportion in the total microbial community carrying plastic degrading genes was 5 20 ranking the third additionally bradyrhizobium ranked the second among the total microbial community carrying pet degrading genes overall bradyrhizobium accounted for 2 5 of the total microbial community despite this relatively low abundance the results still provided evidence that hydrostatic pressure drove the microbial community structure and microbe mediated degradation of pet microplastics in reservoir sediments 4 3 microbial gene function driven by hydrostatic pressure to further identify the association between plastic degrading genes and relevant taxa we conducted taxonomic genus level and functional contribution analysis for eight functional genes involved in pet pe and ps biodegradation table s3 among them rokubacteria and betaproteobacteria were the top two major contributors to plastic degrading genes fig 7a rokubacteria was also the second most abundant taxon based on metagenomic sequencing data fig 5 we found that rokubacteria contributed most to tpha2 87 95 whereas alphaproteobacteria was the largest contributor to tpha3 100 the relative contributions of rokubacteria to the functional genes for pet pe and ps biodegradation were 32 12 24 08 and 21 62 respectively fig 7b taking into account microplastic size we found no remarkable changes in the size of pe and ps microplastics under different pressure conditions table s4 despite the high abundances of functional genes for ps and pe biodegradation it is worth noting that fewer functional genes for ps and pe biodegradation two each were annotated compared with those for pet biodegradation therefore incomplete biodegradation function of the annotated genes might be responsible for the minimal change in the size of ps and pe microplastics at various hydrostatic pressures on the other hand there were as many as four functional genes for pet biodegradation which contributed to a 13 66 decrease in the mean size of pet microplastics from atmospheric pressure au to 0 7 mpa su therefore fewer functional genes associated with biodegradation of microplastics might be responsible for the minimal change in the size of ps and pe microplastics at various hydrostatic pressures based on multiple comparisons the relative abundance of k18075 i e the tpha3 gene for pet biodegradation was significantly different among the four pressure groups p 0 05 in addition pairwise comparisons revealed that the relative abundance of tpha3 was significantly different between the au and fu groups p 0 05 or between the tu and fu groups p 0 01 fig 8 a the pet biodegradation process is illustrated in map00624 based on the kegg database fig 8c which involves the tpha2 tpha3 pacg and pach genes annotated in the present study this biodegradation process mainly consists of the binding of petase active site to the ester bond of pet and subsequent biodegradation of plastics catalyzed by the active site wright et al 2021 based on the metabolic pathways involved in pet biodegradation pacg and pach participate in 3 4 dihydroxy benzoate metabolism and both genes had considerably high relative abundances in various groups in addition tpha2 and tpha3 take part in terephthalate metabolism and both genes had substantially low relative abundances in all groups further we re analyzed these two groups of functional genes fig 8b when the hydrostatic pressure was elevated a slight increase occurred in the relative abundances of pacg and pach whereas the relative abundances of tpha2 and tpha3 variably decreased the mean size of pet microplastics also decreased as a result of elevated hydrostatic pressures but the decrease mainly occurred between the tu and fu groups meanwhile the tu group showed the lowest relative abundance of the functional genes which corroborated that the mean size of pet microplastics was larger in the tu group than in the other groups accordingly changing the hydrostatic pressure influenced the abundance of tpha2 tpha3 pacg and pach genes in other words hydrostatic pressure drove plastic degrading microorganisms at the functional gene level to cause changes in microplastic size in reservoir sediments 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the occurrence patterns of microplastics in surface sediments of a drinking water reservoir as influenced by hydrostatic pressure the ftir and ldir results indicated that the major shapes of microplastics were fibers pellets films and fragments with sizes in the range of 20 2860 μm the polymer types of microplastics mainly included pet ps pe cpe and pu in transparent yellow and white colors in the presence of microorganisms the shape and size of microplastics were influenced by elevating hydrostatic pressure for instance the microplastic size decreased and the microplastic shape was broken down from fragments into smaller particles this phenomenon was particularly evident for small sized microplastics 20 500 μm the metagenomic sequencing results of sediment samples showed that plastic degrading genera such as rhodococcus flavobacterium and aspergillus were enriched at higher hydrostatic pressures eight functional genes for ps pe and pet biodegradation such as paak lada and tpha2 were annotated by the kegg database of these the abundance of the tpha3 gene for pet degradation was significantly influenced by hydrostatic pressure and the mean size of pet microplastics decreased under elevated pressure conditions this led to the conclusion that high hydrostatic pressure drove plastic degrading microorganisms at the functional gene level to cause changes in microplastic size this study presents novel insights into the mechanisms how hydrostatic pressure regulates microbial gene function in the biodegradation of microplastics in reservoir sediments findings of this study provide a new idea for identifying the response patterns of microbial communities and functional genes to various hydrostatic pressures and associated metabolic pathways in deep reservoirs metatranscriptomic studies are warranted to verify

14631,human induced antibiotic pollution in the world s large rivers poses significant risk to riverine ecosystems water quality and human health this study identified geophysical and socioeconomic factors driving antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river by quantifying 83 target antibiotics in water and sediment samples collected in its 6300 km long reach followed by source apportionment and statistical modeling total antibiotic concentrations ranged between 2 05 111 ng l in water samples and 0 57 57 9 ng g in sediment samples contributed predominantly by veterinary antibiotics sulfonamides and tetracyclines respectively antibiotic compositions were clustered according to three landform regions plateau mountain basin foothill and plains resulting from varying animal production practices cattle sheep pig poultry and aquaculture in the sub basins population density animal production total nitrogen concentration and river water temperature are directly associated with antibiotic concentrations in the water samples this study revealed that the species and production of food animals are key determinants of the geographic distribution pattern of antibiotics in the yangtze river therefore effective strategies to mitigate antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river should include proper management of antibiotic use and waste treatment in animal production

micropollutants with wide presence in global surface water kummerer 2009 li et al 2022 li et al 2018 patel et al 2019 yang et al 2022b groundwater patel et al 2019 zainab et al 2020 and oceans li et al 2018 antibiotic pollution is often linked with the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes which threatens the effectiveness and sustainability of antimicrobials to treat bacterial infections in animals and humans tang et al 2017 van boeckel et al 2019 in aquatic ecosystems elevated levels of antibiotics may cause toxicity to aquatic organisms such as algae fish invertebrates and plants kummerer 2009 li et al 2018 patel et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022b in addition to sewage treatment plants stp the release of antibiotics used in animal production is another major source of antibiotics in the environment gaballah et al 2021 sarmah et al 2006 yang et al 2022a china is the largest producer of food animals and the largest user of veterinary antibiotics in the world about 41 967 tonnes in 2017 or 45 of the global use ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 2020 tiseo et al 2020 resulting in the elevation of antibiotic levels and antibiotic resistance in animals schoenmakers 2020 van boeckel et al 2019 nevertheless how the animal production affects the antibiotic levels in aquatic environments is still poorly understood large rivers are the repository and conduit of contaminants including antibiotics and are being threatened by pollution damming fragmentation and climate change best 2019 world wildlife fund 2007 wu et al 2021 despite their great social economic and ecological importance from the source to the estuary large rivers typically flow through areas with distinct environmental and socioeconomic conditions thus large rivers receive pollutants from various pollution sources and would exhibit highly complex antibiotic profiles a global reconnaissance of 61 pharmaceuticals in 258 rivers in 104 countries found that the geographic patterns of pollution were closely associated with socioeconomic factors such as population and gross national income wilkinson et al 2022 sharma et al 2019 reported high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the middle and lower reaches of the ganges india due to the severe impact of human activities large rivers have high dilution effects for pollutants ruff et al 2015 and the water columns are typically well mixed which could comprehensively reflect the pollution mass loads from the land therefore large rivers are ideal for assessing antibiotic profiles and backtracking potential sources and driving factors of antibiotic pollution the 6300 km long yangtze river is the third longest river in the world and the largest river in china which provides 40 of the country s fresh water resources floehr et al 2013 and holds one third of china s population 460 million chai et al 2019 from the headwater to the estuary of the yangtze river geophysical conditions such as elevation topography liu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 climate chai et al 2019 and socioeconomic conditions population density animal production and land use vary substantially the yangtze river typically receives about 34 billion tonnes of wastewater in 2018 http www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb suggesting the massive loads of various pollutants its populous sub basins e g the delta middle and lower reaches and chengdu chongqing city cluster are particularly vulnerable to antibiotic pollution bu et al 2013 li et al 2018 recently chen et al 2022b reported a comprehensive study of 24 antibiotics in sediments of the whole yangtze river and contributed valuable data to the existing literature however the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics in the yangtze river water especially in the source area and upper reaches and the underlying geophysical and socioeconomic drivers remain largely unknown in this study we collected water and sediment samples from 30 sites along more than 6000 km of the yangtze river in spring and autumn of 2018 and determined antibiotic profiles 83 target antibiotics in the whole yangtze river from the source area to the estuary variations in the concentrations and compositions of antibiotics along the yangtze river were explicitly determined and linked to the diverse geophysical and socioeconomic factors by structural equation and multifactor models these findings could provide key information for developing mitigation strategies of antibiotic pollution in the river furthermore we provide a paradigm for studying other rivers in the world to better understand the sources and drivers of antibiotic pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the standards of 83 target antibiotics in 7

solutions were freshly prepared each time before analysis 2 2 sample collection water samples n 59 and sediment samples n 56 were collected from 30 water quality monitoring stations of the changjiang water resources commission along the yangtze river from the source to the estuary in march 2018 spring and october 2018 autumn as described in fig 1 a and table s2 all the sampling sites were located in the main channel of the yangtze river and distributed along a curvilinear distance of 6000 km from the site y1 in the source area to the site y30 in the estuary some sampling sites e g y8 y12 y15 y21 and y23 were located downstream of the confluences of major tributaries which may reflect the influences of the corresponding tributaries with the assistance of the staff from the monitoring stations the grab water sample of 4 5 l was collected at 0 5 m below the water surface at each sampling site and stored in amber glass bottles without headspace concentrated sulfuric acid were added to adjust the ph of water samples to 3 0 to inhibit the microbial activity surface sediment samples depth 0 15 cm were collected using a stainless steel grab sampler and stored in aluminum boxes all samples were transported to local environmental monitoring centers in ice boxes in one day the water samples were immediately filtered and stored at 4 c in the dark and extracted within 24 h the sediment samples were stored at 20 c for further analysis another 1 5 l water and 0 5 kg sediment samples were collected for physicochemical analyses physicochemical properties of the water samples

and sediment organic carbon soc were analyzed in our laboratory and provided in table s4 2 3 extraction and analysis of antibiotics the extraction of antibiotics was performed according to previous studies li et al 2019 solid phase extraction spe was used to concentrate antibiotics in water samples for sediment samples we conducted ultrasonic extraction prior to spe the detailed methods for sample preparation are described in text s2 quantification of target antibiotics was carried out by an ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc vanquish with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms tsq endura thermo scientific usa using an electrospray ionization source chromatographic separation of antibiotics was conducted at 40 c with a syncronis c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 7

acid b different elution gradients and ion source conditions were used for various classes of antibiotics table s5 mass spectrum detections of antibiotics were operated in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode in positive electrospray ionization the parameters for uhplc and ms were optimized based on our previous studies hu et al 2022 kuang et al 2020 li et al 2020 and are given in tables s5 and s6 2 4 quality assurance and quality control the mass to charge ratio of precursor ion quantifying and confirming product ions and retention times were used to ensure the correct identification of each target compound in the analysis appropriate elution gradient and dwell time of each precursor ion were set to ensure enough scan points 10 20 for each chromatographic peak check standards 50 or 100 µg l and solvent blanks methanol were analyzed every 16 injections to monitor the potential contamination and stability of the instrument relative standard deviation of check standards and duplicate injections were much lower than 15 indicating a good analytical repeatability the concentrations of antibiotics in procedural blanks were lower than limits of detection lod suggesting no contamination during pretreatment and analysis calibration curves 7 points ranged from 1 to 400 µg l of each batch with r2 0 98 together with internal standards and calibration standards were used to quantify the target compounds the peaks of target compounds in samples were manually determined according to the retention time of adjacent check standards with tolerance less than 0 2 min the lods defined as the concentration with a signal to noise ratio of 3 were 0 001 0 35 ng l for water samples and 0 001 0 14 ng g for sediment samples table s6 the recoveries of antibiotics in the water and sediment samples determined by matrix spikes were 66 124 and 62 131 respectively which have been validated in the previous study hu et al 2022 2 5 data analysis two sample t test in origin 2020b originlab corporation northampton ma was used to determine the significance of difference in antibiotic concentrations between different classes and seasons hierarchical clustering based on euclidean distance and principal component analysis pca were performed to cluster sampling sites with similar antibiotic compositions using r version 3 6 1 r development core team the analysis of similarity anosim was conducted to assess the significance of difference in antibiotic compositions between various regions to remove the concentration effects of different samples the data were subjected to z score normalization before cluster analysis carpenter and helbling 2018 pca coupled with multiple linear regression pca mlr was conducted for source identification of antibiotics using ibm spss statistics 24 0 detailed in text s3 larsen and baker 2003 redundancy analysis rda was performed to reveal the relationships of antibiotics and physicochemical parameters mapping and geospatial analysis were conducted using arcgis version 10 4 redland ca usa 2 6 structural equation model and multifactor model a structural equation model sem was developed to identify the potential driving factors and interpret their direct and indirect effects on antibiotic concentrations han et al 2020 lv et al 2020 we first proposed an a priori conceptual model based on the spatiotemporal distribution analysis and source identification of antibiotics to preliminarily depict the direct and indirect effects of potential driving factors fig s1 the candidate variables used for the model development included geophysical factors elevation latitude longitude and distance to estuary table s2 chemical and physical parameters of water or sediments tables s3 and s4 population density pd at buffer radii of 1 5 10 and 20 km land use croplands and urban lands at buffer radii of 5 10 and 20 km table s11 and animal production i e pig cattle sheep poultry and aquaculture at buffer radii of 1 5 10 and 20 km table s12 the buffer radii were selected according to previous studies on spatial scale dependent effects of land use on water quality kim et al 2019 song et al 2020 tudesque et al 2014 as well as the data resolution and the scale of the study area different buffer radii were used to select the best fit model finally sems were constructed and tested using the maximum likelihood estimation method with ibm spss amos 22 0 the overall goodness of fit was evaluated using multiple criteria illustrated in fig s1 the detailed information on the candidate variables and development of sem are provided in text s4 we subsequently developed multifactor models to predict the concentrations of antibiotics in water and sediments using a forward stepwise selection approach eeftens et al 2012 robinson et al 2019 the variables that displayed direct effects on antibiotics as identified by sem were used for model development variables were introduced into the model one by one and only variables that significantly increased the adjusted r2 adj r2 and did not change the effect direction of the previously included variables were included into the new predictive models the addition procedure stopped when the added variable could not improve the adj r 2 of predictive models by 0 01 or more the variables with variance inflation factors vif greater than 3 indicating collinearity were sequentially removed during model development the model was manually checked and recalculated and finally validated using leave one out cross validation loocv the details for model development are given in text s5 variation partitioning analysis using vegan package in r version 3 6 1 r development core team was then applied to evaluate the effects of selected factors by multifactor models on the distribution of antibiotics the relative contributions of selected variables to model r 2 were calculated using the lmg function of the r package relaimpo 3 results 3 1 antibiotic profiles the number concentration and frequency of detected antibiotics in the water and sediment samples in two seasons are summarized in figs s2 and s3 among the 83 target antibiotics 48 antibiotics were detected at least once in the water samples with concentrations up to 87 1 ng l and 35 antibiotics were detected at least once in the sediment samples with the highest concentration of 35 6 ng g the maximum number of detected antibiotics per site was 36 and 26 for the water and sediment samples i e 43 and 31 of the target antibiotics respectively in the water samples more antibiotics were detected in spring 43 than in autumn 36 probably resulting from the lower water temperature 8 1 16 4 c p 0 001 weaker solar irradiation and smaller flow discharge 395 17 900 m3 s p 0 05 in spring than those 9 2 23 7 c and 862 24 500 m3 s in autumn figs s4 and s5 in the water samples fig s3a and s3b the concentrations of antibiotics ranged from not detected nd to 40 9 ng l in spring and to 87 1 ng l in autumn overall sulfamethoxazole smx lincomycin lcm and sulfamonomethoxine smm exhibited the highest average concentrations of 6 78 ng l nd 14 9 ng l 6 44 ng l nd 87 1 ng l and 6 09 ng l nd 40 8 ng l with detection frequencies of 89 8 89 8 and 79 7 respectively among the tested classes of antibiotics fig s6 sas were dominant in the water samples despite their smallest usage only 5 of the total antibiotic consumption in china fig s7 high sa concentrations were also found in other rivers bu et al 2013 li et al 2018 reservoirs li et al 2019 and lakes li et al 2020 which was attributed to their relatively high hydrophilicity logk ow 1 22 1 68 fig s8 and persistence in aquatic environments li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 macrolides mls such as anhydroerythromycin aetm erythromycin etm roxithromycin rtm clarithromycin ctm and azithromycin azm were detected at high frequencies but at relatively low concentrations in the water samples probably due to their largest usage 26 of the total antibiotic consumption in china fig s7 and relatively strong hydrophobicity logk ow 1 63 4 34 fig s8 in comparison with sas in contrast the usage of β ls was the second largest in china but only penicillin g was observed at relatively low levels in the water samples nd 1 19 ng l in spring and nd 0 606 ng l in autumn likely because of the unstable and easily hydrolysable β lactam ring in their structures zhang et al 2015 zumstein and helbling 2019 in the sediment samples fig s3c and d the antibiotic concentrations varied from nd to 35 6 ng g in spring and to 29 6 ng g in autumn overall oxytetracycline otc and doxycycline dc displayed the highest average concentrations of 2 42 ng g nd 35 6 ng g and 1 42 ng g nd 29 6 ng g with detection frequencies of 41 1 and 71 4 respectively tcs dominated in the sediment samples fig s6 although their usage was the second smallest 7 in china fig s7 this could be attributed to their strong sorption to sediments through complexation with multivalent cations zhang et al 2011 and natural organic matter gu et al 2007 because of their oxygenic and nitrogenous functional groups we further investigated the distribution of antibiotics between water and sediment by calculating the distribution coefficients k d the k d values varied from 0 343 to 34 911 l kg fig s9a the great variability of k d values among different antibiotics and different sampling sites may be related to the varying properties of antibiotics and soc levels li et al 2018 patel et al 2019 to rule out the influence of soc the soc normalized distribution coefficients koc were calculated and the logkoc values were in the range of 1 44 6 88 fig s9b the highest logkoc values were observed for tcs otc dc and 4 epichlortetracycline ectc 4 48 6 74 and pes i e nigericin nig 4 68 5 63 followed by mls 2 44 6 88 the varying logkoc values were mainly attributed to the hydrophobicity of antibiotics as suggested by the positive correlation between logkoc and logkow except for tcs fig s9c which exhibited strong affinity to sediments due to their preferable complexation with multivalent cations zhang et al 2011 and natural organic matter gu et al 2007 3 2 variation of antibiotic concentrations along the river the total concentrations of antibiotics in the water samples were in the range of 4 60 111 ng l in spring and 2 05 111 ng l in autumn respectively fig 2 and generally increased from the upstream to the downstream fig s10 the increasing antibiotic concentrations along the river may result from two aspects 1 increasing antibiotics are discharged to the river from stps michael et al 2013 patel et al 2019 animal farms zhang et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 and non point sources hall et al 2020 yi et al 2019 due to the growing pd animal production and thus antibiotic consumption from the upstream to the downstream fig 3 a and b 2 pseudo persistent and hydrophilic antibiotics e g sas may gradually accumulate along the river channel li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 intriguingly the spring water samples at the sites of y22 and y23 had significantly elevated concentrations fig 2a mainly due to the high levels of smm 26 0 ng l and 40 8 ng l and sulfachloropyridazine scp 15 7 ng l and 20 0 ng l scp is a veterinary antibiotic drug and more than 99 6 of smm is used for animals table s14 zhang et al 2015 scp and smm have been frequently reported to be dominant in animal wastewater with concentrations up to 2950 ng l and 5730 ng l respectively du et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 the results agreed with the relatively high animal production in this area fig 3b indicating the great influence of animal farming on antibiotics in the river differently the autumn water samples at y5 y8 and y23 y30 had relatively high levels of qns and lms respectively fig 2b specifically the concentrations of nalidixic acid nda 4 04 12 0 ng l flumequine flu 3 90 10 1 ng l and oxolinic acid ola 3 15 9 06 ng l at y5 y8 the upstream of the yangtze river with low pd fig 3a were much higher than those at other sites these qns were mainly used for animals and have been detected in the wastewaters of animal farms du et al 2022 suzuki et al 2021 zhi et al 2020 but scarcely detected in stps jia et al 2012 meng et al 2023 the extremely high levels of lcm 13 0 87 1 ng l were observed at y23 y30 lcm is mainly used for swine and poultry zhang et al 2015 which had high production in the downstream of the yangtze river fig 3b and typically exhibits considerable levels in animal wastewater hanamoto et al 2018 suzuki et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 furthermore the higher levels of qns and lms in autumn october wet season than in spring march dry season fig s5 also revealed that they were more likely derived from the surface runoff of animal farms and manured farmland hall et al 2020 sarmah et al 2006 because the concentrations of stp derived contaminants such as surculose typically decreased in wet season due to the increased dilution carpenter et al 2019 qi et al 2014 the total concentrations of antibiotics in the sediment samples were in the range of 1 31 55 3 ng g in spring and 0 571 57 9 ng g in autumn respectively fig s11 no increasing trend was observed in the sediment samples from upstream to downstream some sampling sites y12 y14 and y28 y29 in spring y12 y14 y15 y24 and y28 y30 in autumn had notably high concentrations of tcs i e otc or dc and mls i e aetm and rtm in the sediment samples otc and dc were frequently detected in animal waste at high levels du et al 2022 zhou et al 2013 whereas aetm and rtm were both widely used for human and animals zhang et al 2015 these sampling sites are located in the vicinity of densely populated areas or large cities fig 3a with heavy loads of antibiotics from stps or animal farms to the river the antibiotics discharged in dissolved or solid bound phases i e tcs and mls may accumulate in river sediments gu et al 2007 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 resulting in the relatively high concentrations of antibiotics in the sediment samples near the pollution sources hu et al 2012 yi et al 2019 also these sites with high sedimentary antibiotic concentrations were in line with those reported in a previous study chen et al 2022b 3 3 variation of antibiotic compositions along the river the sampling sites were clustered into three groups according to antibiotic compositions in the water samples fig 4 accordingly the yangtze river can be divided into 3 regions with different antibiotic compositions labeled as a b and c from upstream to downstream which are located in the landforms of plateau mountain basin foothill and plains respectively this indicates substantial regional differences in antibiotic compositions along the yangtze river the boundary of the 3 regions moved downstream in autumn because of the higher flow discharge in this season fig s5 which can transport the pollutants further downstream more quickly than in the spring the anosim statistic test of pairwise bray curtis dissimilarities fig s12 confirmed the significant differences in antibiotic compositions of the water samples among the three regions in the spring r 0 626 p 0 001 and autumn r 0 675 p 0 001 however the antibiotic compositions in the sediment samples were clustered randomly fig s13 except that the sites in densely populated areas y12 y14 y24 y28 and y29 clustered together due to their same characteristic antibiotic otc this is possibly because antibiotics in the sediments primarily reflect the cumulative effects of local pollution due to the weak connectivity and mobility of the sediments along the river hu et al 2012 yi et al 2019 additionally significant differences in sediment properties table s4 may contribute to the heterogeneity of antibiotic compositions in the sediment samples fig 3c further showed the differences of antibiotic compositions in the water samples among three regions which was also confirmed by the pca biplot fig s14 furthermore the characteristic antibiotics for each region were identified by the dendrograms and pca loading plots figs 4 and s14 in spring figs 4a and s14a the characteristic antibiotics were sulfisoxazole ssz and nda in region a smx in region b and smm and scp in region c in autumn figs 4b and s14b the characteristic antibiotics were 3 qns nda flu and ola and 1 sas sulfaguanidine sgd in region a 3 sas smx smm and sulfadiazine sdz in region b and lcm in region c interestingly most characteristic antibiotics are primarily used in animal production table s14 for example scp is only used as a veterinary antibiotic more than 99 6 of smm is used for animals about 99 4 of smx is used for animals and lcm is mainly used for swine and poultry hanamoto et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 moreover the characteristic antibiotics in each region changed across the seasons likely due to the seasonal variations of antibiotic usage and pollution sources e g lcm the production and composition of various food animals cattle sheep pig poultry and aquaculture in different areas of the yangtze river basin are shown in fig 3b and table s15 the animal production increased from region a to region c along the river the species of food animals were also different in the three regions the dominant animal species changed from cattle and sheep accounting for 60 and 90 of the animal production in qinghai and tibet respectively in region a to pig 55 70 in region b and to aquaculture 31 49 and pig 29 40 in region c the amount of antibiotics used for each species of animals differed and the global average annual use of antimicrobials was estimated to follow the order of cattle 45 mg kg chicken 148 mg kg pigs 172 mg kg van boeckel et al 2015 together with varying types and use patterns of antibiotics for different animal species krishnasamy et al 2015 fig s15 the differences in the species and production of food animals are considered key determinants of the geographic distribution pattern of antibiotics 3 4 source apportionment we further conducted source apportionment to explain the spatial and seasonal variations in the concentrations and compositions of antibiotics along the yangtze river for the water samples three pollution sources pc1 pc2 and pc3 were identified see text s6 for detailed discussion by analyzing the usage and occurrence patterns of characteristic antibiotics closely associated with each source table s14 pc1 e g smx and mls was attributed to mixed sources of human and animals and pc2 e g smm scp and tylosin tyl and pc3 lcm were indicative of the sources from food animals the contribution of each source to the total antibiotic concentrations in water was then calculated and shown in fig 5 we found the animal source pc3 showed significant seasonal and spatial variations and only dominated in the region c in autumn with much higher contribution 72 7 than that in spring and other regions 19 6 44 1 the yangtze river has higher flow discharge in autumn 862 24 500 m3 s october wet season relative to spring 395 17 900 m3 s march dry season fig s5 and the increased surface runoff accounted for the heavy pollution loads e g dissolved nitrogen from animal production in autumn in the yangtze river chen et al 2019 furthermore previous studies found that lcm exhibited high levels up to 9 94 μg l in runoff following the land application of swine manure slurry hall et al 2020 the loads of micropollutants from non point pollution sources such as agricultural derived pesticides and veterinary medicines were significantly higher in wet season and were correlated with streamflow carpenter and helbling 2018 in the yangtze river basin surface runoff contributed about one third to the inputs of manure related nitrogen to rivers in 2012 chen et al 2022a application of animal manure in farmland increased from upstream to downstream sub basins of the yangtze river associated with the high animal production fig 3b and large cropland area fig 3d in region c chen et al 2019 therefore pc3 was identified as the non point pollution source of runoff e g from manured farmland and pc2 was assigned as the point source from animal farms the animal derived sources predominantly contribute to antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river region c received more antibiotics from the animal sources than regions a and b especially from the surface runoff of manured farmland in autumn wet season fig 5b the varying contributions of pollution sources across the three regions validated the regional differences of antibiotic concentrations and compositions in water figs 3 and 4 for the sediment samples fig s17 pc1 was characterized with rtm and dc and pc2 was only correlated with otc about half of rtm was used for humans whereas approximately 95 of dc was used for animals zhang et al 2015 therefore pc1 was identified as the mixed source of stps and animal farms otc have been frequently detected in animal wastewater with high levels du et al 2022 zhou et al 2013 for example up to 918 μg l in swine wastewater and 26 4 μg g in swine manure zhang et al 2018 thus pc2 represents the source of animal farms the mixed sources of stps and animal farms generally exhibited dominant contributions to the total antibiotic concentrations at most sites however at some sites e g y12 y14 in spring the source of animal farms was dominant due to the high concentrations of otc 3 5 driving factors of the antibiotic distribution the sem identified 5 factors i e elevation pd animal production tn and wt and 4 factors i e elevation pd animal production and nh4 n for antibiotics in the water and sediment samples respectively fig 6 a c land use was excluded because it failed to meet all the rules for the model development the parameters for the final models chi square value χ2 p value χ2 degree freedom χ2 df root mean square error of approximation rmsea goodness of fit index gfi and comparative fit index cfi fig 6a and c met the criteria stipulated in fig s1 for the water samples fig 6a a total of 77 8 variation of antibiotics could be explained indicating successful identification of influencing factors tn λ 0 544 p 0 001 pd λ 0 359 p 0 001 and animal production λ 0 239 p 0 01 had positive and direct effects on antibiotics whereas wt had negative and direct effect λ 0 195 p 0 01 moreover animal production could indirectly impact antibiotics by strongly influencing tn λ 0 814 p 0 001 which is a key chemical indicator of water pollution although without direct effects elevation could indirectly affect antibiotics via negatively influencing pd λ 0 302 p 0 05 animal production λ 0 809 p 0 001 and wt λ 0 603 p 0 001 which was also confirmed by the negative correlations between these three factors and elevation table s16 pd and animal production reflect the consumption and discharge of antibiotics leading to positive correlations with the antibiotic concentrations in the river water bu et al 2013 hanamoto et al 2018 yi et al 2019 animal production has the highest standardized total effect on antibiotics fig 6b directly and indirectly via influencing tn tn was selected as the most associated factor from the chemical parameters of the water samples which agrees with its largest loadings on total concentrations of all antibiotics shown in the rda biplot fig s17 here tn is the dominant factor directly explaining antibiotic concentrations in the water samples λ 0 544 p 0 001 and is mainly influenced by animal production λ 0 814 p 0 001 on the other hand more consumption van boeckel et al 2014 and lower degradation li et al 2019 of antibiotics in cold seasons cause higher antibiotic concentrations and thus result in a negative effect of wt elevation is associated with landform climate soil plants and animal species and negatively influences wt λ 0 603 p 0 001 pd λ 0 302 p 0 05 and the animal production λ 0 809 p 0 001 thus elevation has a strong indirect negative effect on the distribution of antibiotics figs 6a and b and s19 for the sediment samples fig 6c a total of 35 5 variation of antibiotics could be explained by the sem which is lower than that for the water samples 77 8 this indicates that the factors influencing the distribution of antibiotics in the sediment samples are more complex than those for the water samples moreover in contrast to the water samples only nh4 n has a significant positive effect λ 0 569 p 0 05 whereas pd and animal production has insignificant effects on the distribution of antibiotics in the sediment samples soc was excluded in the final sem because the fitted models did not meet the parameter criteria fig s1 this may be because many antibiotics have various functional groups in their molecular structures e g tcs and behave much differently from other hydrophobic organic pollutants li et al 2018 lv et al 2020 for example in addition to hydrophobic interactions antibiotics e g tcs can be adsorbed by sediments through complexation hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction patel et al 2019 the explanatory model for antibiotics in the sediment samples needs to be further explored in the future by considering additional factors including sediment texture cation exchange capability and particle size which might significantly influence the sedimentary concentrations of antibiotics li et al 2018 patel et al 2019 3 6 multifactor models to predict antibiotic concentrations to predict total antibiotic concentrations in water samples a multifactor model eq 1 was successfully developed table s17 using the direct influencing factors identified by sem fig 6a the total adjusted explained variance adj r2 of the predictive model is 0 774 the difference between adj r2 and loocv r2 0 732 table s17 was less than 15 indicating that the predictive model was stable and valid eeftens et al 2012 the relatively small mean absolute error mae 10 6 ng l and root mean square error rmse 13 3 ng l values and good correlation of predicted concentrations with measured concentrations of antibiotics fig 6d reflected the robust prediction ability of the predictive model as expected positive coefficients of tn and pd and a negative coefficient of wt were obtained different from the results of sem the total animal production was excluded in the multifactor model eq 1 due to its high collinearity with tn this may be because the total animal production is strongly correlated with tn and its effect on the antibiotic concentrations is included in the effect of tn fig 6a λ 0 814 p 0 001 this is plausible because animal derived n is an important source of n in river water in the yangtze river chen et al 2022a 1 c o n c n g l 34 85 tn 0 2347 pd 0 844 wt 0 233 r 2 0 786 adj r 2 0 774 p 0 001 variation partitioning analysis fig 6e showed that tn was the single best predictor of the antibiotic concentrations in the water samples 43 6 followed by the interactive effect of tn and pd 22 6 and the individual effect of pd 11 0 fig 6f showed the relative r 2 contribution of different factors to antibiotic concentrations in the water samples consistent with fig 6e tn accounted for a majority of the variability 53 8 in antibiotic concentrations and pd explained a moderate level of variability 23 1 likewise the multifactor models were also developed for total concentrations of all antibiotics in the sediment samples and each class of antibiotics in the water samples only the models for sas mls and pes in the water samples were stable had relatively high adj r2 table s17 and showed good agreement between the predicted and measured concentrations fig s20 eeftens et al 2012 similarly tn contributed to the majority of the explained variability of sas mls and pes fig s21 to r2 37 5 41 1 fig 6f as one of the factors explaining seasonal and regional variation li et al 2019 van boeckel et al 2014 wt had the highest contribution to mls pig production was selected for mls and sas probably because more than half of mls and sas were used for pigs in china zhang et al 2015 nh4 n was selected for pes which agrees with its large loading on pes shown in the rda biplot fig s18 4 discussion in this study 48 and 35 antibiotics were detected in the water and sediment samples of the yangtze river with concentrations of nd 87 1 ng l and nd 35 6 ng g respectively which were comparable with those in the yellow river and the pearl river but lower than those in the hai river china li et al 2018 an increasing trend in the total antibiotic concentrations was observed in the water samples of the yangtze river from the source to estuary which is associated with the increasing pd and animal production similar distribution pattern was also reported for organic pollutants in the ganges river sharma et al 2019 and the rhine river ruff et al 2015 intriguingly the yangtze river can be divided into 3 regions according to the antibiotic compositions which are located in the landforms of plateau mountain basin foothill and plains respectively along the river the landform influenced geographic distribution patterns were also observed for bacterial communities in the yangtze river liu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 further examination on the characteristic antibiotics and animal production practices revealed that the differences in the species and production of food animals are the key determinants for the geographic distribution pattern of antibiotics in the yangtze river similarly for other large rivers in the world future studies should be directed to investigating antibiotic consumption and production practices in animal agriculture across the entire river basin to accurately assess antibiotic pollution in the river waters in addition to antibiotics from human health care and domestic wastewaters further statistical modeling found that the geographic distribution pattern of antibiotics in the yangtze river is driven by both natural indirect and anthropogenic direct factors with animal production as the dominant anthropogenic factor the veterinary use of antibiotics accounts for about 73 of global antibiotic consumption van boeckel et al 2017 and animal waste is a major source of environmental antibiotics and antibiotic resistance gaballah et al 2021 sarmah et al 2006 extensive studies have reported the considerable antibiotic levels in animal waste and the receiving environments du et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 in china many animal farms lack effective waste treatment systems and the efficacies of lagoon anaerobic digester and constructed wetland can be variable zhang et al 2018 therefore managing antibiotic use in animal production and proper treatment and disposal of animal waste are crucial for mitigating antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river furthermore we found that surface runoff from manured croplands is an important source of antibiotics to the yangtze river in autumn wet season animal manure with high concentrations of antibiotic residues is considered a non point source of water pollution bai et al 2017 chen et al 2022a previous studies have demonstrated the substantial pollution of antibiotic and antibiotic resistance genes in the soils and surface runoff from manure amended agricultural land hall et al 2020 le et al 2018 li et al 2023 thus management and treatment of animal waste also need to be improved to control antibiotic pollution bai et al 2017 gaballah et al 2021 china has forbidden the direct application of untreated animal waste in croplands since 2020 ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china and ministry of ecology and environmental of the people s republic of china 2020 collection storage treatment and final disposal of animal waste should be more properly managed to minimize the discharge of pollutants to the yangtze river additionally edge of field practices such as vegetative buffer strip constructed wetland and controlled drainage should be adopted to decrease the antibiotic loads to surface waters our study identified the need for mitigating animal derived antibiotic pollution provided with better knowledge on the variations of antibiotic concentrations and composition along the river management decisions may be tailored to local conditions to protect the overall health of the yangtze river integrated management such as reducing antibiotics use improving management and treatment of animal waste at the farm level controlling non point source of antibiotics at the field scale as well as managing other domestic hospital and manufacturing pollution sources should be taken to mitigate antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river coordinated effort among policy makers animal producers pharmaceutical manufacturers consumers and waste treatment facilities will be key to reducing antibiotic pollution in the river finally the results of this study provided a spatial temporal snapshot of antibiotic pollution in the whole yangtze river and may be used as the reference conditions when comparing future monitoring data to assess the effectiveness of management practices in the yangtze river basin this study also provided an example on how to assess the antibiotic pollution and its driving factors in a large river which could be useful to similar studies in other large rivers of the world 5 conclusions this study revealed antibiotic profiles in the yangtze river from the source area to the estuary by quantifying 83 antibiotics forty eight and 35 antibiotics were detected in the water and sediment samples with total concentrations in the range of 2 05 111 ng l and 0 57 57 9 ng g respectively total concentrations in the water samples showed an increasing trend from the upstream to the downstream the composition of antibiotics was geographically clustered into three groups according to the plateau mountain basin foothill and plain regions largely determined by the geographic distribution pattern of food animal species in the yangtze river basin the regional variations of antibiotic profiles in the water along the river can be explained by the direct influence of pd animal production tn and wt as well as the indirect impact of topography or elevation tn was selected as the best predictor of total antibiotic concentrations in the water samples these findings are essential for developing pollution mitigation strategies in the yangtze river and could be informative to study the antibiotic pollution in other large rivers in the

14631,human induced antibiotic pollution in the world s large rivers poses significant risk to riverine ecosystems water quality and human health this study identified geophysical and socioeconomic factors driving antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river by quantifying 83 target antibiotics in water and sediment samples collected in its 6300 km long reach followed by source apportionment and statistical modeling total antibiotic concentrations ranged between 2 05 111 ng l in water samples and 0 57 57 9 ng g in sediment samples contributed predominantly by veterinary antibiotics sulfonamides and tetracyclines respectively antibiotic compositions were clustered according to three landform regions plateau mountain basin foothill and plains resulting from varying animal production practices cattle sheep pig poultry and aquaculture in the sub basins population density animal production total nitrogen concentration and river water temperature are directly associated with antibiotic concentrations in the water samples this study revealed that the species and production of food animals are key determinants of the geographic distribution pattern of antibiotics in the yangtze river therefore effective strategies to mitigate antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river should include proper management of antibiotic use and waste treatment in animal production

micropollutants with wide presence in global surface water kummerer 2009 li et al 2022 li et al 2018 patel et al 2019 yang et al 2022b groundwater patel et al 2019 zainab et al 2020 and oceans li et al 2018 antibiotic pollution is often linked with the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes which threatens the effectiveness and sustainability of antimicrobials to treat bacterial infections in animals and humans tang et al 2017 van boeckel et al 2019 in aquatic ecosystems elevated levels of antibiotics may cause toxicity to aquatic organisms such as algae fish invertebrates and plants kummerer 2009 li et al 2018 patel et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022b in addition to sewage treatment plants stp the release of antibiotics used in animal production is another major source of antibiotics in the environment gaballah et al 2021 sarmah et al 2006 yang et al 2022a china is the largest producer of food animals and the largest user of veterinary antibiotics in the world about 41 967 tonnes in 2017 or 45 of the global use ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 2020 tiseo et al 2020 resulting in the elevation of antibiotic levels and antibiotic resistance in animals schoenmakers 2020 van boeckel et al 2019 nevertheless how the animal production affects the antibiotic levels in aquatic environments is still poorly understood large rivers are the repository and conduit of contaminants including antibiotics and are being threatened by pollution damming fragmentation and climate change best 2019 world wildlife fund 2007 wu et al 2021 despite their great social economic and ecological importance from the source to the estuary large rivers typically flow through areas with distinct environmental and socioeconomic conditions thus large rivers receive pollutants from various pollution sources and would exhibit highly complex antibiotic profiles a global reconnaissance of 61 pharmaceuticals in 258 rivers in 104 countries found that the geographic patterns of pollution were closely associated with socioeconomic factors such as population and gross national income wilkinson et al 2022 sharma et al 2019 reported high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the middle and lower reaches of the ganges india due to the severe impact of human activities large rivers have high dilution effects for pollutants ruff et al 2015 and the water columns are typically well mixed which could comprehensively reflect the pollution mass loads from the land therefore large rivers are ideal for assessing antibiotic profiles and backtracking potential sources and driving factors of antibiotic pollution the 6300 km long yangtze river is the third longest river in the world and the largest river in china which provides 40 of the country s fresh water resources floehr et al 2013 and holds one third of china s population 460 million chai et al 2019 from the headwater to the estuary of the yangtze river geophysical conditions such as elevation topography liu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 climate chai et al 2019 and socioeconomic conditions population density animal production and land use vary substantially the yangtze river typically receives about 34 billion tonnes of wastewater in 2018 http www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb suggesting the massive loads of various pollutants its populous sub basins e g the delta middle and lower reaches and chengdu chongqing city cluster are particularly vulnerable to antibiotic pollution bu et al 2013 li et al 2018 recently chen et al 2022b reported a comprehensive study of 24 antibiotics in sediments of the whole yangtze river and contributed valuable data to the existing literature however the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics in the yangtze river water especially in the source area and upper reaches and the underlying geophysical and socioeconomic drivers remain largely unknown in this study we collected water and sediment samples from 30 sites along more than 6000 km of the yangtze river in spring and autumn of 2018 and determined antibiotic profiles 83 target antibiotics in the whole yangtze river from the source area to the estuary variations in the concentrations and compositions of antibiotics along the yangtze river were explicitly determined and linked to the diverse geophysical and socioeconomic factors by structural equation and multifactor models these findings could provide key information for developing mitigation strategies of antibiotic pollution in the river furthermore we provide a paradigm for studying other rivers in the world to better understand the sources and drivers of antibiotic pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the standards of 83 target antibiotics in 7

water resources commission along the yangtze river from the source to the estuary in march 2018 spring and october 2018 autumn as described in fig 1 a and table s2 all the sampling sites were located in the main channel of the yangtze river and distributed along a curvilinear distance of 6000 km from the site y1 in the source area to the site y30 in the estuary some sampling sites e g y8 y12 y15 y21 and y23 were located downstream of the confluences of major tributaries which may reflect the influences of the corresponding tributaries with the assistance of the staff from the monitoring stations the grab water sample of 4 5 l was collected at 0 5 m below the water surface at each sampling site and stored in amber glass bottles without headspace concentrated sulfuric acid were added to adjust the ph of water samples to 3 0 to inhibit the microbial activity surface sediment samples depth 0 15 cm were collected using a stainless steel grab sampler and stored in aluminum boxes all samples were transported to local environmental monitoring centers in ice boxes in one day the water samples were immediately filtered and stored at 4 c in the dark and extracted within 24 h the

and sediment organic carbon soc were analyzed in our laboratory and provided in table s4 2 3 extraction and analysis of antibiotics the extraction of antibiotics was performed according to previous studies li et al 2019 solid phase extraction spe was used to concentrate antibiotics in water samples for sediment samples we conducted ultrasonic extraction prior to spe the detailed methods for sample preparation are described in text s2 quantification of target antibiotics was carried out by an ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc vanquish with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms tsq endura thermo scientific usa using an electrospray ionization source chromatographic separation of antibiotics was conducted at 40 c with a syncronis c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 7

acid b different elution gradients and ion source conditions were used for various classes of antibiotics table s5 mass spectrum detections of antibiotics were operated in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode in positive electrospray ionization the parameters for uhplc and ms were optimized based on our previous studies hu et al 2022 kuang et al 2020 li et al 2020 and are given in tables s5 and s6 2 4 quality assurance and quality control the mass to charge ratio of precursor ion quantifying and confirming product ions and retention times were used to ensure the correct identification of each target compound in the analysis appropriate elution gradient and dwell time of each precursor ion were set to ensure enough scan points 10 20 for each chromatographic peak check standards 50 or 100 µg l and solvent blanks methanol were analyzed every 16 injections to monitor the potential contamination and stability of the instrument relative standard deviation of check standards and duplicate injections were much lower than 15 indicating a good analytical repeatability the concentrations of antibiotics in procedural blanks were lower than limits of detection lod suggesting no contamination during pretreatment and analysis calibration curves 7 points ranged from 1 to 400 µg l of each batch with r2 0 98 together with internal standards and calibration standards were used to quantify the target compounds the peaks of target compounds in samples were manually determined according to the retention time of adjacent check standards with tolerance less than 0 2 min the lods defined as the concentration with a signal to noise ratio of 3 were 0 001 0 35 ng l for water samples and 0 001 0 14 ng g for sediment samples table s6 the recoveries of antibiotics in the water and sediment samples determined by matrix spikes were 66 124 and 62 131 respectively which have been validated in the previous study hu et al 2022 2 5 data analysis two sample t test in origin 2020b originlab corporation northampton ma was used to determine the significance of difference in antibiotic concentrations between different classes and seasons hierarchical clustering based on euclidean distance and principal component analysis pca were performed to cluster sampling sites with similar antibiotic compositions using r version 3 6 1 r development core team the analysis of similarity anosim was conducted to assess the significance of difference in antibiotic compositions between various regions to remove the concentration effects of different samples the data were subjected to z score normalization before cluster analysis carpenter and helbling 2018 pca coupled with multiple linear regression pca mlr was conducted for source identification of antibiotics using ibm spss statistics 24 0 detailed in text s3 larsen and baker 2003 redundancy analysis rda was performed to reveal the relationships of antibiotics and physicochemical parameters mapping and geospatial analysis were conducted using arcgis version 10 4 redland ca usa 2 6 structural equation model and multifactor model a structural equation model sem was developed to identify the potential driving factors and interpret their direct and indirect effects on antibiotic concentrations han et al 2020 lv et al 2020 we first proposed an a priori conceptual model based on the spatiotemporal distribution analysis and source identification of antibiotics to preliminarily depict the direct and indirect effects of potential driving factors fig s1 the candidate variables used for the model development included geophysical factors elevation latitude longitude and distance to estuary table s2 chemical and physical parameters of water or sediments tables s3 and s4 population density pd at buffer radii of 1 5 10 and 20 km land use croplands and urban lands at buffer radii of 5 10 and 20 km table s11 and animal production i e pig cattle sheep poultry and aquaculture at buffer radii of 1 5 10 and 20 km table s12 the buffer radii were selected according to previous studies on spatial scale dependent effects of land use on water quality kim et al 2019 song et al 2020 tudesque et al 2014 as well as the data resolution and the scale of the study area different buffer radii were used to select the best fit model finally sems were constructed and tested using the maximum likelihood estimation method with ibm spss amos 22 0 the overall goodness of fit was evaluated using multiple criteria illustrated in fig s1 the detailed information on the candidate variables and development of sem are provided in text s4 we subsequently developed multifactor models to predict the concentrations of antibiotics in water and sediments using a forward stepwise selection approach eeftens et al 2012 robinson et al 2019 the variables that displayed direct effects on antibiotics as identified by sem were used for model development variables were introduced into the model one by one and only variables that significantly increased the adjusted r2 adj r2 and did not change the effect direction of the previously included variables were included into the new predictive models the addition procedure stopped when the added variable could not improve the adj r 2 of predictive models by 0 01 or more the variables with variance inflation factors vif greater than 3 indicating collinearity were sequentially removed during model development the model was manually checked and recalculated and finally validated using leave one out cross validation loocv the details for model development are given in text s5 variation partitioning analysis using vegan package in r version 3 6 1 r development core team was then applied to evaluate the effects of selected factors by multifactor models on the distribution of antibiotics the relative contributions of selected variables to model r 2 were calculated using the lmg function of the r package relaimpo 3 results 3 1 antibiotic profiles the number concentration and frequency of detected antibiotics in the water and sediment samples in two seasons are summarized in figs s2 and s3 among the 83 target antibiotics 48 antibiotics were detected at least once in the water samples with concentrations up to 87 1 ng l and 35 antibiotics were detected at least once in the sediment samples with the highest concentration of 35 6 ng g the maximum number of detected antibiotics per site was 36 and 26 for the water and sediment samples i e 43 and 31 of the target antibiotics respectively in the water samples more antibiotics were detected in spring 43 than in autumn 36 probably resulting from the lower water temperature 8 1 16 4 c p 0 001 weaker solar irradiation and smaller flow discharge 395 17 900 m3 s p 0 05 in spring than those 9 2 23 7 c and 862 24 500 m3 s in autumn figs s4 and s5 in the water samples fig s3a and s3b the concentrations of antibiotics ranged from not detected nd to 40 9 ng l in spring and to 87 1 ng l in autumn overall sulfamethoxazole smx lincomycin lcm and sulfamonomethoxine smm exhibited the highest average concentrations of 6 78 ng l nd 14 9 ng l 6 44 ng l nd 87 1 ng l and 6 09 ng l nd 40 8 ng l with detection frequencies of 89 8 89 8 and 79 7 respectively among the tested classes of antibiotics fig s6 sas were dominant in the water samples despite their smallest usage only 5 of the total antibiotic consumption in china fig s7 high sa concentrations were also found in other rivers bu et al 2013 li et al 2018 reservoirs li et al 2019 and lakes li et al 2020 which was attributed to their relatively high hydrophilicity logk ow 1 22 1 68 fig s8 and persistence in aquatic environments li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 macrolides mls such as anhydroerythromycin aetm erythromycin etm roxithromycin rtm clarithromycin ctm and azithromycin azm were detected at high frequencies but at relatively low concentrations in the water samples probably due to their largest usage 26 of the total antibiotic consumption in china fig s7 and relatively strong hydrophobicity logk ow 1 63 4 34 fig s8 in comparison with sas in contrast the usage of β ls was the second largest in china but only penicillin g was observed at relatively low levels in the water samples nd 1 19 ng l in spring and nd 0 606 ng l in autumn likely because of the unstable and easily hydrolysable β lactam ring in their structures zhang et al 2015 zumstein and helbling 2019 in the sediment samples fig s3c and d the antibiotic concentrations varied from nd to 35 6 ng g in spring and to 29 6 ng g in autumn overall oxytetracycline otc and doxycycline dc displayed the highest average concentrations of 2 42 ng g nd 35 6 ng g and 1 42 ng g nd 29 6 ng g with detection frequencies of 41 1 and 71 4 respectively tcs dominated in the sediment samples fig s6 although their usage was the second smallest 7 in china fig s7 this could be attributed to their strong sorption to sediments through complexation with multivalent cations zhang et al 2011 and natural organic matter gu et al 2007 because of their oxygenic and nitrogenous functional groups we further investigated the distribution of antibiotics between water and sediment by calculating the distribution coefficients k d the k d values varied from 0 343 to 34 911 l kg fig s9a the great variability of k d values among different antibiotics and different sampling sites may be related to the varying properties of antibiotics and soc levels li et al 2018 patel et al 2019 to rule out the influence of soc the soc normalized distribution coefficients koc were calculated and the logkoc values were in the range of 1 44 6 88 fig s9b the highest logkoc values were observed for tcs otc dc and 4 epichlortetracycline ectc 4 48 6 74 and pes i e nigericin nig 4 68 5 63 followed by mls 2 44 6 88 the varying logkoc values were mainly attributed to the hydrophobicity of antibiotics as suggested by the positive correlation between logkoc and logkow except for tcs fig s9c which exhibited strong affinity to sediments due to their preferable complexation with multivalent cations zhang et al 2011 and natural organic matter gu et al 2007 3 2 variation of antibiotic concentrations along the river the total concentrations of antibiotics in the water samples were in the range of 4 60 111 ng l in spring and 2 05 111 ng l in autumn respectively fig 2 and generally increased from the upstream to the downstream fig s10 the increasing antibiotic concentrations along the river may result from two aspects 1 increasing antibiotics are discharged to the river from stps michael et al 2013 patel et al 2019 animal farms zhang et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 and non point sources hall et al 2020 yi et al 2019 due to the growing pd animal production and thus antibiotic consumption from the upstream to the downstream fig 3 a and b 2 pseudo persistent and hydrophilic antibiotics e g sas may gradually accumulate along the river channel li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 intriguingly the spring water samples at the sites of y22 and y23 had significantly elevated concentrations fig 2a mainly due to the high levels of smm 26 0 ng l and 40 8 ng l and sulfachloropyridazine scp 15 7 ng l and 20 0 ng l scp is a veterinary antibiotic drug and more than 99 6 of smm is used for animals table s14 zhang et al 2015 scp and smm have been frequently reported to be dominant in animal wastewater with concentrations up to 2950 ng l and 5730 ng l respectively du et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 the results agreed with the relatively high animal production in this area fig 3b indicating the great influence of animal farming on antibiotics in the river differently the autumn water samples at y5 y8 and y23 y30 had relatively high levels of qns and lms respectively fig 2b specifically the concentrations of nalidixic acid nda 4 04 12 0 ng l flumequine flu 3 90 10 1 ng l and oxolinic acid ola 3 15 9 06 ng l at y5 y8 the upstream of the yangtze river with low pd fig 3a were much higher than those at other sites these qns were mainly used for animals and have been detected in the wastewaters of animal farms du et al 2022 suzuki et al 2021 zhi et al 2020 but scarcely detected in stps jia et al 2012 meng et al 2023 the extremely high levels of lcm 13 0 87 1 ng l were observed at y23 y30 lcm is mainly used for swine and poultry zhang et al 2015 which had high production in the downstream of the yangtze river fig 3b and typically exhibits considerable levels in animal wastewater hanamoto et al 2018 suzuki et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 furthermore the higher levels of qns and lms in autumn october wet season than in spring march dry season fig s5 also revealed that they were more likely derived from the surface runoff of animal farms and manured farmland hall et al 2020 sarmah et al 2006 because the concentrations of stp derived contaminants such as surculose typically decreased in wet season due to the increased dilution carpenter et al 2019 qi et al 2014 the total concentrations of antibiotics in the sediment samples were in the range of 1 31 55 3 ng g in spring and 0 571 57 9 ng g in autumn respectively fig s11 no increasing trend was observed in the sediment samples from upstream to downstream some sampling sites y12 y14 and y28 y29 in spring y12 y14 y15 y24 and y28 y30 in autumn had notably high concentrations of tcs i e otc or dc and mls i e aetm and rtm in the sediment samples otc and dc were frequently detected in animal waste at high levels du et al 2022 zhou et al 2013 whereas aetm and rtm were both widely used for human and animals zhang et al 2015 these sampling sites are located in the vicinity of densely populated areas or large cities fig 3a with heavy loads of antibiotics from stps or animal farms to the river the antibiotics discharged in dissolved or solid bound phases i e tcs and mls may accumulate in river sediments gu et al 2007 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 resulting in the relatively high concentrations of antibiotics in the sediment samples near the pollution sources hu et al 2012 yi et al 2019 also these sites with high sedimentary antibiotic concentrations were in line with those reported in a previous study chen et al 2022b 3 3 variation of antibiotic compositions along the river the sampling sites were clustered into three groups according to antibiotic compositions in the water samples fig 4 accordingly the yangtze river can be divided into 3 regions with different antibiotic compositions labeled as a b and c from upstream to downstream which are located in the landforms of plateau mountain basin foothill and plains respectively this indicates substantial regional differences in antibiotic compositions along the yangtze river the boundary of the 3 regions moved downstream in autumn because of the higher flow discharge in this season fig s5 which can transport the pollutants further downstream more quickly than in the spring the anosim statistic test of pairwise bray curtis dissimilarities fig s12 confirmed the significant differences in antibiotic compositions of the water samples among the three regions in the spring r 0 626 p 0 001 and autumn r 0 675 p 0 001 however the antibiotic compositions in the sediment samples were clustered randomly fig s13 except that the sites in densely populated areas y12 y14 y24 y28 and y29 clustered together due to their same characteristic antibiotic otc this is possibly because antibiotics in the sediments primarily reflect the cumulative effects of local pollution due to the weak connectivity and mobility of the sediments along the river hu et al 2012 yi et al 2019 additionally significant differences in sediment properties table s4 may contribute to the heterogeneity of antibiotic compositions in the sediment samples fig 3c further showed the differences of antibiotic compositions in the water samples among three regions which was also confirmed by the pca biplot fig s14 furthermore the characteristic antibiotics for each region were identified by the dendrograms and pca loading plots figs 4 and s14 in spring figs 4a and s14a the characteristic antibiotics were sulfisoxazole ssz and nda in region a smx in region b and smm and scp in region c in autumn figs 4b and s14b the characteristic antibiotics were 3 qns nda flu and ola and 1 sas sulfaguanidine sgd in region a 3 sas smx smm and sulfadiazine sdz in region b and lcm in region c interestingly most characteristic antibiotics are primarily used in animal production table s14 for example scp is only used as a veterinary antibiotic more than 99 6 of smm is used for animals about 99 4 of smx is used for animals and lcm is mainly used for swine and poultry hanamoto et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 moreover the characteristic antibiotics in each region changed across the seasons likely due to the seasonal variations of antibiotic usage and pollution sources e g lcm the production and composition of various food animals cattle sheep pig poultry and aquaculture in different areas of the yangtze river basin are shown in fig 3b and table s15 the animal production increased from region a to region c along the river the species of food animals were also different in the three regions the dominant animal species changed from cattle and sheep accounting for 60 and 90 of the animal production in qinghai and tibet respectively in region a to pig 55 70 in region b and to aquaculture 31 49 and pig 29 40 in region c the amount of antibiotics used for each species of animals differed and the global average annual use of antimicrobials was estimated to follow the order of cattle 45 mg kg chicken 148 mg kg pigs 172 mg kg van boeckel et al 2015 together with varying types and use patterns of antibiotics for different animal species krishnasamy et al 2015 fig s15 the differences in the species and production of food animals are considered key determinants of the geographic distribution pattern of antibiotics 3 4 source apportionment we further conducted source apportionment to explain the spatial and seasonal variations in the concentrations and compositions of antibiotics along the yangtze river for the water samples three pollution sources pc1 pc2 and pc3 were identified see text s6 for detailed discussion by analyzing the usage and occurrence patterns of characteristic antibiotics closely associated with each source table s14 pc1 e g smx and mls was attributed to mixed sources of human and animals and pc2 e g smm scp and tylosin tyl and pc3 lcm were indicative of the sources from food animals the contribution of each source to the total antibiotic concentrations in water was then calculated and shown in fig 5 we found the animal source pc3 showed significant seasonal and spatial variations and only dominated in the region c in autumn with much higher contribution 72 7 than that in spring and other regions 19 6 44 1 the yangtze river has higher flow discharge in autumn 862 24 500 m3 s october wet season relative to spring 395 17 900 m3 s march dry season fig s5 and the increased surface runoff accounted for the heavy pollution loads e g dissolved nitrogen from animal production in autumn in the yangtze river chen et al 2019 furthermore previous studies found that lcm exhibited high levels up to 9 94 μg l in runoff following the land application of swine manure slurry hall et al 2020 the loads of micropollutants from non point pollution sources such as agricultural derived pesticides and veterinary medicines were significantly higher in wet season and were correlated with streamflow carpenter and helbling 2018 in the yangtze river basin surface runoff contributed about one third to the inputs of manure related nitrogen to rivers in 2012 chen et al 2022a application of animal manure in farmland increased from upstream to downstream sub basins of the yangtze river associated with the high animal production fig 3b and large cropland area fig 3d in region c chen et al 2019 therefore pc3 was identified as the non point pollution source of runoff e g from manured farmland and pc2 was assigned as the point source from animal farms the animal derived sources predominantly contribute to antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river region c received more antibiotics from the animal sources than regions a and b especially from the surface runoff of manured farmland in autumn wet season fig 5b the varying contributions of pollution sources across the three regions validated the regional differences of antibiotic concentrations and compositions in water figs 3 and 4 for the sediment samples fig s17 pc1 was characterized with rtm and dc and pc2 was only correlated with otc about half of rtm was used for humans whereas approximately 95 of dc was used for animals zhang et al 2015 therefore pc1 was identified as the mixed source of stps and animal farms otc have been frequently detected in animal wastewater with high levels du et al 2022 zhou et al 2013 for example up to 918 μg l in swine wastewater and 26 4 μg g in swine manure zhang et al 2018 thus pc2 represents the source of animal farms the mixed sources of stps and animal farms generally exhibited dominant contributions to the total antibiotic concentrations at most sites however at some sites e g y12 y14 in spring the source of animal farms was dominant due to the high concentrations of otc 3 5 driving factors of the antibiotic distribution the sem identified 5 factors i e elevation pd animal production tn and wt and 4 factors i e elevation pd animal production and nh4 n for antibiotics in the water and sediment samples respectively fig 6 a c land use was excluded because it failed to meet all the rules for the model development the parameters for the final models chi square value χ2 p value χ2 degree freedom χ2 df root mean square error of approximation rmsea goodness of fit index gfi and comparative fit index cfi fig 6a and c met the criteria stipulated in fig s1 for the water samples fig 6a a total of 77 8 variation of antibiotics could be explained indicating successful identification of influencing factors tn λ 0 544 p 0 001 pd λ 0 359 p 0 001 and animal production λ 0 239 p 0 01 had positive and direct effects on antibiotics whereas wt had negative and direct effect λ 0 195 p 0 01 moreover animal production could indirectly impact antibiotics by strongly influencing tn λ 0 814 p 0 001 which is a key chemical indicator of water pollution although without direct effects elevation could indirectly affect antibiotics via negatively influencing pd λ 0 302 p 0 05 animal production λ 0 809 p 0 001 and wt λ 0 603 p 0 001 which was also confirmed by the negative correlations between these three factors and elevation table s16 pd and animal production reflect the consumption and discharge of antibiotics leading to positive correlations with the antibiotic concentrations in the river water bu et al 2013 hanamoto et al 2018 yi et al 2019 animal production has the highest standardized total effect on antibiotics fig 6b directly and indirectly via influencing tn tn was selected as the most associated factor from the chemical parameters of the water samples which agrees with its largest loadings on total concentrations of all antibiotics shown in the rda biplot fig s17 here tn is the dominant factor directly explaining antibiotic concentrations in the water samples λ 0 544 p 0 001 and is mainly influenced by animal production λ 0 814 p 0 001 on the other hand more consumption van boeckel et al 2014 and lower degradation li et al 2019 of antibiotics in cold seasons cause higher antibiotic concentrations and thus result in a negative effect of wt elevation is associated with landform climate soil plants and animal species and negatively influences wt λ 0 603 p 0 001 pd λ 0 302 p 0 05 and the animal production λ 0 809 p 0 001 thus elevation has a strong indirect negative effect on the distribution of antibiotics figs 6a and b and s19 for the sediment samples fig 6c a total of 35 5 variation of antibiotics could be explained by the sem which is lower than that for the water samples 77 8 this indicates that the factors influencing the distribution of antibiotics in the sediment samples are more complex than those for the water samples moreover in contrast to the water samples only nh4 n has a significant positive effect λ 0 569 p 0 05 whereas pd and animal production has insignificant effects on the distribution of antibiotics in the sediment samples soc was excluded in the final sem because the fitted models did not meet the parameter criteria fig s1 this may be because many antibiotics have various functional groups in their molecular structures e g tcs and behave much differently from other hydrophobic organic pollutants li et al 2018 lv et al 2020 for example in addition to hydrophobic interactions antibiotics e g tcs can be adsorbed by sediments through complexation hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction patel et al 2019 the explanatory model for antibiotics in the sediment samples needs to be further explored in the future by considering additional factors including sediment texture cation exchange capability and particle size which might significantly influence the sedimentary concentrations of antibiotics li et al 2018 patel et al 2019 3 6 multifactor models to predict antibiotic concentrations to predict total antibiotic concentrations in water samples a multifactor model eq 1 was successfully developed table s17 using the direct influencing factors identified by sem fig 6a the total adjusted explained variance adj r2 of the predictive model is 0 774 the difference between adj r2 and loocv r2 0 732 table s17 was less than 15 indicating that the predictive model was stable and valid eeftens et al 2012 the relatively small mean absolute error mae 10 6 ng l and root mean square error rmse 13 3 ng l values and good correlation of predicted concentrations with measured concentrations of antibiotics fig 6d reflected the robust prediction ability of the predictive model as expected positive coefficients of tn and pd and a negative coefficient of wt were obtained different from the results of sem the total animal production was excluded in the multifactor model eq 1 due to its high collinearity with tn this may be because the total animal production is strongly correlated with tn and its effect on the antibiotic concentrations is included in the effect of tn fig 6a λ 0 814 p 0 001 this is plausible because animal derived n is an important source of n in river water in the yangtze river chen et al 2022a 1 c o n c n g l 34 85 tn 0 2347 pd 0 844 wt 0 233 r 2 0 786 adj r 2 0 774 p 0 001 variation partitioning analysis fig 6e showed that tn was the single best predictor of the antibiotic concentrations in the water samples 43 6 followed by the interactive effect of tn and pd 22 6 and the individual effect of pd 11 0 fig 6f showed the relative r 2 contribution of different factors to antibiotic concentrations in the water samples consistent with fig 6e tn accounted for a majority of the variability 53 8 in antibiotic concentrations and pd explained a moderate level of variability 23 1 likewise the multifactor models were also developed for total concentrations of all antibiotics in the sediment samples and each class of antibiotics in the water samples only the models for sas mls and pes in the water samples were stable had relatively high adj r2 table s17 and showed good agreement between the predicted and measured concentrations fig s20 eeftens et al 2012 similarly tn contributed to the majority of the explained variability of sas mls and pes fig s21 to r2 37 5 41 1 fig 6f as one of the factors explaining seasonal and regional variation li et al 2019 van boeckel et al 2014 wt had the highest contribution to mls pig production was selected for mls and sas probably because more than half of mls and sas were used for pigs in china zhang et al 2015 nh4 n was selected for pes which agrees with its large loading on pes shown in the rda biplot fig s18 4 discussion in this study 48 and 35 antibiotics were detected in the water and sediment samples of the yangtze river with concentrations of nd 87 1 ng l and nd 35 6 ng g respectively which were comparable with those in the yellow river and the pearl river but lower than those in the hai river china li et al 2018 an increasing trend in the total antibiotic concentrations was observed in the water samples of the yangtze river from the source to estuary which is associated with the increasing pd and animal production similar distribution pattern was also reported for organic pollutants in the ganges river sharma et al 2019 and the rhine river ruff et al 2015 intriguingly the yangtze river can be divided into 3 regions according to the antibiotic compositions which are located in the landforms of plateau mountain basin foothill and plains respectively along the river the landform influenced geographic distribution patterns were also observed for bacterial communities in the yangtze river liu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 further examination on the characteristic antibiotics and animal production practices revealed that the differences in the species and production of food animals are the key determinants for the geographic distribution pattern of antibiotics in the yangtze river similarly for other large rivers in the world future studies should be directed to investigating antibiotic consumption and production practices in animal agriculture across the entire river basin to accurately assess antibiotic pollution in the river waters in addition to antibiotics from human health care and domestic wastewaters further statistical modeling found that the geographic distribution pattern of antibiotics in the yangtze river is driven by both natural indirect and anthropogenic direct factors with animal production as the dominant anthropogenic factor the veterinary use of antibiotics accounts for about 73 of global antibiotic consumption van boeckel et al 2017 and animal waste is a major source of environmental antibiotics and antibiotic resistance gaballah et al 2021 sarmah et al 2006 extensive studies have reported the considerable antibiotic levels in animal waste and the receiving environments du et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 in china many animal farms lack effective waste treatment systems and the efficacies of lagoon anaerobic digester and constructed wetland can be variable zhang et al 2018 therefore managing antibiotic use in animal production and proper treatment and disposal of animal waste are crucial for mitigating antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river furthermore we found that surface runoff from manured croplands is an important source of antibiotics to the yangtze river in autumn wet season animal manure with high concentrations of antibiotic residues is considered a non point source of water pollution bai et al 2017 chen et al 2022a previous studies have demonstrated the substantial pollution of antibiotic and antibiotic resistance genes in the soils and surface runoff from manure amended agricultural land hall et al 2020 le et al 2018 li et al 2023 thus management and treatment of animal waste also need to be improved to control antibiotic pollution bai et al 2017 gaballah et al 2021 china has forbidden the direct application of untreated animal waste in croplands since 2020 ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china and ministry of ecology and environmental of the people s republic of china 2020 collection storage treatment and final disposal of animal waste should be more properly managed to minimize the discharge of pollutants to the yangtze river additionally edge of field practices such as vegetative buffer strip constructed wetland and controlled drainage should be adopted to decrease the antibiotic loads to surface waters our study identified the need for mitigating animal derived antibiotic pollution provided with better knowledge on the variations of antibiotic concentrations and composition along the river management decisions may be tailored to local conditions to protect the overall health of the yangtze river integrated management such as reducing antibiotics use improving management and treatment of animal waste at the farm level controlling non point source of antibiotics at the field scale as well as managing other domestic hospital and manufacturing pollution sources should be taken to mitigate antibiotic pollution in the yangtze river coordinated effort among policy makers animal producers pharmaceutical manufacturers consumers and waste treatment facilities will be key to reducing antibiotic pollution in the river finally the results of this study provided a spatial temporal snapshot of antibiotic pollution in the whole yangtze river and may be used as the reference conditions when comparing future monitoring data to assess the effectiveness of management practices in the yangtze river basin this study also provided an example on how to assess the antibiotic pollution and its driving factors in a large river which could be useful to similar studies in other large rivers of the world 5 conclusions this study revealed antibiotic profiles in the yangtze river from the source area to the estuary by quantifying 83 antibiotics forty eight and 35 antibiotics were detected in the water and sediment samples with total concentrations in the range of 2 05 111 ng l and 0 57 57 9 ng g respectively total concentrations in the water samples showed an increasing trend from the upstream to the downstream the composition of antibiotics was geographically clustered into three groups according to the plateau mountain basin foothill and plain regions largely determined by the geographic distribution pattern of food animal species in the yangtze river basin the regional variations of antibiotic profiles in the water along the river can be explained by the direct influence of pd animal production tn and wt as well as the indirect impact of topography or elevation tn was selected as the best predictor of total antibiotic concentrations in the water samples these findings are essential for developing pollution mitigation strategies in the yangtze river and could be informative to study the antibiotic pollution in other large rivers in the

14632,in this study we systematically developed the long term photoaging behavior of different sized polypropylene pp floating plastic wastes in a coastal seawater environment after 68 d of laboratory accelerated uv irradiation the pp plastic particle size decreased by 99 3 0 15 and nanoplastics average size 435 250 nm were produced with a maximum yield of 57 9 evidencing that natural sunlight irradiation induced long term photoaging ultimately converts floating plastic waste in marine environments into micro and nanoplastics subsequently when comparing the photoaging rate of different sized pp plastics in coastal seawater we discovered that large sized pp plastics 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm showed a lower photoaging rate than that of small sized pp plastic debris 0 150 and 300 500 μm with the decrease rate of plastic crystallinity as follow 0 150 μm 2 01 d 1 300 500 μm 1 25 d 1 1000 2000 μm 0 780 d 1 and 5000 7000 μm 0 900 d 1 this result can be attributed to the small size pp plastics producing more reactive oxygen species ros species with the formation capacity of hydroxyl radical oh as follows 0 150 μm 6 46 10 15 m 300 500 μm 4 87 10 15 m 500 1000 3 61 10 15 m and 5000 7000 μm 3 73 10 15 m the findings obtained in this study offer a new perspective on the formation and ecological risks of pp nanoplastics in current coastal seawater environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics and nanoplastics photoaging coastal seawater uv oxidation fragmentation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nanoplastic np plastic particles with size 1 μm pollution in marine environments has garnered much attention as an anthropogenic pollutant owing to its ubiquity and higher toxicity to aquatic organisms than microplastics mps particle size range in 1 μm to 5 mm and macroplastics plastic particles with size 5 mm meides et al 2021 there is abundant evidence that micro and nanoplastics especially surface modified aged ones are more toxic than that of large sized pristine macro and microplastics li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zou et al 2020 for example wang et al 2021a exposed 40 mg polystyrene ps microplastics to 80 ml natural seawater and uv irradiation for 60 days 113 45 w m 2 25 3 c the results showed that the plastic particle size decreased from 55 9 μm to 38 6 μm and yielded abundant of nanosized plastic particles yield 7 03 0 37 indicating that sunlight irradiation induced long term mp weathering in seawater is able to ultimately convert micro to nanoplastics wang et al 2020 then pristine and photoaged ps mps were exposed to juvenile groupers length 64 1 3 67 mm weight 3 53 0 24 g and fed a 20 mg g mp spiked diet with the obtained results showing that photoaged micro and nanoplastics are of higher toxic growth inhibition and hepatic pathological damage than pristine mps wang et al 2020 this is attributed to that fact that nps preferentially interfere with mitochondrial metabolism and trigger apoptosis after intracellular uptake into the inner side of the cell membrane while mp exposure into the cell membrane can induce mechanical damage through direct physical contact due to the particles relatively large size and inability to penetrate into the inside of the cells li et al 2021 in addition surface modified photoaged micro and nanoplastics in water readily produce reactive oxygen species ros i e hydroxyl radicals superoxide anion and singlet oxygen which can attack mitochondria directly leading to intracellular oxidative stress inflammatory response and reduced cell activity zhu et al 2020 zou et al 2020 in contrast during long term mp and np retention in marine environments they inevitably interact with surrounding microbiota e g bacteria and fungi and form a plastisphere defined as the large scale presence of microbial communities colonization upon the surface of mps nps wright et al 2020 the presence of mps nps and associated plastisphere will induce composite ecological risks to marine organisms or microorganisms including altering the microbial community structure by supporting the habitat and source energy to microorganisms amaneesh et al 2023 changing the environmental behavior of contaminants in marine waters through sorption desorption behavior wang et al 2021b and inducing additional ecological risk to marine organisms through the bioaccessibility of marine organisms liu et al 2022 therefore considering the adverse impact of mps and nps on marine water and marine organisms the pollution characteristics of mps and nps in marine waters need sufficient attention however the formation mechanism and the duration of nanoparticle fragmentation from floating plastic pellets in marine environments have yet to be assessed uv aging induced fragmentation of macro and microplastics is the most effective abiotic process leading to plastic embrittlement and fragmentation into smaller secondary mps or nps in comparison with biodegradation mechanical abrasion and hydrolysis reineccius et al 2023 wang et al 2020 this is due to the long term solar ultraviolet uv radiation induced extensive weathering likely changing the plastic molecular arrangement creating an abundance of cracks and holes on the surfaces of plastic materials and further fragmenting them under the impact of shear and stress forces induced by water flow or other solid matter i e suspended particles shi et al 2023 wei et al 2021 from this perspective we hypothesize that floating plastic wastes macro and microplastics in current marine environments readily underwent long term weathering processes e g photo degradation mechanical abrasion or biodegradation processes and are ultimately transferred into nps while the formation rate and mechanism of nps broken from macro and microplastics have not been well addressed wang et al 2020 zou et al 2020 primary and secondary macro and mp residues in current marine environments are distributed in different sizes 7 00 4 85 103 μm average 389 mm in the south china sea 5 00 102 1 99 103 μm 71 8 of total sampled amounts in the yellow sea

differently sized particles have a uniform aging mechanism and rate remains unknown although halle et al 2016 reported that small cubic pieces are subject to roll in the water during long term weathering processes large parallelepipeds are prone to floating on the water surface and expose one side to sunlight ter halle et al 2016 herein we systematically investigated the mechanism by which np is generated from floating plastic waste and its duration in the coastal seawater environment polypropylene pp ch2 ch ch3 plastics were selected because of their extensive use in global markets 19 3 of global consumption in 2019 especially in food packaging sweets and snack wrappers and microwave containers plastic europe 2020 the specific objectives of the paper were i to investigate the uv irradiation associated fragmentation duration and mechanism of micro and mesoplastics to nps in coastal seawater which also helped to develop the formation mechanism of different sized microplastics residue in current marine environments ii to investigate the photoaging rate of different sized macro and microplastics 0 150 300 500 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm used in this study in coastal seawater iii to unravel the mechanisms governing the diverse photoaging rate of different sized macro and microplastics in coastal seawater which was achieved by comparing the light shielding effect and formation capacity of reactive oxygen species ros for different sizes of plastic debris the obtained results are of great significance to unravel the source and formation formation process formation mechanism and formation duration of secondary miro and nanoplastic residues in the current marine ecosystems from floating marine plastic that underwent long term weathering in marine waters moreover the findings in this study adds some potentially important information to our understanding of mp and np formation in marine environments especially for secondary ones fragmented from large sized plastic debris in current marine ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pp materials purchased from chenfu co ltd china used in this study were disposable transparent meal boxes which were

given in fig s1 plastic particles with particle sizes ranging from 1000 to 2000 μm and 5000 7000 μm were cut by pp plastic products directly while plastic particles with particle sizes ranging from 0 to 150 μm and 300 500 μm were frozen in liquid nitrogen frozen coupled with mechanical breakdown by a mechanical crusher and finally sieved through a 150 μm stainless steel sifter to obtain 0 150 μm plastic particles 500 μm and 300 μm stainless steel sifters prior to acquiring 300 500 μm particles prior use in uv irradiation experiments 2 2 uv irradiation experiments owing to the prolonged time required for natural weathering of plastic waste in coastal seawater accelerated uv aging of pp mp particles were conducted herein to simulate the pp mp natural weathering process which has been extensively utilized in previous studies li et al 2022 lian et al 2023 wang et al 2023 for the uv irradiation experiments 500 mg of pp mps and 20 0 ml coastal seawater were mixed in a transparent quartz tube and stirred for 24 h in the dark to avoid the interference of surface electric charge the reaction tube was then transferred into a photochemical reaction apparatus cel lab500 beijing zhongjiao jinyuan technology co ltd china equipped with a 500 w 260 600 nm uv365 100 w m2 mercury lamp the light intensity used herein was approximately 10 times higher than that in natural sunlight 0

contents of the reaction tube were removed and passed through a 0 450 μm membrane to separate the solid plastic samples note that the presence of pp nps fragmented from pp macro and microplastics observed in this study are of the particles above the membrane pp nps passed through the 0 45 μm membrane and residue in the aqueous solution was excluded due to the difficulty in accumulating sufficient nps to be determined and characterized subsequently the solid plastic samples were dried for 48 h at 50 c and stored at 4 c prior to use control experiments were conducted simultaneously in the dark by wrapping the quartz tube in aluminum foil 2 3 characterization of pristine and aged pp mps nps characterization of pristine and aged pp plastic surface morphology specific surface area

presented as average values coupled with standard deviation 2 5 statistical analysis all of the statistical analyses herein were conducted using the ibm spss version 19 0 software for windows the correlation between pp mp carbonyl index ci value or crystallinity versus aging time were conducted using pearson correlation analysis and one way anova analysis in terms of the feasibility of

of variance 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv weathering induced fragmentation of floating plastic wastes down to different sized micro and nanosized pp plastics photoaging induced fragmentation of floating plastic waste into mps and nps was explored by continuously exposing plastic pellets size 6 15 0 824 103 μm in range of 5000 7000 μm to uv irradiation for 12 d fig s2 which is considered the main source of mp and np residue in the current marine environments as shown in fig 1 a the pp plastic size decreased from 6 15 0 824 103 μm to 93 9 12 6 μm after 12 d of uv irradiation with no difference in the pp plastic particle size found under dark controls indicating that aging induced fragmentation of pp macroplastics can lead to a decrease in particle size and the release of abundant smaller secondary mps these secondary mps were relatively distributed in different sizes fig 1d dose dependent release of pp mp fragments owing to prolonged uv aging showed that in contrast to dark controls fig s4a the total number of plastic particles in the aqueous solution increased from 53 to 2300 particles after 12 d of uv irradiation fig s4b indicating that prolonged pp mp exposure to uv irradiation in coastal seawater can produce abundant differently sized fragments and pollute surrounding waters arp et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 subsequently the photoaging behavior of pp debris of different sizes 0 150 300 500 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm fig 2 a in a coastal seawater environment was explored with the specific preparation method given in the section 2 1 the size ranges of those pp plastic debris for uv weathering experiments were determined by passing through different sized meshes when preparing different sized pp materials and the specific size of pp materials was determined by counting the size of pp materials in sem tem images using imagej software which was extensively used in previous studies fig s3 liu et al 2019 according to fig 2b 2e after 12 d of uv irradiation all of the plastic particle sizes were reduced with increasing uv aging time and uniform in size to 0 150 μm highlighting the diverse photoaging and fragment rates for different sized pp plastics in water to further investigate the uv weathering behavior of those fragmented plastic residues within a limited size range we extended the uv irradiation time to 68 d fig 2f showed that the pp particle size decreased constantly with increasing uv irradiation time and abundant nanoscale fragments were also observed on the pp mp surface after 68 d of uv irradiation in coastal seawater according to sem and tem analysis figs 2h and s5b those particles were distributed with an average particle size was 435 250 nm the production rate of pp nps was estimated as 57 9 among all of the particles that were uv irradiated by 68 d 240 particles chosen from the tem image the size of pp nps was counted using imagej software this indicates that photoaging and fragmentation of macro and microplastics in coastal seawater causes the release of abundant nps before dissociation into dissolved organics fig s5b which may be an important source of residual nps in the current marine environment wang et al 2020 in order to unravel the potential toxicity effect of pristine and aged pp mps to aquatic organisms we exposed 0 50 100 250 and 500 mg l pristine without uv irradiation and aged mps uv irradiated for 16 d and 68 d to zebrafish embryo 10 individuals for each sample and cultivated for 120 h at 28 5 c in fig s6 no differences were found for the zebrafish embryos and larvae in the blank controls without mps during 120 h incubation in contrast in comparison with pristine pp mps after exposed to 16 d and 68 d uv aged pp mps phenomenon of embryonic death 24 h exposure for 16 d uv aged pp mps with 50 and 250 mg l in concentration 24 h exposure for 68 d uv aged pp mps with 50 and 100 mg l in concentration death in fish body 72 h exposure for 16 d uv aged pp mps with 100 mg l in concentration were occurred although pristine 72 h exposure for pristine pp mps with 100 mg l in concentration and aged pp mps 72 h exposure for 68 d uv aged pp mps with 50 mg l in concentration were found to induce the deformed in fish body this evidenced the fact that photoaged mps in natural waters are of higher toxic effect and ecological risk to aquatic organisms mechanism illustrating the higher toxic effect of photoaged mps than that of pristine ones to aquatic organisms are assigned to the photoaged mps generally has higher surface roughness smaller size and readily to generate epfrs e g co and coo which facilitated to interfere the oxidative stress triggered mitochondrial depolarization promote the inflammation and hindered the transport and oxidation of fatty acid magri et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 thereby critical issue to unravel the source fate and potential ecological risk of photoaged mps and nps in natural aquatic waters is necessary and urgent 3 2 degradation mechanism and duration of mps and nps during long term retention in coastal seawater based on the slow decomposition rate of floating pp plastic wastes in marine environments their timescale of degradation mechanisms morphology and changes in chemical composition is mostly unknown making it difficult to determine their residence time and potential ecological risk to marine ecosystems when converting the laboratory accelerated uv aging experimental results to natural weathering we exposed pp mps to natural solar irradiation for 90 d in nanjing 32 7 n 118 57 e china the carbonyl index ci representing the content of oxygen residue within the pp plastic materials is used as an indicator to compare the pp laboratory accelerated uv aging and natural weathering results this is because the ci value has significant correlation r 0 935 p 0 01 with aging time fig 2h and is able to reflect the changes in plastic properties during photoaging in water deng et al 2022 qiu et al 2022 reineccius et al 2023 as shown in fig 2h after 90 d of natural exposure to coastal seawater the ci value of the pp mps increased from 2 00 0 100 10 2 to 1 50 0 200 10 1 which is equivalent to the ci value after 4 d 6 80 1 00 10 2 of laboratory accelerated uv irradiation this indicates that laboratory accelerated uv irradiation of pp for 68 d are equivalent to 1530 d 4 19 y 365 d y of natural weathering in coastal seawater given that there are many differences in laboratory accelerated weathering and naturally occurring aging processes due to the spectral distribution between mercury lamps light intensity uv365 100 w m2 and natural sunlight global radiation under ideal conditions uv365 4 w m2 reineccius et al 2023 and the impact of other weathering approaches simultaneously i e biodegradation mechanical abrasion and wind erosion bullard et al 2023 ding et al 2023 during plastic retention in water although sunlight irradiation associated uv weathering is introduced as the predominant approach leading to the aging and fragmentation of plastic wastes in current marine environments meides et al 2021 therefore there may be some differences when comparing the laboratory accelerated plastic uv weathering of plastics in coastal seawater to plastic natural weathering results in real aquatic environments and caution is needed crystallinity was used as a critical indicator to explore the pp fragmentation mechanism in coastal seawater which exhibited significant correlations with the plastic particle size r 0 895 p 0 01 and uv irradiation time r 0 910 p 0 01 this indicates that weathered plastic has unique chemical signatures in its molecular arrangement compared with pristine plastic materials fig 2i which will induce the formation of cracks on the surface of plastic pellets fig 3 e the mechanism associated with the formation of cracks on the surface of aged pp plastic materials is attributed to the fact that pp plastic photooxidation in water can induce polymer chain scission resulting in the formation of abundant o containing photodegradation products which include carbonyl aldehydes ketones carboxylic acids and esters 1550 1800 cm 1 and hydroxyl groups 3300 3800 cm 1 according to atr ftir fig 3c reineccius et al 2023 in contrast pp plastic uv weathering in water induced release of organic residue was also observed through total organic carbon toc analysis which increased from 10 4 0 110 to 27 2 0 280 mg l after 12 d of uv irradiation fig s8 in coastal seawater the plastic molecular arrangement associated crystallinity changed consequently with the pp ci value has significant correlation with the changes in pp crystallinity r 0 827 p 0 01 observed in this study in fig 3a and 3b the surface morphology of pristine pp pellets was smooth after 4 d of uv irradiation the surface morphology of plastics became wrinkled and displayed many cracks on the plastic surface indicating that uv light irradiation induced uneven surface erosion creating a rough surface morphology primarily on the exposed surfaces meides et al 2021 the cracks then expanded and penetrateed into the deep side of the plastic with increasing duration of uv aging forming a rough plastic surface after 12 d of uv irradiation according to atomic force microscopy afm analysis fig 3b in addition the release of micro and nanoplastic particles from the surface layer of degraded pp debris fig s5b occurred simultaneously during pp plastic waste aging in water from this perspective we can conclude that pp plastic surface oxidation induced fragmentation was mainly due to gradual delamination from the outside to the inside of the material fig 3e this is attributed to the uv aging induced polymer chain scission leading to changes in the plastic molecular arrangement creating abundant holes and cracks on the plastic surface and causing the embrittlement of plastic materials which eventually fragment into smaller debris fig s9 meides et al 2021 crushing and surface peeling as essential mechanisms for pp mp fragmentation and pp np formation were also demonstrated by behagat et al 2022 who used x ray tomography visualization analysis to determine the defect volume within pristine and aged mps bhagat et al 2022 however it is still unknown whether these differently sized pp mp residues in coastal seawater have a constant photoaging and fragmentation rate when converting into smaller pp mps even pp nps therefore we further compared the photoaging rate and mechanism of different sized macro and microplastics in coastal seawater 3 3 phototransformation rate of different sized pp macro and mps in natural coastal seawater the diverse plastic photoaging rates for different sizes of pp plastic debris floating in coastal seawater were also investigated through changes in the plastic physicochemical properties surface zeta potential water contact angle melting temperature crystallinity and ci for pristine and 12 d uv irradiated aged pp plastic particles 0 150 and 5000 7000 μm changes in the surface zeta potential water contact angle melting temperature ci and crystallinity of pp plastics during 12 d of treatment under dark conditions were conducted and observed no differences fig s10 the time dependent changes in crystallinity for different sized pp plastics followed a consistent tendency during light exposure which was calculated based on atr ftir fig s11 the decrease rate of plastic crystallinity was higher for small plastics 0 150 μm 2 01 d 1 300 500 μm 1 25 d 1 than for large plastics 1000 2000 μm 0 780 d 1 5000 7000 μm 0 900 d 1 fig 4 a no changes in the ci value occurred for pp mps of different sizes after 12 d of uv irradiation in coastal seawater the pp plastic ci reached a plateau in contrast to the continuous decrease in mp crystallinity with aging time fig 4b this suggests that rather than the surface oxidation associated ci value the plastic molecular arrangement associated crystallinity controls the photoaging rate of different sized pp plastic debris in coastal seawater similar to changes in plastic crystallinity the surface oxidation rate varied among the different sized pp plastic and mp pellets as demonstrated by the surface zeta potential water contact angle and melting temperature results fig 4c shows that the pp plastic surface charge associated zeta potential decreased from 0 760 0 530 mv to 9 52 0 900 mv for 5000 7000 μm plastic and 12 7 1 66 mv for 0 150 μm plastic after 12 d of uv light irradiation similarly the hydrophobicity related water contact angle and polymer crystalline related melting temperature varied for different sized pp plastics during the uv aging process in water after 12 d of uv irradiation the water contact angle and melting temperature of the 0 150 μm pp particles decreased by 29 3 110 1 48 to 78 4 0 84 and 5 8 156 0 15 c to 147 0 15 c respectively in contrast the water contact angle and melting temperature of the 5000 7000 μm pp particles decreased by 15 5 from 110 1 48 to 93 8 0 63 and 1 02 from 156 0 15 c to 154 0 14 c fig 4d and 4e respectively these results highlight the varied photoaging rates of the different sized mps during long term retention in coastal seawater smaller pp particles exhibited higher photoaging rate than large pp particles subsequently the photoaging mechanisms of different sizes of floating plastic waste in coastal seawater were investigated 3 4 mechanism illustrating the diverse photoaging rate of different sized pp macro and microplastics in coastal seawater photoaging of pp plastic debris in coastal seawater under light exposure is mainly associated with polymers attacked by photons and is referred as direct photooxidation whereas the various free radical mediated reactions induced by ros oh o2 and 1o2 are referred as free radical sensitized photooxidation qiu et al 2022 to further clarify the size dependent pp photoaging mechanism in coastal seawater we compared the formation capacity of ros species by different sized pp plastic debris in coastal seawater because the intermediates aldehydes ketones esters and alcohols released by different sizes of pp plastic debris induced light shielding effect are demonstrated not be a dominant factor controlling the photoaging rate of different sized plastics in coastal seawater with the relative results were given in text s2 of si in the free radical sensitized photooxidation of pp plastic debris in the coastal seawater the ros species oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 are essential constituents of plastic photoaging in water with oh and o2 introduced as the primary contributors catalyzing the cleavage of polymers in aquatic environments zhu et al 2021 the formation mechanism of o2 in coastal seawater by pp under light irradiation was assigned to the alkyl radical r or alkoxy radical ro produced by pp which can act as an electron donor that reacts with o2 o2 e o2 or 1o2 1o2 e o2 and finally causing the formation of o2 wang et al 2021a the formed o2 then reacts with h in water forming the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 h o2 ho2 and finally cause the plastic polymer chain h ho2 r h2o2 to break under light irradiation in water bielski et al 1983 oh the primary contributor to plastic photoaging and fragmentation in water is mainly formed through the cleavage of hydroperoxide rooh rooh hv ro oh under light irradiation the reaction mechanism between oh and the plastic polymer involves oh attacking the plastic polymer forming an alkyl radical and water rh oh r h2o chen et al 2019 herein the generation of oh and o2 by different sized pp particles in coastal seawater under light irradiation was investigated through electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis the reaction system contained 0 1 g pp 20 ml coastal seawater and the free radical trap 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 50 mm for oh and 100 mm for o2 specific information for the identification of ros oh and o2 is provided in text s3 si as shown in fig 5 a compared with the dark controls fig 5b obvious quartet epr signals were observed after 20 min of uv irradiation and the peak intensity followed the ratio 1 2 2 1 typical dmpo oh signal indicating that pp photoaging induces the formation of oh fontmorin et al 2016 similarly in fig 5c a broad four line epr signal was observed after 20 min of uv irradiation associated with the formation of dmpo hoo radicals from the reaction of o2 and dmpo with no peak in the dark controls fig 5d this suggests that photoaging of different sized pp plastic particles in coastal seawater induces the formation of o2 khachatryan et al 2011 subsequently the formation capacity of oh and o2 by different sized pp particles under light irradiation was compared the specific methods are provided in text s4 of the si the amount of oh formed by pp particles of different sizes 0 150 300 500 500 1000 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm during the photoaging process was determined using nitrobenzene nb 2 mm with a second order rate constant k nb of 3 90 109 m 1 s 1 fig s14 fang et al 2014 fig 5e shows that a linear fit was utilized for the loss of nb in the presence of different sized pp particles at different uv aging times whereas no difference was observed in nb concentration under dark conditions fig 5f the consumption ratios of nb in the uv reaction system were higher for smaller pp particles absolute first order rate constants 0 150 μm 0 0907 h 1 300 500 μm 0 0684 h 1 than for large pp particles first order rate constants 500 1000 μm 0 0507 h 1 and 5000 7000 μm 0 0384 h 1 the steady state concentration of oh oh ss was further calculated from the second order rate constant of nb k nb 3 90 109 m 1 s 1 and first order kinetic constant k nb oh of nb degradation in the reaction system k nb k nb oh oh ss hua et al 2019 the formation capacities of oh by pp in the size ranges of 0 150 300 500 500 1000 and 5000 7000 μm were then calculated as 6 46 10 15 m 4 87 10 15 m 3 61 10 15 m and 3 73 10 15 m respectively this suggests that smaller pp particles have a greater capacity to produce oh than larger pp plastics during long term weathering in coastal seawater the formation capacity of o2 by different sized pp particles under light irradiation in coastal seawater was estimated using nitroblue tetrazolium nbt as an o2 radical scavenger the reaction mechanism between nbt and o2 as follows luo et al 2021 1 nbt o2 nbt o2 2 nbt o2 mf o2 3 mf o2 mf o2 in brief under light irradiation o2 attacks ditetrazolium nbt2 and forms the tetrazolinyl radical nbt hayyan et al 2016 nbt is further converted to mf through the addition of electrons by o2 after exposing 100 mg pp materials to 1 00 mm nbt and uv irradiation for 25 0 min figure s15 the cumulative concentration of o2 were 62 6 1 76 45 6 0 270 32 4 0 320 and 41 1 0 650 μm for pp in size range of 0 150 300 500 500 1000 and 5000 7000 μm respectively fig 5g no changes were observed for the dark controls fig 5h these results indicate that smaller pp mps have a higher capacity to produce o2 than large pp mps in coastal seawater in view of the ros formation capacity of pp mps of different sizes during the photoaging process small pp mps 0 150 and 300 500 μm have a higher capacity to produce ros species than large pp pellets 500 1000 and 5000 7000 μm this may occur because small plastic pellets have a higher specific surface area than large plastic pellets and thus have more sites available to absorb photons during the photoaging process in water figs s16a and s16b to clarify this hypothesis the specific surface areas of pp particles after different periods of uv aging were determined using an adsorption desorption curve fig s17 after 32 d of uv irradiation in coastal seawater the pp bet surface area increased from 0 659 to 1 50 m2 g fig s18 with an increase of 127 this result showed that smaller sized photoaged plastics in water have higher specific surface areas and readily absorb more photons than large particles fig 6 overall we can conclude that different sized macro and mp residues residue in coastal seawater have diverse photoaging ratios with small pp mps 0 150 and 300 500 μm having higher photoaging rates than large pp pellets 500 1000 and 5000 7000 μm this is mainly attributed to the small pp particles having higher a capacity to produce ros during the long term photoaging process in coastal seawater 4 environmental implications in this study we prepared secondary nanoplastics using floating pp plastic wastes by laboratory accelerated uv weathering strategies to simulate their long term natural weathering in marine environments and demonstrated the long term photoaging process of floating pp plastics in marine waters converts macroplastic debris into mps and eventually in nps our results are favorable for unraveling the source and formation mechanism of secondary micro and nanoplastic particle residues in current marine environments in addition our findings reveal a ubiquitous but long overlooked fact that clearly indicating the smaller pp mps e g 0 150 and 300 500 μm have higher photoaging rates than large pp debris e g 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm which is attributed to smaller mps having a higher capacity to produce ros species thereby promoting free radical sensitized photooxidation processes this findings highlights that the fate and potential ecological risk of different sized aged micro and nanoplastics in current marine environments may be diverse due to the distinct photoaging behavior and surface chemistry e g surface roughness hydrophobicity and surface charging modification process during long term retention in water and this diversity requires further studies to be addressed

14632,in this study we systematically developed the long term photoaging behavior of different sized polypropylene pp floating plastic wastes in a coastal seawater environment after 68 d of laboratory accelerated uv irradiation the pp plastic particle size decreased by 99 3 0 15 and nanoplastics average size 435 250 nm were produced with a maximum yield of 57 9 evidencing that natural sunlight irradiation induced long term photoaging ultimately converts floating plastic waste in marine environments into micro and nanoplastics subsequently when comparing the photoaging rate of different sized pp plastics in coastal seawater we discovered that large sized pp plastics 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm showed a lower photoaging rate than that of small sized pp plastic debris 0 150 and 300 500 μm with the decrease rate of plastic crystallinity as follow 0 150 μm 2 01 d 1 300 500 μm 1 25 d 1 1000 2000 μm 0 780 d 1 and 5000 7000 μm 0 900 d 1 this result can be attributed to the small size pp plastics producing more reactive oxygen species ros species with the formation capacity of hydroxyl radical oh as follows 0 150 μm 6 46 10 15 m 300 500 μm 4 87 10 15 m 500 1000 3 61 10 15 m and 5000 7000 μm 3 73 10 15 m the findings obtained in this study offer a new perspective on the formation and ecological risks of pp nanoplastics in current coastal seawater environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics and nanoplastics photoaging coastal seawater uv oxidation fragmentation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nanoplastic np plastic particles with size 1 μm pollution in marine environments has garnered much attention as an anthropogenic pollutant owing to its ubiquity and higher toxicity to aquatic organisms than microplastics mps particle size range in 1 μm to 5 mm and macroplastics plastic particles with size 5 mm meides et al 2021 there is abundant evidence that micro and nanoplastics especially surface modified aged ones are more toxic than that of large sized pristine macro and microplastics li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zou et al 2020 for example wang et al 2021a exposed 40 mg polystyrene ps microplastics to 80 ml natural seawater and uv irradiation for 60 days 113 45 w m 2 25 3 c the results showed that the plastic particle size decreased from 55 9 μm to 38 6 μm and yielded abundant of nanosized plastic particles yield 7 03 0 37 indicating that sunlight irradiation induced long term mp weathering in seawater is able to ultimately convert micro to nanoplastics wang et al 2020 then pristine and photoaged ps mps were exposed to juvenile groupers length 64 1 3 67 mm weight 3 53 0 24 g and fed a 20 mg g mp spiked diet with the obtained results showing that photoaged micro and nanoplastics are of higher toxic growth inhibition and hepatic pathological damage than pristine mps wang et al 2020 this is attributed to that fact that nps preferentially interfere with mitochondrial metabolism and trigger apoptosis after intracellular uptake into the inner side of the cell membrane while mp exposure into the cell membrane can induce mechanical damage through direct physical contact due to the particles relatively large size and inability to penetrate into the inside of the cells li et al 2021 in addition surface modified photoaged micro and nanoplastics in water readily produce reactive oxygen species ros i e hydroxyl radicals superoxide anion and singlet oxygen which can attack mitochondria directly leading to intracellular oxidative stress inflammatory response and reduced cell activity zhu et al 2020 zou et al 2020 in contrast during long term mp and np retention in marine environments they inevitably interact with surrounding microbiota e g bacteria and fungi and form a plastisphere defined as the large scale presence of microbial communities colonization upon the surface of mps nps wright et al 2020 the presence of mps nps and associated plastisphere will induce composite ecological risks to marine organisms or microorganisms including altering the microbial community structure by supporting the habitat and source energy to microorganisms amaneesh et al 2023 changing the environmental behavior of contaminants in marine waters through sorption desorption behavior wang et al 2021b and inducing additional ecological risk to marine organisms through the bioaccessibility of marine organisms liu et al 2022 therefore considering the adverse impact of mps and nps on marine water and marine organisms the pollution characteristics of mps and nps in marine waters need sufficient attention however the formation mechanism and the duration of nanoparticle fragmentation from floating plastic pellets in marine environments have yet to be assessed uv aging induced fragmentation of macro and microplastics is the most effective abiotic process leading to plastic embrittlement and fragmentation into smaller secondary mps or nps in comparison with biodegradation mechanical abrasion and hydrolysis reineccius et al 2023 wang et al 2020 this is due to the long term solar ultraviolet uv radiation induced extensive weathering likely changing the plastic molecular arrangement creating an abundance of cracks and holes on the surfaces of plastic materials and further fragmenting them under the impact of shear and stress forces induced by water flow or other solid matter i e suspended particles shi et al 2023 wei et al 2021 from this perspective we hypothesize that floating plastic wastes macro and microplastics in current marine environments readily underwent long term weathering processes e g photo degradation mechanical abrasion or biodegradation processes and are ultimately transferred into nps while the formation rate and mechanism of nps broken from macro and microplastics have not been well addressed wang et al 2020 zou et al 2020 primary and secondary macro and mp residues in current marine environments are distributed in different sizes 7 00 4 85 103 μm average 389 mm in the south china sea 5 00 102 1 99 103 μm 71 8 of total sampled amounts in the yellow sea

differently sized particles have a uniform aging mechanism and rate remains unknown although halle et al 2016 reported that small cubic pieces are subject to roll in the water during long term weathering processes large parallelepipeds are prone to floating on the water surface and expose one side to sunlight ter halle et al 2016 herein we systematically investigated the mechanism by which np is generated from floating plastic waste and its duration in the coastal seawater environment polypropylene pp ch2 ch ch3 plastics were selected because of their extensive use in global markets 19 3 of global consumption in 2019 especially in food packaging sweets and snack wrappers and microwave containers plastic europe 2020 the specific objectives of the paper were i to investigate the uv irradiation associated fragmentation duration and mechanism of micro and mesoplastics to nps in coastal seawater which also helped to develop the formation mechanism of different sized microplastics residue in current marine environments ii to investigate the photoaging rate of different sized macro and microplastics 0 150 300 500 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm used in this study in coastal seawater iii to unravel the mechanisms governing the diverse photoaging rate of different sized macro and microplastics in coastal seawater which was achieved by comparing the light shielding effect and formation capacity of reactive oxygen species ros for different sizes of plastic debris the obtained results are of great significance to unravel the source and formation formation process formation mechanism and formation duration of secondary miro and nanoplastic residues in the current marine ecosystems from floating marine plastic that underwent long term weathering in marine waters moreover the findings in this study adds some potentially important information to our understanding of mp and np formation in marine environments especially for secondary ones fragmented from large sized plastic debris in current marine ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pp materials purchased from chenfu co ltd china used in this study were disposable transparent meal boxes which were

given in fig s1 plastic particles with particle sizes ranging from 1000 to 2000 μm and 5000 7000 μm were cut by pp plastic products directly while plastic particles with particle sizes ranging from 0

required for natural weathering of plastic waste in coastal seawater accelerated uv aging of pp mp particles were conducted herein to simulate the pp mp natural weathering process which has been extensively utilized in previous studies li et al 2022 lian et al 2023 wang et al 2023 for the uv irradiation experiments 500 mg of pp mps and 20 0 ml coastal seawater were mixed in a transparent quartz tube and stirred for 24 h in the dark to avoid the interference of surface electric charge the reaction tube was then transferred into a photochemical reaction apparatus cel lab500 beijing

contents of the reaction tube were removed and passed through a 0 450 μm membrane to separate the solid plastic samples note that the presence of pp nps fragmented from pp macro and microplastics observed in this study are of the particles above the membrane pp nps passed through the 0 45 μm membrane and residue in the aqueous solution was excluded due to the difficulty in accumulating sufficient nps to be determined and characterized subsequently the solid plastic samples were dried for 48 h at 50 c and stored at 4 c prior to use control experiments were conducted simultaneously in

precision and or accuracy for various instrumental analysis mp and np determination associated to the limit of detection lod for sem tem and nano zeta sizer were 2 nm 0 2 nm point resolution 0 19 nm

analysis was 0 0005 m2 g all of the plastic uv aging pristine and plastic characterization and reactive oxygen species ros quantification experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results were presented as average values coupled with standard deviation 2 5 statistical analysis all of the statistical analyses herein were conducted using the ibm spss version 19 0 software for windows the

of variance 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv weathering induced fragmentation of floating plastic wastes down to different sized micro and nanosized pp plastics photoaging induced fragmentation of floating plastic waste into mps and nps was explored by continuously exposing plastic pellets size 6 15 0 824 103 μm in range of 5000 7000 μm to uv irradiation for 12 d fig s2 which is considered the main source of mp and np residue in the current marine environments as shown in fig 1 a the pp plastic size decreased from 6 15 0 824 103 μm to 93 9 12 6 μm after 12 d of uv irradiation with no difference in the pp plastic particle size found under dark controls indicating that aging induced fragmentation of pp macroplastics can lead to a decrease in particle size and the release of abundant smaller secondary mps these secondary mps were relatively distributed in different sizes fig 1d dose dependent release of pp mp fragments owing to prolonged uv aging showed that in contrast to dark controls fig s4a the total number of plastic particles in the aqueous solution increased from 53 to 2300 particles after 12 d of uv irradiation fig s4b indicating that prolonged pp mp exposure to uv irradiation in coastal seawater can produce abundant differently sized fragments and pollute surrounding waters arp et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 subsequently the photoaging behavior of pp debris of different sizes 0 150 300 500 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm fig 2 a in a coastal seawater environment was explored with the specific preparation method given in the section 2 1 the size ranges of those pp plastic debris for uv weathering experiments were determined by passing through different sized meshes when preparing different sized pp materials and the specific size of pp materials was determined by counting the size of pp materials in sem tem images using imagej software which was extensively used in previous studies fig s3 liu et al 2019 according to fig 2b 2e after 12 d of uv irradiation all of the plastic particle sizes were reduced with increasing uv aging time and uniform in size to 0 150 μm highlighting the diverse photoaging and fragment rates for different sized pp plastics in water to further investigate the uv weathering behavior of those fragmented plastic residues within a limited size range we extended the uv irradiation time to 68 d fig 2f showed that the pp particle size decreased constantly with increasing uv irradiation time and abundant nanoscale fragments were also observed on the pp mp surface after 68 d of uv irradiation in coastal seawater according to sem and tem analysis figs 2h and s5b those particles were distributed with an average particle size was 435 250 nm the production rate of pp nps was estimated as 57 9 among all of the particles that were uv irradiated by 68 d 240 particles chosen from the tem image the size of pp nps was counted using imagej software this indicates that photoaging and fragmentation of macro and microplastics in coastal seawater causes the release of abundant nps before dissociation into dissolved organics fig s5b which may be an important source of residual nps in the current marine environment wang et al 2020 in order to unravel the potential toxicity effect of pristine and aged pp mps to aquatic organisms we exposed 0 50 100 250 and 500 mg l pristine without uv irradiation and aged mps uv irradiated for 16 d and 68 d to zebrafish embryo 10 individuals for each sample and cultivated for 120 h at 28 5 c in fig s6 no differences were found for the zebrafish embryos and larvae in the blank controls without mps during 120 h incubation in contrast in comparison with pristine pp mps after exposed to 16 d and 68 d uv aged pp mps phenomenon of embryonic death 24 h exposure for 16 d uv aged pp mps with 50 and 250 mg l in concentration 24 h exposure for 68 d uv aged pp mps with 50 and 100 mg l in concentration death in fish body 72 h exposure for 16 d uv aged pp mps with 100 mg l in concentration were occurred although pristine 72 h exposure for pristine pp mps with 100 mg l in concentration and aged pp mps 72 h exposure for 68 d uv aged pp mps with 50 mg l in concentration were found to induce the deformed in fish body this evidenced the fact that photoaged mps in natural waters are of higher toxic effect and ecological risk to aquatic organisms mechanism illustrating the higher toxic effect of photoaged mps than that of pristine ones to aquatic organisms are assigned to the photoaged mps generally has higher surface roughness smaller size and readily to generate epfrs e g co and coo which facilitated to interfere the oxidative stress triggered mitochondrial depolarization promote the inflammation and hindered the transport and oxidation of fatty acid magri et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 thereby critical issue to unravel the source fate and potential ecological risk of photoaged mps and nps in natural aquatic waters is necessary and urgent 3 2 degradation mechanism and duration of mps and nps during long term retention in coastal seawater based on the slow decomposition rate of floating pp plastic wastes in marine environments their timescale of degradation mechanisms morphology and changes in chemical composition is mostly unknown making it difficult to determine their residence time and potential ecological risk to marine ecosystems when converting the laboratory accelerated uv aging experimental results to natural weathering we exposed pp mps to natural solar irradiation for 90 d in nanjing 32 7 n 118 57 e china the carbonyl index ci representing the content of oxygen residue within the pp plastic materials is used as an indicator to compare the pp laboratory accelerated uv aging and natural weathering results this is because the ci value has significant correlation r 0 935 p 0 01 with aging time fig 2h and is able to reflect the changes in plastic properties during photoaging in water deng et al 2022 qiu et al 2022 reineccius et al 2023 as shown in fig 2h after 90 d of natural exposure to coastal seawater the ci value of the pp mps increased from 2 00 0 100 10 2 to 1 50 0 200 10 1 which is equivalent to the ci value after 4 d 6 80 1 00 10 2 of laboratory accelerated uv irradiation this indicates that laboratory accelerated uv irradiation of pp for 68 d are equivalent to 1530 d 4 19 y 365 d y of natural weathering in coastal seawater given that there are many differences in laboratory accelerated weathering and naturally occurring aging processes due to the spectral distribution between mercury lamps light intensity uv365 100 w m2 and natural sunlight global radiation under ideal conditions uv365 4 w m2 reineccius et al 2023 and the impact of other weathering approaches simultaneously i e biodegradation mechanical abrasion and wind erosion bullard et al 2023 ding et al 2023 during plastic retention in water although sunlight irradiation associated uv weathering is introduced as the predominant approach leading to the aging and fragmentation of plastic wastes in current marine environments meides et al 2021 therefore there may be some differences when comparing the laboratory accelerated plastic uv weathering of plastics in coastal seawater to plastic natural weathering results in real aquatic environments and caution is needed crystallinity was used as a critical indicator to explore the pp fragmentation mechanism in coastal seawater which exhibited significant correlations with the plastic particle size r 0 895 p 0 01 and uv irradiation time r 0 910 p 0 01 this indicates that weathered plastic has unique chemical signatures in its molecular arrangement compared with pristine plastic materials fig 2i which will induce the formation of cracks on the surface of plastic pellets fig 3 e the mechanism associated with the formation of cracks on the surface of aged pp plastic materials is attributed to the fact that pp plastic photooxidation in water can induce polymer chain scission resulting in the formation of abundant o containing photodegradation products which include carbonyl aldehydes ketones carboxylic acids and esters 1550 1800 cm 1 and hydroxyl groups 3300 3800 cm 1 according to atr ftir fig 3c reineccius et al 2023 in contrast pp plastic uv weathering in water induced release of organic residue was also observed through total organic carbon toc analysis which increased from 10 4 0 110 to 27 2 0 280 mg l after 12 d of uv irradiation fig s8 in coastal seawater the plastic molecular arrangement associated crystallinity changed consequently with the pp ci value has significant correlation with the changes in pp crystallinity r 0 827 p 0 01 observed in this study in fig 3a and 3b the surface morphology of pristine pp pellets was smooth after 4 d of uv irradiation the surface morphology of plastics became wrinkled and displayed many cracks on the plastic surface indicating that uv light irradiation induced uneven surface erosion creating a rough surface morphology primarily on the exposed surfaces meides et al 2021 the cracks then expanded and penetrateed into the deep side of the plastic with increasing duration of uv aging forming a rough plastic surface after 12 d of uv irradiation according to atomic force microscopy afm analysis fig 3b in addition the release of micro and nanoplastic particles from the surface layer of degraded pp debris fig s5b occurred simultaneously during pp plastic waste aging in water from this perspective we can conclude that pp plastic surface oxidation induced fragmentation was mainly due to gradual delamination from the outside to the inside of the material fig 3e this is attributed to the uv aging induced polymer chain scission leading to changes in the plastic molecular arrangement creating abundant holes and cracks on the plastic surface and causing the embrittlement of plastic materials which eventually fragment into smaller debris fig s9 meides et al 2021 crushing and surface peeling as essential mechanisms for pp mp fragmentation and pp np formation were also demonstrated by behagat et al 2022 who used x ray tomography visualization analysis to determine the defect volume within pristine and aged mps bhagat et al 2022 however it is still unknown whether these differently sized pp mp residues in coastal seawater have a constant photoaging and fragmentation rate when converting into smaller pp mps even pp nps therefore we further compared the photoaging rate and mechanism of different sized macro and microplastics in coastal seawater 3 3 phototransformation rate of different sized pp macro and mps in natural coastal seawater the diverse plastic photoaging rates for different sizes of pp plastic debris floating in coastal seawater were also investigated through changes in the plastic physicochemical properties surface zeta potential water contact angle melting temperature crystallinity and ci for pristine and 12 d uv irradiated aged pp plastic particles 0 150 and 5000 7000 μm changes in the surface zeta potential water contact angle melting temperature ci and crystallinity of pp plastics during 12 d of treatment under dark conditions were conducted and observed no differences fig s10 the time dependent changes in crystallinity for different sized pp plastics followed a consistent tendency during light exposure which was calculated based on atr ftir fig s11 the decrease rate of plastic crystallinity was higher for small plastics 0 150 μm 2 01 d 1 300 500 μm 1 25 d 1 than for large plastics 1000 2000 μm 0 780 d 1 5000 7000 μm 0 900 d 1 fig 4 a no changes in the ci value occurred for pp mps of different sizes after 12 d of uv irradiation in coastal seawater the pp plastic ci reached a plateau in contrast to the continuous decrease in mp crystallinity with aging time fig 4b this suggests that rather than the surface oxidation associated ci value the plastic molecular arrangement associated crystallinity controls the photoaging rate of different sized pp plastic debris in coastal seawater similar to changes in plastic crystallinity the surface oxidation rate varied among the different sized pp plastic and mp pellets as demonstrated by the surface zeta potential water contact angle and melting temperature results fig 4c shows that the pp plastic surface charge associated zeta potential decreased from 0 760 0 530 mv to 9 52 0 900 mv for 5000 7000 μm plastic and 12 7 1 66 mv for 0 150 μm plastic after 12 d of uv light irradiation similarly the hydrophobicity related water contact angle and polymer crystalline related melting temperature varied for different sized pp plastics during the uv aging process in water after 12 d of uv irradiation the water contact angle and melting temperature of the 0 150 μm pp particles decreased by 29 3 110 1 48 to 78 4 0 84 and 5 8 156 0 15 c to 147 0 15 c respectively in contrast the water contact angle and melting temperature of the 5000 7000 μm pp particles decreased by 15 5 from 110 1 48 to 93 8 0 63 and 1 02 from 156 0 15 c to 154 0 14 c fig 4d and 4e respectively these results highlight the varied photoaging rates of the different sized mps during long term retention in coastal seawater smaller pp particles exhibited higher photoaging rate than large pp particles subsequently the photoaging mechanisms of different sizes of floating plastic waste in coastal seawater were investigated 3 4 mechanism illustrating the diverse photoaging rate of different sized pp macro and microplastics in coastal seawater photoaging of pp plastic debris in coastal seawater under light exposure is mainly associated with polymers attacked by photons and is referred as direct photooxidation whereas the various free radical mediated reactions induced by ros oh o2 and 1o2 are referred as free radical sensitized photooxidation qiu et al 2022 to further clarify the size dependent pp photoaging mechanism in coastal seawater we compared the formation capacity of ros species by different sized pp plastic debris in coastal seawater because the intermediates aldehydes ketones esters and alcohols released by different sizes of pp plastic debris induced light shielding effect are demonstrated not be a dominant factor controlling the photoaging rate of different sized plastics in coastal seawater with the relative results were given in text s2 of si in the free radical sensitized photooxidation of pp plastic debris in the coastal seawater the ros species oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 are essential constituents of plastic photoaging in water with oh and o2 introduced as the primary contributors catalyzing the cleavage of polymers in aquatic environments zhu et al 2021 the formation mechanism of o2 in coastal seawater by pp under light irradiation was assigned to the alkyl radical r or alkoxy radical ro produced by pp which can act as an electron donor that reacts with o2 o2 e o2 or 1o2 1o2 e o2 and finally causing the formation of o2 wang et al 2021a the formed o2 then reacts with h in water forming the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 h o2 ho2 and finally cause the plastic polymer chain h ho2 r h2o2 to break under light irradiation in water bielski et al 1983 oh the primary contributor to plastic photoaging and fragmentation in water is mainly formed through the cleavage of hydroperoxide rooh rooh hv ro oh under light irradiation the reaction mechanism between oh and the plastic polymer involves oh attacking the plastic polymer forming an alkyl radical and water rh oh r h2o chen et al 2019 herein the generation of oh and o2 by different sized pp particles in coastal seawater under light irradiation was investigated through electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis the reaction system contained 0 1 g pp 20 ml coastal seawater and the free radical trap 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 50 mm for oh and 100 mm for o2 specific information for the identification of ros oh and o2 is provided in text s3 si as shown in fig 5 a compared with the dark controls fig 5b obvious quartet epr signals were observed after 20 min of uv irradiation and the peak intensity followed the ratio 1 2 2 1 typical dmpo oh signal indicating that pp photoaging induces the formation of oh fontmorin et al 2016 similarly in fig 5c a broad four line epr signal was observed after 20 min of uv irradiation associated with the formation of dmpo hoo radicals from the reaction of o2 and dmpo with no peak in the dark controls fig 5d this suggests that photoaging of different sized pp plastic particles in coastal seawater induces the formation of o2 khachatryan et al 2011 subsequently the formation capacity of oh and o2 by different sized pp particles under light irradiation was compared the specific methods are provided in text s4 of the si the amount of oh formed by pp particles of different sizes 0 150 300 500 500 1000 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm during the photoaging process was determined using nitrobenzene nb 2 mm with a second order rate constant k nb of 3 90 109 m 1 s 1 fig s14 fang et al 2014 fig 5e shows that a linear fit was utilized for the loss of nb in the presence of different sized pp particles at different uv aging times whereas no difference was observed in nb concentration under dark conditions fig 5f the consumption ratios of nb in the uv reaction system were higher for smaller pp particles absolute first order rate constants 0 150 μm 0 0907 h 1 300 500 μm 0 0684 h 1 than for large pp particles first order rate constants 500 1000 μm 0 0507 h 1 and 5000 7000 μm 0 0384 h 1 the steady state concentration of oh oh ss was further calculated from the second order rate constant of nb k nb 3 90 109 m 1 s 1 and first order kinetic constant k nb oh of nb degradation in the reaction system k nb k nb oh oh ss hua et al 2019 the formation capacities of oh by pp in the size ranges of 0 150 300 500 500 1000 and 5000 7000 μm were then calculated as 6 46 10 15 m 4 87 10 15 m 3 61 10 15 m and 3 73 10 15 m respectively this suggests that smaller pp particles have a greater capacity to produce oh than larger pp plastics during long term weathering in coastal seawater the formation capacity of o2 by different sized pp particles under light irradiation in coastal seawater was estimated using nitroblue tetrazolium nbt as an o2 radical scavenger the reaction mechanism between nbt and o2 as follows luo et al 2021 1 nbt o2 nbt o2 2 nbt o2 mf o2 3 mf o2 mf o2 in brief under light irradiation o2 attacks ditetrazolium nbt2 and forms the tetrazolinyl radical nbt hayyan et al 2016 nbt is further converted to mf through the addition of electrons by o2 after exposing 100 mg pp materials to 1 00 mm nbt and uv irradiation for 25 0 min figure s15 the cumulative concentration of o2 were 62 6 1 76 45 6 0 270 32 4 0 320 and 41 1 0 650 μm for pp in size range of 0 150 300 500 500 1000 and 5000 7000 μm respectively fig 5g no changes were observed for the dark controls fig 5h these results indicate that smaller pp mps have a higher capacity to produce o2 than large pp mps in coastal seawater in view of the ros formation capacity of pp mps of different sizes during the photoaging process small pp mps 0 150 and 300 500 μm have a higher capacity to produce ros species than large pp pellets 500 1000 and 5000 7000 μm this may occur because small plastic pellets have a higher specific surface area than large plastic pellets and thus have more sites available to absorb photons during the photoaging process in water figs s16a and s16b to clarify this hypothesis the specific surface areas of pp particles after different periods of uv aging were determined using an adsorption desorption curve fig s17 after 32 d of uv irradiation in coastal seawater the pp bet surface area increased from 0 659 to 1 50 m2 g fig s18 with an increase of 127 this result showed that smaller sized photoaged plastics in water have higher specific surface areas and readily absorb more photons than large particles fig 6 overall we can conclude that different sized macro and mp residues residue in coastal seawater have diverse photoaging ratios with small pp mps 0 150 and 300 500 μm having higher photoaging rates than large pp pellets 500 1000 and 5000 7000 μm this is mainly attributed to the small pp particles having higher a capacity to produce ros during the long term photoaging process in coastal seawater 4 environmental implications in this study we prepared secondary nanoplastics using floating pp plastic wastes by laboratory accelerated uv weathering strategies to simulate their long term natural weathering in marine environments and demonstrated the long term photoaging process of floating pp plastics in marine waters converts macroplastic debris into mps and eventually in nps our results are favorable for unraveling the source and formation mechanism of secondary micro and nanoplastic particle residues in current marine environments in addition our findings reveal a ubiquitous but long overlooked fact that clearly indicating the smaller pp mps e g 0 150 and 300 500 μm have higher photoaging rates than large pp debris e g 1000 2000 and 5000 7000 μm which is attributed to smaller mps having a higher capacity to produce ros species thereby promoting free radical sensitized photooxidation processes this findings highlights that the fate and potential ecological risk of different sized aged micro and nanoplastics in current marine environments may be diverse due to the distinct photoaging behavior and surface chemistry e g surface roughness hydrophobicity and surface charging modification process during long term retention in water and this diversity requires further studies to be addressed

14633,anaerobic treatment of mainstream wastewater has been proposed as a promising solution to enhance bioenergy recovery for wastewater treatment plants wwtps however the limited organics for downstream nitrogen removal and emissions of dissolved methane into the atmosphere are two major barriers to the broad application of anaerobic wastewater treatment this study aims to develop a novel technology to overcome these two challenges by achieving simultaneous removal of dissolved methane and nitrogen and unravel the microbial competitions underpinning the process from the microbial and kinetic perspectives to this end a laboratory granule based sequencing batch reactor gsbr coupling anammox and nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo microorganisms was developed to treat wastewater mimicking effluent from mainstream anaerobic treatment the gsbr achieved high level nitrogen and dissolved methane removal rates 250 mg n l d and 65 mg ch4 l d and efficiencies 99 total nitrogen removal and 90 total methane removal during the long term demonstration the availability of different electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate imposed significant effects on the removal of ammonium and dissolved methane as well as on the microbial communities and the abundance and expression of functional genes the analysis of apparent microbial kinetics showed that anammox bacteria had a higher nitrite affinity than n damo bacteria while n damo bacteria had a higher methane affinity than n damo archaea these kinetics underpin the observation that nitrite is a preferred electron acceptor for removing ammonium and dissolved methane than nitrate the findings not only extend the applications of novel n damo microorganisms in nitrogen and dissolved methane removal but also provide insights into microbial cooperation and competition in granular systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction recently the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc released its sixth assessment report ar6 making an urgent warning against the global climate change ipcc 2021 as the second most significant contributor to global warming methane emitted from anthropogenic sources is a significant concern due to the high global warming potential i e 29 8 11 and 27 2 11 times that of carbon dioxide for fossil and non fossil ch4 respectively over a 100 year horizon apart from emissions from fossil fuel and agriculture sectors methane emission in wastewater treatment is another significant input to the global methane budget generally methane is produced in anaerobic processes via the bacterial decomposition of organic matters in wastewater and sludge considering the potential for enhancing bioenergy recovery the implementation of anaerobic treatment has been growing rapidly in the past few decades crone et al 2016 mccarty 2018 contrary to the goal of recovering methane in the gas phase a fraction of up to 60 of total methane generated is dissolved in the wastewater 10 30 mg ch4 l vela et al 2015 which is stripped into the atmosphere by aeration another problem associated with mainstream anaerobic treatment is the lack of organic carbon for conventional biological nitrogen removal since 60 80 of organic carbon has been converted to methane prior to nitrogen removal crone et al 2016 to achieve high level nitrogen removal external carbon sources are needed which compromises the benefits achieved by bioenergy recovery these two issues could be simultaneously addressed with the use of microbial consortia capable of performing denitrification using methane as a carbon source ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 in such microbial guilds methane supported nitrate removal reaction 1 and methane supported nitrite removal reaction 2 could be conducted by an archaeal haroon et al 2013 and a bacterial group ettwig et al 2010 respectively these two microbial groups are named after their functions as n damo archaea and n damo bacteria nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation respectively 1 c h 4 4 n o 3 c o 2 4 n o 2 2 h 2 o 2 3 c h 4 8 n o 2 8 h 3 c o 2 4 n 2 10 h 2 o based on the fundamental discovery of these n damo microbes researchers started the development of technologies leveraging their unique capabilities in removing nitrogen using gaseous methane which is readily available in biogas generated from anaerobic sludge digestion bhattacharjee et al 2016 luesken et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 to speed up the nitrogen removal rates in methane fed systems numerous attempts have been made by using efficient methane delivery strategies e g non porous hollow fiber membrane alrashed et al 2018 fu et al 2017 liang et al 2022 liu et al 2020b shi et al 2013 xie et al

2019 lim et al 2021 as expected promising nitrogen removal performances have been achieved based on these strategies for example liu et al 2019 achieved a total nitrogen tn removal rate of 1 5 kg n m3

single reactor allegue et al 2018 boosted up the nitrite removal rate to above 100 mg n l d in a membrane bioreactor with complete retention of biomass fan et al 2019 applied a granular bioreactor which realized a high nitrogen removal rate of 16 5 kg n m3 d very recently dissolved methane in anaerobic effluent has been proposed as another source of methane to support nitrogen removal cai et al 2021 shi et al 2021 this shift in concept is novel and significant it proposes new scenarios for the application of n damo microorganisms potentially solving the two problems associated with anaerobic wastewater treatment as identified above this study aims to develop a novel process to achieve the simultaneous removal of dissolved methane and nitrogen and to unravel microbial interactions underpinning the process for these aims a laboratory granule based sequencing batch reactor gsbr was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of removing different nitrogenous compounds in mainstream anaerobic wastewater using dissolved methane the microbial responses to different electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate were systematically revealed by the combination of ex situ batch tests real time quantitative pcr qpcr reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the apparent kinetics of functional microorganisms were uncovered by independent batch tests to reveal the kinetic mechanisms behind microbial competitions this study not only extended the applications of n damo microorganisms in nitrogen and dissolved methane removal from wastewater but also provided important insights into the fundamental understanding of microbial interactions between anammox and n damo organisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration operation and monitoring a lab scale gsbr with a total working volume of 2 l was established fig 1 a the seeding sludge was taken from a granular upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb in which methane gas was continuously supplied to support nitrogen removal liu et al 2021a the bulk liquid was recirculated from the top to the bottom by a peristaltic pump longer pump china at the upflow rate of 4 5 m h the ph was monitored by a meter oakton australia which was stable at 7 0 0 5 throughout the experiment the reactor was operated in a temperature controlled lab 22 c the synthetic wastewater was deoxygenated with nitrogen gas when prepared and stored in a 10 l feed tank two bunches of hollow fiber membrane 200 μm of inner diameter and 300 μm of outer diameter mitsubishi japan connected to the compressed methane pipeline were installed in the feed tank to dissolve methane efficiently thus mimicking the effluent of anaerobic processes with dissolved methane concentration of 18 20 mg ch4 l to maintain the pressure in the feed tank and to avoid oxygen contamination a 10 l gas bag tedlar australia filled with methane gas was connected to the feed tank the influent nitrogen compositions are summarized in table 1 while trace elements in the growth medium are summarized in table s1 the feeding with dissolved methane and nitrogenous compounds was transferred to the gsbr by a peristaltic pump bt300 2 j longer china the total cycle time of gsbr was fixed at 2 h i e 12 cycles a day the exchange ratio volume of effluent discharged in each cycle divided by the total working volume was designed to be 0

feeding phase fig 1b the settling time of 5 min was selected according to the measured sludge volume index svi5 32 2 ml g so that the majority of granules can be retained in the reactor and the suspended solid in effluent was below 0 01 g l the granular sludge was relatively stable during the experiment the volatile suspended solids vss was determined to be approximately 10 5 2 1 g l while the svi5 and svi30 were 28 3 and 30 5 ml g respectively the long term experiment consisted of six phases for a total of 295 days table 1 to mimic mainstream domestic sewage the tn concentration was fixed at 60 mg n l throughout the experiment to identify the impacts of different types and amounts of electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate on the removal of ammonium and dissolved methane in anaerobic effluent nitrite was added in the feeding at different concentrations from phase i to phase iii while nitrate was added from phase iv to phase v the hrt was prolonged from 12 h in phases i iii to 24 h in phase iv and 48 h in phase v corresponding to an influent flow of 1 4 l d based on the overall nitrogen and methane removal performance see details in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 nitrite appeared to be a better electron acceptor for ammonium and dissolved methane removal which was selected in phase vi to explore the boundary of the system the hrt was gradually decreased to 6 h in phase vi the concentrations of nitrate nitrite ammonium and dissolved methane in the effluent of the gsbr were measured two to three times a week the chemical analytical methods are described in text s1 of supplementary information si cycle studies in the gsbr were performed in each phase by analysing nitrate nitrite ammonium and dissolved methane concentrations every 10 min in a typical cycle 2 2 determination of activities of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea 2 2 1 in situ activity determination the in situ activities of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were calculated during the long term experiment the volumetric removal rates of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were first determined according to the influent and effluent nitrogen compositions and the applied hrt based on the reaction stoichiometry the nitrite removal rate of anammox bacteria ran nitrite removal rate of n damo bacteria rdb and nitrate removal rate of n damo archaea rda were calculated accordingly more details for the calculation of in situ microbial activities can be found in text s2 in si 2 2 2 ex situ activity determination at the end of each phase 100 ml biomass was transferred to 150 ml serum bottles to determine the maximum activities of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea separately specifically the first bottle was flushed with helium gas for 3 min to form an anoxic condition afterwards the sodium nitrite 1 g l and ammonium chloride 1 g l stock solutions were dosed into the bottle leading to initial nitrite and ammonium concentrations of 20 mg n l respectively the maximum anammox activity ran max was represented as the volumetric nitrite removal rate the second bottle and the third bottle were both flushed with pure methane gas for 5 min giving rise to an initial dissolved methane concentration of 20 mg ch4 l then the sodium nitrite 1 g l was dosed into the second bottle to reach an initial nitrite concentration of 20 mg n l while the sodium nitrate 1 g l was dosed into the third bottle to reach an initial nitrate concentration of 20 mg n l the maximum n damo bacteria activity rdb max was determined as the volumetric nitrite removal rate and the maximum n damo archaea activity rda max was determined as the volumetric nitrate removal rate each test lasted for 60 min and was performed in triplicate liquid samples were collected every 15 min to determine the variations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and dissolved methane 2 3 determination of apparent substrate affinities 2 3 1 apparent nitrite affinities of anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria after the long term experiment 200 ml intact granular biomass was collected by a 500 ml glass bottle to determine the apparent nitrite affinities of anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria the test for anammox apparent nitrite affinity was performed with the initial ammonium concentration of 100 mg n l the culture was flushed with pure helium for 5 min to form a completely anoxic condition the initial nitrite concentration was raised to 10 mg n l by adding a nitrite stock solution 1 g l the test was carried out until the nitrite concentration decreased to zero and the liquid samples were taken every 20 min for 6 h the tests enabled the calculation of the nitrite removal rate i e r under varied nitrite concentrations i e s from 0 to 10 mg n l the apparent nitrite affinity of anammox bacteria k n o 2 a n was estimated via non linear least square regression of the monod equation r r m a x s n o 2 s n o 2 k n o 2 a n and the 95 confidence interval of k n o 2 a n was obtained through the in built model in prism graphpad v 8 0 san diego california the test for apparent nitrite affinity of n damo bacteria k n o 2 d b was performed in the same experimental set up with details described in si text s3 2 3 2 apparent methane affinities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea the apparent methane affinity of n damo bacteria was tested in the same system used in section 2 3 1 the system was continuously sparged with the mixture of pure methane and dinitrogen gas at different designed ratios this enabled to maintain a stable dissolved methane concentration at 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg ch4 l in six tests conducted in sequence at the beginning of each test sodium nitrite stock solution 1 g l was injected into the system to result in an initial nitrite concentration of 25 mg n l the nitrite consumption rate i e r was measured at each dissolved methane level i e s in triplicate the non linear least square regression of the monod equation was also used to determine the apparent methane affinity k c h 4 d b for n damo bacteria and the 95 confidence interval san diego california likewise the apparent methane kinetics of n damo archaea k was determined with similar methods with details described in si text s4 2 4 dna extraction rna extraction and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing biomass 0 5 g was collected at the end of each phase for dna

primers used in qpcr and rt qpcr were listed in table s2 of si and experiment details were described in text s5 of si 3 results and discussion 3 1 simultaneous removal of nitrogen and dissolved methane in long term operation 3 1 1 long term nitrogen removal performance the gsbr was operated for 295 days consisting of six phases table 1 and fig 2 the feasibility of removing dissolved methane using nitrite as the electron acceptor was examined in phases i iii while the feasibility of using nitrate as the electron acceptor to remove dissolved methane was tested in phases iv v with different influent nitrite to ammonium molar ratios in phases i iii 2 1 5 1 the system was robust in terms of stable tn removal efficiency of 99 and tn removal rate of 115 mg n l d at a fixed hrt of 12 h fig 2a and b these results indicate the capability of the gsbr to couple anammox and n damo microorganisms in coping with wastewater dynamics similar observations were also reported in biofilm systems which were able to maintain high level nitrogen removal when treating wastewater with different compositions xie et al 2018 in the system with only anammox bacteria nitrite and ammonium are removed following the reaction stoichiometry of 1 32 1 while any additional nitrite beyond this ratio will remain in effluent laureni et al 2015 meng et al 2021 reino and carrera 2017 based on the calculation of in situ microbial activities the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria gradually increased while the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria decreased fig 2c following the increase in nitrite to ammonium ratio in the feeding given the fact that real wastewater composition varies from time to time the robustness of gsbr coupling anammox bacteria and n damo microorganisms against dynamic feedings is a valuable feature in practical applications after replacing nitrite with nitrate as the electron acceptor in phase iv the hrt was prolonged to 24 h considering the relatively low nitrate removal rate achieved in phases i iii however the accumulations of ammonium of up to 5 mg n l and nitrate of up to 10 mg n l were still observed fig 2a leading to the drop of tn removal efficiency to 74 7 2 6 fig 2b with direct nitrate supply from the feed in phase iv the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea increased and reached an average of 26 7 mg n l d fig 2c aiming to improve the effluent quality the hrt was prolonged to 48 h in phase v leading to a lower nitrate loading rate of 20 mg n l d as this new nitrate loading rate was lower than the nitrate removal rate achieved in phase iv the nitrate accumulation in effluent was expected to disappear and the tn removal efficiency was expected to be enhanced nonetheless the average effluent nitrate concentration was still about 5 0 mg n l in phase v fig 2a while the tn removal efficiency only slightly increased to 84 4 1 6 fig 2b this disparity between expectation and experimental results indicates that the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea immediately decreased when the hrt was prolonged in phase v fig 2c as the nitrate concentration in phases iv and v was always 2 3 times higher than the nitrate affinity constant of n damo archaea 2 1 mg n l lu et al 2019 the activity of n damo archaea should be mainly affected by the concentration of dissolved methane which indeed decreased from 8 1 mg ch4 l in phase iv to 5 3 mg ch4 l in phase v in contrast to the sensitivity of n damo archaea to the dissolved methane concentration the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria increased when the dissolved methane concentration decreased from phase i to phase iii suggesting that the n damo bacteria activity was limited by nitrite concentration 1 mg n l instead of dissolved methane in the tested range 3 1 2 long term dissolved methane removal performance during the entire experiment the influent dissolved methane concentration was maintained at a constant level 19 0 0 8 mg ch4 l fig 2d with increased nitrite to ammonium ratio more electron acceptors were available for methane removal leading to the elevated total methane tm removal efficiency from 71 5 in phase i to 78 4 in phase ii and 93 4 in phase iii in phases i iii n damo bacteria primarily contributed to 87 95 of tm removal fig s1 with nitrate as the major electron acceptor the tm removal efficiency was determined to be 51 8 in phase iv and 63 5 in phase v during these two phases n damo archaea primarily contributed to tm removal 72 85 fig s1 based on the results of phases i v nitrite appeared to be a better electron acceptor for removing dissolved methane and ammonium in mainstream anaerobic effluent because of two reasons 1 the tn removal efficiency was stably above 99 and a good effluent quality 1 mg n l was achieved and 2 the nitrite dependent methane removal i e n damo bacteria was less affected by the decrease of dissolved methane driving dissolved methane to a lower level 1 mg ch4 l while maintaining the nitrogen removal rate based on these two reasons nitrite was selected as a preferred electron acceptor in phase vi to explore the rate boundary of the gsbr by reducing the hrt gradually at hrt of 12 h and 9 h the tn removal efficiency was maintained at high levels 99 however the tn removal efficiency dropped to 95 at the hrt of 6 h at the hrt of 6 12 h the tm removal efficiency was consistently maintained above 90 the highest tn and tm removal rates achieved were 251 4 mg n l d and 65 7 mg ch4 l d respectively at the hrt of 6 h fig s2 these rates were at the median level of rates achieved in previous systems with n damo microorganisms fu et al 2017 liu et al 2020b liu et al 2021b silva teira et al 2017 stultiens et al 2019 and meet the practical requirements in mainstream wastewater treatment gilbert et al 2014 lotti et al 2014 3 1 3 substrate variations in typical cycles cycle studies were performed in phases i v to assess the conversions of nitrogenous compounds and dissolved methane fig 3 taking the cycle of phase i as an example fig 3a the reaction time was divided into three sub periods based on the methane consumption rate i e the slope of methane profiles a proxy for the activities of n damo microorganisms in the presence of ammonium in the first period the nitrite was consumed together with ammonium while the decrease of dissolved methane was slow when the ammonium ran out in the second period dissolved methane started to be consumed at a higher rate accompanied by the nitrite consumption once nitrite was completely consumed dissolved methane remained stable in the third period these observations confirm the coupling of methane and nitrite removal and also suggest a shift of active microbial activities during a typical cycle specifically anammox bacteria actively removed nitrite and ammonium first while n damo bacteria contributed to the consumption of nitrite and dissolved methane afterwards a similar phenomenon was also observed in phases ii and iii both showing that anammox bacteria dominated over n damo bacteria in the presence of sufficient ammonium fig 3b and c there are two potential reasons for this observation firstly the nitrite affinity of anammox bacteria is generally considered higher than that of n damo bacteria as shown in previous studies guerrero cruz et al 2019 winkler et al 2015 and proved here in section 3 3 secondly n damo microorganisms were found to inhabit the inner layer of granules while anammox bacteria occupied the surface fan et al 2019 liu et al 2021a thus nitrite supplied from the bulk liquid was likely used by anammox bacteria first before penetrating into the inner layer of granules and being used by n damo bacteria another interesting phenomenon is that the anammox dominating period was shortened while the period driven by n damo microorganisms was prolonged from phase i to phase iii this was because of the increase in the molar ratio of nitrite to ammonium in the feeding from phase i to phase iii which was accompanied by a decreased effluent dissolved methane concentration 0 9 0 2 in phase iii versus 3 6 0 2 in phase i and 2 6 0 1 in phase ii despite that the dissolved methane load was identical in phases iv and v with nitrate as the electron acceptor ammonium nitrate and dissolved methane were consumed simultaneously while no nitrite accumulation occurred during the entire cycle nevertheless the removal of dissolved methane and nitrogenous compounds was not completed during the two hour cycle evidenced by 6 2 9 5 mg no3 n l and 5 2 7 7 mg ch4 l towards the end of the cycles this suggests that the microbial methane dependent nitrate removal i e n damo archaea was inadequate to completely remove the nitrogen at the tested dissolved methane concentration unlike the results in phases i iii with a clear shift of functional microbial reactions anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo jointly contributed to the consumption of nitrogenous compounds and dissolved methane during the entire cycle of phases iv and v this means that anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria can simultaneously obtain the nitrite generated from nitrate reduction by n damo archaea regardless the higher nitrite affinity of the former a potential explanation was associated with the microbial distribution along the granule radius which showed that n damo bacteria and n damo archaea clustered together in the inner layer while anammox bacteria occupied the surface fan et al 2019 liu et al 2021a thus a fraction of nitrite generated from nitrate reduction by n damo archaea might be directly cross fed to n damo bacteria due to the spatial proximity i e less diffusion resistance while the rest diffused to the outer layer and was consumed by anammox bacteria that have a higher nitrite affinity 3 2 effects of electron acceptors on microbial activities associated with methane and nitrogen removal 3 2 1 effects of electron acceptors on maximum microbial activities to further elucidate the effects of different electron acceptors nitrite and nitrate on nitrogen and methane removal rates ex situ batch tests were conducted at the end of each stage to monitor the maximum activities of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea fig 4 a these maximum activities measured by ex situ batch tests were generally higher than the in situ microbial activities fig 2c because of sufficient substrates provided in batch tests this also suggests the system s overcapacity in terms of nitrogen removal i e the in situ activity lower than the maximum activity which is a common feature also reported by other studies and might impart the system with certain robustness against the variation in wastewater compositions liu et al 2020a reino et al 2018 moreover the molar ratios of consumed ammonium to nitrite nitrite to methane and nitrate to methane accorded with the stoichiometry of anammox n damo bacteria and n damo archaea reactions respectively as a proxy for their dominances table s3 from phase i to phase iii with the gradually increased molar ratio of nitrite and ammonium there was a significant increase in the maximum activity of n damo bacteria p 0 05 while no significant change was observed for the maximum activity of n damo archaea p 0 05 fig 4a this indicates that the nitrite in feeding was a favourable electron acceptor for the enrichment of n damo bacteria while n damo archaea could also live on the limited nitrate produced by anammox bacteria and maintain their activities the existence of n damo archaea was also observed in other systems fed with ammonium nitrite and methane while no nitrate was intentionally provided nie et al 2020 xie et al 2018 additionally anammox bacteria activity slightly increased from phase i to phase iii p 0 05 although their in situ activity gradually decreased due to the change of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio during the long term experiment fig 2c interestingly the maximum activity of anammox bacteria showed no significant change even after replacing nitrite with nitrate in the feeding of phases iv and v p 0 05 this suggests that anammox bacteria can sustain in a system without direct nitrite supply and live on the nitrite produced by n damo archaea the only known population capable of producing nitrite from nitrate using methane as the electron donor haroon et al 2013 this microbial cooperation between anammox bacteria and n damo archaea was similar to the well established partial denitrification anammox pd a systems cao et al 2019 du et al 2019 sun et al 2022 wang et al 2022 zheng et al 2023 in which anammox bacteria also grow on the nitrite generated from partial denitrification i e nitrate to nitrite driven by traditional organic carbons e g acetate however the maximum activity of the other nitrite scavenger n damo bacteria significantly decreased in phase iv and v p 0 05 referring to their sensitivity to the nitrite supply as expected the maximum activity of n damo archaea that live on nitrate significantly increased in phase iv p 0 05 during which the nitrate loading rate was nearly four times of that in phases i iii in phase v the activities of all three functional populations decreased because of the halved nitrogen and dissolved methane loadings during the long term experiment in summary the microbial cooperation was found to be beneficial for the system to cope with different feedings with ammonium and nitrite in the feeding n damo archaea can endure the lack of nitrate by using the in situ nitrate produced from the anammox reaction to survive with ammonium and nitrate in the feeding n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria can also live on the nitrite generated from n damo archaea to sustain 3 2 2 effects of electron acceptors on abundances and expressions of functional genes to investigate the response of critical functional genes of anammox bacteria hzsa n damo bacteria pmoa and n damo archaea mcra to the change of electron acceptors qpcr was used to track the changes of their in situ abundances while rt qpcr was employed to monitor the variations of their in situ expressions first the abundance of hzsa gradually increased from phase i 3 6 109 copies per mg to phase iii 4 7 109 copies per mg which then significantly decreased in phase iv 3 1 109 copies per mg and v 2 5 109 copies per mg p 0 05 fig 4b this was in the same trend as that of the maximum activity of anammox bacteria fig 4a different to qpcr results the transcription expression of hzsa decreased from phase i 1 5 107 copies per mg to phase iii 1 4 106 copies per mg and from phase iv 3 5 106 copies per mg to phase v 1 7 106 copies per mg which was correlated with the observed variations in situ anammox activity fig 2c similarly the abundances of pmoa fig 4c and mcra fig 4d also agreed with the maximum activity of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea respectively fig 4a while the variation of their in situ expressions followed a similar trend with their in situ activities fig 2c these results clearly showed that the qpcr data more reflected the maximum microbial activities while the rt qpcr was more likely related to their in situ activities the expression ratio of hzsa pmoa and mcra was further calculated by normalizing the transcription of gene to the abundance of gene to assess the active functional communities fig 4e no significant difference was observed for the expression ratio of hzsa p 0 05 suggesting anammox bacteria were actively involved in all phases even in phase iv and v during which nitrite was not provided in the feeding but was produced by n damo archaea again this might be due to the high nitrite affinity of anammox bacteria winkler et al 2015 making them competitive in using nitrite provided regardless from the feeding or by n damo archaea differently the expression ratio of pmoa was significantly higher p 0 01 when using nitrite as the main electron acceptor phases i iii while the expression ratio of mcra was significantly higher p 0 01 when using nitrate as the main electron acceptor phases iv v this clearly showed the preference of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in using different electron acceptors for dissolved methane removal 3 2 3 microbial community structure in response to various electron acceptors microbial communities were revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at the end of phases i v fig 5 the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia a typical anammox genus in engineering systems chen et al 2020 oshiki et al 2016 decreased continuously from 15 2 of the entire community in phase i to 5 7 in phase v in contrast the n damo bacteria genus of candidatus methylomirabilis with known ability to couple nitrite reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation ettwig et al 2010 gradually increased from 3 0 of the entire community in phase i to 8 9 in phase v these results indicate a shift of dominating nitrite utilizers from anammox bacteria to n damo bacteria in the system removing dissolved methane a recent study showed that specific member of candidatus methylomirabilis may be also involved in the methane dependent nitrate reduction li et al 2023 furthermore the candidatus methanoperedens identified in the granules was affiliated with the euryarchaeota phylum which is recognized as the nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation archaea haroon et al 2013 the relative abundance of candidatus methanoperedens increased from 1 1 in phase i to 6 0 in phase iv and then decreased to 2 5 in phase v in the further comparison of three functional populations anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea the results showed a decreasing trend of anammox bacteria an and an increasing trend of n damo bacteria db while n damo archaea da peaked in phase iv and then decreased in phase v in summary the results showed the enrichment of n damo bacteria over anammox bacteria because of the high nitrite to ammonium ratio provided in the feeding it also confirmed the enrichment of n damo archaea in the conditions with either nitrite or nitrate provided from the feed again underpinning the proposed microbial cooperation moreover there were no aerobic nitrifiers or aerobic methanotrophs detected in the community in line with the absence of oxygen of note the trend of microbial relative abundances shown in fig 5 was not fully consistent with the qpcr results presented in fig 4 this could be partially due to the different recovery efficiencies of different primers and partially due to the fact that the qpcr data provide the absolute quantities while the amplicon sequencing reflects the relative abundances in consideration of the total community agrawal et al 2021 orschler et al 2019 therefore although qpcr and amplicon sequencing results generally supported each other it is difficult to directly compare the data obtained from these two different methods which described the microbial community from different perspectives 3 3 kinetics explained competitions among anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea the long term experiment and short term batch results both showed that different electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate significantly affected the removal performance of nitrogen and dissolved methane via regulating microbial competitions for example anammox bacteria appeared to be more competitive in nitrite utilization in comparison to n damo bacteria evidenced by the cycle studies fig 3a c likewise n damo bacteria appeared to have a higher affinity to methane than n damo archaea as the long term experiment and cycle studies both showed nitrite was a better electron acceptor for dissolved methane removal to explain the competition among anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea batch tests were performed at the end of the long term experiment to determine the crucial kinetics the apparent nitrite affinity of anammox bacteria was significantly higher than that of n damo bacteria 0 41 0 06 mg n l versus 2 85 0 38 mg n l fig 6 a and b this explains why the coupling of nitrite consumption and ammonium consumption i e anammox bacteria occurred prior to the consumption of dissolved methane and nitrite i e n damo bacteria fig 3a c also the result underpinned the observation that anammox bacteria dominated over n damo bacteria in phases iv v during which nitrite was a limiting substrate fig 2c of note the nitrite affinity constant of anammox bacteria was determined to be in a broad range from 0 05 mg n l to 5 mg n l in previous studies awata et al 2013 oshiki et al 2016 zheng et al 2023 this is because of either the various biomass aggregating types e g planktonic cells flocs biofilm and granules or the different anammox strains tested regarding the nitrite affinity constant of n damo bacteria the value obtained here 2 85 0 38 mg n l is higher than the reported values 0 1 0 6 mg n l in previous studies with the same methods as that used here the nitrite affinity of n damo bacteria was estimated to be 0 1 mg n l candidatus methylomirabilis lanthanidiphila guerrero cruz et al 2019 and 0 6 mg n l candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera winkler et al 2015 a potential reason is that these previous studies were conducted using floccular biomass while the present study used granular sludge as n damo bacteria mainly occupied the inner layer of granules fan et al 2019 liu et al 2021a the apparent nitrite affinity obtained here considered the diffusion resistance and thus should be lower than the affinities measured in systems with planktonic cells and flocs it should be noted that kinetics are not the only factor affecting microbial competition a recent study showed that the spatial arrangement of microorganisms in biofilms also played a role in their competition for shared substrates consequently affecting the removal of nitrogen and dissolved methane liu et al 2023 likewise the apparent methane affinity constant of n damo bacteria in granules was estimated to be 2 04 0 29 mg ch4 l higher than the reported values in previous studies using floccular biomass 0 04 1 47 mg ch4 l guerrero cruz et al 2019 he et al 2013 winkler et al 2015 notably the dependency of n damo archaea activity on dissolved methane concentration in the experimental range 20 mg ch4 l followed a first order equation instead of the traditional monod equation which was in accordance with a previous study using floccular biomass lu et al 2019 to be noted this conclusion is not against the monod equation from the mathematical perspective the monod based equation r r m a x s s k s can be transformed to the first order equation r k s when the substrate concentration is far lower than the affinity constant s k s thus the result suggests that 1 the apparent methane affinity of n damo archaea should be considerably higher than the highest dissolved methane concentration tested 20 mg ch4 l and 2 in the tested range of dissolved methane the n damo archaea activity was in a linear relationship with the dissolved methane concentration consequently the results clearly showed that the n damo archaea have a poorer affinity for methane than bacterial methane oxidizers likely because of their different methane activation enzymes particulate methane monooxygenases for bacterial methane oxidizers and methyl coenzyme m reductase for archaeal methane oxidizers ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 in view of applications the poor methane affinity indicates that n damo archaea are more sensitive to the variations in dissolved methane concentration for example in the presence of sufficient nitrate nitrite n damo bacteria activity calculated by r r m a x s c h 4 s c h 4 k c h 4 d b only decreases by 8 when the dissolved methane decreased from 20 to 10 mg ch4 l while the n damo archaea activity calculated by r k s c h 4 would dramatically decrease by 50 this well explains the immediate decrease of n damo archaea activity from 26 7 to 15 8 mg n l d when the dissolved methane concentration decreased from 8 1 in phase iv to 5 3 mg ch4 l in phase v fig 2c additionally this also provides another evidence to support the conclusion that nitrite is a better electron acceptor for dissolved methane removal specifically if the dissolved methane of below 1 mg ch4 l in the final effluent is targeted and electron acceptors nitrite and nitrate are sufficient the in situ n damo archaea activity and n damo bacteria activity should be 5 and 35 of their maximum activities achieved at the saturated dissolved methane of 20 mg ch4 l this means that the maximum activity of n damo archaea needs to be nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of n damo bacteria to both achieve the effluent dissolved methane of 1 mg ch4 l thus nitrite is a preferable electron acceptor for dissolved methane removal in practical applications 3 4 a new concept achieving cost efficient wastewater treatment with reduced greenhouse gas emission to facilitate achieving sustainable water management wastewater is now being considered more a resource than a waste a key resource within wastewater is organic carbon a carrier of chemical energy capturing energy from domestic wastewater has a long history especially through the anaerobic conversion of wastewater s organic contents into methane however the amount of energy recovered is small through side stream anaerobic sludge digestion representing less than 7 of the total chemical energy within wastewater mccarty et al 2011 smith et al 2014 the ongoing paradigm shift requires a completely new process design to enhance bioenergy recovery and to transform wwtps from a large energy consumer to an energy exporter one of the most promising configurations is the upfront conversion of organic carbon to methane using anaerobic microbial processes mccarty 2018 this configuration called mainstream bioenergy recovery as opposed to side stream bioenergy recovery from sludge digestion boosts a high energy yield and results in much less quantity of sludge thus of considerable interest to the water industry in the past decades promising results have been achieved to recover bioenergy from mainstream wastewater with pilot scale demonstrations and full scale applications lim et al 2023 van haandel et al 2006 nonetheless the limited organics in anaerobic effluent for downstream nitrogen removal and the emission of dissolved methane into the atmosphere are recognized as two major barriers to the mainstream bioenergy recovery as supplementing external organics will reduce the economic benefits the first challenge of restrained nitrogen removal in anaerobic effluent is expected to be solved using anammox based processes as anammox bacteria can remove nitrogen autotrophically cogert et al 2019 rong et al 2021 wu et al 2021 indeed the limited organics also favor the growth of anammox bacteria as fast growing heterotrophs may dominate over anammox bacteria in the presence of sufficient organics gilbert et al 2014 liu et al 2017 thus anammox based processes can well fit in the technical route implemented with upfront mainstream bioenergy recovery however the second challenge of dissolved methane remains to be addressed degassing of dissolved methane into the atmosphere no matter intentionally via the membrane based separation bandara et al 2011 cookney et al 2016 or unintentionally due to the liquid turbulence represents a substantial loss of bioenergy and a sharp increase in the carbon footprint some technologies such as membrane based separation processes have been trialed to recover methane from anaerobic effluent but the energy demand of the process increases significantly when the targeted dissolved methane concentration decreases as the separation is intrinsically governed by the concentration gradient crone et al 2016 li et al 2021 it is therefore practically difficult to reduce dissolved methane to below 5 mg l as a potent greenhouse gas ipcc 2021 the emission of dissolved methane at 5 mg l of wastewater would add 0 14 gco2 eq l to the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment representing 7 28 of the currently estimated carbon footprint of a wastewater treatment plant 0 5 2 0 gco2 eq l de haas et al 2014 this could partially explain the rare large scale applications of membrane based separation of dissolved methane despite extensive successful lab scale studies this study provided an alternative solution to remove dissolved methane from mainstream anaerobic wastewater compared to sole anammox systems the involvement of n damo microorganisms provides the system with the capability to remove dissolved methane with nitrite or nitrate recirculated from the oxic tank as electron acceptors fig 7 after introducing n damo microorganisms as additional functional populations in anammox granules the combined system can simultaneously remove nitrogen and dissolved methane in anaerobic effluent without the addition of any other organics with hindsight nitrite appears to be a better electron acceptor to achieve this aim because of two reasons first anammox bacteria that have a higher nitrite affinity will use nitrite in the feeding to remove ammonium with priority thus being able to drive ammonium and nitrite in effluent to an extremely low level 1 mg n l moreover n damo bacteria that use nitrite for methane removal have a higher methane affinity than n damo archaea that use nitrate for methane removal as per the need to drive dissolved methane to below 1 mg ch4 l the required maximum activity of n damo archaea is approximately one order higher than that of n damo bacteria since the maximum activity is usually related to the quantity of biomass this means that if targeting the same methane removal efficiency considerably more biomass will be needed when using nitrate as the electron acceptor than nitrite however an important question beyond the present study is that the mainstream nitritation is still a challenge and the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob requires specific operational strategies hu et al 2023 meng et al 2022 zheng et al 2023 additionally the residual organics in anaerobically treated wastewater and the presence of limited oxygen in recirculated nitrifying liquor may also affect the removal of dissolved methane and nitrogen in practice for example the residual organics may support heterotrophic denitrifiers potentially competing for nitrate nitrite with n damo microorganisms the high oxygen should be avoided as it would adversely affect anaerobic methane oxidizers but favourably support aerobic methanotrophs thus future studies are required to examine the effectiveness of this technology by treating real anaerobically treated wastewater still the proposed granules coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms add more operational flexibility to mainstream anammox systems to cope with wastewater dynamics and also provide a feasibility to make the best use of dissolved methane 4 conclusions this study developed a novel process for simultaneous removal of dissolved methane and nitrogen in low strength wastewater and unraveled the microbial interactions underpinning the process from the microbial and kinetic perspectives long term bioreactor operation and short term ex situ batch tests were conducted in conjunction with the determination of kinetics and diverse microbial analyses the key conclusions include dissolved methane and nitrogenous compounds in mainstream anaerobic effluent can be removed simultaneously by granules coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms the nitrogen and dissolved methane removal rates achieved meet the requirement of mainstream wastewater treatment in practice the type of electron acceptors nitrite vs nitrate incurs significant effects on the removal of ammonium and dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent the maximum microbial activities abundance and expression of functional genes and microbial communities nitrite is a favourable electron acceptor for the removal of ammonium and dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent this study also highlights the important role of microbial competition and cooperation the microbial competition affects the overall nitrogen and methane removal performance which is mainly governed by microbial kinetics the cooperation results in a more stable microbial guild against wastewater dynamics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14633,anaerobic treatment of mainstream wastewater has been proposed as a promising solution to enhance bioenergy recovery for wastewater treatment plants wwtps however the limited organics for downstream nitrogen removal and emissions of dissolved methane into the atmosphere are two major barriers to the broad application of anaerobic wastewater treatment this study aims to develop a novel technology to overcome these two challenges by achieving simultaneous removal of dissolved methane and nitrogen and unravel the microbial competitions underpinning the process from the microbial and kinetic perspectives to this end a laboratory granule based sequencing batch reactor gsbr coupling anammox and nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo microorganisms was developed to treat wastewater mimicking effluent from mainstream anaerobic treatment the gsbr achieved high level nitrogen and dissolved methane removal rates 250 mg n l d and 65 mg ch4 l d and efficiencies 99 total nitrogen removal and 90 total methane removal during the long term demonstration the availability of different electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate imposed significant effects on the removal of ammonium and dissolved methane as well as on the microbial communities and the abundance and expression of functional genes the analysis of apparent microbial kinetics showed that anammox bacteria had a higher nitrite affinity than n damo bacteria while n damo bacteria had a higher methane affinity than n damo archaea these kinetics underpin the observation that nitrite is a preferred electron acceptor for removing ammonium and dissolved methane than nitrate the findings not only extend the applications of novel n damo microorganisms in nitrogen and dissolved methane removal but also provide insights into microbial cooperation and competition in granular systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction recently the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc released its sixth assessment report ar6 making an urgent warning against the global climate change ipcc 2021 as the second most significant contributor to global warming methane emitted from anthropogenic sources is a significant concern due to the high global warming potential i e 29 8 11 and 27 2 11 times that of carbon dioxide for fossil and non fossil ch4 respectively over a 100 year horizon apart from emissions from fossil fuel and agriculture sectors methane emission in wastewater treatment is another significant input to the global methane budget generally methane is produced in anaerobic processes via the bacterial decomposition of organic matters in wastewater and sludge considering the potential for enhancing bioenergy recovery the implementation of anaerobic treatment has been growing rapidly in the past few decades crone et al 2016 mccarty 2018 contrary to the goal of recovering methane in the gas phase a fraction of up to 60 of total methane generated is dissolved in the wastewater 10 30 mg ch4 l vela et al 2015 which is stripped into the atmosphere by aeration another problem associated with mainstream anaerobic treatment is the lack of organic carbon for conventional biological nitrogen removal since 60 80 of organic carbon has been converted to methane prior to nitrogen removal crone et al 2016 to achieve high level nitrogen removal external carbon sources are needed which compromises the benefits achieved by bioenergy recovery these two issues could be simultaneously addressed with the use of microbial consortia capable of performing denitrification using methane as a carbon source ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 in such microbial guilds methane supported nitrate removal reaction 1 and methane supported nitrite removal reaction 2 could be conducted by an archaeal haroon et al 2013 and a bacterial group ettwig et al 2010 respectively these two microbial groups are named after their

single reactor allegue et al 2018 boosted up the nitrite removal rate to above 100 mg n l d in a membrane bioreactor with complete retention of biomass fan et al 2019 applied a granular bioreactor which realized a high nitrogen removal rate of 16 5 kg n m3 d very recently dissolved methane in anaerobic effluent has been proposed as another source of methane to support nitrogen removal cai et al 2021 shi et al 2021 this shift in concept is novel and significant it proposes new scenarios for the application of n damo microorganisms potentially solving the two problems associated with anaerobic wastewater treatment as identified above this study aims to develop a novel process to achieve the simultaneous removal of dissolved methane and nitrogen and to unravel microbial interactions underpinning the process for these aims a laboratory granule based sequencing batch reactor gsbr was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of removing different nitrogenous compounds in mainstream anaerobic wastewater using dissolved methane the microbial responses to different electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate were systematically revealed by the combination of ex situ batch tests real time quantitative pcr qpcr reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the apparent kinetics of functional microorganisms were uncovered by independent batch tests to reveal the kinetic mechanisms behind microbial competitions this study not only extended the applications of n damo microorganisms in nitrogen and dissolved methane removal from wastewater but also provided important insights into the fundamental understanding of microbial interactions between anammox and n damo organisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration operation and monitoring a lab scale gsbr with a total working volume of 2 l was established fig 1 a the seeding sludge was taken from a granular upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb in which methane gas was continuously supplied to support nitrogen removal liu et al 2021a the bulk liquid was recirculated from the top to the bottom by a peristaltic pump longer pump china at the upflow rate of 4 5 m h the ph was monitored by a meter oakton australia which was stable at 7 0 0 5 throughout the experiment the reactor was operated in a temperature controlled lab 22 c the synthetic wastewater was deoxygenated with nitrogen gas when prepared and stored in a 10 l feed tank two bunches of hollow fiber membrane 200 μm of inner diameter and 300 μm of outer diameter mitsubishi japan connected to the compressed methane pipeline were installed in the feed tank to dissolve methane efficiently thus mimicking the effluent of anaerobic processes with dissolved methane concentration of 18 20 mg ch4 l to maintain the pressure in the feed tank and to avoid oxygen contamination a 10 l gas bag tedlar australia filled with methane gas was connected to the feed tank the influent nitrogen compositions are summarized in table 1 while trace elements in the growth medium are summarized in table s1 the feeding with dissolved methane and nitrogenous compounds was transferred to the gsbr by a peristaltic pump bt300 2 j longer china the total cycle time of gsbr was fixed at 2 h i e 12 cycles a day the exchange ratio volume of effluent discharged in each cycle divided by the total working volume was designed to be 0 04 0 33 giving rise to a hydraulic retention time hrt in the range of 6 48 h table 1 each cycle consisted of 104 min of reaction phase 5 min of settling phase 1 min of decanting phase and 10 min of feeding phase fig 1b the settling time of 5 min was selected according to the measured sludge volume index svi5 32 2 ml g so that the majority of granules can be retained in the reactor and the suspended solid in effluent was below 0 01 g l the granular sludge was relatively stable during the experiment the volatile suspended solids vss was determined to be approximately 10 5 2 1 g l while the svi5 and svi30 were 28 3 and 30 5 ml g respectively the long term experiment consisted of six phases for a total of 295 days table 1 to mimic mainstream domestic sewage the tn concentration was fixed at 60 mg n l throughout the experiment to identify the impacts of different types and amounts of electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate on the removal of ammonium and dissolved methane in anaerobic effluent nitrite was added in the feeding at different concentrations from phase i to phase iii while nitrate was added from phase iv to phase v the hrt was prolonged from 12 h in phases i iii to 24 h in phase iv and 48 h in phase v corresponding to an influent flow of 1 4 l d based on the overall nitrogen and methane removal performance see details in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 nitrite appeared to be a better electron acceptor for ammonium and dissolved methane removal which was selected in phase vi to explore the boundary of the system the hrt was gradually decreased to 6 h in phase vi the concentrations of nitrate nitrite ammonium and dissolved methane in the effluent of the gsbr were measured two to three times a week the chemical analytical methods are described in text s1 of supplementary information si cycle studies in the gsbr were performed in each phase by analysing nitrate nitrite ammonium and dissolved methane concentrations every 10 min in a typical cycle 2 2 determination of activities of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea 2 2 1 in situ activity determination the in situ activities of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were calculated during the long term experiment the volumetric removal rates of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were first determined according to the influent and effluent nitrogen compositions and the applied hrt based on the reaction stoichiometry the nitrite removal rate of anammox bacteria ran nitrite removal rate of n damo bacteria rdb and nitrate removal rate of n damo archaea rda were calculated accordingly more details for the calculation of in situ microbial activities can be found in text s2 in si 2 2 2 ex situ activity determination at the end of each phase 100 ml biomass was transferred to 150 ml serum bottles to determine the maximum activities of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea separately specifically the first bottle was flushed with helium gas for 3 min to form an anoxic condition afterwards the sodium nitrite 1 g l and ammonium chloride 1 g l stock solutions were dosed into the bottle leading to initial nitrite and ammonium concentrations of 20 mg n l respectively the maximum anammox activity ran max was represented as the volumetric nitrite removal rate the second bottle and the third bottle were both flushed with pure methane gas for 5 min giving rise to an initial dissolved methane concentration of 20 mg ch4 l then the sodium nitrite 1 g l was dosed into the second bottle to reach an initial nitrite concentration of 20 mg n l while the sodium nitrate 1 g l was dosed into the third bottle to reach an initial nitrate concentration of 20 mg n l the maximum n damo bacteria activity rdb max was determined as the volumetric nitrite removal rate and the maximum n damo archaea activity rda max was determined as the volumetric nitrate removal rate each test lasted for 60 min and was performed in triplicate liquid samples were collected every 15 min to determine the variations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and dissolved methane 2 3 determination of apparent substrate affinities 2 3 1 apparent nitrite affinities of anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria after the long term experiment 200 ml intact granular biomass was collected by a 500 ml glass bottle to determine the apparent nitrite affinities of anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria the test for anammox apparent nitrite affinity was performed with the initial ammonium concentration of 100 mg n l the culture was flushed with pure helium for 5 min to form a completely anoxic condition the initial nitrite concentration was raised to 10 mg n l by adding a nitrite stock solution 1 g l the test was carried out until the nitrite concentration decreased to zero and the liquid samples were taken every 20 min for 6 h the tests enabled the calculation of the nitrite removal rate i e r under varied nitrite concentrations i e s from 0 to 10 mg n l the apparent nitrite affinity of anammox bacteria k n o 2 a n was estimated via non linear least square regression of the monod equation r r m a x s n o 2 s n o 2 k n o 2 a n and the 95 confidence interval of k n o 2 a n was obtained through the in built model in prism graphpad v 8 0 san diego california the test for apparent nitrite affinity of n damo bacteria k n o 2 d b was performed in the same experimental set up with details described in si text s3 2 3 2 apparent methane affinities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea the apparent methane affinity of n damo bacteria was tested in the same system used in section 2 3 1 the system was continuously sparged with the mixture of pure methane and dinitrogen gas at different designed ratios this enabled to maintain a stable dissolved methane concentration at 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg ch4 l in six tests conducted in sequence at the beginning of each test sodium nitrite stock solution 1 g l was injected into the system to result in an initial nitrite concentration of 25 mg n l the nitrite consumption rate i e r was measured at each dissolved methane level i e s in triplicate the non linear least square regression of the monod equation was also used to determine the apparent methane affinity k c h 4 d b for n damo bacteria and the 95 confidence interval san diego california likewise the apparent methane kinetics of n damo archaea k was determined with similar methods with details described in si text s4 2 4 dna extraction rna extraction and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing biomass 0 5 g was collected at the end of each phase for dna extraction using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa rna of granular samples collected at the end of each phase was extracted using rneasy mini kit qiagen and reverse transcription was performed using quantitect reverse transcription kit qiagen the 16s rrna gene amplification sequencing and analysis were performed following the procedures described in liu et al

primers used in qpcr and rt qpcr were listed in table s2 of si and experiment details were described in text s5 of si 3 results and discussion 3 1 simultaneous removal of nitrogen and dissolved methane in long term operation 3 1 1 long term nitrogen removal performance the gsbr was operated for 295 days consisting of six phases table 1 and fig 2 the feasibility of removing dissolved methane using nitrite as the electron acceptor was examined in phases i iii while the feasibility of using nitrate as the electron acceptor to remove dissolved methane was tested in phases iv v with different influent nitrite to ammonium molar ratios in phases i iii 2 1 5 1 the system was robust in terms of stable tn removal efficiency of 99 and tn removal rate of 115 mg n l d at a fixed hrt of 12 h fig 2a and b these results indicate the capability of the gsbr to couple anammox and n damo microorganisms in coping with wastewater dynamics similar observations were also reported in biofilm systems which were able to maintain high level nitrogen removal when treating wastewater with different compositions xie et al 2018 in the system with only anammox bacteria nitrite and ammonium are removed following the reaction stoichiometry of 1 32 1 while any additional nitrite beyond this ratio will remain in effluent laureni et al 2015 meng et al 2021 reino and carrera 2017 based on the calculation of in situ microbial activities the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria gradually increased while the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria decreased fig 2c following the increase in nitrite to ammonium ratio in the feeding given the fact that real wastewater composition varies from time to time the robustness of gsbr coupling anammox bacteria and n damo microorganisms against dynamic feedings is a valuable feature in practical applications after replacing nitrite with nitrate as the electron acceptor in phase iv the hrt was prolonged to 24 h considering the relatively low nitrate removal rate achieved in phases i iii however the accumulations of ammonium of up to 5 mg n l and nitrate of up to 10 mg n l were still observed fig 2a leading to the drop of tn removal efficiency to 74 7 2 6 fig 2b with direct nitrate supply from the feed in phase iv the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea increased and reached an average of 26 7 mg n l d fig 2c aiming to improve the effluent quality the hrt was prolonged to 48 h in phase v leading to a lower nitrate loading rate of 20 mg n l d as this new nitrate loading rate was lower than the nitrate removal rate achieved in phase iv the nitrate accumulation in effluent was expected to disappear and the tn removal efficiency was expected to be enhanced nonetheless the average effluent nitrate concentration was still about 5 0 mg n l in phase v fig 2a while the tn removal efficiency only slightly increased to 84 4 1 6 fig 2b this disparity between expectation and experimental results indicates that the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea immediately decreased when the hrt was prolonged in phase v fig 2c as the nitrate concentration in phases iv and v was always 2 3 times higher than the nitrate affinity constant of n damo archaea 2 1 mg n l lu et al 2019 the activity of n damo archaea should be mainly affected by the concentration of dissolved methane which indeed decreased from 8 1 mg ch4 l in phase iv to 5 3 mg ch4 l in phase v in contrast to the sensitivity of n damo archaea to the dissolved methane concentration the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria increased when the dissolved methane concentration decreased from phase i to phase iii suggesting that the n damo bacteria activity was limited by nitrite concentration 1 mg n l instead of dissolved methane in the tested range 3 1 2 long term dissolved methane removal performance during the entire experiment the influent dissolved methane concentration was maintained at a constant level 19 0 0 8 mg ch4 l fig 2d with increased nitrite to ammonium ratio more electron acceptors were available for methane removal leading to the elevated total methane tm removal efficiency from 71 5 in phase i to 78 4 in phase ii and 93 4 in phase iii in phases i iii n damo bacteria primarily contributed to 87 95 of tm removal fig s1 with nitrate as the major electron acceptor the tm removal efficiency was determined to be 51 8 in phase iv and 63 5 in phase v during these two phases n damo archaea primarily contributed to tm removal 72 85 fig s1 based on the results of phases i v nitrite appeared to be a better electron acceptor for removing dissolved methane and ammonium in mainstream anaerobic effluent because of two reasons 1 the tn removal efficiency was stably above 99 and a good effluent quality 1 mg n l was achieved and 2 the nitrite dependent methane removal i e n damo bacteria was less affected by the decrease of dissolved methane driving dissolved methane to a lower level 1 mg ch4 l while maintaining the nitrogen removal rate based on these two reasons nitrite was selected as a preferred electron acceptor in phase vi to explore the rate boundary of the gsbr by reducing the hrt gradually at hrt of 12 h and 9 h the tn removal efficiency was maintained at high levels 99 however the tn removal efficiency dropped to 95 at the hrt of 6 h at the hrt of 6 12 h the tm removal efficiency was consistently maintained above 90 the highest tn and tm removal rates achieved were 251 4 mg n l d and 65 7 mg ch4 l d respectively at the hrt of 6 h fig s2 these rates were at the median level of rates achieved in previous systems with n damo microorganisms fu et al 2017 liu et al 2020b liu et al 2021b silva teira et al 2017 stultiens et al 2019 and meet the practical requirements in mainstream wastewater treatment gilbert et al 2014 lotti et al 2014 3 1 3 substrate variations in typical cycles cycle studies were performed in phases i v to assess the conversions of nitrogenous compounds and dissolved methane fig 3 taking the cycle of phase i as an example fig 3a the reaction time was divided into three sub periods based on the methane consumption rate i e the slope of methane profiles a proxy for the activities of n damo microorganisms in the presence of ammonium in the first period the nitrite was consumed together with ammonium while the decrease of dissolved methane was slow when the ammonium ran out in the second period dissolved methane started to be consumed at a higher rate accompanied by the nitrite consumption once nitrite was completely consumed dissolved methane remained stable in the third period these observations confirm the coupling of methane and nitrite removal and also suggest a shift of active microbial activities during a typical cycle specifically anammox bacteria actively removed nitrite and ammonium first while n damo bacteria contributed to the consumption of nitrite and dissolved methane afterwards a similar phenomenon was also observed in phases ii and iii both showing that anammox bacteria dominated over n damo bacteria in the presence of sufficient ammonium fig 3b and c there are two potential reasons for this observation firstly the nitrite affinity of anammox bacteria is generally considered higher than that of n damo bacteria as shown in previous studies guerrero cruz et al 2019 winkler et al 2015 and proved here in section 3 3 secondly n damo microorganisms were found to inhabit the inner layer of granules while anammox bacteria occupied the surface fan et al 2019 liu et al 2021a thus nitrite supplied from the bulk liquid was likely used by anammox bacteria first before penetrating into the inner layer of granules and being used by n damo bacteria another interesting phenomenon is that the anammox dominating period was shortened while the period driven by n damo microorganisms was prolonged from phase i to phase iii this was because of the increase in the molar ratio of nitrite to ammonium in the feeding from phase i to phase iii which was accompanied by a decreased effluent dissolved methane concentration 0 9 0 2 in phase iii versus 3 6 0 2 in phase i and 2 6 0 1 in phase ii despite that the dissolved methane load was identical in phases iv and v with nitrate as the electron acceptor ammonium nitrate and dissolved methane were consumed simultaneously while no nitrite accumulation occurred during the entire cycle nevertheless the removal of dissolved methane and nitrogenous compounds was not completed during the two hour cycle evidenced by 6 2 9 5 mg no3 n l and 5 2 7 7 mg ch4 l towards the end of the cycles this suggests that the microbial methane dependent nitrate removal i e n damo archaea was inadequate to completely remove the nitrogen at the tested dissolved methane concentration unlike the results in phases i iii with a clear shift of functional microbial reactions anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo jointly contributed to the consumption of nitrogenous compounds and dissolved methane during the entire cycle of phases iv and v this means that anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria can simultaneously obtain the nitrite generated from nitrate reduction by n damo archaea regardless the higher nitrite affinity of the former a potential explanation was associated with the microbial distribution along the granule radius which showed that n damo bacteria and n damo archaea clustered together in the inner layer while anammox bacteria occupied the surface fan et al 2019 liu et al 2021a thus a fraction of nitrite generated from nitrate reduction by n damo archaea might be directly cross fed to n damo bacteria due to the spatial proximity i e less diffusion resistance while the rest diffused to the outer layer and was consumed by anammox bacteria that have a higher nitrite affinity 3 2 effects of electron acceptors on microbial activities associated with methane and nitrogen removal 3 2 1 effects of electron acceptors on maximum microbial activities to further elucidate the effects of different electron acceptors nitrite and nitrate on nitrogen and methane removal rates ex situ batch tests were conducted at the end of each stage to monitor the maximum activities of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea fig 4 a these maximum activities measured by ex situ batch tests were generally higher than the in situ microbial activities fig 2c because of sufficient substrates provided in batch tests this also suggests the system s overcapacity in terms of nitrogen removal i e the in situ activity lower than the maximum activity which is a common feature also reported by other studies and might impart the system with certain robustness against the variation in wastewater compositions liu et al 2020a reino et al 2018 moreover the molar ratios of consumed ammonium to nitrite nitrite to methane and nitrate to methane accorded with the stoichiometry of anammox n damo bacteria and n damo archaea reactions respectively as a proxy for their dominances table s3 from phase i to phase iii with the gradually increased molar ratio of nitrite and ammonium there was a significant increase in the maximum activity of n damo bacteria p 0 05 while no significant change was observed for the maximum activity of n damo archaea p 0 05 fig 4a this indicates that the nitrite in feeding was a favourable electron acceptor for the enrichment of n damo bacteria while n damo archaea could also live on the limited nitrate produced by anammox bacteria and maintain their activities the existence of n damo archaea was also observed in other systems fed with ammonium nitrite and methane while no nitrate was intentionally provided nie et al 2020 xie et al 2018 additionally anammox bacteria activity slightly increased from phase i to phase iii p 0 05 although their in situ activity gradually decreased due to the change of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio during the long term experiment fig 2c interestingly the maximum activity of anammox bacteria showed no significant change even after replacing nitrite with nitrate in the feeding of phases iv and v p 0 05 this suggests that anammox bacteria can sustain in a system without direct nitrite supply and live on the nitrite produced by n damo archaea the only known population capable of producing nitrite from nitrate using methane as the electron donor haroon et al 2013 this microbial cooperation between anammox bacteria and n damo archaea was similar to the well established partial denitrification anammox pd a systems cao et al 2019 du et al 2019 sun et al 2022 wang et al 2022 zheng et al 2023 in which anammox bacteria also grow on the nitrite generated from partial denitrification i e nitrate to nitrite driven by traditional organic carbons e g acetate however the maximum activity of the other nitrite scavenger n damo bacteria significantly decreased in phase iv and v p 0 05 referring to their sensitivity to the nitrite supply as expected the maximum activity of n damo archaea that live on nitrate significantly increased in phase iv p 0 05 during which the nitrate loading rate was nearly four times of that in phases i iii in phase v the activities of all three functional populations decreased because of the halved nitrogen and dissolved methane loadings during the long term experiment in summary the microbial cooperation was found to be beneficial for the system to cope with different feedings with ammonium and nitrite in the feeding n damo archaea can endure the lack of nitrate by using the in situ nitrate produced from the anammox reaction to survive with ammonium and nitrate in the feeding n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria can also live on the nitrite generated from n damo archaea to sustain 3 2 2 effects of electron acceptors on abundances and expressions of functional genes to investigate the response of critical functional genes of anammox bacteria hzsa n damo bacteria pmoa and n damo archaea mcra to the change of electron acceptors qpcr was used to track the changes of their in situ abundances while rt qpcr was employed to monitor the variations of their in situ expressions first the abundance of hzsa gradually increased from phase i 3 6 109 copies per mg to phase iii 4 7 109 copies per mg which then significantly decreased in phase iv 3 1 109 copies per mg and v 2 5 109 copies per mg p 0 05 fig 4b this was in the same trend as that of the maximum activity of anammox bacteria fig 4a different to qpcr results the transcription expression of hzsa decreased from phase i 1 5 107 copies per mg to phase iii 1 4 106 copies per mg and from phase iv 3 5 106 copies per mg to phase v 1 7 106 copies per mg which was correlated with the observed variations in situ anammox activity fig 2c similarly the abundances of pmoa fig 4c and mcra fig 4d also agreed with the maximum activity of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea respectively fig 4a while the variation of their in situ expressions followed a similar trend with their in situ activities fig 2c these results clearly showed that the qpcr data more reflected the maximum microbial activities while the rt qpcr was more likely related to their in situ activities the expression ratio of hzsa pmoa and mcra was further calculated by normalizing the transcription of gene to the abundance of gene to assess the active functional communities fig 4e no significant difference was observed for the expression ratio of hzsa p 0 05 suggesting anammox bacteria were actively involved in all phases even in phase iv and v during which nitrite was not provided in the feeding but was produced by n damo archaea again this might be due to the high nitrite affinity of anammox bacteria winkler et al 2015 making them competitive in using nitrite provided regardless from the feeding or by n damo archaea differently the expression ratio of pmoa was significantly higher p 0 01 when using nitrite as the main electron acceptor phases i iii while the expression ratio of mcra was significantly higher p 0 01 when using nitrate as the main electron acceptor phases iv v this clearly showed the preference of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in using different electron acceptors for dissolved methane removal 3 2 3 microbial community structure in response to various electron acceptors microbial communities were revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at the end of phases i v fig 5 the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia a typical anammox genus in engineering systems chen et al 2020 oshiki et al 2016 decreased continuously from 15 2 of the entire community in phase i to 5 7 in phase v in contrast the n damo bacteria genus of candidatus methylomirabilis with known ability to couple nitrite reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation ettwig et al 2010 gradually increased from 3 0 of the entire community in phase i to 8 9 in phase v these results indicate a shift of dominating nitrite utilizers from anammox bacteria to n damo bacteria in the system removing dissolved methane a recent study showed that specific member of candidatus methylomirabilis may be also involved in the methane dependent nitrate reduction li et al 2023 furthermore the candidatus methanoperedens identified in the granules was affiliated with the euryarchaeota phylum which is recognized as the nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation archaea haroon et al 2013 the relative abundance of candidatus methanoperedens increased from 1 1 in phase i to 6 0 in phase iv and then decreased to 2 5 in phase v in the further comparison of three functional populations anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea the results showed a decreasing trend of anammox bacteria an and an increasing trend of n damo bacteria db while n damo archaea da peaked in phase iv and then decreased in phase v in summary the results showed the enrichment of n damo bacteria over anammox bacteria because of the high nitrite to ammonium ratio provided in the feeding it also confirmed the enrichment of n damo archaea in the conditions with either nitrite or nitrate provided from the feed again underpinning the proposed microbial cooperation moreover there were no aerobic nitrifiers or aerobic methanotrophs detected in the community in line with the absence of oxygen of note the trend of microbial relative abundances shown in fig 5 was not fully consistent with the qpcr results presented in fig 4 this could be partially due to the different recovery efficiencies of different primers and partially due to the fact that the qpcr data provide the absolute quantities while the amplicon sequencing reflects the relative abundances in consideration of the total community agrawal et al 2021 orschler et al 2019 therefore although qpcr and amplicon sequencing results generally supported each other it is difficult to directly compare the data obtained from these two different methods which described the microbial community from different perspectives 3 3 kinetics explained competitions among anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea the long term experiment and short term batch results both showed that different electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate significantly affected the removal performance of nitrogen and dissolved methane via regulating microbial competitions for example anammox bacteria appeared to be more competitive in nitrite utilization in comparison to n damo bacteria evidenced by the cycle studies fig 3a c likewise n damo bacteria appeared to have a higher affinity to methane than n damo archaea as the long term experiment and cycle studies both showed nitrite was a better electron acceptor for dissolved methane removal to explain the competition among anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea batch tests were performed at the end of the long term experiment to determine the crucial kinetics the apparent nitrite affinity of anammox bacteria was significantly higher than that of n damo bacteria 0 41 0 06 mg n l versus 2 85 0 38 mg n l fig 6 a and b this explains why the coupling of nitrite consumption and ammonium consumption i e anammox bacteria occurred prior to the consumption of dissolved methane and nitrite i e n damo bacteria fig 3a c also the result underpinned the observation that anammox bacteria dominated over n damo bacteria in phases iv v during which nitrite was a limiting substrate fig 2c of note the nitrite affinity constant of anammox bacteria was determined to be in a broad range from 0 05 mg n l to 5 mg n l in previous studies awata et al 2013 oshiki et al 2016 zheng et al 2023 this is because of either the various biomass aggregating types e g planktonic cells flocs biofilm and granules or the different anammox strains tested regarding the nitrite affinity constant of n damo bacteria the value obtained here 2 85 0 38 mg n l is higher than the reported values 0 1 0 6 mg n l in previous studies with the same methods as that used here the nitrite affinity of n damo bacteria was estimated to be 0 1 mg n l candidatus methylomirabilis lanthanidiphila guerrero cruz et al 2019 and 0 6 mg n l candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera winkler et al 2015 a potential reason is that these previous studies were conducted using floccular biomass while the present study used granular sludge as n damo bacteria mainly occupied the inner layer of granules fan et al 2019 liu et al 2021a the apparent nitrite affinity obtained here considered the diffusion resistance and thus should be lower than the affinities measured in systems with planktonic cells and flocs it should be noted that kinetics are not the only factor affecting microbial competition a recent study showed that the spatial arrangement of microorganisms in biofilms also played a role in their competition for shared substrates consequently affecting the removal of nitrogen and dissolved methane liu et al 2023 likewise the apparent methane affinity constant of n damo bacteria in granules was estimated to be 2 04 0 29 mg ch4 l higher than the reported values in previous studies using floccular biomass 0 04 1 47 mg ch4 l guerrero cruz et al 2019 he et al 2013 winkler et al 2015 notably the dependency of n damo archaea activity on dissolved methane concentration in the experimental range 20 mg ch4 l followed a first order equation instead of the traditional monod equation which was in accordance with a previous study using floccular biomass lu et al 2019 to be noted this conclusion is not against the monod equation from the mathematical perspective the monod based equation r r m a x s s k s can be transformed to the first order equation r k s when the substrate concentration is far lower than the affinity constant s k s thus the result suggests that 1 the apparent methane affinity of n damo archaea should be considerably higher than the highest dissolved methane concentration tested 20 mg ch4 l and 2 in the tested range of dissolved methane the n damo archaea activity was in a linear relationship with the dissolved methane concentration consequently the results clearly showed that the n damo archaea have a poorer affinity for methane than bacterial methane oxidizers likely because of their different methane activation enzymes particulate methane monooxygenases for bacterial methane oxidizers and methyl coenzyme m reductase for archaeal methane oxidizers ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 in view of applications the poor methane affinity indicates that n damo archaea are more sensitive to the variations in dissolved methane concentration for example in the presence of sufficient nitrate nitrite n damo bacteria activity calculated by r r m a x s c h 4 s c h 4 k c h 4 d b only decreases by 8 when the dissolved methane decreased from 20 to 10 mg ch4 l while the n damo archaea activity calculated by r k s c h 4 would dramatically decrease by 50 this well explains the immediate decrease of n damo archaea activity from 26 7 to 15 8 mg n l d when the dissolved methane concentration decreased from 8 1 in phase iv to 5 3 mg ch4 l in phase v fig 2c additionally this also provides another evidence to support the conclusion that nitrite is a better electron acceptor for dissolved methane removal specifically if the dissolved methane of below 1 mg ch4 l in the final effluent is targeted and electron acceptors nitrite and nitrate are sufficient the in situ n damo archaea activity and n damo bacteria activity should be 5 and 35 of their maximum activities achieved at the saturated dissolved methane of 20 mg ch4 l this means that the maximum activity of n damo archaea needs to be nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of n damo bacteria to both achieve the effluent dissolved methane of 1 mg ch4 l thus nitrite is a preferable electron acceptor for dissolved methane removal in practical applications 3 4 a new concept achieving cost efficient wastewater treatment with reduced greenhouse gas emission to facilitate achieving sustainable water management wastewater is now being considered more a resource than a waste a key resource within wastewater is organic carbon a carrier of chemical energy capturing energy from domestic wastewater has a long history especially through the anaerobic conversion of wastewater s organic contents into methane however the amount of energy recovered is small through side stream anaerobic sludge digestion representing less than 7 of the total chemical energy within wastewater mccarty et al 2011 smith et al 2014 the ongoing paradigm shift requires a completely new process design to enhance bioenergy recovery and to transform wwtps from a large energy consumer to an energy exporter one of the most promising configurations is the upfront conversion of organic carbon to methane using anaerobic microbial processes mccarty 2018 this configuration called mainstream bioenergy recovery as opposed to side stream bioenergy recovery from sludge digestion boosts a high energy yield and results in much less quantity of sludge thus of considerable interest to the water industry in the past decades promising results have been achieved to recover bioenergy from mainstream wastewater with pilot scale demonstrations and full scale applications lim et al 2023 van haandel et al 2006 nonetheless the limited organics in anaerobic effluent for downstream nitrogen removal and the emission of dissolved methane into the atmosphere are recognized as two major barriers to the mainstream bioenergy recovery as supplementing external organics will reduce the economic benefits the first challenge of restrained nitrogen removal in anaerobic effluent is expected to be solved using anammox based processes as anammox bacteria can remove nitrogen autotrophically cogert et al 2019 rong et al 2021 wu et al 2021 indeed the limited organics also favor the growth of anammox bacteria as fast growing heterotrophs may dominate over anammox bacteria in the presence of sufficient organics gilbert et al 2014 liu et al 2017 thus anammox based processes can well fit in the technical route implemented with upfront mainstream bioenergy recovery however the second challenge of dissolved methane remains to be addressed degassing of dissolved methane into the atmosphere no matter intentionally via the membrane based separation bandara et al 2011 cookney et al 2016 or unintentionally due to the liquid turbulence represents a substantial loss of bioenergy and a sharp increase in the carbon footprint some technologies such as membrane based separation processes have been trialed to recover methane from anaerobic effluent but the energy demand of the process increases significantly when the targeted dissolved methane concentration decreases as the separation is intrinsically governed by the concentration gradient crone et al 2016 li et al 2021 it is therefore practically difficult to reduce dissolved methane to below 5 mg l as a potent greenhouse gas ipcc 2021 the emission of dissolved methane at 5 mg l of wastewater would add 0 14 gco2 eq l to the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment representing 7 28 of the currently estimated carbon footprint of a wastewater treatment plant 0 5 2 0 gco2 eq l de haas et al 2014 this could partially explain the rare large scale applications of membrane based separation of dissolved methane despite extensive successful lab scale studies this study provided an alternative solution to remove dissolved methane from mainstream anaerobic wastewater compared to sole anammox systems the involvement of n damo microorganisms provides the system with the capability to remove dissolved methane with nitrite or nitrate recirculated from the oxic tank as electron acceptors fig 7 after introducing n damo microorganisms as additional functional populations in anammox granules the combined system can simultaneously remove nitrogen and dissolved methane in anaerobic effluent without the addition of any other organics with hindsight nitrite appears to be a better electron acceptor to achieve this aim because of two reasons first anammox bacteria that have a higher nitrite affinity will use nitrite in the feeding to remove ammonium with priority thus being able to drive ammonium and nitrite in effluent to an extremely low level 1 mg n l moreover n damo bacteria that use nitrite for methane removal have a higher methane affinity than n damo archaea that use nitrate for methane removal as per the need to drive dissolved methane to below 1 mg ch4 l the required maximum activity of n damo archaea is approximately one order higher than that of n damo bacteria since the maximum activity is usually related to the quantity of biomass this means that if targeting the same methane removal efficiency considerably more biomass will be needed when using nitrate as the electron acceptor than nitrite however an important question beyond the present study is that the mainstream nitritation is still a challenge and the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob requires specific operational strategies hu et al 2023 meng et al 2022 zheng et al 2023 additionally the residual organics in anaerobically treated wastewater and the presence of limited oxygen in recirculated nitrifying liquor may also affect the removal of dissolved methane and nitrogen in practice for example the residual organics may support heterotrophic denitrifiers potentially competing for nitrate nitrite with n damo microorganisms the high oxygen should be avoided as it would adversely affect anaerobic methane oxidizers but favourably support aerobic methanotrophs thus future studies are required to examine the effectiveness of this technology by treating real anaerobically treated wastewater still the proposed granules coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms add more operational flexibility to mainstream anammox systems to cope with wastewater dynamics and also provide a feasibility to make the best use of dissolved methane 4 conclusions this study developed a novel process for simultaneous removal of dissolved methane and nitrogen in low strength wastewater and unraveled the microbial interactions underpinning the process from the microbial and kinetic perspectives long term bioreactor operation and short term ex situ batch tests were conducted in conjunction with the determination of kinetics and diverse microbial analyses the key conclusions include dissolved methane and nitrogenous compounds in mainstream anaerobic effluent can be removed simultaneously by granules coupling anammox and n damo microorganisms the nitrogen and dissolved methane removal rates achieved meet the requirement of mainstream wastewater treatment in practice the type of electron acceptors nitrite vs nitrate incurs significant effects on the removal of ammonium and dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent the maximum microbial activities abundance and expression of functional genes and microbial communities nitrite is a favourable electron acceptor for the removal of ammonium and dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent this study also highlights the important role of microbial competition and cooperation the microbial competition affects the overall nitrogen and methane removal performance which is mainly governed by microbial kinetics the cooperation results in a more stable microbial guild against wastewater dynamics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14634,the interfacial electron transfer et between electron shuttling compounds and iron fe oxyhydroxides plays a crucial role in the reductive dissolution of fe minerals and the fate of surface bound arsenic as however the impact of exposed facets of highly crystalline hematite on reductive dissolution and as immobilization is poorly understood in this study we systematically investigated the interfacial processes of the electron shuttling compound cysteine cys on various facets of hematite and the reallocations of surface bound as iii or as v on the respective surfaces our results demonstrate that the et process between cys and hematite generates fe ii and leads to reductive dissolution with more fe ii generated on 001 facets of exposed hematite nanoplates hnps reductive dissolution of hematite leads to significantly enhanced as v reallocations on hematite nevertheless upon the addition of cys a raipd release of as iii can be halted by its prompt re adsorption leaving the extent of as iii immobilization on hematite unchanged throughout the course of reductive dissolution this is due to that fe ii can form new precipitates with as v a process that is facet dependent and influenced by water chemistry electrochemical analysis reveals that hnps exhibit higher conductivity and et ability which is beneficial for reductive dissolution and as reallocations on hematite these findings highlight the facet dependent reallocations of as iii and as v facilitated by electron shuttling compounds and have implications for the biogeochemical processes of as in soil and subsurface environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heavy metalloid iron oxyhydroxides electron shuttles electron transfer reductive dissolution reallocations 1 introduction arsenic as is widespread in subsurface environments posing potential threats to water and food safety rodríguez lado et al 2013 teixeira et al 2020 due to its strong affinity with iron fe oxyhydroxides in groundwater and soils di iorio et al 2018 the environmental behavior of as is highly associated with the biogeochemical process of the fe cycle sowers et al 2017 recently it has been suggested that microbially driven reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides occurring under anoxic conditions is a key driving force of as release and mobilization stolze et al 2019 liu et al 2022a increasing evidence suggests that the electron transfer et process of fe oxyhydroxides with microorganisms determines its reductive dissolution which can be greatly accelerated by electron shuttling compounds doong and schink 2002 thereby significantly contributing to as release yamamura et al 2019 stolze et al 2019 thus understanding the interfacial et processes of these electron shuttles on fe oxyhydroxides is of great significance for accurately evaluating the potential risk of as in groundwater aquifers and soils except for the role of the redox potential of electron shuttles e g fe ii cysteine and flavin doong and schink 2002 hu et al 2021a liu et al 2022a previous studies have proposed that the surface chemistry of fe oxyhydroxides could determine the interfacial et process between microbes and fe minerals thereby affecting the coupled process of fe as cycle glodoska et al 2020 sutton et al 2009 previous investigations have found that the reductive dissolution rate of fe iii could decrease with an increase in crystallinity due to their lower energy of breaking the fe o bonds and higher fe vacancies content song et al 2022 consequently the release of as has been closely related to that of fe underscoring the significant influence of fe mineral dissolution on the fate of as in subsurface environments erbs et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a moreover evidence suggests that fe ii exhibits the catalysis ability of transformation of amorphous and poorly crystalline fe minerals into more stable phases aeppli et al 2019 with highly crystalline fe minerals being responsible for as immobilization in subsurface environments however the interfacial et process of electron shuttles on these crystalline fe minerals and their corresponding effects on as cycling are often overlooked aeppli et al 2018 additionally the exposure of distinct facets which is as an important surface characteristic of these crystalline fe oxyhydroxides may also greatly contribute to this interfacial et process and thereby the as im mobilization in subsurface environments huang et al 2020 the diverse impacts of facets on the adsorption and catalytic processes of crystalline fe oxyhydroxides have been frequently observed lv et al 2018 jin et al 2022 huang and colleagues discovered that the 001 facet of hematite exhibited significantly greater catalytic activity in generating reactive oxygen species ros than the 110 and 012 facets huang et al 2017b such difference is caused by the abundance of hydroxyl groups and highly active fe atom densities on the 001 facet which facilitate the interfacial et on this particular hematite s facet huang et al 2017b in addition to its significant influence on the et process the facet of crystalline metal oxides e g hematite was also found to impact the surface complexation of heavy metal loids waychunas et al 2005 noerpel et al 2016 evidence suggests that the 214 facet of hematite has a considerably greater affinity in complexing as compared to the 110 and 001 facets yan et al 2020 but exhibits considerably weaker complexation for chromium cr huang et al 2016 these results highlight the crucial role of facets in both the et and chemical complexation processes on fe oxyhydroxides therefore we postulate that the interfacial et process of electron shuttles on crystalline fe oxyhydroxides such as hematite may also be significantly related to facets which govern the reductive dissolution of fe iii and the fate of as the aim of this research is to explore facets effects on the hematite s reductive dissolution a highly crystalline and widespread fe mineral facilitated by electron shuttling compounds and to explore its impact on the fate of surface bound arsenic under anoxic conditions cysteine cys which possesses a low redox potential eh 348 mv and is commonly found in subsurface environments was chosen as the electron shuttle due to its high affinity with fe oxyhydroxides li et al 2022 three 001 110 and 012 facets mainly exposed hematite is chosen in our current study as these facets are dominant exposed facets of natural hematite with low surface energies and they are widely applied in many research areas including environmental geological and catalysis study to investigate the facet dependent interfacial process huang et al 2017b 2020 jin et al 2022 the study examines the interfacial processes of cys on different hematite s facets and evaluates the reallocations of surface bound as iii and as v on the respective surfaces under varying conditions to probe the thermodynamics of cys on different facets electrochemical analyses were conducted and x ray absorption spectroscopy xas was applied to determine the surface complexation of as with different surfaces 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of hematite three highly exposed facets of hematite namely 001 110 and 012 facets corresponding to nanoplates hnps nanorods hnrs and nanocubes hncs respectively were prepared based on the previously established methods hao et al 2022a the detailed description of reagents and synthesized procedure of hematite can be found in texts s1 2 2 2 characterization the

reactions with as iii as v and cys were collected at 6 bm beamline at the detailed procedure of xas analyses and data fitting can be found in texts s3 4 2 3 batch experiments the reductive dissolution kinetics of three hematite samples hnps hnrs and hncs by cys were conducted under anoxic conditions in an anaerobic glovebox po2 0 1 mg m3 hematite suspension at 1 g l was prepared and spiked with appropriate amounts of cys to achieve an initial cys concentration of 2 mm in a 50 ml glass the suspensions were stabilized in the dark at 25 1 c on a shaker 200 rpm and their ph was adjusted to 7 0 by 0 1 m naoh or hcl to determine dissolved fe ii concentration hematite suspensions were sampled and filtered by a 0 22 μm membrane filter at desired reaction intervals prior to colorimetric analysis for the total fe ii concentration hematite suspensions were mixed with 6 m hcl at a 1 1 vol rate before filtration and sample analysis additionally changes in cys and cystine concentrations in the reaction systems were also monitored further the kinetics experiments of as reaction on different hematite samples were conducted in a two step process of as adsorption on hematite and followed by adding cys to trigger surface reductive dissolution first as adsorption on hematite was achieved by adding as iii as v stock solution to hematite suspensions in 50 ml glass vials at ph 7 0 adjusting by 0 1 m hcl or naoh the dosage of hematite was 1 g l the as iii as v concentrations of were 6 12 mg l and the suspensions were equilibrated on a shaker table under 200 rpm at 25 1 c the suspensions were sampled at regular intervals within 120 min in the second step some cys stock solution was immediately added to each sample vial to trigger surface reductive dissolution the initial cys concentration was 2 mm and the reaction suspensions were continuously sampled and filtrated through a 0 22 μm membrane filter to monitor the changes of as and fe ii concentrations in the aqueous phase the effects of ph in a range of 3 10 and the ratio of as fe in a range of 0 0004 0 0024 on as allocations were investigated additionally the influences of different co existing anions including humic acid ha nitrate bicarbonate and phosphate on the behavior of as in the reaction system were also evaluated the experiments were repeated in triplicate 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of total fe ii and aqueous fe ii during reductive dissolution process were analyzed by phenanthroline colorimetric method using uv vis spectrophotometer persee china the concentration of cys during reductive reaction processes were measured by mixing 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid dtnb as color development agent before analysis by uv vis spectrophotometer persee china at 412 nm high performance liquid chromatography agilent usa were applied to measure the concentrations of cystine using acetonitrile phosphoric acid 80 20 ph 3 0 as mobile phase the concentrations of as iii and as v were measured on a kylin s12 liquid chromatography equipped with atomic fluorescence spectroscope lc afs titan instruments china the electrochemical properties of hematite with and without cys at ph 7 0 were determined on an electrochemical workstation composed of three electrodes under anoxic conditions the working electrode was modified by hnps hnrs and hncs and it was polished by al2o3 particles and activated with h2so4 before casting with different hematite samples the electrodes were immersed in the anoxic solution containing 2 mm cys at ph 7 0 during the whole experiment cyclic voltammetry curves were measured at a scan rate of 0 25 v s all these electrochemical experiments were repeated in triplicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 facet dependent reduction kinetics of hematite facilitated by cysteine the xrd patterns of the three prepared hematite are consistent and in agreement with that of the reference of ɑ fe2o3 pdf 33 0644 fig s1 while they i e hnps hnrs and hncs exhibit distinctly different morphologies i e hexagonal plate prism and cube like figs 1 a c s2 these results are likely due to the oriented growth of fe lattices thus leading to exposure of different facets huang et al 2020 further tem analysis reveals that the three hematite samples exhibits significantly different lattice spacings of 0 25 0 44 and 0 37 nm assigning to 001 110 012 facets respectively for hnps hnrs and hncs respectively fig 1a c confirming the feature of highly exposed facet of the hematite as a result these highly exposed facets also exhibit different surface areas in a range of 8 6 26 7 m2 g fig s3 the addition of cys to hematite suspensions triggers a rapid reductive dissolution of surface fe iii results show that approximate 0 2 1 1 mg l fe ii is generated with the addition of cys to hematite with different facet exposed and the generation kinetics of fe ii kobs is fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model 0 12 0 23 min 1 fig 1d it is noteworthy that the generation of fe ii primarily occurred during the initial 30 min of the reaction subsequently the reaction rate of fe ii generation decreased rapidly similar trends have been reported in previous studies investigating the reductive dissolution of fe minerals huang et al 2017a li et al 2022 this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the surface adsorbed cys cystine and newly generated fe ii would occupy the binding sites on hematite gradually reducing the availability of cys in the aqueous phase for further adsorption and reduction thus only a small portion fe ii is generated after the 300 min reaction the dissolved fe ii concentration increases slowly during the initial 30 min fig 1d then the concentration of dissolved fe ii increases rapidly while a significant portion of fe ii still remains adsorbed on hematite even after 300 min this is leading by the strong binding capabilities of fe ii to hematite s surface as previously reported huang et al 2017a compared to goethite and ferrihydrite the kinetics of fe ii generation and release in hematite are considerably slower li et al 2022 this is due to the higher crystallization and lower content of fe vacancies in hematite which require more energy to break the fe o bonds during the reductive dissolution process liu et al 2016 aeppli et al 2019 furthermore the processes of fe ii generation and release are found to be facet dependent with the order of reactivity being hnps hncs hnrs this suggests that cys exhibits varying reactivity towards different facet exposed hematite surfaces after normalization with the specific surface areas of hematite the order of fe ii generation and release exhibit the trend of hnps hnrs hncs indicating that the surface areas also influence the reductive dissolution rate of hematite the relative ratio of released fe ii to total fe ii on different hematite facets is also depended on the facet orientation and the ratio on hnps hnrs and hncs are 0 34 0 06 and 0 18 respectively showing a trend of hnps hncs hnrs this trend indicates that though the 001 facet of hematite has a higher adsorption capacity for fe ii compared to other facets owing to the facet dependent coordination mode between fe ii and iron oxides ouyang et al 2014 the greater generation of fe ii can still lead to release more ratio of dissolved fe ii after enough accumulation during the reductive dissolution process cys undergoes adsorption on hematite and subsequent oxidation through an electron transfer et process the thiol group of cys forms a surface complex with the fe o group of hematite fig 1e f the kinetics of cys adsorption and oxidation are correlated with the generation of fe ii our batch experiments have demonstrated that cys can adsorb onto the hematite surface with a trend of higher adsorption on hnps hncs hnrs fig 1e indicating that the initial content of cys may be a crucial factor for fe ii generation and cys oxidation to gain a better understanding of cys adsorption on different facet exposed hematite we analyzed the surface potential of hematite before and after the reaction with cys using afm kpfm fig 1g h the surface potential of different hematite samples decreased after the reaction with cys primarily due to the adsorption of cys ge et al 2022 zhai and wang 2020 as the content of newly generated fe ii and cystine is limited compared to the content of adsorbed cys the decreased values of surface potential for hnps hnrs and hncs were 186 mv 134 mv and 161 mv respectively confirming that hnps exhibit a higher capacity for cys adsorption additionally the surface potential of hnps is higher than that of hnrs and hncs before the reaction with cys which is advantageous for the adsorption of negatively charged cys and the interfacial et process thus in the whole reductive dissolution process cys is adsorbed onto the hematite s surface forming complexes with the surface fe iii eq 1 this facilitates the et from cys to the fe iii through oxo bridges leading to the formation of fe ii cystine complexes eq 2 as a result an equilibrium of fe ii between the aqueous phase and solid phase of hematite is established eq 3 li et al 2022 consequently different observations of fe ii production and release are expected and varied depending on the facets of hematite due to the distinct et processes occurring on respective facets huang et al 2017a b moreover the activity of cys in reactions with different hematite facets is also determined by the electron transfer et process between cys and the hematite facets with the 001 facet of hnps exhibiting higher surface hydroxyl and highly active fe atom densities for interfacial et process and fe ii generation huang et al 2017a thus 001 facet of hnps with greater surface areas and et abilities can generate more fe ii 1 fe iii 2 cys fe iii 2 cys 2 fe iii 2 cys fe ii cystine 3 fe ii cystine fe ii cystine 3 2 variations of as reallocation on facet exposed hematite the influences of reductive dissolution of hematite with highly facet exposed surfaces on as allocations were compared fig 2 a demonstrates that the adsorption of as v is rapidly triggered upon the addition of as v to different facet exposed hematite the adsorption capabilities of different facets for as also show a trend of hnps hncs hnrs with the maximum adsorption of as v in a range of 1 9 3 8 mg g that is well described by the langmuir model fig s4a this result indicates that as v adsorption occurs through monolayer chemisorption on the heterogeneous surfaces hao et al 2022a however when normalized to surface area the trend of surface area normalized as v adsorption is hnps hnrs hncs suggesting that both surface area and the uncoordinated fe atoms on the surface of hematite simultaneously determine the adsorption of as by hematite catalano et al 2007 huang et al 2016 after as v adsorption equilibrium the addition of cys leads to release of a small portion of surface bound as v and co occurring fe ii initially fig 2b c the release of as v from various facet exposed hematite primarily occurs due to the reductive dissolution of hematite facilitated by cys this process involves the reduction of surface fe iii and the release of newly generated fe ii consequently surface bound as v is simultaneously released as a result of the coupled fe reduction and release mechanisms stolze et al 2019 yamamura et al 2019 additionally the initial release of as v can be influenced by the competitive adsorption between cys and as v liu et al 2022a the slight differences in the ratio of released as fe release for different hematite samples may be due to differences in their binding abilities with as v fig 2d erbs et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a the presence of as v inhibits the generation and release of fe ii figs 1d 2c which could be attributed to the competitive adsorption between as v and cys on the hematite surface liu et al 2022a however the released as v can be rapidly re adsorbed on hematite and additional as v is adsorbed on hnps hnrs and hncs after reaching the equilibrium state of fe ii generation fig 2a b this reallocation of as v may be attributed to the formation of new precipitates between as v and fe ii the precipitates of fe ii as v exist in the form of fe3 aso4 2 8h2o at ph 7 0 eq 4 masue slowey et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 moreover the promotion effects of as v reallocations on hematite facilitated by cys are also facet dependent with the trend of hnps hncs hnrs fig 2a e this is because of the facet dependent fe ii generation with hnps generating and releasing more fe ii compared with that of hnrs and hncs in the presence of cys fig 2c the normalized promotion of as v reallocations with surface areas of hematite exhibits the trend of hnps hnrs hncs consistent with the trends of normalized fe ii generation on different facet exposed hematite with or without as v fig 2c this further provide that the generation of fe ii is a key factor in promoting as v reallocations as a result more fe ii as v precipitates can be formed and more significant as v reallocations were observed on hnps 4 3 fe ii 2 as o 4 3 8 h 2 o f e 3 as o 4 2 8 h 2 o in addition the ratio of as fe influences as v reallocations during reductive dissolution fig s5 the percentage of immobilized as v increases when the as fe ratio increases as high concentrations of as v promote the formation of fe ii as v precipitates moreover at a high as fe ratio the reaction requires more time to reach the adsorption equilibrium state compared to that of a low as fe ratio fi s5 because as v competes with cys on the surface of hematite therefore a higher as fe ratio decreases cys oxidation and fe ii generation rates the adsorption of as iii is also facet dependent with the trend of hnps hncs hnrs fig s4 moreover all the facets of hematite can adsorb more as iii compared with that of as v which has also been observed by other researches yan et al 2020 zheng et al 2023 because as iii with smaller ionic radius is more favorable to adsorb on the micropores and defects of fe oxyhydroxides compared with that of as v zheng et al 2023 fig s6 shows that as iii is also rapidly adsorbed on the hematite s surface the subsequent addition of cys leads to release of a small portion of surface bound as iii fig s6 which can also be attributed to the reductive dissolution of hematite and competitive adsorption between cys and as iii and the released as iii was re bound to the surface of hematite immediately figs s6 2f huang et al 2020 this indicates that reductive dissolution facilitated by cys negligibly influence as iii allocations on the surface of hematite the ksp of h7fe4 aso3 5 ksp 1033 97 eq 5 is significantly higher than that of fe3 aso4 2 8h2o ksp 10 33 25 masue slowey et al 2014 making it difficult for fe ii as iii precipitates to be formed yuan et al 2019 facet dependent as iii immobilization also occurs fig 2f and this is consistent with the capabilities of as iii adsorption capabilities of hnps hnrs and hncs as shown by the as iii adsorption isotherms fig s4a hnp is able to immobilize more as iii because 001 facets exhibit higher adsorption site densities that can be determined by the uncoordinated fe atoms on the surface of hematite huang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 yan et al 2020 5 4 fe ii 5 h 3 as o 3 3 h 7 f e 4 as o 3 5 8 h 3 3 effects of water chemistry on as reallocation water chemistries can impact the process of as reallocation while the morphology number of active sites on the surface and densities of exposed groups may vary among different hematite samples their intrinsic properties and mineral compositions remain consistent as a result the influence of water chemistries on electron transfer et and pollutant immobilization for hematite with different exposed facets is expected to be similar this consistency has also been confirmed in previous studies hao et al 2022a consequently in our current research hnps are employed to investigate the process of as reallocation solution ph is a key factor in et reductive dissolution and as immobilization processes liu et al 2022b as ph values increase from 3 0 to 11 0 as v adsorption is inhibited with and without cys fig 3 a fang et al 2022 the electrostatic interactions between as v and hematite are stronger under acidic conditions because of the protonation of the surface of hematite ying et al 2011 the surface charge of hematite decreases with increasing ph leading to the inhibition of as v adsorption with or without cys however the differences in as immobilization between with and without cys become more significant with increasing ph indicating varying content of fe ii as v precipitates at different ph values fig 3a although the increase in solution ph inhibits the reductive dissolution process and fe ii generation shi et al 2013 li et al 2022 fe ii concentration is not a dependent factor in the as v reallocation process the increase of ph leads to the protonated forms of as v which benefits fe ii as v precipitation moreover the increase in ph will increase the ion activity product iap of fe ii and as v which promotes the nucleation process during precipitation chi et al 2022 thus more fe ii as v precipitates can form with increasing ph the influences of anions and ha on as v reallocations coupled with reductive dissolution were also investigated fig 3b nitrate and bicarbonate have little effect on as v adsorption with or without cys as the interactions between nitrate bicarbonate and iron hydro oxides are weaker than those of as v however phosphate and humic acid ha inhibit as v immobilization with or without cys phosphate and ha are also adsorbed onto the surface of hematite through stronger interactions and occupy the active binding sites of hematite chi et al 2022 phosphate can bind to fe oxyhydroxides such as hematite and goethite through different monodentate coordination including bidentate binuclear bidentate mononuclear and monodentate mononuclear occupying as v binding sites chen et al 2022 moreover soil organic matter such as ha can also bind to fe minerals through electrostatic interactions ligand exchange h bonding van der waals interactions and cation bridging and compete with as chi et al 2022 3 4 thermodynamic evidence of cysteine reaction on different facets the et from the reducing thiol group of cys to the surface fe iii on different facet exposed hematite is the key factor in determining the differences of reductive dissolution and subsequent as reallocations on different facet exposed hematite fuller et al 2014 thus the electrochemical properties of different hematite samples with and without cys were compared by electrochemical characterization dpv experiments and tafel curves of hnps hnrs and hncs illustrate the redox properties of different hematites fig s7 and these results demonstrate that the hnps exhibit a lower et barrier and that it is easier to reduce 001 facets exposed hematite the et rate between different hematites and cys was compared directly the cyclic voltammetry cv curves show that the oxidation peak of hnps cys systems is located at 0 489 v corresponding to the oxidation of cys to cystine on the surface of hematite fig 4 a indicating that it is fully irreversible for cys oxidation liu et al 2020 while no obvious oxidation or reduction peak is detected from hnrs cys and hncs cys systems fig 4a as the peak current is too low to be observed demonstrating that it is difficult for the et on hncs and hnrs surfaces yuan et al 2011 the oxidation peaks of cys on hnps hnrs and hncs were observed by differential pulse voltammetry dpv because of higher sensitivity of dpv compared with that of cv fig 4b the differences in the oxidation peaks of cys hnps hnrs and hncs 0 5 4 2 μa demonstrate that the et from cys to hnps is the fastest because of the abundant hydroxyl and highly active fe atom densities of the 001 facet huang et al 2017b jin et al 2022 the impedance half radius results measured by electrochemical impedance spectra eis also show that hnps exhibit a better interfacial charge transfer ability hu et al 2021b fig 4c these electrochemical results indicate that hnps exhibit higher conductivity and et ability between surface adsorbed cys and hematite which is beneficial for the efficiencies of fe ii generation and release and as reallocations huang et al 2020 3 5 molecular evidence of as coordination with specific facets and underlying mechanisms the xrd diffraction peaks of hnps hnrs and hncs before and after the reaction are not changed obviously and no new peak was observed fig s8 this demonstrates that there is no crystalline transformation of hematite occurred during reductive dissolution driven by fe ii zhang et al 2017b this stability is crucial for different result of as iii as v reallocations compared with amorphous or poorly crystallized fe minerals sutton et al 2009 the peak of new precipitates was also not observed which is probably attributed to the difficulties of detecting small content of new formed precipitates by xrd tem eds images show that the structure and morphology of hnps are not changed after the reaction with as v and cys while the signals of as are distributed throughout the surfaces of hnps indicating that fe ii as v precipitates likely exists fig s9 notably the signals of o and fe are concentrated on the hematite whereas the signal of as is dispersed throughout the entire region this is attributed to the low content of as with only a small fraction of adsorbed as v on the hematite surface resulting in a relatively weak signal intensity for as consequently the interference from the background can also be observed fang et al 2023 zhang et al 2023 however the stronger signal of as in the hematite still confirms that as v is adsorbed or precipitated on the surface of hematite the as k edge exafs spectra of hnps and hnrs after as iii as v adsorption were investigated fig 5 a b table s1 the peak with interatomic distance at 3 00 3 23 å is attributed to the contribution of as o o the peak with interatomic distance at 3 34 3 37 å corresponds to the as fe atomic pair and the interatomic distances r are different for different treatments in the absence of cys the as fe atomic distance ranges from 3 34 to 3 39 å indicating that as iii as v is adsorbed to the surface of hematite via the formation of bidentate binuclear complexes perez et al 2020 the addition of cys does not apparently affect the as fe s distance for the as iii as v hnps indicating that the bidentate binuclear geometry between as iii as v at the hnps edges remains waychunas et al 2005 however the as fe s distance for the as v on hnrs decreases to 2 89 å corresponding to mononuclear edge sharing geometry perez et al 2020 these different as fe configurations reflect different coordination features of as with fe reaction site on hematite and may support the results of different abilities of as immobilization on different facet exposed hematite with or without cys the as 3d s and fe 2p s xps spectra on hnps were further compared to identify the precipitate phases figs 5c d s10 after as adsorption in the presence of cys two new fe 2p signals located at 709 23 and 722 83 ev were observed fig 5c which belongs to fe ii species hao et al 2022b demonstrating that fe ii is generated on hnps surfaces containing cys moreover there is no obvious change in the as 3d xps peak at 44 56 ev for as iii adsorbed hematite fig s10 however the as 3d xps peaks for as v adsorbed hematite move from 44 8 ev to 45 6 ev in the presence of cys fig 5d indicating that fe ii as v secondary minerals are likely formed to gain further insights into the solid compositions of as on hematite in the presence or absence of cys raman spectra were used to characterize the hematite before and after the reaction with as with or without cys as shown in fig 5e the raman signals of adsorbed as v located at 836 cm 1 burton et al 2009 müller et al 2010 attributed to symmetric as o stretching are observed on hnps after the adsorption of as v additionally a new peak at 860 cm 1 is observed in the presence of cys which can be attributed to the signals of fe ii as v precipitates halder et al 2018 the formation of these new precipitates is a result of the coupled dissolution reprecipitation process occurring at the hematite interface due to the supersaturated state of reduced fe ii and aqueous as v which has been extensively investigated in previous research zhai et al 2019 ge et al 2022 however in the case of adsorbed as iii on hematite with or without cys only the signals of adsorbed as iii at 802 cm 1 were observed müller et al 2010 zhai et al 2019 this observation indicates that the formation of fe ii as iii precipitates does not occur during the reductive dissolution process therefore the mechanism of facet dependent et process and as reallocations in the hnps hnrs or hncs system during the reductive process facilitated by cys can be summarized in fig 6 initially the equilibrium state of as adsorption is reached stage i with the addition of cys it is adsorbed on different hematite s surface and complexes with surface fe iii causing et to occur from cys to fe iii resulting in facet dependent fe ii generation coupled with as iii as v release stage ii the allocations of as iii and as v on hematite are different the released as iii is rapidly adsorbed again due to the newly exposed as binding site on the structurally stable surface of hematite while fe ii can form precipitates with as v leading to additional as v reallocations on the hematite s surface stage iii due to facet dependent et rates and the as binding site of different hematite facets the reductive dissolution and as iii as v immobilization or reallocation efficiencies on different hematite exhibit the trend of hnps hncs hnrs notably the concentrations of electron shuttles such as humic substances cys and flavin can vary widely ranging from a few nanomolar nm to tens of millimolar mm depending on different geological conditions such as soils sediments and groundwater glasser et al 2017 jiang and kappler 2008 morrison et al 2013 in our current experiment we specifically set the concentration of cys at 2 mm while achieving this concentration solely with cys may pose certain challenges it allows us to simulate the reductive dissolution process of fe oxyhydroxides facilitated by electron shuttles as demonstrated in previous research morrison et al 2013 hu et al 2021a by utilizing relatively high concentrations of electron shuttles we aim to gain a better understanding of the facet dependent electron transfer process and the reallocation of as within the hnps hnrs or hncs system furthermore it provides insights into similar processes occurring in real environmental conditions 4 conclusions this research emphasizes the importance of considering the facet dependent properties of fe minerals in understanding their behavior in the environment more fe ii is generated on hnps compared with that of hnrs and hncs with the addition of cys in contrast to the previous results which have found that the reductive dissolution of poorly crystalline fe oxyhydroxides contributes to as release kumarathilaka et al 2018 our result shows that more as v is reallocated with the addition of cys because fe ii can form new precipitates with as v while the as iii reallocation is not influence during reductive dissolution the as iii as v immobilization or reallocation is facet dependent on different hematite facets due to the facet dependent et rates and the as binding site this result highlights the role of facets on interfacial et and as reallocation process on crystalline fe oxyhydroxides this study provides insight into as immobilization in geological

14634,the interfacial electron transfer et between electron shuttling compounds and iron fe oxyhydroxides plays a crucial role in the reductive dissolution of fe minerals and the fate of surface bound arsenic as however the impact of exposed facets of highly crystalline hematite on reductive dissolution and as immobilization is poorly understood in this study we systematically investigated the interfacial processes of the electron shuttling compound cysteine cys on various facets of hematite and the reallocations of surface bound as iii or as v on the respective surfaces our results demonstrate that the et process between cys and hematite generates fe ii and leads to reductive dissolution with more fe ii generated on 001 facets of exposed hematite nanoplates hnps reductive dissolution of hematite leads to significantly enhanced as v reallocations on hematite nevertheless upon the addition of cys a raipd release of as iii can be halted by its prompt re adsorption leaving the extent of as iii immobilization on hematite unchanged throughout the course of reductive dissolution this is due to that fe ii can form new precipitates with as v a process that is facet dependent and influenced by water chemistry electrochemical analysis reveals that hnps exhibit higher conductivity and et ability which is beneficial for reductive dissolution and as reallocations on hematite these findings highlight the facet dependent reallocations of as iii and as v facilitated by electron shuttling compounds and have implications for the biogeochemical processes of as in soil and subsurface environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heavy metalloid iron oxyhydroxides electron shuttles electron transfer reductive dissolution reallocations 1 introduction arsenic as is widespread in subsurface environments posing potential threats to water and food safety rodríguez lado et al 2013 teixeira et al 2020 due to its strong affinity with iron fe oxyhydroxides in groundwater and soils di iorio et al 2018 the environmental behavior of as is highly associated with the biogeochemical process of the fe cycle sowers et al 2017 recently it has been suggested that microbially driven reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides occurring under anoxic conditions is a key driving force of as release and mobilization stolze et al 2019 liu et al 2022a increasing evidence suggests that the electron transfer et process of fe oxyhydroxides with microorganisms determines its reductive dissolution which can be greatly accelerated by electron shuttling compounds doong and schink 2002 thereby significantly contributing to as release yamamura et al 2019 stolze et al 2019 thus understanding the interfacial et processes of these electron shuttles on fe oxyhydroxides is of great significance for accurately evaluating the potential risk of as in groundwater aquifers and soils except for the role of the redox potential of electron shuttles e g fe ii cysteine and flavin doong and schink 2002 hu et al 2021a liu et al 2022a previous studies have proposed that the surface chemistry of fe oxyhydroxides could determine the interfacial et process between microbes and fe minerals thereby affecting the coupled process of fe as cycle glodoska et al 2020 sutton et al 2009 previous investigations have found that the reductive dissolution rate of fe iii could decrease with an increase in crystallinity due to their lower energy of breaking the fe o bonds and higher fe vacancies content song et al 2022 consequently the release of as has been closely related to that of fe underscoring the significant influence of fe mineral dissolution on the fate of as in subsurface environments erbs et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a moreover evidence suggests that fe ii exhibits the catalysis ability of transformation of amorphous and poorly crystalline fe minerals into more stable phases aeppli et al 2019 with highly crystalline fe minerals being responsible for as immobilization in subsurface environments however the interfacial et process of electron shuttles on these crystalline fe minerals and their corresponding effects on as cycling are often overlooked aeppli et al 2018 additionally the exposure of distinct facets which is as an important surface characteristic of these crystalline fe oxyhydroxides may also greatly contribute to this interfacial et process and thereby the as im mobilization in subsurface environments huang et al 2020 the diverse impacts of facets on the adsorption and catalytic processes of crystalline fe oxyhydroxides have been frequently observed lv et al 2018 jin et al 2022 huang and colleagues discovered that the 001 facet of hematite exhibited significantly greater catalytic activity in generating reactive oxygen species ros than the 110 and 012 facets huang et al 2017b such difference is caused by the abundance of hydroxyl groups and highly active fe atom densities on the 001 facet which facilitate the interfacial et on this particular hematite s facet huang et al 2017b in addition to its significant influence on the et process the facet of crystalline metal oxides e g hematite was also found to impact the surface complexation of heavy metal loids waychunas et al 2005 noerpel et al 2016 evidence suggests that the 214 facet of hematite has a considerably greater affinity in complexing as compared to the 110 and 001 facets yan et al 2020 but exhibits considerably weaker complexation for chromium cr huang et al 2016 these results highlight the crucial role of facets in both the et and chemical complexation processes on fe oxyhydroxides therefore we postulate that the interfacial et process of electron shuttles on crystalline fe oxyhydroxides such as hematite may also be significantly related to facets which govern the reductive dissolution of fe iii and the fate of as the aim of this research is to explore facets effects on the hematite s reductive dissolution a highly crystalline and widespread fe mineral facilitated by electron shuttling compounds and to explore its impact on the fate of surface bound arsenic under anoxic conditions cysteine cys which possesses a low redox potential eh 348 mv and is commonly found in subsurface environments was chosen as the electron shuttle due to its high affinity with fe oxyhydroxides li et al 2022 three 001 110 and 012 facets mainly exposed hematite is chosen in our current study as these facets are dominant exposed facets of natural hematite with low surface energies and they are widely applied in many research areas including environmental geological and catalysis study to investigate the facet dependent interfacial process huang et al 2017b 2020 jin et al 2022 the study examines the interfacial processes of cys on different hematite s facets and evaluates the reallocations of surface bound as iii and as v on the respective surfaces under varying conditions to probe the thermodynamics of cys on different facets electrochemical analyses were conducted and x ray absorption spectroscopy xas was applied to determine the surface complexation of as with different surfaces 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of hematite three highly exposed facets of hematite namely 001 110 and 012 facets corresponding to nanoplates hnps nanorods hnrs and nanocubes hncs respectively were prepared based on the previously established methods hao et al 2022a the detailed description of reagents and synthesized procedure of hematite can be found in texts s1 2 2 2 characterization the morphologies of the hematite with varying facets were determined by a su8010 scanning electron microscope sem hitachi japan the three hematite samples i e hnps hnrs and hncs before and after reactions

were dispersed in 5 ml ethanol and a drop of the mixture solution was added on a silica grid and air dried the surface potential of hematite with varying facets before and after reaction with cys were measured by the kelvin probe force microscopy kpfm using a nanoscope v multimode 8 afm bruker santa barbara ca by mesp v2 tips after calibrated on a gold surface for x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps analysis different hematite samples after reactions were freeze dried and collected and analyzed on an esca 250xi xps thermo fischer uk the hematite samples before and after reaction with as iii

50 microscope objective the hematite s surface area were determined by the n2 adsorption method on a micromeritics asap2020 surface analyzer micromeritics ins usa the as k edge xas of hematite after reactions with as iii as v and cys were collected at 6 bm beamline at the detailed procedure of xas analyses and data fitting can be found in texts s3 4 2 3 batch experiments the reductive dissolution kinetics of three hematite samples hnps hnrs and hncs by cys were conducted under anoxic conditions in an anaerobic glovebox po2 0 1 mg m3 hematite suspension at 1 g l was prepared and spiked with appropriate amounts of cys to achieve an initial cys concentration of 2 mm in a 50 ml glass the suspensions were stabilized in the dark at 25 1 c on a shaker 200 rpm and their ph was adjusted to 7 0 by 0 1 m naoh or hcl to determine dissolved fe ii concentration hematite suspensions were sampled and filtered by a 0 22 μm membrane filter at desired reaction intervals prior to colorimetric analysis for the total fe ii concentration hematite suspensions were mixed with 6 m hcl at a 1 1 vol rate before filtration and sample analysis additionally changes in cys and cystine concentrations in the reaction systems were also monitored further the kinetics experiments of as reaction on different hematite samples were conducted in a two step process of as adsorption on hematite and followed by adding cys to trigger surface reductive dissolution first as adsorption on hematite was achieved by adding as iii as v stock solution to hematite suspensions in 50 ml glass vials at ph 7 0 adjusting by 0 1 m hcl or naoh the dosage of hematite was 1 g l the as iii as v concentrations of were 6 12 mg l and the suspensions were equilibrated on a shaker table under 200 rpm at 25 1 c the suspensions were sampled at regular intervals within 120 min in the second step some cys stock solution was immediately added to each sample vial to trigger surface reductive dissolution the initial cys concentration was 2 mm and the reaction suspensions were continuously sampled and filtrated through a 0 22 μm membrane filter to monitor the changes of as and fe ii concentrations in the aqueous phase the effects of ph in a range of 3 10 and the ratio of as fe in a range of 0 0004 0 0024 on as allocations were investigated additionally the influences of different co existing anions including humic acid ha nitrate bicarbonate and phosphate on the behavior of as in the reaction system were also evaluated the experiments were repeated in triplicate 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of total fe ii and aqueous fe ii during reductive dissolution process were analyzed by phenanthroline colorimetric method using uv vis spectrophotometer persee china the concentration of cys during reductive reaction processes were measured by mixing 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid dtnb as color development agent before analysis by uv vis spectrophotometer persee china at 412 nm high performance liquid chromatography agilent usa were applied to measure the concentrations of cystine using acetonitrile phosphoric acid 80 20 ph 3 0 as mobile phase the concentrations of as iii and as v were measured on a kylin s12 liquid chromatography equipped with atomic fluorescence spectroscope lc afs titan instruments china the electrochemical properties of hematite with and without cys at ph 7 0 were determined on an electrochemical workstation composed of three electrodes under anoxic conditions the working electrode was modified by hnps hnrs and hncs and it was polished by al2o3 particles and activated with h2so4 before casting with different hematite samples the electrodes were immersed in the anoxic solution containing 2 mm cys at ph 7 0 during the whole experiment cyclic voltammetry curves were measured at a scan rate of 0 25 v s all these electrochemical experiments were repeated in triplicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 facet dependent reduction kinetics of hematite facilitated by cysteine the xrd patterns of the three prepared hematite are consistent and in agreement with that of the reference of ɑ fe2o3 pdf 33 0644 fig s1 while they i e hnps hnrs and hncs exhibit distinctly different morphologies i e hexagonal plate prism and cube like figs 1 a c s2 these results are likely due to the oriented growth of fe lattices thus leading to exposure of different facets huang et al 2020 further tem analysis reveals that the three hematite samples exhibits significantly different lattice spacings of 0 25 0 44 and 0 37 nm assigning to 001 110 012 facets respectively for hnps hnrs and hncs respectively fig 1a c confirming the feature of highly exposed facet of the hematite as a result these highly exposed facets also exhibit different surface areas in a range of 8 6 26 7 m2 g fig s3 the addition of cys to hematite suspensions triggers a rapid reductive dissolution of surface fe iii results show that approximate 0 2 1 1 mg l fe ii is generated with the addition of cys to hematite with different facet exposed and the generation kinetics of fe ii kobs is fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model 0 12 0 23 min 1 fig 1d it is noteworthy that the generation of fe ii primarily occurred during the initial 30 min of the reaction subsequently the reaction rate of fe ii generation decreased rapidly similar trends have been reported in previous studies investigating the reductive dissolution of fe minerals huang et al 2017a li et al 2022 this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the surface adsorbed cys cystine and newly generated fe ii would occupy the binding sites on hematite gradually reducing the availability of cys in the aqueous phase for further adsorption and reduction thus only a small portion fe ii is generated after the 300 min reaction the dissolved fe ii concentration increases slowly during the initial 30 min fig 1d then the concentration of dissolved fe ii increases rapidly while a significant portion of fe ii still remains adsorbed on hematite even after 300 min this is leading by the strong binding capabilities of fe ii to hematite s surface as previously reported huang et al 2017a compared to goethite and ferrihydrite the kinetics of fe ii generation and release in hematite are considerably slower li et al 2022 this is due to the higher crystallization and lower content of fe vacancies in hematite which require more energy to break the fe o bonds during the reductive dissolution process liu et al 2016 aeppli et al 2019 furthermore the processes of fe ii generation and release are found to be facet dependent with the order of reactivity being hnps hncs hnrs this suggests that cys exhibits varying reactivity towards different facet exposed hematite surfaces after normalization with the specific surface areas of hematite the order of fe ii generation and release exhibit the trend of hnps hnrs hncs indicating that the surface areas also influence the reductive dissolution rate of hematite the relative ratio of released fe ii to total fe ii on different hematite facets is also depended on the facet orientation and the ratio on hnps hnrs and hncs are 0 34 0 06 and 0 18 respectively showing a trend of hnps hncs hnrs this trend indicates that though the 001 facet of hematite has a higher adsorption capacity for fe ii compared to other facets owing to the facet dependent coordination mode between fe ii and iron oxides ouyang et al 2014 the greater generation of fe ii can still lead to release more ratio of dissolved fe ii after enough accumulation during the reductive dissolution process cys undergoes adsorption on hematite and subsequent oxidation through an electron transfer et process the thiol group of cys forms a surface complex with the fe o group of hematite fig 1e f the kinetics of cys adsorption and oxidation are correlated with the generation of fe ii our batch experiments have demonstrated that cys can adsorb onto the hematite surface with a trend of higher adsorption on hnps hncs hnrs fig 1e indicating that the initial content of cys may be a crucial factor for fe ii generation and cys oxidation to gain a better understanding of cys adsorption on different facet exposed hematite we analyzed the surface potential of hematite before and after the reaction with cys using afm kpfm fig 1g h the surface potential of different hematite samples decreased after the reaction with cys primarily due to the adsorption of cys ge et al 2022 zhai and wang 2020 as the content of newly generated fe ii and cystine is limited compared to the content of adsorbed cys the decreased values of surface potential for hnps hnrs and hncs were 186 mv 134 mv and 161 mv respectively confirming that hnps exhibit a higher capacity for cys adsorption additionally the surface potential of hnps is higher than that of hnrs and hncs before the reaction with cys which is advantageous for the adsorption of negatively charged cys and the interfacial et process thus in the whole reductive dissolution process cys is adsorbed onto the hematite s surface forming complexes with the surface fe iii eq 1 this facilitates the et from cys to the fe iii through oxo bridges leading to the formation of fe ii cystine complexes eq 2 as a result an equilibrium of fe ii between the aqueous phase and solid phase of hematite is established eq 3 li et al 2022 consequently different observations of fe ii production and release are expected and varied depending on the facets of hematite due to the distinct et processes occurring on respective facets huang et al 2017a b moreover the activity of cys in reactions with different hematite facets is also determined by the electron transfer et process between cys and the hematite facets with the 001 facet of hnps exhibiting higher surface hydroxyl and highly active fe atom densities for interfacial et process and fe ii generation huang et al 2017a thus 001 facet of hnps with greater surface areas and et abilities can generate more fe ii 1 fe iii 2 cys fe iii 2 cys 2 fe iii 2 cys fe ii cystine 3 fe ii cystine fe ii cystine 3 2 variations of as reallocation on facet exposed hematite the influences of reductive dissolution of hematite with highly facet exposed surfaces on as allocations were compared fig 2 a demonstrates that the adsorption of as v is rapidly triggered upon the addition of as v to different facet exposed hematite the adsorption capabilities of different facets for as also show a trend of hnps hncs hnrs with the maximum adsorption of as v in a range of 1 9 3 8 mg g that is well described by the langmuir model fig s4a this result indicates that as v adsorption occurs through monolayer chemisorption on the heterogeneous surfaces hao et al 2022a however when normalized to surface area the trend of surface area normalized as v adsorption is hnps hnrs hncs suggesting that both surface area and the uncoordinated fe atoms on the surface of hematite simultaneously determine the adsorption of as by hematite catalano et al 2007 huang et al 2016 after as v adsorption equilibrium the addition of cys leads to release of a small portion of surface bound as v and co occurring fe ii initially fig 2b c the release of as v from various facet exposed hematite primarily occurs due to the reductive dissolution of hematite facilitated by cys this process involves the reduction of surface fe iii and the release of newly generated fe ii consequently surface bound as v is simultaneously released as a result of the coupled fe reduction and release mechanisms stolze et al 2019 yamamura et al 2019 additionally the initial release of as v can be influenced by the competitive adsorption between cys and as v liu et al 2022a the slight differences in the ratio of released as fe release for different hematite samples may be due to differences in their binding abilities with as v fig 2d erbs et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a the presence of as v inhibits the generation and release of fe ii figs 1d 2c which could be attributed to the competitive adsorption between as v and cys on the hematite surface liu et al 2022a however the released as v can be rapidly re adsorbed on hematite and additional as v is adsorbed on hnps hnrs and hncs after reaching the equilibrium state of fe ii generation fig 2a b this reallocation of as v may be attributed to the formation of new precipitates between as v and fe ii the precipitates of fe ii as v exist in the form of fe3 aso4 2 8h2o at ph 7 0 eq 4 masue slowey et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 moreover the promotion effects of as v reallocations on hematite facilitated by cys are also facet dependent with the trend of hnps hncs hnrs fig 2a e this is because of the facet dependent fe ii generation with hnps generating and releasing more fe ii compared with that of hnrs and hncs in the presence of cys fig 2c the normalized promotion of as v reallocations with surface areas of hematite exhibits the trend of hnps hnrs hncs consistent with the trends of normalized fe ii generation on different facet exposed hematite with or without as v fig 2c this further provide that the generation of fe ii is a key factor in promoting as v reallocations as a result more fe ii as v precipitates can be formed and more significant as v reallocations were observed on hnps 4 3 fe ii 2 as o 4 3 8 h 2 o f e 3 as o 4 2 8 h 2 o in addition the ratio of as fe influences as v reallocations during reductive dissolution fig s5 the percentage of immobilized as v increases when the as fe ratio increases as high concentrations of as v promote the formation of fe ii as v precipitates moreover at a high as fe ratio the reaction requires more time to reach the adsorption equilibrium state compared to that of a low as fe ratio fi s5 because as v competes with cys on the surface of hematite therefore a higher as fe ratio decreases cys oxidation and fe ii generation rates the adsorption of as iii is also facet dependent with the trend of hnps hncs hnrs fig s4 moreover all the facets of hematite can adsorb more as iii compared with that of as v which has also been observed by other researches yan et al 2020 zheng et al 2023 because as iii with smaller ionic radius is more favorable to adsorb on the micropores and defects of fe oxyhydroxides compared with that of as v zheng et al 2023 fig s6 shows that as iii is also rapidly adsorbed on the hematite s surface the subsequent addition of cys leads to release of a small portion of surface bound as iii fig s6 which can also be attributed to the reductive dissolution of hematite and competitive adsorption between cys and as iii and the released as iii was re bound to the surface of hematite immediately figs s6 2f huang et al 2020 this indicates that reductive dissolution facilitated by cys negligibly influence as iii allocations on the surface of hematite the ksp of h7fe4 aso3 5 ksp 1033 97 eq 5 is significantly higher than that of fe3 aso4 2 8h2o ksp 10 33 25 masue slowey et al 2014 making it difficult for fe ii as iii precipitates to be formed yuan et al 2019 facet dependent as iii immobilization also occurs fig 2f and this is consistent with the capabilities of as iii adsorption capabilities of hnps hnrs and hncs as shown by the as iii adsorption isotherms fig s4a hnp is able to immobilize more as iii because 001 facets exhibit higher adsorption site densities that can be determined by the uncoordinated fe atoms on the surface of hematite huang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 yan et al 2020 5 4 fe ii 5 h 3 as o 3 3 h 7 f e 4 as o 3 5 8 h 3 3 effects of water chemistry on as reallocation water chemistries can impact the process of as reallocation while the morphology number of active sites on the surface and densities of exposed groups may vary among different hematite samples their intrinsic properties and mineral compositions remain consistent as a result the influence of water chemistries on electron transfer et and pollutant immobilization for hematite with different exposed facets is expected to be similar this consistency has also been confirmed in previous studies hao et al 2022a consequently in our current research hnps are employed to investigate the process of as reallocation solution ph is a key factor in et reductive dissolution and as immobilization processes liu et al 2022b as ph values increase from 3 0 to 11 0 as v adsorption is inhibited with and without cys fig 3 a fang et al 2022 the electrostatic interactions between as v and hematite are stronger under acidic conditions because of the protonation of the surface of hematite ying et al 2011 the surface charge of hematite decreases with increasing ph leading to the inhibition of as v adsorption with or without cys however the differences in as immobilization between with and without cys become more significant with increasing ph indicating varying content of fe ii as v precipitates at different ph values fig 3a although the increase in solution ph inhibits the reductive dissolution process and fe ii generation shi et al 2013 li et al 2022 fe ii concentration is not a dependent factor in the as v reallocation process the increase of ph leads to the protonated forms of as v which benefits fe ii as v precipitation moreover the increase in ph will increase the ion activity product iap of fe ii and as v which promotes the nucleation process during precipitation chi et al 2022 thus more fe ii as v precipitates can form with increasing ph the influences of anions and ha on as v reallocations coupled with reductive dissolution were also investigated fig 3b nitrate and bicarbonate have little effect on as v adsorption with or without cys as the interactions between nitrate bicarbonate and iron hydro oxides are weaker than those of as v however phosphate and humic acid ha inhibit as v immobilization with or without cys phosphate and ha are also adsorbed onto the surface of hematite through stronger interactions and occupy the active binding sites of hematite chi et al 2022 phosphate can bind to fe oxyhydroxides such as hematite and goethite through different monodentate coordination including bidentate binuclear bidentate mononuclear and monodentate mononuclear occupying as v binding sites chen et al 2022 moreover soil organic matter such as ha can also bind to fe minerals through electrostatic interactions ligand exchange h bonding van der waals interactions and cation bridging and compete with as chi et al 2022 3 4 thermodynamic evidence of cysteine reaction on different facets the et from the reducing thiol group of cys to the surface fe iii on different facet exposed hematite is the key factor in determining the differences of reductive dissolution and subsequent as reallocations on different facet exposed hematite fuller et al 2014 thus the electrochemical properties of different hematite samples with and without cys were compared by electrochemical characterization dpv experiments and tafel curves of hnps hnrs and hncs illustrate the redox properties of different hematites fig s7 and these results demonstrate that the hnps exhibit a lower et barrier and that it is easier to reduce 001 facets exposed hematite the et rate between different hematites and cys was compared directly the cyclic voltammetry cv curves show that the oxidation peak of hnps cys systems is located at 0 489 v corresponding to the oxidation of cys to cystine on the surface of hematite fig 4 a indicating that it is fully irreversible for cys oxidation liu et al 2020 while no obvious oxidation or reduction peak is detected from hnrs cys and hncs cys systems fig 4a as the peak current is too low to be observed demonstrating that it is difficult for the et on hncs and hnrs surfaces yuan et al 2011 the oxidation peaks of cys on hnps hnrs and hncs were observed by differential pulse voltammetry dpv because of higher sensitivity of dpv compared with that of cv fig 4b the differences in the oxidation peaks of cys hnps hnrs and hncs 0 5 4 2 μa demonstrate that the et from cys to hnps is the fastest because of the abundant hydroxyl and highly active fe atom densities of the 001 facet huang et al 2017b jin et al 2022 the impedance half radius results measured by electrochemical impedance spectra eis also show that hnps exhibit a better interfacial charge transfer ability hu et al 2021b fig 4c these electrochemical results indicate that hnps exhibit higher conductivity and et ability between surface adsorbed cys and hematite which is beneficial for the efficiencies of fe ii generation and release and as reallocations huang et al 2020 3 5 molecular evidence of as coordination with specific facets and underlying mechanisms the xrd diffraction peaks of hnps hnrs and hncs before and after the reaction are not changed obviously and no new peak was observed fig s8 this demonstrates that there is no crystalline transformation of hematite occurred during reductive dissolution driven by fe ii zhang et al 2017b this stability is crucial for different result of as iii as v reallocations compared with amorphous or poorly crystallized fe minerals sutton et al 2009 the peak of new precipitates was also not observed which is probably attributed to the difficulties of detecting small content of new formed precipitates by xrd tem eds images show that the structure and morphology of hnps are not changed after the reaction with as v and cys while the signals of as are distributed throughout the surfaces of hnps indicating that fe ii as v precipitates likely exists fig s9 notably the signals of o and fe are concentrated on the hematite whereas the signal of as is dispersed throughout the entire region this is attributed to the low content of as with only a small fraction of adsorbed as v on the hematite surface resulting in a relatively weak signal intensity for as consequently the interference from the background can also be observed fang et al 2023 zhang et al 2023 however the stronger signal of as in the hematite still confirms that as v is adsorbed or precipitated on the surface of hematite the as k edge exafs spectra of hnps and hnrs after as iii as v adsorption were investigated fig 5 a b table s1 the peak with interatomic distance at 3 00 3 23 å is attributed to the contribution of as o o the peak with interatomic distance at 3 34 3 37 å corresponds to the as fe atomic pair and the interatomic distances r are different for different treatments in the absence of cys the as fe atomic distance ranges from 3 34 to 3 39 å indicating that as iii as v is adsorbed to the surface of hematite via the formation of bidentate binuclear complexes perez et al 2020 the addition of cys does not apparently affect the as fe s distance for the as iii as v hnps indicating that the bidentate binuclear geometry between as iii as v at the hnps edges remains waychunas et al 2005 however the as fe s distance for the as v on hnrs decreases to 2 89 å corresponding to mononuclear edge sharing geometry perez et al 2020 these different as fe configurations reflect different coordination features of as with fe reaction site on hematite and may support the results of different abilities of as immobilization on different facet exposed hematite with or without cys the as 3d s and fe 2p s xps spectra on hnps were further compared to identify the precipitate phases figs 5c d s10 after as adsorption in the presence of cys two new fe 2p signals located at 709 23 and 722 83 ev were observed fig 5c which belongs to fe ii species hao et al 2022b demonstrating that fe ii is generated on hnps surfaces containing cys moreover there is no obvious change in the as 3d xps peak at 44 56 ev for as iii adsorbed hematite fig s10 however the as 3d xps peaks for as v adsorbed hematite move from 44 8 ev to 45 6 ev in the presence of cys fig 5d indicating that fe ii as v secondary minerals are likely formed to gain further insights into the solid compositions of as on hematite in the presence or absence of cys raman spectra were used to characterize the hematite before and after the reaction with as with or without cys as shown in fig 5e the raman signals of adsorbed as v located at 836 cm 1 burton et al 2009 müller et al 2010 attributed to symmetric as o stretching are observed on hnps after the adsorption of as v additionally a new peak at 860 cm 1 is observed in the presence of cys which can be attributed to the signals of fe ii as v precipitates halder et al 2018 the formation of these new precipitates is a result of the coupled dissolution reprecipitation process occurring at the hematite interface due to the supersaturated state of reduced fe ii and aqueous as v which has been extensively investigated in previous research zhai et al 2019 ge et al 2022 however in the case of adsorbed as iii on hematite with or without cys only the signals of adsorbed as iii at 802 cm 1 were observed müller et al 2010 zhai et al 2019 this observation indicates that the formation of fe ii as iii precipitates does not occur during the reductive dissolution process therefore the mechanism of facet dependent et process and as reallocations in the hnps hnrs or hncs system during the reductive process facilitated by cys can be summarized in fig 6 initially the equilibrium state of as adsorption is reached stage i with the addition of cys it is adsorbed on different hematite s surface and complexes with surface fe iii causing et to occur from cys to fe iii resulting in facet dependent fe ii generation coupled with as iii as v release stage ii the allocations of as iii and as v on hematite are different the released as iii is rapidly adsorbed again due to the newly exposed as binding site on the structurally stable surface of hematite while fe ii can form precipitates with as v leading to additional as v reallocations on the hematite s surface stage iii due to facet dependent et rates and the as binding site of different hematite facets the reductive dissolution and as iii as v immobilization or reallocation efficiencies on different hematite exhibit the trend of hnps hncs hnrs notably the concentrations of electron shuttles such as humic substances cys and flavin can vary widely ranging from a few nanomolar nm to tens of millimolar mm depending on different geological conditions such as soils sediments and groundwater glasser et al 2017 jiang and kappler 2008 morrison et al 2013 in our current experiment we specifically set the concentration of cys at 2 mm while achieving this concentration solely with cys may pose certain challenges it allows us to simulate the reductive dissolution process of fe oxyhydroxides facilitated by electron shuttles as demonstrated in previous research morrison et al 2013 hu et al 2021a by utilizing relatively high concentrations of electron shuttles we aim to gain a better understanding of the facet dependent electron transfer process and the reallocation of as within the hnps hnrs or hncs system furthermore it provides insights into similar processes occurring in real environmental conditions 4 conclusions this research emphasizes the importance of considering the facet dependent properties of fe minerals in understanding their behavior in the environment more fe ii is generated on hnps compared with that of hnrs and hncs with the addition of cys in contrast to the previous results which have found that the reductive dissolution of poorly crystalline fe oxyhydroxides contributes to as release kumarathilaka et al 2018 our result shows that more as v is reallocated with the addition of cys because fe ii can form new precipitates with as v while the as iii reallocation is not influence during reductive dissolution the as iii as v immobilization or reallocation is facet dependent on different hematite facets due to the facet dependent et rates and the as binding site this result highlights the role of facets on interfacial et and as reallocation process on crystalline fe oxyhydroxides this study provides insight into as immobilization in geological
