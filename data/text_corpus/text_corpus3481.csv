and modelled aerobic zone volume in different granule sizes was investigated using aerobic granular sludge from a pilot scale reactor the pilot was fed with centrate and secondary effluent amended with acetate as the main carbon source the maximum specific ammonia oxidation rates and community composition of different aerobic granular sludge size fractions were evaluated by batch tests quantitative pcr and genomic analysis small 331µm granules had a 4 72 0 09 times higher maximum specific ammonia oxidizing rate per 1 gvss and a 4 05 0 17 times higher specific amoa gene copy number than large 2225µm granules per 1 gram of wet biomass however when related to surface area small granules had 1 43 0 01 times lower maximum specific ammonia oxidation rate and a 1 66 0 04 times lower specific amoa gene copy number per unit surface than large granules experimental results aligned with modeling results in which smaller granules had a higher specific aerobic zone volume to biomass and lower specific aerobic zone volume to surface area aerobic granular sludge reactors having the same average diameter of granules may have very different proportions of granule size fractions and hence possess different nitrification rates therefore instead of the commonly reported average granule diameter a new method was proposed to determine the aerobic volume density per sample which correlated well with the nitrification rate this work provides a roadmap to control nitrification capacity by two methods a crushing larger granules into smaller fractions or b increasing the mixed

removal is expected in the u s as a result of the environmental protection agency ecoregional criteria u s epa 2002 developed for point source discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus in order to meet new regulations many wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the us will have to upgrade their systems for nitrogen removal while being limited by existing infrastructure and space to increase the nitrification capacity solids retention time srt needs to be increased to support slow growing nitrifiers requiring costly construction of large conventional aeration tanks or clarifiers benedetti et al 2013 over the last two decades aerobic granular sludge ags has become a promising alternative to the conventional activated sludge treatment process ags s dense biofilm structure allows for partially simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd in a single tank and their fast settling characteristics eliminates the need for clarifiers resulting in up to 33 reduction in volume de kreuk et al 2007 pronk et al 2015 layer et al 2020 one bottleneck to expand ags into existing infrastructure is that most treatment plants are operated in continuous flow mode whilst ags is operated in sequencing batch mode it is of increasing interest to expand this new technology into existing reactor configurations in order to upgrade wwtps to include nutrient removal capability the recent observation that ags existing in full scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr plants suggested the potential for implementing ags into retrofitted continuous flow activated sludge cfas plants wei et al 2020 one way to accomplish this is by bioaugmentation of granules into continuous flow systems a method proven to intensify nitrification capacity of a conventional activated sludge system at a 2 5 day sludge retention time srt figdore et al 2018 with the promising prospect of applying the ags technology to existing continuous flow systems a fundamental understanding of the nitrification kinetics and capacity of the augmented biomass is crucial each granule size has a different surface to volume ratio and aerobic zone volume fraction contributing to differences in nitrification rates and populations winkler et al 2011 as granule size increases over time limited penetration of substrates into deeper layers will lead to an accumulation of inert material in the core winkler et al 2015 hence decreasing overall activity and granule integrity de kreuk et al 2007b figdore et al 2017 it is intuitive that granule size selection should be an important control variable in obtaining and maintaining efficient nutrient removal however published studies addressing the relationship between nitrification rate and granule sizes are mainly based on theoretical models su and yu 2006 or focused on anammox granules winkler et al 2011 volcke et al 2010 volcke et al 2012 vlaeminck et al 2010 recent modelling work by layer et al 2020 gave a comprehensive comparison of the dynamic availability of redox zone formation between the 500 µm and 2000 µm granules at different do concentrations however a correlation between experimental nitrification rates and a broad range of granule sizes is still lacking as a result the current approaches to select for granules such as hydro cyclones and hydraulic separators ford et al 2016 morgenroth et al 1997 are operated without consideration of the optimal granule size fraction for high nitrification capacity in this study maximum specific ammonia oxidation rates maor and specific amoa gene copy numbers and specific aerobic zone volume azv were quantified for five different granule size fractions the studied ags was obtained from a pilot fed with acetate as sole carbon source in a well mixed anaerobic phase experimental data was compared to modelling results to validate the theoretical expectation of how granular size and size distribution affects nitrification capacity the aim of this work was to increase our fundamental understanding of how aerobic zone volume density azvd and surface area correlate with nitrification rates and nitrifier abundance this information will be crucial to select for optimal granule sizes and respective nutrient removal capacities in either sbr or continuous flow ags systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 operational condition of reactors there were four types of

ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria aob nob were analyzed from day 73 and day 196 of the pilot scale reactor study table 2 nitrosomonas nitrosococcus and nitrosospira table 2 were identified as major aob whereas complete ammonium oxidizing bacteria comammox ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox bacteria were not detected as also confirmed by pcr assays nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus were the most abundant aob as also reported in many wastewater treatment facilities and bio reactor studies daims et al 2006 nitrospira was the main nob which is in alignment with community compositions from other plants daims et al 2006 these findings are reasonable based on constant low nitrite concentrations in the pilot plant armenta et al 2019 that favor nitrospira k strategist over nitrobacter r strategist nogueira et al 2002 schramm et al 1999 winkler et al 2017 3 2 relationship between maximum specific ammonia oxidation rate maor specific amoa gene copy number and modeled specific aerobic zone volume azv for different granule sizes the modeled specific azv and maor per 1 biomass unit increased as the granular size decreased figure 1 a figure 1b the modeled azv per biomass unit calculated at do 2 mg l 1 had a positive linear correlation with the specific amoa gene copy numbers developed at do 2 mg l 1 r2 0 98 and the maor measured at do 9 08 mg l 1 r2 0 99 aligning with these trends specific amoa gene copy numbers had a positive linear correlation with maor r2 0 97 figure 1c these correlations suggested a proportional relationship between azv and nitrifiers community and since the maor was determined by nitrifiers communities developed at the modelled do 2 0 mg l 1 the maor had a proportional correlation with azv independent of the higher do value used 9 08 mg l 1 during the maor tests granules with the normalized size of 331 µm had a 4 05 0 17 times higher specific amoa gene copy number and 4 72 0 09 times higher maor than big granules at 2225 µm figure 1a furthermore their modeled specific azv per biomass unit was also higher by a factor of 5 53 table 4 the modelled specific azv was calculated based on the assumption that nitrifiers dominated in the aerobic zone fish images showed a strong stratification with nitrifiers localized on the granule periphery and paos in the inner core figure 2 which is in agreement with other fish images of ags de kreuk et al 2005 winkler et al 2012 winkler et al 2013 the positive linear correlation between the modeled specific azv and specific amoa gene copy numbers further confirmed the assumption was appropriate for this study overall the calculation of the oxygen penetration depth is a simplification and aims to approximate the oxygenated layer occupied with either nitrifiers or denitrifiers in different sized granules figure 1 and table 3 in reality the nitrifier distribution is not restricted to such a strict cutoff as shown in the fish image figure 2 and their distribution will depend on biofilm structure and competition with other oxygen consuming bacteria besides other factors we would finally like to note that the findings of this study differ from studies that operate with some organic carbon in the aeration phase where strong heterotrophic growth is reported to supersede nitrifiers in the granule periphery nogueira et al 2002 okabe et al 1996 this will generate steeper gradients and shorter oxygen penetration depth table 3 as heterotrophs have a higher specific oxygen consumption rate q o 2 m a x than nitrifiers earlier research based on deammonification showed that granules with a diameter of 700 µm exhibited a 3 5 times higher oxygen penetration depth than bigger granules 2 mm volcke et al 2012 likewise the oxygen penetration depth for small granules 500 µm in an ags system were 5 10 times deeper than large granules 2000 µm layer et al 2020 our findings showed a weaker trend as small granules 331 µm had only a 1 12 times higher oxygen penetration than large granules 2225 µm table 3 in fact even if the oxygen penetration depth was assumed to be the same for different granule sizes eq 9 specific azv still had a linear correlation with measured kinetic molecular data r2 0 97 figure s1 supplementary information this suggested that physiological environmental and biological factors csi q o 2 m a x do cxf in eq 1 were similar between granule sizes explanation for this homogeneity are that granules were exposed to the same amount of ammonia and diffusible carbon concentration in the pilot due to the complete mixed anerobic aerobic phase and therefore the competition between nitrifiers and heterotrophs was relatively independent from granule sizes this study is different from typical nereda type systems in which the sbr has an anaerobic plug flow feeding regime supplying the bigger and faster settling granules at the bottom with more diffusible substrates than small granules residing at the top of the sludge bed winkler et al 2011b creating a competitive edge for bigger granules layer et al 2020 in fact nitrifiers were shown to be more enriched in the big granules while small granules contained a significant fraction of fermentative bacteria that utilize the non diffusible organic substrates layer et al 2019 ali et al 2019 our result was directed toward studying the impact of granule size competition in continuous flow systems amended with vfa as sole carbon source which per definition operate with complete stirred tanks and not with plug flow figdore et al 2018 3 3 comparing the specific aerobic zone volume azv per unit of mass and surface area as mentioned in the previous section small granules 331 µm had 5 53 times higher modeled specific azv per 1 mass unit than the big granule size 2225 µm however when calculating this value per surface area unit the larger size had a 1 23 times higher specific azv than the small ones table 4 likewise the maor and specific amoa gene copy number were also higher in bigger granules when calculated for 1 mm2 surface area table 4 this information suggests that surface area is not a good parameter to monitor the ammonium oxidation capacity in practice theoretically two reactors with a similar total surface area but different granule size distributions may have different nitrification rates as the maor per surface area change with granule diameter 3 4 average granular size versus aerobic zone volume density azvd reporting average granule diameter along with nitrification rate is common in ags studies figdore et al 2018 isanta et al 2012 liu et al 2011 the nitrification rate is generally expected to increase as the average granule diameter decreases however the theoretical result of our study suggested that the average granule diameter can be misleading our modelling results showed that samples with the same average granule diameter had different maor figure 3 because the nitrification rate depends on the contribution of the individual size fractions and herewith associated distribution in nitrifier populations the model points out that the size range between 212 1180 µm yields the most dramatic changes in specific azv maor and specific amoa gene copy number after which all parameters level off figure 1d e f thus the small granule fraction strongly impacts the maor of a mixed liquor sample a sample containing a higher percentage of small granules will have a higher maor than a sample with identical average size but a lower abundance of small granular size fractions a poor correlation between average granule sizes and nitrification rates figure 3 can be confirmed by comparison two ags sbrs armenta 2019 figdore et al 2018 that were operated with similar operational parameters do around 2 mg l 1 c n of 2 9 3 4 both systems had an average granule diameter of 1 400 µm but one system had 1 5 times more granules below 600 µm and exhibited a 1 9 times higher ammonia oxidation rate and 1 2 times higher specific amoa gene copy number similarly wagner et al 2015 reported the nitrification increased from 60 to 86 6 over the course of the experiment while the average granule diameter of an ags sbr system remained around 470 µm as opposed to the average granule size specific azv per biomass unit was strongly correlated with specific amoa gene copy number and maor figure 1a b therefore we propose to use the azvd of mixed liquor to monitor nitrification rate instead of using the average granule size the azvd is the amount of aerobic zone volume per 1 unit of reactor volume to measure the azvd two important parameters are necessary granule size distribution and oxygen penetration depth for each granule size the protocol of torfs et al 2016 provides a practical method to determine the size distribution however the oxygen penetration depth is typically measured with a microelectrode li et al 2008 which is too expensive and labor intensive for a routine measurement at a wwtp alternatively the azvd can be estimated using eq 12 and an example is demonstrated in table s1 and figure s2 for a scenario of do 2 mg l 1 it should be noted that the applicability of eq 12 was demonstrated for this study based on an ags system with a well mixed anaerobic feeding and vfa as main carbon source for sbrs operated with plug flow and on real domestic wastewater small granules may harbor a significantly different microbial composition that will differentially influence the azv relative to big granules layer et al 2019 ali et al 2019 therefore the relationship between azv and nitrification rate across different granule sizes must be re evaluated for ags fed with domestic wastewater under plug flow conditions 3 5 practical implications for management of granule diameter our results have shown that granule size is an important parameter to control nitrification rates small granules have a higher surface to volume ratio but possess a lower azv per surface area table 4 from a control perspective one can either increase nitrification by breaking up big granules to increase the surface to volume ratio at the same mlss or by increasing the mlss to yield a higher number of both big and small granules resulting in higher net surface area availability for nitrification to demonstrate the effect of granule breakage a long term lab sbr was controlled at a srt of 23 days by maintaining the sludge bed at 750 ml figure 4 after 600 days of operation more than 60 of the granules became bigger than 2360 µm figure s3 supplementary information this led to the aerobic surface area deficiency which limited nitrification and caused effluent ammonia to raise over time figure 4 on day 611 granules larger than 3350 µm constituting to roughly 31 of the total reactor tss were removed from the reactor via sieving crushed in a blender and returned to the reactor as a result almost full nitrification was observed within 8 cycles after the event ca 1 mgn nh4 l 1 in effluent on day 622 granules larger than 2800 µm were blended and returned back to reactor after which more than 57 of granules were smaller than 1180 µm figure s3 supplementary information which lead to full ammonia removal there were two possible factors that led to an improvement in the nitrification rate by breaking up big granules firstly when big granules were broken up into smaller granules the mass transfer resistance per mass unit decreased and thus the azv per sludge mass increased resulting in oxygen penetration into places where oxygen was limited before at the same do of 2 mg l 1 secondly deeper layers of big granules could experience fluctuated anoxic aerobic conditions that altered through the aerobic phase layer et al 2020 in which aobs might have resided when granules were crushed these alternating aerobic anoxic zones become permanently oxygenated hence promoting greater ammonia oxidizing capacity such hypothesis was supported by a discrepancy between the specific amoa gene copy number and azv per surface area table 4 big granules had a 1 66 times higher specific amoa gene copy number per surface area than small granules but a lower ratio of 1 23 for specific azv per surface area table 4 this discrepancy indicated that a fraction of the amoa gene copy numbers in the big granules were in areas deeper than the aerobic zone the result from this experiment suggested that breaking up big granules will improve nitrification rate for ags by gaining surface area and azv per sludge mass and thus could be a method to control maintain the ags system s nitrification performance further work should be completed to investigate nitrogen removal limitations from mechanically decreasing granule sizes breaking up granules may not be necessary in systems that have little anaerobic volume fraction derlon et al 2016 wagner et al 2015 due to low vfa availability that are promoting the occurrence of smaller granules layer et al 2019 świątczak et al 2018 however systems treating high strength wastewater with high loading of vfa industrial wastewater or a sidestream ags system for mainstream bio augmentation will favor the dominance of big granules liu et al 2011 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 figdore et al 2018 and granule breakage may become necessary methods for breaking up granules may be a high speed propeller pump on the ras line or a high speed propeller within the granular sludge reactor some drawbacks of breaking up granules would include diminished snd and elevated effluent suspended solids wilen et al 2018 alternatively increased aeration capacity may be used to increase nitrification but the increase in oxygen penetration depth may come at a cost of losing denitrification capacity layer et al 2020 and high energy requirements in summary both methods granule breakage and higher aeration come with advantages and disadvantages and the best choice will depend on site specific conditions breaking up granules may not always be an option for all plant configurations especially for cfas systems with limited clarifier capacity that can lead to concerns with high effluent solids an alternative approach for increasing the nitrification capacity could be increasing the solid inventory by minimizing sludge wastage to demonstrate this relationship big granules 2000 µm were collected from the pilot and inoculated in a lab reactor that ran for short term 44 days without sludge wasting at day 0 mlss was at 4077 mgtss l 1 vss tss 0 78 and after 44 days without manually sludge wasting the mlss was built up to 6715 mgtss l 1 vss tss 0 77 meanwhile the granule fraction that was bigger than 2800 µm increased from 22 9 to 79 9 figure 5 b while the ammonia oxidation percentage increased from 23 6 0 62 to 49 7 0 20 figure 5a the system was started with exclusively big granules 2000 µm obtained by sieving pilot scale granules and after 44 days of operation only approximately 3 4 of the granules in the 212 2000 µm size range had developed in the reactor this smaller size fraction was estimated to contribute 11 8 of the net gained nitrification capacity table s3 supplementary information most of the gain in mlss occurred through big granules above 2800 µm ca 57 which was responsible for the 88 2 of that net gain in nitrification capacity and improved the nitrogen removal percentage from 22 4 0 57 to 43 6 0 09 figure 5a our experimental results have successfully shown that an increase in sludge bed volume improved the ammonia oxidation capacity which is in agreement with earlier simulation results ni et al 2008 less manual sludge wasting will also increase the srt which could lead to a deterioration in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr tchobanoglous et al 2014 rodrigo et al 1999 however the effect of srt on ebpr performance is highly dependent upon the wastewater influent readily bioavailable cod rbcod to p ratios when rbcod p loading is higher than value of 20 6 required for p removal wang et al 2013 gaos can grow on the excess cod and therefore will not be competing with paos nielsen et al 2019 good p removal performances have been demonstrated in many ags systems with srt up to 30 60 days and high bcod p ratios in the range of 30 71 campo et al 2020 lee et al 2007 zuo et al 2012 this is congruent with results of our short term lab reactor study where the p removal capacity was above 94 during the operational period influent rbcod p 20 1 nevertheless it is known in wastewater treatment processes that long srt is not desired due to many reasons such as increased aeration requirement due to more endogenous respiration and reduced aeration efficiency wong et al 2003 therefore increasing mlss could be a good temporary solution but for the long term operation maintaining the volumetric nitrification capacity of a reactor by reduction of granular sizes will be a more optimal solution untreated domestic wastewater has a bod n ratio of 5 8 and cod n ratio of 14 7 tchobanoglous et al 2014 which is in the range of the pilot short term reactors bcod n of 3 5 and the long term reactor bcod n of 10 of this study the higher cod n ratio is known to result in higher heterotrophic growth and lower relative nitrifiers abundance lackner et al 2008 which would affect the oxygen penetration depth of the granules as shown in table 3 however the difference in c n ratios did not conflict with the conclusions made from the reactor operations which was to demonstrate the strategies breaking up granules and increasing mlss for improving nitrification rate this work aimed to study the nitrifier competition in different granule sizes assuming that granules will be integrated in continuous flow systems with a mixed anaerobic feed and vfa as the main carbon source these feeding regime and influent characteristics will lead to different competition amongst heterotrophs and nitrifiers and therefore the here presented results differ from studies conducted with an anaerobic plug flow reactor ali et al 2019 layers et al 2020 implementing the bioaugmentation of sidestream granules in cfas is a newly developed idea figdore et al 2018 and this study aimed to increase our understanding about how granule size influences nitrification capacity in these types of systems 4 conclusion in a well mixed reactor fed with acetate as a sole carbon source specific azv per biomass unit governs the nitrifier population and thus the maor this phenomenon was proven by a linear relationship between a measured maor and b and specific amoa gene copy number versus modeled specific azv per biomass unit in comparison to large granules 2225 µm small granules 331 µm had a 4 05 0 17 times higher specific amoa gene copy number and 4 72 0 09 times higher maor per biomass unit therefore if the main goal of a plant is to improve nitrification rate it is best to select and retain granules with the diameter from 212 425 µm as this offers the best nitrification rate a 5 5 times increase in the granule fraction smaller than 1180 µm by manually crushing big granules 2800 µm increased the ammonia oxidation rate by 2 3 times this demonstrated mechanical breakup of granules can be used to promote nitrification rate as granules mature during long term lab sbr operation nitrification efficiency increased from 23 to 50 after increasing the solids inventory by 65 suggesting that the management of solids in the system can help to regulate nitrification in a short term the average granular size does not correlate well to the ammonia oxidation capacity instead total azvd is a better parameter to monitor nitrification rate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

and modelled aerobic zone volume in different granule sizes was investigated using aerobic granular sludge from a pilot scale reactor the pilot was fed with centrate and secondary effluent amended with acetate as the main carbon source the maximum specific ammonia oxidation rates and community composition of different aerobic granular sludge size fractions were evaluated by batch tests quantitative pcr and genomic analysis small 331µm granules had a 4 72 0 09 times higher maximum specific ammonia oxidizing rate per 1 gvss and a 4 05 0 17 times higher specific amoa gene copy number than large 2225µm granules per 1 gram of wet biomass however when related to surface area small granules had 1 43 0 01 times lower maximum specific ammonia oxidation rate and a 1 66 0 04 times lower specific amoa gene copy number per unit surface than large granules experimental results aligned with modeling results in which smaller granules had a higher specific aerobic zone volume to biomass and lower specific aerobic zone volume to surface area aerobic granular sludge reactors having the same average diameter of granules may have very different proportions of granule size fractions and hence possess different nitrification rates therefore instead of the commonly reported average granule diameter a new method was proposed to determine the aerobic volume density per sample which correlated well with the nitrification rate this work provides a roadmap to control nitrification capacity by two methods a crushing larger granules into smaller fractions or b increasing the mixed

removal is expected in the u s as a result of the environmental protection agency ecoregional criteria u s epa 2002 developed for point source discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus in order to meet new regulations many wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the us will have to upgrade their systems for nitrogen removal while being limited by existing infrastructure and space to increase the nitrification capacity solids retention time srt needs to be increased to support slow growing nitrifiers requiring costly construction of large conventional aeration tanks or clarifiers benedetti et al 2013 over the last two decades aerobic granular sludge ags has become a promising alternative to the conventional activated sludge treatment process ags s dense biofilm structure allows for partially simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd in a single tank and their fast settling characteristics eliminates the need for clarifiers resulting in up to 33 reduction in volume de kreuk et al 2007 pronk et al 2015 layer et al 2020 one bottleneck to expand ags into existing infrastructure is that most treatment plants are operated in continuous flow mode whilst ags is operated in sequencing batch mode it is of increasing interest to expand this new technology into existing reactor configurations in order to upgrade wwtps to include nutrient removal capability the recent observation that ags existing in full scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr plants suggested the potential for implementing ags into retrofitted continuous flow activated sludge cfas plants wei et al 2020 one way to accomplish this is by bioaugmentation of granules into continuous flow systems a method proven to intensify nitrification capacity of a conventional activated sludge system at a 2 5 day sludge retention time srt figdore et al 2018 with the promising prospect of applying the ags technology to existing continuous flow systems a fundamental understanding of the nitrification kinetics and capacity of the augmented biomass is crucial each granule size has a different surface to volume ratio and aerobic zone volume fraction contributing to differences in nitrification rates and populations winkler et al 2011 as granule size increases over time limited penetration of substrates into deeper layers will lead to an accumulation of inert material in the core winkler et al 2015 hence decreasing overall activity and granule integrity de kreuk et al 2007b figdore et al 2017 it is intuitive that granule size selection should be an important control variable in obtaining and maintaining efficient nutrient removal however published studies addressing the relationship between nitrification rate and granule sizes are mainly based on theoretical models su and yu 2006 or focused on anammox granules winkler et al 2011 volcke et al 2010 volcke et al 2012 vlaeminck et al 2010 recent modelling work by layer et al 2020 gave a comprehensive comparison of the dynamic availability of redox zone formation between the 500 µm and 2000 µm granules at different do concentrations however a correlation between experimental nitrification rates and a broad range of granule sizes is still lacking as a result the current approaches to select for granules such as hydro cyclones and hydraulic separators ford et al 2016 morgenroth et al 1997 are operated without consideration of the optimal granule size fraction for high nitrification capacity in this study maximum specific ammonia oxidation rates maor and specific amoa gene copy numbers and specific aerobic zone volume azv were quantified for five different granule size fractions the studied ags was obtained from a pilot fed with acetate as sole carbon source in a well mixed anaerobic phase experimental data was compared to modelling results to validate the theoretical expectation of how granular size and size distribution affects nitrification capacity the aim of this work was to increase our fundamental understanding of how aerobic zone volume density azvd and surface area correlate with nitrification rates and nitrifier abundance this information will be crucial to select for optimal granule sizes and respective nutrient removal capacities in either sbr or continuous flow ags systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 operational condition of reactors there were four types of

ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria aob nob were analyzed from day 73 and day 196 of the pilot scale reactor study table 2 nitrosomonas nitrosococcus and nitrosospira table 2 were identified as major aob whereas complete ammonium oxidizing bacteria comammox ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox bacteria were not detected as also confirmed by pcr assays nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus were the most abundant aob as also reported in many wastewater treatment facilities and bio reactor studies daims et al 2006 nitrospira was the main nob which is in alignment with community compositions from other plants daims et al 2006 these findings are reasonable based on constant low nitrite concentrations in the pilot plant armenta et al 2019 that favor nitrospira k strategist over nitrobacter r strategist nogueira et al 2002 schramm et al 1999 winkler et al 2017 3 2 relationship between maximum specific ammonia oxidation rate maor specific amoa gene copy number and modeled specific aerobic zone volume azv for different granule sizes the modeled specific azv and maor per 1 biomass unit increased as the granular size decreased figure 1 a figure 1b the modeled azv per biomass unit calculated at do 2 mg l 1 had a positive linear correlation with the specific amoa gene copy numbers developed at do 2 mg l 1 r2 0 98 and the maor measured at do 9 08 mg l 1 r2 0 99 aligning with these trends specific amoa gene copy numbers had a positive linear correlation with maor r2 0 97 figure 1c these correlations suggested a proportional relationship between azv and nitrifiers community and since the maor was determined by nitrifiers communities developed at the modelled do 2 0 mg l 1 the maor had a proportional correlation with azv independent of the higher do value used 9 08 mg l 1 during the maor tests granules with the normalized size of 331 µm had a 4 05 0 17 times higher specific amoa gene copy number and 4 72 0 09 times higher maor than big granules at 2225 µm figure 1a furthermore their modeled specific azv per biomass unit was also higher by a factor of 5 53 table 4 the modelled specific azv was calculated based on the assumption that nitrifiers dominated in the aerobic zone fish images showed a strong stratification with nitrifiers localized on the granule periphery and paos in the inner core figure 2 which is in agreement with other fish images of ags de kreuk et al 2005 winkler et al 2012 winkler et al 2013 the positive linear correlation between the modeled specific azv and specific amoa gene copy numbers further confirmed the assumption was appropriate for this study overall the calculation of the oxygen penetration depth is a simplification and aims to approximate the oxygenated layer occupied with either nitrifiers or denitrifiers in different sized granules figure 1 and table 3 in reality the nitrifier distribution is not restricted to such a strict cutoff as shown in the fish image figure 2 and their distribution will depend on biofilm structure and competition with other oxygen consuming bacteria besides other factors we would finally like to note that the findings of this study differ from studies that operate with some organic carbon in the aeration phase where strong heterotrophic growth is reported to supersede nitrifiers in the granule periphery nogueira et al 2002 okabe et al 1996 this will generate steeper gradients and shorter oxygen penetration depth table 3 as heterotrophs have a higher specific oxygen consumption rate q o 2 m a x than nitrifiers earlier research based on deammonification showed that granules with a diameter of 700 µm exhibited a 3 5 times higher oxygen penetration depth than bigger granules 2 mm volcke et al 2012 likewise the oxygen penetration depth for small granules 500 µm in an ags system were 5 10 times deeper than large granules 2000 µm layer et al 2020 our findings showed a weaker trend as small granules 331 µm had only a 1 12 times higher oxygen penetration than large granules 2225 µm table 3 in fact even if the oxygen penetration depth was assumed to be the same for different granule sizes eq 9 specific azv still had a linear correlation with measured kinetic molecular data r2 0 97 figure s1 supplementary information this suggested that physiological environmental and biological factors csi q o 2 m a x do cxf in eq 1 were similar between granule sizes explanation for this homogeneity are that granules were exposed to the same amount of ammonia and diffusible carbon concentration in the pilot due to the complete mixed anerobic aerobic phase and therefore the competition between nitrifiers and heterotrophs was relatively independent from granule sizes this study is different from typical nereda type systems in which the sbr has an anaerobic plug flow feeding regime supplying the bigger and faster settling granules at the bottom with more diffusible substrates than small granules residing at the top of the sludge bed winkler et al 2011b creating a competitive edge for bigger granules layer et al 2020 in fact nitrifiers were shown to be more enriched in the big granules while small granules contained a significant fraction of fermentative bacteria that utilize the non diffusible organic substrates layer et al 2019 ali et al 2019 our result was directed toward studying the impact of granule size competition in continuous flow systems amended with vfa as sole carbon source which per definition operate with complete stirred tanks and not with plug flow figdore et al 2018 3 3 comparing the specific aerobic zone volume azv per unit of mass and surface area as mentioned in the previous section small granules 331 µm had 5 53 times higher modeled specific azv per 1 mass unit than the big granule size 2225 µm however when calculating this value per surface area unit the larger size had a 1 23 times higher specific azv than the small ones table 4 likewise the maor and specific amoa gene copy number were also higher in bigger granules when calculated for 1 mm2 surface area table 4 this information suggests that surface area is not a good parameter to monitor the ammonium oxidation capacity in practice theoretically two reactors with a similar total surface area but different granule size distributions may have different nitrification rates as the maor per surface area change with granule diameter 3 4 average granular size versus aerobic zone volume density azvd reporting average granule diameter along with nitrification rate is common in ags studies figdore et al 2018 isanta et al 2012 liu et al 2011 the nitrification rate is generally expected to increase as the average granule diameter decreases however the theoretical result of our study suggested that the average granule diameter can be misleading our modelling results showed that samples with the same average granule diameter had different maor figure 3 because the nitrification rate depends on the contribution of the individual size fractions and herewith associated distribution in nitrifier populations the model points out that the size range between 212 1180 µm yields the most dramatic changes in specific azv maor and specific amoa gene copy number after which all parameters level off figure 1d e f thus the small granule fraction strongly impacts the maor of a mixed liquor sample a sample containing a higher percentage of small granules will have a higher maor than a sample with identical average size but a lower abundance of small granular size fractions a poor correlation between average granule sizes and nitrification rates figure 3 can be confirmed by comparison two ags sbrs armenta 2019 figdore et al 2018 that were operated with similar operational parameters do around 2 mg l 1 c n of 2 9 3 4 both systems had an average granule diameter of 1 400 µm but one system had 1 5 times more granules below 600 µm and exhibited a 1 9 times higher ammonia oxidation rate and 1 2 times higher specific amoa gene copy number similarly wagner et al 2015 reported the nitrification increased from 60 to 86 6 over the course of the experiment while the average granule diameter of an ags sbr system remained around 470 µm as opposed to the average granule size specific azv per biomass unit was strongly correlated with specific amoa gene copy number and maor figure 1a b therefore we propose to use the azvd of mixed liquor to monitor nitrification rate instead of using the average granule size the azvd is the amount of aerobic zone volume per 1 unit of reactor volume to measure the azvd two important parameters are necessary granule size distribution and oxygen penetration depth for each granule size the protocol of torfs et al 2016 provides a practical method to determine the size distribution however the oxygen penetration depth is typically measured with a microelectrode li et al 2008 which is too expensive and labor intensive for a routine measurement at a wwtp alternatively the azvd can be estimated using eq 12 and an example is demonstrated in table s1 and figure s2 for a scenario of do 2 mg l 1 it should be noted that the applicability of eq 12 was demonstrated for this study based on an ags system with a well mixed anaerobic feeding and vfa as main carbon source for sbrs operated with plug flow and on real domestic wastewater small granules may harbor a significantly different microbial composition that will differentially influence the azv relative to big granules layer et al 2019 ali et al 2019 therefore the relationship between azv and nitrification rate across different granule sizes must be re evaluated for ags fed with domestic wastewater under plug flow conditions 3 5 practical implications for management of granule diameter our results have shown that granule size is an important parameter to control nitrification rates small granules have a higher surface to volume ratio but possess a lower azv per surface area table 4 from a control perspective one can either increase nitrification by breaking up big granules to increase the surface to volume ratio at the same mlss or by increasing the mlss to yield a higher number of both big and small granules resulting in higher net surface area availability for nitrification to demonstrate the effect of granule breakage a long term lab sbr was controlled at a srt of 23 days by maintaining the sludge bed at 750 ml figure 4 after 600 days of operation more than 60 of the granules became bigger than 2360 µm figure s3 supplementary information this led to the aerobic surface area deficiency which limited nitrification and caused effluent ammonia to raise over time figure 4 on day 611 granules larger than 3350 µm constituting to roughly 31 of the total reactor tss were removed from the reactor via sieving crushed in a blender and returned to the reactor as a result almost full nitrification was observed within 8 cycles after the event ca 1 mgn nh4 l 1 in effluent on day 622 granules larger than 2800 µm were blended and returned back to reactor after which more than 57 of granules were smaller than 1180 µm figure s3 supplementary information which lead to full ammonia removal there were two possible factors that led to an improvement in the nitrification rate by breaking up big granules firstly when big granules were broken up into smaller granules the mass transfer resistance per mass unit decreased and thus the azv per sludge mass increased resulting in oxygen penetration into places where oxygen was limited before at the same do of 2 mg l 1 secondly deeper layers of big granules could experience fluctuated anoxic aerobic conditions that altered through the aerobic phase layer et al 2020 in which aobs might have resided when granules were crushed these alternating aerobic anoxic zones become permanently oxygenated hence promoting greater ammonia oxidizing capacity such hypothesis was supported by a discrepancy between the specific amoa gene copy number and azv per surface area table 4 big granules had a 1 66 times higher specific amoa gene copy number per surface area than small granules but a lower ratio of 1 23 for specific azv per surface area table 4 this discrepancy indicated that a fraction of the amoa gene copy numbers in the big granules were in areas deeper than the aerobic zone the result from this experiment suggested that breaking up big granules will improve nitrification rate for ags by gaining surface area and azv per sludge mass and thus could be a method to control maintain the ags system s nitrification performance further work should be completed to investigate nitrogen removal limitations from mechanically decreasing granule sizes breaking up granules may not be necessary in systems that have little anaerobic volume fraction derlon et al 2016 wagner et al 2015 due to low vfa availability that are promoting the occurrence of smaller granules layer et al 2019 świątczak et al 2018 however systems treating high strength wastewater with high loading of vfa industrial wastewater or a sidestream ags system for mainstream bio augmentation will favor the dominance of big granules liu et al 2011 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 figdore et al 2018 and granule breakage may become necessary methods for breaking up granules may be a high speed propeller pump on the ras line or a high speed propeller within the granular sludge reactor some drawbacks of breaking up granules would include diminished snd and elevated effluent suspended solids wilen et al 2018 alternatively increased aeration capacity may be used to increase nitrification but the increase in oxygen penetration depth may come at a cost of losing denitrification capacity layer et al 2020 and high energy requirements in summary both methods granule breakage and higher aeration come with advantages and disadvantages and the best choice will depend on site specific conditions breaking up granules may not always be an option for all plant configurations especially for cfas systems with limited clarifier capacity that can lead to concerns with high effluent solids an alternative approach for increasing the nitrification capacity could be increasing the solid inventory by minimizing sludge wastage to demonstrate this relationship big granules 2000 µm were collected from the pilot and inoculated in a lab reactor that ran for short term 44 days without sludge wasting at day 0 mlss was at 4077 mgtss l 1 vss tss 0 78 and after 44 days without manually sludge wasting the mlss was built up to 6715 mgtss l 1 vss tss 0 77 meanwhile the granule fraction that was bigger than 2800 µm increased from 22 9 to 79 9 figure 5 b while the ammonia oxidation percentage increased from 23 6 0 62 to 49 7 0 20 figure 5a the system was started with exclusively big granules 2000 µm obtained by sieving pilot scale granules and after 44 days of operation only approximately 3 4 of the granules in the 212 2000 µm size range had developed in the reactor this smaller size fraction was estimated to contribute 11 8 of the net gained nitrification capacity table s3 supplementary information most of the gain in mlss occurred through big granules above 2800 µm ca 57 which was responsible for the 88 2 of that net gain in nitrification capacity and improved the nitrogen removal percentage from 22 4 0 57 to 43 6 0 09 figure 5a our experimental results have successfully shown that an increase in sludge bed volume improved the ammonia oxidation capacity which is in agreement with earlier simulation results ni et al 2008 less manual sludge wasting will also increase the srt which could lead to a deterioration in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr tchobanoglous et al 2014 rodrigo et al 1999 however the effect of srt on ebpr performance is highly dependent upon the wastewater influent readily bioavailable cod rbcod to p ratios when rbcod p loading is higher than value of 20 6 required for p removal wang et al 2013 gaos can grow on the excess cod and therefore will not be competing with paos nielsen et al 2019 good p removal performances have been demonstrated in many ags systems with srt up to 30 60 days and high bcod p ratios in the range of 30 71 campo et al 2020 lee et al 2007 zuo et al 2012 this is congruent with results of our short term lab reactor study where the p removal capacity was above 94 during the operational period influent rbcod p 20 1 nevertheless it is known in wastewater treatment processes that long srt is not desired due to many reasons such as increased aeration requirement due to more endogenous respiration and reduced aeration efficiency wong et al 2003 therefore increasing mlss could be a good temporary solution but for the long term operation maintaining the volumetric nitrification capacity of a reactor by reduction of granular sizes will be a more optimal solution untreated domestic wastewater has a bod n ratio of 5 8 and cod n ratio of 14 7 tchobanoglous et al 2014 which is in the range of the pilot short term reactors bcod n of 3 5 and the long term reactor bcod n of 10 of this study the higher cod n ratio is known to result in higher heterotrophic growth and lower relative nitrifiers abundance lackner et al 2008 which would affect the oxygen penetration depth of the granules as shown in table 3 however the difference in c n ratios did not conflict with the conclusions made from the reactor operations which was to demonstrate the strategies breaking up granules and increasing mlss for improving nitrification rate this work aimed to study the nitrifier competition in different granule sizes assuming that granules will be integrated in continuous flow systems with a mixed anaerobic feed and vfa as the main carbon source these feeding regime and influent characteristics will lead to different competition amongst heterotrophs and nitrifiers and therefore the here presented results differ from studies conducted with an anaerobic plug flow reactor ali et al 2019 layers et al 2020 implementing the bioaugmentation of sidestream granules in cfas is a newly developed idea figdore et al 2018 and this study aimed to increase our understanding about how granule size influences nitrification capacity in these types of systems 4 conclusion in a well mixed reactor fed with acetate as a sole carbon source specific azv per biomass unit governs the nitrifier population and thus the maor this phenomenon was proven by a linear relationship between a measured maor and b and specific amoa gene copy number versus modeled specific azv per biomass unit in comparison to large granules 2225 µm small granules 331 µm had a 4 05 0 17 times higher specific amoa gene copy number and 4 72 0 09 times higher maor per biomass unit therefore if the main goal of a plant is to improve nitrification rate it is best to select and retain granules with the diameter from 212 425 µm as this offers the best nitrification rate a 5 5 times increase in the granule fraction smaller than 1180 µm by manually crushing big granules 2800 µm increased the ammonia oxidation rate by 2 3 times this demonstrated mechanical breakup of granules can be used to promote nitrification rate as granules mature during long term lab sbr operation nitrification efficiency increased from 23 to 50 after increasing the solids inventory by 65 suggesting that the management of solids in the system can help to regulate nitrification in a short term the average granular size does not correlate well to the ammonia oxidation capacity instead total azvd is a better parameter to monitor nitrification rate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

hydroperoxide species on the surface of mps to prevent the formation of hydroxyl radical was the possible mechanism for the inhibiting effects after antioxidant was exhausted its photo degradation products could become the dominant contributor to influence the aging process of mps this is the first work exploring the role of antioxidant on the aging process of pp mps in simulated ocean

plastic wastes in the environment would be subjected to many weathering processes including ultraviolet oxidation mechanical abrasion and biodegradation alimi et al 2018 charles and carraher 2013 this manifested that aged mps are widely existed in the outdoor environment especially in the ocean environment ultraviolet uv oxidation is introduced as a fundamental way to form aged mps in aquatic system feldman 2002 when exposed to uv light the surface of mps would become embrittlement and produce pores holes and cracks as the surface reaction proceeded the expanded pores and crakes on the

kedzierski et al 2018 plastic debris in the environment are normally comprised of monomers and plastic additives such as flame retardants plasticizers antioxidants and stabilizers hermabessiere et al 2017 however available data dealing with the effect of plastic additives on the photochemical weathering of plastic debris in natural waters is quite limited it has been assumed that antioxidants are the key ingredients in plastic materials to extend their life for use evidence to this assumption is that antioxidants can scavenge free radicals in polymer matrix and interference the photo degradation process of polymers in the environment fouyer et al 2012 li et al 2015 reingruber et al 2010 other additives may have less effect because limited information has reported for the direct effect of these chemicals on the mps aging process for example plasticizers are employed to promote the flexibility stretchability and durability of plastic products zhang et al 2018 slip agents generally injected or extracted in plastic formulations to improve the lubricate properties of polymer film and reduce the friction coefficient for the surface of a polymers markarian j 2007 therefore characterizing the impact of antioxidants on the aging process of mps is critical to trace the source and formation of mps in aquatic environment this study systematically investigated the aging

worldwide figure s1 of the supporting information si the mps of the materials were exposed to uv for 12 d in artificial seawater the changes of plastic particle size crystallinity melting temperature contact angle and surface charges of mps were developed to seek the possible fragmenting mechanism of mps in marine environment the role of antioxidants in the aging process of pp mps was probed by mixing different amounts of irgafos 168 in pure pp polymer the obtained data will provide new insight to evaluate the effect of plastic additives on the aging process of hydrocarbon mps in marine

irgafos 168 the size and shape of initial pp mps i e pure pp meal box and tea cup mps were similar with each other and uniformed between 400 500 μm by sieving through a 500 μm and 400 μm stainless steel sifter prior to use in uv irradiation experiments figure s2 initial particle size for pure pp meal box tea cup as well as 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained pp mps in the uv irradiation

stored at 4 c before use 2 3 ultraviolet uv irradiation experiments the aging process of pure pp meal box and tea cup mps in artificial seawater were performed at room temperature about 25 c using an xpa series of photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang electromechanical technology co ltd china equipped with a 500 w mercury lamp uv365 100 w m2 the artificial seawater used in aging experiments was

mps and 20 ml artificial seawater were added into silica tubes the silica tubes were put in a thermostatic water bath 25 c with a magnetic stirrer 700 rad min at the first 4 d of uv irradiation mps were floating on the surface of water because of the non polar and lower density 0 91 g cm3 of pp mps during 4 d to 12 d uv irradiation period most of the mps were suspending in the reaction system figure s3 tubes were removed at 0 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 d 12 h light irradiation per day and the mp samples were collected by passing through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter which was baked in muffle furnace at 450 c for 4 h to remove the potential impurities residue in the membrane prior use each irradiation experiments were conducted in triplicate dark controls were conducted by wrapping the silica tubes with aluminum foil under the same experiment condition 2 4 identification and quantification of irgafos 168 and dehp two strategies of target and non target strategies were commonly used to determine the potential additives and non intentionally added substances nias in mps products as well as their accurate amount gc ms screening analysis coupled with the mass spectrometry library i e epa environmental protection agency tandem mass spectrometry nist national institute of standards and technology 17 tandem ms library and wiley library were able to analyzed and identified most of the volatile chemicals in mps vera et al 2018 prior gc ms analysis ultrasonic assisted extraction ningbo licheng instrument co ltd china was performed to extract additives from the tested pp mp samples

per cycle for 3 times the extract temperature output power and frequency of ultrasonic cleaning device were set at 25 c 300 w and 40 khz respectively after extraction the extract was combined and concentrated to 500 μl by nitrogen flow before analysis thermo scientific dsq ii gas chromatography coupled with a single quadrupole detector was used to determine the potential additives in meal box and tea cup mps the ion source was electron ionization 70 ev the chromatographic column was db 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 mm helium was the carrier gas and the flow was set at 1 ml min the procedure temperature was initialed at 80 c 2 min then promoted to 300 c with the rate of 15 c min and keep for 7 min the temperature of injection and ion source were set at 280 c and 230 c respectively the ion range was varied from m z 60 to m z 650 in the full scan analysis the target compounds were identified by comparing the retention time and qualitative quantitative ions with external standards the concentration of target compounds of irgafos 168 and dehp in meal box and tea cup were determined by external standards fragment ions with m z 441 647 and 191 were used in irgafos 168 and 149 167 and 279 for dehp quantification spiked recovery study was performed by adding three levels of irgafos 168 and dehp into pure n hexane and replicate for six times yang et al 2016 the spiked concentrations were set at 1 ppm 10 ppm and 50 ppm respectively the measured average recoveries of irgafos 168 and dehp were 98 2 10 5 and 83 7 8 73 no target compounds were detected in all blanks the results of all irgafos 168 concentration were corrected by spiked recoveries 2 5 characterization of mps surface morphology and o c atom ratio of virgin and aged pp mps were explored by a field emission scanning electron microscope coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer system sem eds fei quanta 250 usa the size distribution of mps was stated based on the sem images and imagej software liu et al 2019b the properties of mp samples including surface functional groups surface zeta potential melting temperature contact angle and rubbery region were determined by

calorimetry analyzer tg dsc sta449f3 germany contact angle goniometer oca 30 dataphysics instruments gmbh and x ray diffraction xrd x tra thermofisher usa respectively the total organic carbon toc of aqueous solution was measured using a toc analyzer elementar vario germany 2 6 quantification of hydroxyl radical formed in the aging process of pp mps benzoic acid ba was used to quantify the formed hydroxyl radical oh by mps under uv irradiation briefly 0 5 g of pp mps was added into the mixture containing 10 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs and 10 mm ba after uv irradiation 0 5 ml of suspension was withdrawn and passed through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter and mixed with 0 5 ml methanol before analysis the formed p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with a uv detector the cumulated oh was determined by the 5 87 times of the p hba concentration zhang et al 2016 agilent 1200 series of hplc coupled with agilent eclipse xdb c18 reversed phase column 5 μm 250 mm 4 mm and uv vis detector was utilized to determine the concentration of p hba in tested solution the mobile phase contained 0 1 trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution and methanol 65 35 at the flow rate of 1 ml min zhang et al 2016 the injection volume detection wavelength and temperature were set at 20 μl 255 nm and 40 c respectively 2 7 statistical analysis pearson correlation analysis was done to define the correlation of pp carbonyl index ci and average particle size versus uv irradiation time using ibm spss 19 for windows the p value less than 0 05 was defined as significant the results presented in this study are the mean values standard deviation sd based on triplicate experiments 3 result and discussion 3 1 photo aging of mps from pp food packaging materials in artificial seawater to explore the aging process of mps from pp food packaging materials in ocean environment transparent disposable meal box and tea cup were chosen as representatives with uv exposure in artificial seawater for 20 d from the atr ftir spectra of uv exposed mp samples from meal box fig 1 a and tea cup fig 1b apparent signals were observed at 1650 1850 cm 1 and 3250 3600 cm 1 after 20 d of uv irradiation which were identified as the carbonyl i e ketones esters and lactones and hydroxyl i e alcohols and hydroperoxide stretching vibrations respectively brandon et al 2016 tang et al 2019 similar types of signals were observed from the natural weathering of pp polymers indicating the laboratory accelerated aging procedure may be feasible to investigate the long term aging behavior of mps in the environment ni et al 2015 rajakumar et al 2009 as no apparent signal in carbonyl and hydroxyl region was discovered in dark conditions figure s4a and figure s4b in control samples the oxygen containing functional groups produced on the surface of aged mps might be mainly attributed to the reaction of pp with oxygen in water during photo irradiation yousif et al 2012 meanwhile these newly formed oxygen containing functional groups might also result in the changes of plastic properties including polarity hydrophobicity and surface charging which will impact the further aging of mps in aqueous solution liu et al 2019a carbonyl index ci was utilized to quantitatively evaluate the aging degrees of mps during oxidation period which was calculated by the ratio of maximum carbonyl peak at 1715 cm 1 to the reference peak at 974 cm 1 rajakumar et al 2009 the ci value of pure pp meal box and tea cup mps have reached to a pseudo equilibrium state in 20 days of uv irradiation fig 1c 1d for meal box and tea cup the ci value displayed little changes before the first 12 d then increased sharply and finally reached the steady state between 12 d to 20 d of test periods the changes for the alterations of meal box and tea cup before and after 12 d were also demonstrated by the mps properties of crystallinity figure s5a melting temperature figure s5b surface zeta potential figure s5c and particle size figure s5d this indicated that the aging process of mps made from pp products i e meal box and tea cup were significantly impeded in the first 12 d of uv irradiation compared with pure pp mps thus 12 d of uv irradiation duration was chosen in this study to better understand the difference and potential mechanism of the aging process between pure pp and pp products in seawater as depicted in figure s6a the alterations of ci for pure pp versus aging time t days was likely to be well fitted through pseudo first order kinetics ci 0 65 1 exp 0 29t r2 0 91 which provided evidence that more oxygen containing functional groups were generated during the mps aging process besides the ci value displayed significant correlation with alteration time r 0 921 p 0 01 suggesting that the abundance of carbonyl group and oxygen percentage were suitable for reflecting the changed properties of mps during aging process compared to the aging of pp plastic in abient water environment the ci value of pure pp obtained after 12 d of uv irradiation was comparable to the ci value 0 8 for pp mps after 210 days uv irradiation uv a 11 01 w m2 uv b 0 12 w m2 uv c 0 04 w m2 temperature 43 45 c in coastal seawater of korea song et al 2017 2411 h 200 days 12 h sunlight per day of weathering under seawater sunlight conditions sunshine with radiance 338 647 mj m 2 at 13 8 35 6 c in taiwan ci 0 78 tang et al 2019 and lower than 360 days of sunlight exposure ci 1 2 in subtropical humid zone of guangzhou china temperature 22 6 c total solar radiation 4590 mj m2 humidity 75 ni et al 2015 table s1 these illustrated the photo oxidation level of mps under 12 days of uv irradiation experiments in this study was relevant to approximately 200 days of sunlight exposure in the real aquatic environment the ci values of meal box from 0 01 0 004 to 0 16 0 028 and tea cup from 0 05 0 011 to 0 19 0 001 mps displayed a little change within 12 d uv exposure the changes of another parameter related to the aging extent of mps o c atom ratio showed the similar tends with the ci results the o c atom ratio in pure pp mps was increased from 0 02 0 014 to 0 14 0 021 after 12 d of uv irradiation figure s6b while that of the meal box and tea cup mps varied from 0 02 0 005 to 0 05 0 003 and from 0 02 0 014 to 0 05 0 001 respectively implied that a mass of carbon centered monomers and oligomers were generated on the polymer backbone during the photo aging process however it is worthy to note that both ci value and o c ratio of meal box and tea cup hardly showed significant changes regardless of in light or darkness conditions during the experimental period figure s6c and figure s6d suggesting the aging time of plastic debris from commercial plastic products in natural seawater may be longer than that of pure ones 3 2 characterization of virgin and aged pp mps under uv exposure uv irradiation is believed to be essential on the photo aging and degradation process of plastics in the water environment and associated with changes of plastic molecular arrangement and surface properties time dependent variations of crystallinity melting temperature surface zeta potential and particle size were measured to better understand the aging process of pp mps in artificial seawater the crystallinity r 0 952 p 0 01 melting temperature r 0 761 p 0 05 surface zeta potential r 924 p 0 01 and particle size r 0 918 p 0 01 for aged pure pp mps exhibited significant correlation with the ci value during uv irradiation this indicated that sustainable uv irradiation might be responsible for the modified properties of pp mps the crystallinity of pure pp mps estimated according to the peak at 998 cm 1 and 974 cm 1 in atr ftir spectra brandon et al 2016 were decreased from 62 04 1 26 uv oxidation for 0 d to 56 40 1 99 uv oxidation for 12 d no obvious changes were found for the crystallinity of meal box from 61 26 0 76 to 61 23 1 30 and tea cup mps from 61 21 0 37 to 60 66 0 70 during the aging period fig 2 a the melting temperature was reduced from 166 33 0 11 c to 159 25 0 82 c for pure pp mps as well as 156 16 3 71 c to 149 08 0 11 c for meal box and from 167 24 0 12 c to 149 250 35 c for tea cup after 12 d uv oxidation fig 2b besides no significant variations of crystallinity and melting temperature were observed in dark conditions figure s7a and s7b the decrease of crystallinity and melting temperature for three types of aged pp mps after uv irradiation implied that the photo aging process could result in the increase of rubbery non crystallinity domains and the formation of more flexible molecular structure in pp mps the surface zeta potential of pure pp mps was decreased from 1 37 2 02 mv uv exposure for 0 d to 6 12 1 72 mv uv exposure for 12 d fig 2c with exiguous changes observed in dark controls figure s7c indicating that the photo aging process could induce more negative surface charges on mps in artificial seawater this may assign to the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of aged mps which will enhance their hydrophilicity and polarity fu et al 2016 rajakumar et al 2009 differing from pure pp the surface zeta potential of meal box and tea cup displayed no difference with the aging time fig 2c suggesting that the aging process of pp food packaging products were likely to be delayed compared with pure pp the finding was further confirmed by the changes of particle size within the test period in fig 2d the particle size of pure pp mps was decreased from 443 65 23 25 μm to 34 18 7 70 μm after uv exposure in artificial seawater for 12 d however the average particle size of mps from meal box and tea cup were not significantly changed under uv and in dark conditions figure s7d these indicated that the uv exposure induced aging process of pp products in artificial seawater were significantly inhibited compared with that of pure ones which may be ascribed to the influence of added chemicals on the photo degradation process of plastic materials thus exploring the impact of plastic additives on the modification of plastic properties are essential to evaluate their further fate and potential environmental risks in the marine environment 3 3 effect of plastic additives on the photo aging of pp materials in seawater 3 3 1 analysis of the dominant additives incorporated in the meal box and tea cup varied types and contents of plastic additives i e antioxidants plasticizers heat stabilizers and slip agents were reported to be added in polymeric materials to improve their performance in manufacturing or using process chang et al 2013 in this study gc ms full scan analysis was carried out to explore the potential additives presented in the meal box and tea cup as showed in figure s8 phosphite antioxidant irgafos 168 and phthalate plasticizers of dehp were identified as dominant additives added in pp plastic food contact materials of meal box and tea cups the identified concentration of antioxidant irgafos 168 in meal box and tea cup were 0 45 0 03 wt average 4450 ug g and 0 24 0 02 wt average 2387 ug g respectively plasticizer dehp displayed lower abundance than irgafos 168 in both materials with the exact concentration were 0 025 0 001 wt average 244 ug g in meal box and 0 027 0 002 wt average 268 ug g in tea cup due to antioxidant within plastic polymers have remarkable capability in controlling the aging of plastics by degrading themselves li et al 2015 thus the role of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the fragmentation process of pp mps was develpoed other types of additives such as antioxidants n d 2416 ug g i e irgafos 1010 irgafos 168 ox and irganox 1076 plasticizers n d 132 ug g dehp dibutyl phthalate dbp and diisobutyl phthalate dibp and slip agents erucamide may also existence in pp food packaging materials although the presence in meal box and tea cup were not found in this study table s2 which may attribute to the established regulations such as european regulation no 10 2011 eu european regulation n 1935 2004 to guarantee the safety of plastic food containers to human health vera et al 2018 3 3 2 effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the fragmentation process of pp mps to study the effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the fragmentation process of pp materials we mixed pure pp with varied contents of irgafos 168 the amount of irgafos 168 incorporated into the pure pp mps were set at 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt w w referred to the content of irgafos 168 within the selected mps products as well as common and satisfactory content of antioxidant in packaging materials 6 5 marcato et al 2003 sánchez 2021 the changes of fragmentation ratio ln st s0 st mps size at aging time t st initial mps size before uv irradiation experiments of mps within the uv irradiation periods were detected to evaluate the role of irgafos 168 on the mps aging process the coefficient linear correlation fitted with the absolute ratio were 0 25 0 15 0 06 and 0 03 for pure pp 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained pp mps figure s9a with no difference in particle sizes observed in dark controls figure s9b because our irradiation experiments were conducted with magnetic stirring the observed particle size change may reflect the combined effect of both uv exposure and mechanical force this meant the ocean wave currents and tides related mechanical abrasion coupled with photo oxidation process was responsible for the formation of smaller size pp mps in marine environment the decreased fragmentation ratio with the increase of irgafos 168 content during 12 d uv exposure in artificial seawater highlighted the significant inhibitory effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 in the pp mps aging process in marine environment the inhibitory effect was also verified through the variations in mps surface morphology for example after undergo 12 of uv irradiation many cracks were produced on the surface of pure pp mps and displayed relatively rougher surface than those of original mps figure s10 while for 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained pp mps no obvious cracks were formed for during the aging process pearson correlation analysis showed significant correlation between the mp size and uv exposure time for pure pp r 0 984 p 0 01 pp 168 1 wt r 0 936 p 0 01 pp 168 3 wt r 0 978 p 0 01 and pp 168 5 wt r 0 935 p 0 01 revealing the degree of fragmentation was feasible to be estimated according to the average particle size of mps as showed in fig 3 a the average particle size were 84 13 6 69 μm 214 04 15 87 μm and 280 73 30 11 μm for pp mps containing 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of irgafos 168 after 12 d uv irradiation the primary size distribution intervals were gradually increased with the increase of irgafos 168 content in pp plastics the dominant size of mps after uv exposure were 70 80 μm 60 200 250 μm 80 and 250 300 μm 60 for pp mps containing 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of irgafos 168 respectively fig 3b 3d while for pure pp mps the particle size of 10 20 μm accounted for 80 to the total fragments after 12 d uv irradiation these confirmed that uv irradiation could enhance the formation of smaller sized plastic particles in aquatic environment besides the fragmentation or aging process of pp mps in marine environment can be altered when varied contents of antioxidants were added in plastic materials 3 3 3 effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the physicochemical properties of pp mps since 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained in pp mps displayed more obvious inhibitory effect on the fragmentation of pp mps in artificial seawater the impact of irgafos 168 on the changed properties of mps during aging process was evaluated based on pure pp and 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained pp mps the variations of solution toc contact angle and rubbery region at different aging time were measured in fig 4 a the solution toc for pure pp was increased from 0 85 mg l to 214 84 mg l after 12 d irradiation which was higher than that of 5 wt irgafos 168 contained pp mps 0 85 mg l to 107 18 mg l the contact angle of pure pp mps was decreased from 105 15 4 31 uv exposure for 0 d to 82 95 0 86 uv exposure for 12 d fig 4b in fig 4c and 4d apparent peaks with 2θ at 14 1 16 9 18 5 21 2 and 21 9 were observed for pure pp and 5 wt of irgafos 168 incubated pp mps in the xrd spectra the relative intensity of pure pp and irgafos 168 contained pp mps decreased for 38 and 25 after 12 d uv exposure which implied that the aging of pp mps was significantly inhibited in the presence of antioxidant irgafos 168 the inhabitation effect of irgafos 168 on mp fragmentation may attribute to its ability to interact with polymers or generated free radicals which slowed down the photo degradation of pp mps to unravel this hypothesis the consumption of irgafos 168 itself in the oxidation process was evaluated by comparing the remaining concentration c to the initial concentration c0 of the compound in pp mps according to the dynamic consumption kinetics of irgafos 168 on the surface of pp mps figure s11 the c c0 values at different aging time exhibited significant correlation r 0 824 p 0 05 with the changes of solution toc for irgafos 168 contained pp mps this evidenced that the content of irgafos 168 within the plastic polymers may take effect in controlling the chain scission process of pp mps besides correlation analysis revealed that the changed contact angle r 938 p 0 01 were strictly impacted by the remaining content of irgafos 168 in pp mps during the aging process the above results suggested that uv irradiation related changes of properties for plastic products could be blocked in the presence of antioxidant irgafos 168 3 4 mechanisms of antioxidant irgafos 168 in the aging process of pp mps 3 4 1 critical effect of hydroxyl radicals on the aging process of pp mps free radical reaction was important to explain the aging process of pp mps under light irradiation fig 5 illustrated the possible degradation pathway of pp mps under uv irradiation when exposed to uv light the cleavage of c h bond in the polymer backbone initiated free radical chain reaction of polymers and form alkyl radicals the produced alkyl radicals could easily react with oxygen in water resulting in the formation of alkoxy radicals the alkoxy radicals subsequently reacted with polymer backbone and produced hydroperoxide groups rooh through hydrogen abstraction because the dissociation energy of co oh 175 8 kj mol was lower than that of c ooh 293 0 kj mol and coo h 376 7 kj mol the cleavage of ro oh may be the dominant way to the formation of ro and oh under uv irradiation as described as follows ranby and rabek 1975 zhu et al 2019 1 rooh ro oh alkoxy radicals ro were ultimately transformed to oxygen containing functional groups of carboxylic acid ketone and olefins of vinylidene through norrish type i and norrish type ii reaction rajakumar et al 2009 the formed oh would initiate free radical chain process by attacking the backbone of pp mps chen et al 2019 this procedure will cause the breakdown of polymer chain and form a mass of monomer or oligomer in aqueous solution to investigate the role of hydroxyl radical oh on the photo aging of pp mps quenching experiment was conducted by adding 600 mm isopropanol in suspension to remove the produced oh during oxidation the results in fig 6 a showed that the average size of pure pp mps exhibited minor changes within 12 d of uv exposure from 442 82 35 54 μm to 438 57 33 71 μm comparing with the apparent decrease in particle size from 443 65 23 25 μm to 16 78 2 51 μm without isopropanol in suspension indicating that oh did play crucial role on the chain scission process of pp mps 2 oh rh r h 2 o above all the effect of oh on the photo oxidation of plastic polymers was significant to access the mechanism of irgafos 168 on the aging process of pp mps in ocean environment 3 4 2 effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the formation of hydroxyl radicals the impact of irgafos 168 on the formation of oh was conducted using ba as a capturer as showing in fig 6b the cumulated oh in the aging process of pp mps containing 5 wt of irgafos 168 was relatively lower than that of pure pp during 12 h uv irradiation elucidating the presence of irgafos 168 in pp mps significantly reduced the available concentration of oh in the aging process therefore the inhibition effect of irgafos 168 on the aging process of pp mps may be ascribed to the prevention of oh formation in addition the detected content of irgafos 168 in pp mps reduced 91 9 after 12 d uv irradiation figure s11 and favorable correlations between the residual of irgafos 168 in pp mps with the ci value r 0 871 p 0 05 and average particle size r 0 922 p 0 01 were observed this might be attributed to the fact that irgafos 168 could react with rooh in the pp plastics in aqueous solution under uv irradiation through the cleavage of p o bond within irgafos 168 to form tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate fig 6c because the phosphorus atom in irgafos 168 was located in the unequal sp3 hybrid orbits when encountering rooh the p orbital of the phosphorus atom forms a stable p d π bond with the d orbital of the oxygen atom with the p o bond energy of 611 kj mol yang et al 2012 therefore we can conclude that the effect of irgafos 168 on the aging process of pp mps in artificial seawater may attribute to its self sacrifice in the surface photochemical reaction with oxidizing species 3 4 3 effect of irgafos 168 degradation products on the aging process of pp mps with the decrease of antioxidant irgafos 168 content its degradation products may become more important in the mps aging process and alter the mps properties uv irradiation of irgafos 168 contained mps could result in the release of leachable intermediates on the surface of mps such as tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate bis 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate mono 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate and 2 4 di tert butylphenyl from plastic to the aqueous solution figure s12 ta and bones 2017 this meant that the degradation product of antioxidant may be essential for characterizing the aging and environmental behaviors of mps in natural waters khaled et al 2018 besides the surface color of irgafos 168 contained pp mps was shifted from white to yellow after 12 d irradiation comparing with no changes for pure pp mps figure s13 and the aged pp mps containing irgafos 168 displayed higher adsorption band at 1375 cm 1 than that of original mps in atr ftir spectra figure s14 which was mainly referred to the p o stretching azizitorghabeh et al 2016 this elucidated that uv irradiation of irgafos 168 might lead to the formation of p o bond related compounds including tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate bis 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate mono 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate and 2 4 di tert butylphenol which extensively distributed on the surface of the plastics figure s12 ta and bones 2017 the yellowing of aged pp mps might further inhibit the photo aging of mps due to light screening effects highlighting the plastic additives and its degradation products may play important role in modifying the photo degradation mechanism of polymers under solar irradiation above all the long term photo aging process of pp mps in marine water can be divided into two stages in the first stage when antioxidant is available it reacts with the photo generated reactive oxygen species i e oh and rooh and break up the free radical chain reaction in the second stage when antioxidant is exhausted its photo degradation products may become the dominant contributor to influence the aging process of mps in water moreover biofilm rummel et al 2017 dissolved organic matters grebel et al 2011 and halide ions grebel et al 2010 may also involve in the polymer free radical reactions under light irradiation and influence the photo aging and fragmentation process of mps this implied that the photo aging mechanism of plastic may be different in in natural waters i e river lake estuary and seawater under the impact of water components additional laboratory and field experiments are critically need to be devoted on the multiple impacts controlling the long term aging process of mps which may display a modified photo degradation mechanism in water environment it will be of great help to fully understand the formation fate and environmental risks of hydrocarbon mps in natural waters 3 5 conclusions uncontrolled disposal of plastic wastes into marine environment has aroused great attention in recent years when exposed to sunlight plastic debris is readily to undergone continuous photo aging process and break into smaller size fragments which may cause adverse effects to organisms in marine environment von moos et al 2012 because plastic materials exposed in the environment generally contained varied types and content of additives studying the influence of plastic additives on the aging of mps in artificial seawater is critical to estimate the fragmentation process and potential environmental risk of mps in real marine environment laboratory accelerated aging of pp mps in this study confirmed that photo oxidation coupled with mechanical abrasion could produce more microsized or nanosized plastic particles in marine environment antioxidant irgafos 168 in pp food packaging materials like meal box and tea cup exhibited significant inhibitory effect on the photo aging process of pp mps in artificial seawater the mechanism might be attributed to the chemical reaction of irgafos 168 with rooh under uv light and preventing the formation of oh distributed on the surface of plastics besides the surface yellowing induced by the photo degradation products of irgafos 168 may also take effect in the long term aging process of mps our results suggested that combined effects of additives in plastics and their degradation products on the aging process of mps may be available on the possible generation of

17406,plastic litters in marine environment usually contain varied types and contents of additives that can significantly affect the photochemical aging and fragmentation process of microplastics mps this study investigated the photo aging process of two common polypropylene pp food packaging materials i e meal box and tea cup in artificial seawater within 12 d of ultraviolet uv irradiation results revealed that the aging of both plastic materials were critically inhibited compared with pure pp indicating that pp food packaging materials in natural seawater may share longer aging time than pure ones gc ms analysis revealed that antioxidant irgafos 168 tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphite was the dominant additive in these plastic materials photo reaction between irgafos 168 and hydroperoxide species on the surface of mps to prevent the formation of hydroxyl radical was the possible mechanism for the inhibiting effects after antioxidant was exhausted its photo degradation products could become the dominant contributor to influence the aging process of mps this is the first work exploring the role of antioxidant on the aging process of pp mps in simulated ocean environment the findings could be of great help for unraveling the effect of antioxidants on the aging related environmental risk of hydrocarbon plastics in ocean environment graphical abstract image

lightweight durability and corrosion resistant properties in use plasticseurope 2010 since been produced in the middle of 20th century global production of plastics has reached 335 million tons in 2016 of which 10 of them would enter into the natural environment rather than been recycled or incinerated europe 2017 kirstein et al 2016 their high volume usage leads to million tons of plastic wastes released into the environment and ending up in ocean andrady 2011 cole et al 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 the magnitude of plastic debris in marine environment has been estimated to be 4 8 to 12 7 million metric tons in 2010 jambeck et al 2015 which mainly dispersed from land based source emission via surface outflow tides and wind auta et al 2017 thompson et al 2005 thus plastic debris has been widely detected in worldwide seawater browne et al 2011 browne et al 2010 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 after enter into marine environment plastic debris tended to be fragmented into smaller size particles after undergoing continuous photo oxidation or mechanical abrasion song et al 2017 breakdown from large plastic debris and industrial manufactured microscopic size plastic beads are considered to be the primary sources for plastic residual in marine environment cole et al 2011 these plastic particles are readily to be trapped by ocean organisms andrady 2011 ekvall et al 2019 sink into the sediments cooper and corcoran 2010 or transport to remote area bergmann et al 2017 microplastics mps plastic fragments with particle size 5 mm as an emerging pollutant in marine environment is of increasing concern due to their adverse ecological risks to marine organisms such as zooplankton cole et al 2013 seabirds lourenco et al 2017 and fishes phillips and bonner 2015 up to 94 of the plastic wastes in the environment would be subjected to many weathering processes including ultraviolet oxidation mechanical abrasion and biodegradation alimi et al 2018 charles and carraher 2013 this manifested that aged mps are widely existed in the outdoor environment especially in the ocean environment ultraviolet uv oxidation is introduced as a fundamental way to form aged mps in aquatic system feldman 2002 when exposed to uv light the surface of mps would become embrittlement and produce pores holes and cracks as the surface reaction proceeded the expanded pores and crakes on the surface of mps provides more available reaction sites and favors the further aging of polymers liu et al 2019b these processes may induce changes of mps properties i e morphology crystallinity oxygen content molecular weight and surface charges and produce abundant secondary mps which further affect their fate transport potential and environmental risks chubarenko et al 2016 gardette et al 2013 kedzierski et al 2018 plastic debris in the environment are normally comprised of monomers and plastic additives such as flame retardants plasticizers antioxidants and stabilizers hermabessiere et al 2017 however available data dealing with the effect of plastic additives on the photochemical weathering of plastic debris in natural waters is quite limited it has been assumed that antioxidants are the key ingredients in plastic materials to extend their life for use evidence to this assumption is that antioxidants can scavenge free radicals in polymer matrix and interference the photo degradation process of polymers in the environment fouyer et al 2012 li et al 2015 reingruber et al 2010 other additives may have less effect because limited information has reported for the direct effect of these chemicals on the mps aging process for example plasticizers are employed to promote the flexibility stretchability and durability of plastic products zhang et al 2018 slip agents generally injected or extracted in plastic formulations to improve the lubricate properties of polymer film and reduce the friction coefficient for the surface of a polymers markarian j 2007 therefore characterizing the impact of antioxidants on the aging process of mps is critical to trace the source and formation of mps in aquatic environment this study systematically investigated the aging process of mps from pp food packaging materials in simulated marine environment because pp is the most frequently used plastics 19 3 to world consumptions in 2016 especially in food packaging products of sweet snack wrappers and microwave proof containers plasticseurope 2018 besides 24 9 million tons of global packaging products were reported to be discharged into the marine environment yearly ellen macarthur foundation 2017 since it is important to understand the fragmentation process and changed physicochemical properties of pp mps after long term aging process in real marine environment alin and minna 2011 two commonly used transparent disposable plastic containers i e meal box and tea cup were chosen as represent of single use pp food packaging materials due to their ubiquitous use worldwide figure s1 of the supporting information si the mps of the materials were exposed to uv for 12 d in artificial seawater the changes of plastic particle size crystallinity melting temperature contact angle and surface charges of mps were developed to seek the possible fragmenting mechanism of mps in marine environment the role of antioxidants in the aging process of pp mps was probed by mixing different amounts of irgafos 168 in pure pp polymer the obtained data will provide new insight to evaluate the effect of plastic additives on the aging process of hydrocarbon mps in marine environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pure pp material was obtained from material china petroleum and chemical co ltd pp packaging materials of meal box and tea cup were supplied by

irgafos 168 the size and shape of initial pp mps i e pure pp meal box and tea cup mps were similar with each other and uniformed between 400 500 μm by sieving through a 500 μm and 400 μm stainless steel sifter prior to use in uv irradiation experiments figure s2 initial particle size for pure pp meal box tea cup as well as 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained pp mps in the uv irradiation

mps and 20 ml artificial seawater were added into silica tubes the silica tubes were put in a thermostatic water bath 25 c with a magnetic stirrer 700 rad min at the first 4 d of uv irradiation mps were floating on the surface of water because of the non polar and lower density 0 91 g cm3 of pp mps during 4 d to 12 d uv irradiation period most of the mps were suspending in the reaction system figure s3 tubes were removed at 0 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 d 12 h light irradiation per day and the mp samples were collected by passing through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter which was baked in muffle furnace at 450 c for 4 h to remove the potential impurities residue in the membrane prior use each irradiation experiments were conducted in triplicate dark controls were conducted by wrapping the silica tubes with aluminum foil under the same experiment condition 2 4 identification and quantification of irgafos 168 and dehp two strategies of target and non target strategies were commonly used to determine the potential additives and non intentionally added substances nias in mps products as well as their accurate amount gc ms screening analysis coupled with the mass spectrometry library i e epa environmental protection agency tandem mass spectrometry nist national institute of standards and technology 17 tandem ms library and wiley library were able to analyzed and identified most of the volatile chemicals in mps vera et al 2018 prior gc ms analysis ultrasonic assisted extraction ningbo licheng instrument co ltd china was performed to extract additives from the tested pp mp samples

per cycle for 3 times the extract temperature output power and frequency of ultrasonic cleaning device were set at 25 c 300 w and 40 khz respectively after extraction the extract was combined and concentrated to 500 μl by nitrogen flow before analysis thermo scientific dsq ii gas chromatography coupled with a single quadrupole detector was used to determine the potential additives in meal box and tea cup mps the ion source was electron ionization 70 ev the chromatographic column was db 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 mm helium was the carrier gas and the flow was set at 1 ml min the procedure temperature was initialed at 80 c 2 min then promoted to 300 c with the rate of 15 c min and keep for 7 min the temperature of injection and ion source were set at 280 c and 230 c respectively the ion range was varied from m z 60 to m z 650 in the full scan analysis the target compounds were identified by comparing the retention time and qualitative quantitative ions with external standards the concentration of target compounds of irgafos 168 and dehp in meal box and tea cup were determined by external standards fragment ions with m z 441 647 and 191 were used in irgafos 168 and 149 167 and 279 for dehp quantification spiked recovery study was performed by adding three levels of irgafos 168 and dehp into pure n hexane and replicate for six times yang et al 2016 the spiked concentrations were set at 1 ppm 10 ppm and 50 ppm respectively the measured average recoveries of irgafos 168 and dehp were 98 2 10 5 and 83 7 8 73 no target compounds were detected in all blanks the results of all irgafos 168 concentration were corrected by spiked recoveries 2 5 characterization of mps surface morphology and o c atom ratio of virgin and aged pp mps were explored

calorimetry analyzer tg dsc sta449f3 germany contact angle goniometer oca 30 dataphysics instruments gmbh and x ray diffraction xrd x tra thermofisher usa respectively the total organic carbon toc of aqueous solution was measured using a toc analyzer elementar vario germany 2 6 quantification of hydroxyl radical formed in the aging process of pp mps benzoic acid ba was used to quantify the formed hydroxyl radical oh by mps under uv irradiation briefly 0 5 g of pp mps was added into the mixture containing 10 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs and 10 mm ba after uv irradiation 0 5 ml of suspension was withdrawn and passed through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter and mixed with 0 5 ml methanol before analysis the formed p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with a uv detector the cumulated oh was determined by the 5 87 times of the p hba concentration zhang et al 2016 agilent 1200 series of hplc coupled with agilent eclipse xdb c18 reversed phase column 5 μm 250 mm 4 mm and uv vis detector was utilized to determine the concentration of p hba in tested solution the mobile phase contained 0 1 trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution and methanol 65 35 at the flow rate of 1 ml min zhang et al 2016 the injection volume detection wavelength and temperature were set at 20 μl 255 nm and 40 c respectively 2 7 statistical analysis pearson correlation analysis was done to define the correlation of pp carbonyl index ci and average particle size versus uv irradiation time using ibm spss 19 for windows the p value less than 0 05 was defined as significant the results presented in this study are the mean values standard deviation sd based on triplicate experiments 3 result and discussion 3 1 photo aging of mps from pp food packaging materials in artificial seawater to explore the aging process of mps from pp food packaging materials in ocean environment transparent disposable meal box and tea cup were chosen as representatives with uv exposure in artificial seawater for 20 d from the atr ftir spectra of uv exposed mp samples from meal box fig 1 a and tea cup fig 1b apparent signals were observed at 1650 1850 cm 1 and 3250 3600 cm 1 after 20 d of uv irradiation which were identified as the carbonyl i e ketones esters and lactones and hydroxyl i e alcohols and hydroperoxide stretching vibrations respectively brandon et al 2016 tang et al 2019 similar types of signals were observed from the natural weathering of pp polymers indicating the laboratory accelerated aging procedure may be feasible to investigate the long term aging behavior of mps in the environment ni et al 2015 rajakumar et al 2009 as no apparent signal in carbonyl and hydroxyl region was discovered in dark conditions figure s4a and figure s4b in control samples the oxygen containing functional groups produced on the surface of aged mps might be mainly attributed to the reaction of pp with oxygen in water during photo irradiation yousif et al 2012 meanwhile these newly formed oxygen containing functional groups might also result in the changes of plastic properties including polarity hydrophobicity and surface charging which will impact the further aging of mps in aqueous solution liu et al 2019a carbonyl index ci was utilized to quantitatively evaluate the aging degrees of mps during oxidation period which was calculated by the ratio of maximum carbonyl peak at 1715 cm 1 to the reference peak at 974 cm 1 rajakumar et al 2009 the ci value of pure pp meal box and tea cup mps have reached to a pseudo equilibrium state in 20 days of uv irradiation fig 1c 1d for meal box and tea cup the ci value displayed little changes before the first 12 d then increased sharply and finally reached the steady state between 12 d to 20 d of test periods the changes for the alterations of meal box and tea cup before and after 12 d were also demonstrated by the mps properties of crystallinity figure s5a melting temperature figure s5b surface zeta potential figure s5c and particle size figure s5d this indicated that the aging process of mps made from pp products i e meal box and tea cup were significantly impeded in the first 12 d of uv irradiation compared with pure pp mps thus 12 d of uv irradiation duration was chosen in this study to better understand the difference and potential mechanism of the aging process between pure pp and pp products in seawater as depicted in figure s6a the alterations of ci for pure pp versus aging time t days was likely to be well fitted through pseudo first order kinetics ci 0 65 1 exp 0 29t r2 0 91 which provided evidence that more oxygen containing functional groups were generated during the mps aging process besides the ci value displayed significant correlation with alteration time r 0 921 p 0 01 suggesting that the abundance of carbonyl group and oxygen percentage were suitable for reflecting the changed properties of mps during aging process compared to the aging of pp plastic in abient water environment the ci value of pure pp obtained after 12 d of uv irradiation was comparable to the ci value 0 8 for pp mps after 210 days uv irradiation uv a 11 01 w m2 uv b 0 12 w m2 uv c 0 04 w m2 temperature 43 45 c in coastal seawater of korea song et al 2017 2411 h 200 days 12 h sunlight per day of weathering under seawater sunlight conditions sunshine with radiance 338 647 mj m 2 at 13 8 35 6 c in taiwan ci 0 78 tang et al 2019 and lower than 360 days of sunlight exposure ci 1 2 in subtropical humid zone of guangzhou china temperature 22 6 c total solar radiation 4590 mj m2 humidity 75 ni et al 2015 table s1 these illustrated the photo oxidation level of mps under 12 days of uv irradiation experiments in this study was relevant to approximately 200 days of sunlight exposure in the real aquatic environment the ci values of meal box from 0 01 0 004 to 0 16 0 028 and tea cup from 0 05 0 011 to 0 19 0 001 mps displayed a little change within 12 d uv exposure the changes of another parameter related to the aging extent of mps o c atom ratio showed the similar tends with the ci results the o c atom ratio in pure pp mps was increased from 0 02 0 014 to 0 14 0 021 after 12 d of uv irradiation figure s6b while that of the meal box and tea cup mps varied from 0 02 0 005 to 0 05 0 003 and from 0 02 0 014 to 0 05 0 001 respectively implied that a mass of carbon centered monomers and oligomers were generated on the polymer backbone during the photo aging process however it is worthy to note that both ci value and o c ratio of meal box and tea cup hardly showed significant changes regardless of in light or darkness conditions during the experimental period figure s6c and figure s6d suggesting the aging time of plastic debris from commercial plastic products in natural seawater may be longer than that of pure ones 3 2 characterization of virgin and aged pp mps under uv exposure uv irradiation is believed to be essential on the photo aging and degradation process of plastics in the water environment and associated with changes of plastic molecular arrangement and surface properties time dependent variations of crystallinity melting temperature surface zeta potential and particle size were measured to better understand the aging process of pp mps in artificial seawater the crystallinity r 0 952 p 0 01 melting temperature r 0 761 p 0 05 surface zeta potential r 924 p 0 01 and particle size r 0 918 p 0 01 for aged pure pp mps exhibited significant correlation with the ci value during uv irradiation this indicated that sustainable uv irradiation might be responsible for the modified properties of pp mps the crystallinity of pure pp mps estimated according to the peak at 998 cm 1 and 974 cm 1 in atr ftir spectra brandon et al 2016 were decreased from 62 04 1 26 uv oxidation for 0 d to 56 40 1 99 uv oxidation for 12 d no obvious changes were found for the crystallinity of meal box from 61 26 0 76 to 61 23 1 30 and tea cup mps from 61 21 0 37 to 60 66 0 70 during the aging period fig 2 a the melting temperature was reduced from 166 33 0 11 c to 159 25 0 82 c for pure pp mps as well as 156 16 3 71 c to 149 08 0 11 c for meal box and from 167 24 0 12 c to 149 250 35 c for tea cup after 12 d uv oxidation fig 2b besides no significant variations of crystallinity and melting temperature were observed in dark conditions figure s7a and s7b the decrease of crystallinity and melting temperature for three types of aged pp mps after uv irradiation implied that the photo aging process could result in the increase of rubbery non crystallinity domains and the formation of more flexible molecular structure in pp mps the surface zeta potential of pure pp mps was decreased from 1 37 2 02 mv uv exposure for 0 d to 6 12 1 72 mv uv exposure for 12 d fig 2c with exiguous changes observed in dark controls figure s7c indicating that the photo aging process could induce more negative surface charges on mps in artificial seawater this may assign to the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of aged mps which will enhance their hydrophilicity and polarity fu et al 2016 rajakumar et al 2009 differing from pure pp the surface zeta potential of meal box and tea cup displayed no difference with the aging time fig 2c suggesting that the aging process of pp food packaging products were likely to be delayed compared with pure pp the finding was further confirmed by the changes of particle size within the test period in fig 2d the particle size of pure pp mps was decreased from 443 65 23 25 μm to 34 18 7 70 μm after uv exposure in artificial seawater for 12 d however the average particle size of mps from meal box and tea cup were not significantly changed under uv and in dark conditions figure s7d these indicated that the uv exposure induced aging process of pp products in artificial seawater were significantly inhibited compared with that of pure ones which may be ascribed to the influence of added chemicals on the photo degradation process of plastic materials thus exploring the impact of plastic additives on the modification of plastic properties are essential to evaluate their further fate and potential environmental risks in the marine environment 3 3 effect of plastic additives on the photo aging of pp materials in seawater 3 3 1 analysis of the dominant additives incorporated in the meal box and tea cup varied types and contents of plastic additives i e antioxidants plasticizers heat stabilizers and slip agents were reported to be added in polymeric materials to improve their performance in manufacturing or using process chang et al 2013 in this study gc ms full scan analysis was carried out to explore the potential additives presented in the meal box and tea cup as showed in figure s8 phosphite antioxidant irgafos 168 and phthalate plasticizers of dehp were identified as dominant additives added in pp plastic food contact materials of meal box and tea cups the identified concentration of antioxidant irgafos 168 in meal box and tea cup were 0 45 0 03 wt average 4450 ug g and 0 24 0 02 wt average 2387 ug g respectively plasticizer dehp displayed lower abundance than irgafos 168 in both materials with the exact concentration were 0 025 0 001 wt average 244 ug g in meal box and 0 027 0 002 wt average 268 ug g in tea cup due to antioxidant within plastic polymers have remarkable capability in controlling the aging of plastics by degrading themselves li et al 2015 thus the role of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the fragmentation process of pp mps was develpoed other types of additives such as antioxidants n d 2416 ug g i e irgafos 1010 irgafos 168 ox and irganox 1076 plasticizers n d 132 ug g dehp dibutyl phthalate dbp and diisobutyl phthalate dibp and slip agents erucamide may also existence in pp food packaging materials although the presence in meal box and tea cup were not found in this study table s2 which may attribute to the established regulations such as european regulation no 10 2011 eu european regulation n 1935 2004 to guarantee the safety of plastic food containers to human health vera et al 2018 3 3 2 effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the fragmentation process of pp mps to study the effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the fragmentation process of pp materials we mixed pure pp with varied contents of irgafos 168 the amount of irgafos 168 incorporated into the pure pp mps were set at 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt w w referred to the content of irgafos 168 within the selected mps products as well as common and satisfactory content of antioxidant in packaging materials 6 5 marcato et al 2003 sánchez 2021 the changes of fragmentation ratio ln st s0 st mps size at aging time t st initial mps size before uv irradiation experiments of mps within the uv irradiation periods were detected to evaluate the role of irgafos 168 on the mps aging process the coefficient linear correlation fitted with the absolute ratio were 0 25 0 15 0 06 and 0 03 for pure pp 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained pp mps figure s9a with no difference in particle sizes observed in dark controls figure s9b because our irradiation experiments were conducted with magnetic stirring the observed particle size change may reflect the combined effect of both uv exposure and mechanical force this meant the ocean wave currents and tides related mechanical abrasion coupled with photo oxidation process was responsible for the formation of smaller size pp mps in marine environment the decreased fragmentation ratio with the increase of irgafos 168 content during 12 d uv exposure in artificial seawater highlighted the significant inhibitory effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 in the pp mps aging process in marine environment the inhibitory effect was also verified through the variations in mps surface morphology for example after undergo 12 of uv irradiation many cracks were produced on the surface of pure pp mps and displayed relatively rougher surface than those of original mps figure s10 while for 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained pp mps no obvious cracks were formed for during the aging process pearson correlation analysis showed significant correlation between the mp size and uv exposure time for pure pp r 0 984 p 0 01 pp 168 1 wt r 0 936 p 0 01 pp 168 3 wt r 0 978 p 0 01 and pp 168 5 wt r 0 935 p 0 01 revealing the degree of fragmentation was feasible to be estimated according to the average particle size of mps as showed in fig 3 a the average particle size were 84 13 6 69 μm 214 04 15 87 μm and 280 73 30 11 μm for pp mps containing 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of irgafos 168 after 12 d uv irradiation the primary size distribution intervals were gradually increased with the increase of irgafos 168 content in pp plastics the dominant size of mps after uv exposure were 70 80 μm 60 200 250 μm 80 and 250 300 μm 60 for pp mps containing 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of irgafos 168 respectively fig 3b 3d while for pure pp mps the particle size of 10 20 μm accounted for 80 to the total fragments after 12 d uv irradiation these confirmed that uv irradiation could enhance the formation of smaller sized plastic particles in aquatic environment besides the fragmentation or aging process of pp mps in marine environment can be altered when varied contents of antioxidants were added in plastic materials 3 3 3 effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the physicochemical properties of pp mps since 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained in pp mps displayed more obvious inhibitory effect on the fragmentation of pp mps in artificial seawater the impact of irgafos 168 on the changed properties of mps during aging process was evaluated based on pure pp and 5 wt of irgafos 168 contained pp mps the variations of solution toc contact angle and rubbery region at different aging time were measured in fig 4 a the solution toc for pure pp was increased from 0 85 mg l to 214 84 mg l after 12 d irradiation which was higher than that of 5 wt irgafos 168 contained pp mps 0 85 mg l to 107 18 mg l the contact angle of pure pp mps was decreased from 105 15 4 31 uv exposure for 0 d to 82 95 0 86 uv exposure for 12 d fig 4b in fig 4c and 4d apparent peaks with 2θ at 14 1 16 9 18 5 21 2 and 21 9 were observed for pure pp and 5 wt of irgafos 168 incubated pp mps in the xrd spectra the relative intensity of pure pp and irgafos 168 contained pp mps decreased for 38 and 25 after 12 d uv exposure which implied that the aging of pp mps was significantly inhibited in the presence of antioxidant irgafos 168 the inhabitation effect of irgafos 168 on mp fragmentation may attribute to its ability to interact with polymers or generated free radicals which slowed down the photo degradation of pp mps to unravel this hypothesis the consumption of irgafos 168 itself in the oxidation process was evaluated by comparing the remaining concentration c to the initial concentration c0 of the compound in pp mps according to the dynamic consumption kinetics of irgafos 168 on the surface of pp mps figure s11 the c c0 values at different aging time exhibited significant correlation r 0 824 p 0 05 with the changes of solution toc for irgafos 168 contained pp mps this evidenced that the content of irgafos 168 within the plastic polymers may take effect in controlling the chain scission process of pp mps besides correlation analysis revealed that the changed contact angle r 938 p 0 01 were strictly impacted by the remaining content of irgafos 168 in pp mps during the aging process the above results suggested that uv irradiation related changes of properties for plastic products could be blocked in the presence of antioxidant irgafos 168 3 4 mechanisms of antioxidant irgafos 168 in the aging process of pp mps 3 4 1 critical effect of hydroxyl radicals on the aging process of pp mps free radical reaction was important to explain the aging process of pp mps under light irradiation fig 5 illustrated the possible degradation pathway of pp mps under uv irradiation when exposed to uv light the cleavage of c h bond in the polymer backbone initiated free radical chain reaction of polymers and form alkyl radicals the produced alkyl radicals could easily react with oxygen in water resulting in the formation of alkoxy radicals the alkoxy radicals subsequently reacted with polymer backbone and produced hydroperoxide groups rooh through hydrogen abstraction because the dissociation energy of co oh 175 8 kj mol was lower than that of c ooh 293 0 kj mol and coo h 376 7 kj mol the cleavage of ro oh may be the dominant way to the formation of ro and oh under uv irradiation as described as follows ranby and rabek 1975 zhu et al 2019 1 rooh ro oh alkoxy radicals ro were ultimately transformed to oxygen containing functional groups of carboxylic acid ketone and olefins of vinylidene through norrish type i and norrish type ii reaction rajakumar et al 2009 the formed oh would initiate free radical chain process by attacking the backbone of pp mps chen et al 2019 this procedure will cause the breakdown of polymer chain and form a mass of monomer or oligomer in aqueous solution to investigate the role of hydroxyl radical oh on the photo aging of pp mps quenching experiment was conducted by adding 600 mm isopropanol in suspension to remove the produced oh during oxidation the results in fig 6 a showed that the average size of pure pp mps exhibited minor changes within 12 d of uv exposure from 442 82 35 54 μm to 438 57 33 71 μm comparing with the apparent decrease in particle size from 443 65 23 25 μm to 16 78 2 51 μm without isopropanol in suspension indicating that oh did play crucial role on the chain scission process of pp mps 2 oh rh r h 2 o above all the effect of oh on the photo oxidation of plastic polymers was significant to access the mechanism of irgafos 168 on the aging process of pp mps in ocean environment 3 4 2 effect of antioxidant irgafos 168 on the formation of hydroxyl radicals the impact of irgafos 168 on the formation of oh was conducted using ba as a capturer as showing in fig 6b the cumulated oh in the aging process of pp mps containing 5 wt of irgafos 168 was relatively lower than that of pure pp during 12 h uv irradiation elucidating the presence of irgafos 168 in pp mps significantly reduced the available concentration of oh in the aging process therefore the inhibition effect of irgafos 168 on the aging process of pp mps may be ascribed to the prevention of oh formation in addition the detected content of irgafos 168 in pp mps reduced 91 9 after 12 d uv irradiation figure s11 and favorable correlations between the residual of irgafos 168 in pp mps with the ci value r 0 871 p 0 05 and average particle size r 0 922 p 0 01 were observed this might be attributed to the fact that irgafos 168 could react with rooh in the pp plastics in aqueous solution under uv irradiation through the cleavage of p o bond within irgafos 168 to form tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate fig 6c because the phosphorus atom in irgafos 168 was located in the unequal sp3 hybrid orbits when encountering rooh the p orbital of the phosphorus atom forms a stable p d π bond with the d orbital of the oxygen atom with the p o bond energy of 611 kj mol yang et al 2012 therefore we can conclude that the effect of irgafos 168 on the aging process of pp mps in artificial seawater may attribute to its self sacrifice in the surface photochemical reaction with oxidizing species 3 4 3 effect of irgafos 168 degradation products on the aging process of pp mps with the decrease of antioxidant irgafos 168 content its degradation products may become more important in the mps aging process and alter the mps properties uv irradiation of irgafos 168 contained mps could result in the release of leachable intermediates on the surface of mps such as tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate bis 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate mono 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate and 2 4 di tert butylphenyl from plastic to the aqueous solution figure s12 ta and bones 2017 this meant that the degradation product of antioxidant may be essential for characterizing the aging and environmental behaviors of mps in natural waters khaled et al 2018 besides the surface color of irgafos 168 contained pp mps was shifted from white to yellow after 12 d irradiation comparing with no changes for pure pp mps figure s13 and the aged pp mps containing irgafos 168 displayed higher adsorption band at 1375 cm 1 than that of original mps in atr ftir spectra figure s14 which was mainly referred to the p o stretching azizitorghabeh et al 2016 this elucidated that uv irradiation of irgafos 168 might lead to the formation of p o bond related compounds including tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate bis 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate mono 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate and 2 4 di tert butylphenol which extensively distributed on the surface of the plastics figure s12 ta and bones 2017 the yellowing of aged pp mps might further inhibit the photo aging of mps due to light screening effects highlighting the plastic additives and its degradation products may play important role in modifying the photo degradation mechanism of polymers under solar irradiation above all the long term photo aging process of pp mps in marine water can be divided into two stages in the first stage when antioxidant is available it reacts with the photo generated reactive oxygen species i e oh and rooh and break up the free radical chain reaction in the second stage when antioxidant is exhausted its photo degradation products may become the dominant contributor to influence the aging process of mps in water moreover biofilm rummel et al 2017 dissolved organic matters grebel et al 2011 and halide ions grebel et al 2010 may also involve in the polymer free radical reactions under light irradiation and influence the photo aging and fragmentation process of mps this implied that the photo aging mechanism of plastic may be different in in natural waters i e river lake estuary and seawater under the impact of water components additional laboratory and field experiments are critically need to be devoted on the multiple impacts controlling the long term aging process of mps which may display a modified photo degradation mechanism in water environment it will be of great help to fully understand the formation fate and environmental risks of hydrocarbon mps in natural waters 3 5 conclusions uncontrolled disposal of plastic wastes into marine environment has aroused great attention in recent years when exposed to sunlight plastic debris is readily to undergone continuous photo aging process and break into smaller size fragments which may cause adverse effects to organisms in marine environment von moos et al 2012 because plastic materials exposed in the environment generally contained varied types and content of additives studying the influence of plastic additives on the aging of mps in artificial seawater is critical to estimate the fragmentation process and potential environmental risk of mps in real marine environment laboratory accelerated aging of pp mps in this study confirmed that photo oxidation coupled with mechanical abrasion could produce more microsized or nanosized plastic particles in marine environment antioxidant irgafos 168 in pp food packaging materials like meal box and tea cup exhibited significant inhibitory effect on the photo aging process of pp mps in artificial seawater the mechanism might be attributed to the chemical reaction of irgafos 168 with rooh under uv light and preventing the formation of oh distributed on the surface of plastics besides the surface yellowing induced by the photo degradation products of irgafos 168 may also take effect in the long term aging process of mps our results suggested that combined effects of additives in plastics and their degradation products on the aging process of mps may be available on the possible generation of mps in ocean environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

17407,intense storms pose a serious threat to ecosystem functioning and services however the effects of typhoons tropical cyclones on the biogeochemical processes mediating risk of eutrophication in deep freshwater ecosystems remain unclear here we conducted a three year study to elucidate linkages between environmental change stable isotopes and the stoichiometry of particulate organic matter pom and nutrient cycling i e carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in a subtropical deep reservoir subjected to typhoon events the typhoons significantly changed the nutrient levels in the deep waters as well as the thermocline position increased typhoon driven organic matter input algae sinking and heterotrophic decomposition interacted with each other to cause steep and prolonged increases of total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus in the bottom waters of the reservoir small sized or pico sized pom i e 0 2 3 μm showed a substantial increase in bottom waters and it exhibited stronger response than large sized pom i e 3 20 20 64 64 200 μm to the typhoons our results also indicated that typhoons boost the nutrient cycling in deep waters mainly through pico sized pom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic matter deep water mixing microbial loop multi nutrient cycling index stable isotope stoichiometry 1 introduction in tropical and subtropical regions the intensity of typhoon events also termed tropical cyclones or hurricanes are expected to increase as a consequence of the ongoing climate changes as well as to cause economic and ecosystem functioning losses due to the strong wind and torrential rain mumby et al 2011 coumou and rahmstorf 2012 fang 2016 emanuel 2020 deep reservoirs and lakes are typically characterized by algae rich surface waters epilimnion and potential nutrient rich bottom waters hypolimnion boehrer and schultze 2008 yu et al 2014 wind induced mixing disturbances can bring the hypolimnetic nutrients up into the photic zone and heavy precipitation may lead to an increase in the influx of terrestrial material including nutrients into these waterbodies paerl et al 2006 sinha et al 2017 such pulse disturbances are typically accompanied by an increased algae biomass or a shift in the plankton community composition tseng et al 2013 ji et al 2018 stockwell et al 2020 however the underlying processes and mechanisms driving the variations of plankton community after typhoon are difficult to estimate from typical low frequency monitoring high frequency observations using novel methodology however may enhance our understanding of the biogeochemical processes following episodic climatic disturbances in freshwater ecosystems in an increasingly changing world the stoichiometry and stable isotopes of particulate organic matter pom are useful tools for the understanding of the biogeochemical processes associated with plankton dynamics and eutrophication processes leal et al 2017 glibert et al 2019 the stoichiometric variations of grazer and algae can influence the rates of nutrient release altering the structure and functioning of freshwater ecosystems elser and urabe 1999 stable isotopes of pom have been widely used to study the biogeochemical processes and to track element sources fry 2006 gu 2009 gu et al 2011 glibert et al 2019 the stable carbon isotope δ13c of pom is considered as a good proxy for co2 concentration and primary production and stable nitrogen isotope δ15n can be used as indicators of the n2 fixation process and trophic position along a food chain in lakes gu et al 2006 trochine et al 2017 therefore the temporally and spatially integrated information on biogeochemical processes provided by stable isotopes and the stoichiometry of pom are important for understanding the nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems following typhoon events the size of pom is an important functional trait as it affects the bioavailability and biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems woodward et al 2005 pom mainly consists of plankton and dead organic matter moore et al 2004 the sizes of most free living bacteria are typically 3 μm while most planktonic algae are larger and within the range 3 20 μm and most protozoans and metazoan are 20 μm and 64 μm respectively chételat et al 2006 the responses of plankton to typhoon driven disturbances vary among size classes and along the water column jones et al 2008 ji et al 2018 in a natural lake jones et al 2008 for example found that the bacterial community composition recovered fast after a typhoon disturbance while the algal communities did not moreover microbial communities exhibited a higher ability to recover from an artificial mixing disturbance in the surface waters than in the deep waters shade et al 2012 therefore studies should not only focus on the microbial communities in the surface waters but also explore the potentially prolonged responses of the microbially mediated biogeochemical processes in the deep waters following strong winds e g typhoons stoichiometry plays a key role for the nutrient cycling and community composition sardans et al 2012 the c p ratio of organic matter for example can greatly influence the global nitrogen fixation rate wang et al 2019 the multi nutrient cycling index i e carbon nitrogen and phosphorus has been used to address the importance of different taxonomic groups for the nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems delgado baquerizo et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 however less is known about the contribution of key drivers and the implications of different pom size classes for the multi nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems especially following typhoon events we explored the susceptibility and drivers of nutrient cycling using meteorological and physicochemical variables stable isotopes and the stoichiometry of different pom size classes following typhoon events in a subtropical reservoir fig s1 we focused on the two questions 1 how did the typhoon affect the biotic and abiotic conditions in different water layers of the reservoir 2 which size fraction of poms can be a key indicator of changes in nutrient cycling to answer these questions we explored the environmental change throughout the water column during one month before and after typhoon events in tingxi reservoir in southeast china we then assessed the importance of different pom size classes for the multi nutrient cycling using the stable isotopes and stoichiometry of pom we hypothesized that 1 pom changes concentration and size driven by the typhoon events would differ among the different water layers and that 2 pom would be a key contributor to the nutrient cycling differing though in importance among particle size classes and water layers this study highlights the importance of using stable isotopes and stoichiometry of pom to elucidate the nutrient cycling in different water layers and provides new insight into the biogeochemical processes of freshwater ecosystems following typhoon events 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling processes a three year 2015 2017 field sampling campaign was conducted near the dam of the tingxi reservoir 24 48 n 118 08 e in xiamen city fujian province southeast china tingxi reservoir was built in 1956 and has a drainage area of about 100 km2 and a total storage of 48 106 m3 yang et al 2012 the trophic state of the reservoir was light eutrophic level with a trophic state index ranging from 50 8 to 56 3 which were calculated using chlorophyll a secchi depth and total phosphorus yang et al 2012 the reservoir is deep with surface chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 9 5 to 22 2 μg dm 3 details of the reservoir are given in our previous studies yang et al 2012 2016 gao et al 2019 annual mean precipitation is about 1336 mm and annual mean temperature 20 7 c liu et al 2019 xiamen is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate and is located at the westbound belt of typhoon movement in the northwestern pacific ocean typhoons are a common disturbance of the tingxi reservoir especially during the water stratification period in summer and autumn samples of particulate organic matter pom were collected every 20 days every 10 days in september 2016 after the typhoon meranti from 2015 to 2017 samples were collected from the subsurface layer depth 0 5 m the hypoxic boundary depth 21 27 m and subbottom layer 2 m above the bottom sediments fig s1a b pom was partitioned into four size classes fractions 0 2 3 μm pico sized 3 20 μm nano sized 20 64 μm micro sized and 64 200 μm net sized briefly we pre filtered the samples through 200 μm 64 μm and 20 μm nylon sieves in situ followed by sequential filtering through 3 μm and 0 2 μm pore size polycarbonate filters 47 mm diameter millipore billerica ma usa in the laboratory the samples were then gently backwashed from filters into 15 cm3 plastic centrifuge tubes finally all the samples were freeze dried at 80 c for at least 72 h prior to nitrogen and carbon elemental and isotopic analyses 2 2 meteorological data collection fujian province is a perfect region for studying typhoon induced disturbances sajjad et al 2019 we focused on typhoons within a 300 km distance from the typhoon center to the tingxi reservoir table s1 fig 1 data on air temperature at precipitation and wind speed ws were collected from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn at station xiamen id 59 134 coordinates 24 29 n 118 04 e to evaluate the effect of typhoon we applied 10 days average air temperature 10 days average wind speed 10 days accumulated precipitation and 10 days accumulated sunshine duration prior to the sampling dates 2 3 abiotic and phytoplankton data collection water depth was measured with a speedtech sm 5 depthmate portable sounder speedtech instruments great falls va usa water temperature wt ph dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ at 0 5 m intervals using a multiparameter water quality analyzer hydrolab ds5 hach company loveland co usa total carbon tc and total organic carbon toc were determined using a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and phosphate phosphorus po4 p were analyzed by spectrophotometry total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured by spectrophotometry after digestion greenberg et al 1992 water transparency was measured with a 30 cm diameter secchi disk depth of euphotic zone zeu was estimated as 2 7 times the secchi depth cole 1994 the masses of the nano and pico pom size classes were sampled by sequential filtering of the samples through 20 μm 3 μm and 0 2 μm pore size polycarbonate filters 47 mm diameter millipore billerica ma usa respectively subsequently the filters were weighed after drying at 50 c for at least 72 h chlorophyll a and fv fm of blue green cyanobacteria green chlorophytes and brown mostly diatoms and dinoflagellates algae and the total phytoplankton were measured ex situ with a phyto pam phytoplankton analyzer heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter fv fm indicates the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem ii psii photochemistry and can be used as an early disturbance indicator in algae dittami et al 2016 the dominant algal groups were counted using a flowsight cytometer amnis merck millipore darmstadt germany equipped with blue green 488 nm 60 mv and sideward scatter ssc 785 nm 12 mv solid state lasers and high image resolution 20 magnification the analyses were performed on amnis ideas software version 6 2 red autofluorescence of photosynthetic pigments and ssc were used to distinguish the algae from dead particles red and yellow autofluorescences were defined as algal group 1 and group 2 respectively 2 4 stable isotopes and stoichiometry of particulate organic matter percent carbon percent nitrogen and δ13c and δ15n of pom samples were measured using a thermo electron flash ea 2000 elemental analyzer ea coupled to a delta v isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma usa carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were presented as δ13c and δ15n relative to vienna pee dee belemnite carbonate and atmospheric n2 isotopes respectively fry 2006 average analytical errors for δ13c and δ15n were approximately 0 13 and 0 1 respectively in this study we used the carbon content and c n ratios to correct the δ13c of the net pom for lipid bias syväranta and rautio 2010 other pom size classes typically consisted of algae or bacteria and the carbon content c of these pom samples was almost less than 40 in our study therefore we did not correct the δ13c of the other pom size classes following the method of a previous study post et al 2007 all stoichiometric ratios were calculated using the elemental content of pom 2 5 analysis of temporal changes in water parameters to track the ecological consequences of typhoon events samples taken within one month before and after typhoon events were selected as pre and post typhoon periods respectively table s1 since the different pom size classes from different water layers were only available from 2016 to 2017 further data analyses were thus performed based on data from the two years we compared the differences in nutrients between pre and post typhoon periods using the nonparametric mann whitney u test the effects of typhoon and water depth on the δ13c δ15n and stoichiometry of the different pom size classes were evaluated by two way permanova analyses in past v3 0 2 6 multi nutrient cycling index the multi nutrient cycling index was calculated to track the cycling of multiple nutrients it is analogous to the widely used multi functionality index for nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems maestre et al 2012 delgado baquerizo et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 we constructed the multi nutrient cycling index including eight measured nutrient properties total carbon tc total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total phosphorus tp and phosphate phosphorus po4 p to quantify the multi nutrient cycling index for each sample we first normalized log transformed and then standardized each of the eight nutrient properties using z score transformation the standardized functions were then averaged to obtain the multi nutrient cycling index 2 7 indicators of multi nutrient cycling we assessed spearman s correlation coefficients between stable isotopes and the stoichiometry of different pom size classes and nutrients along the water column then the key predictors for the multi nutrient cycling index were explored using random forest regression analyses the analyses were conducted using the randomforest package in r environment r core team 2019 the higher mean square error mse value indicates the variable is more important we applied the a3 package to calculate the significance and cross validated r2 values with 5000 permutations of the response variables we simultaneously evaluated the significance of each predictor for the multifunctionality index using the rfpermute package 2 8 direct and indirect effects of key drivers on multi nutrient cycling finally we constructed partial least squares path models pls pm using the plspm package to illustrate the direct and indirect effects of the drivers on the multi nutrient cycling index in the surface middle and bottom waters respectively the drivers were categorized into 7 block variables meteorological factors meteo physicochemical factors env algae properties algae the mass of pom mass δ13c δ15n and stoichiometry stoichio we did not consider the complex relationships among δ13c δ15n and stoichiometry in our initial pls pm structure equation meteorological factors average 10 days included precipitation sunshine air temperature and wind speed physicochemical factors included water depth water level fluctuation euphotic depth water temperature ph dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity algae properties included chlorophyll a and the fv fm of algae groups we removed the variables with loadings 0 7 goodness of fit index gof and r2 were used to estimate model performance gao et al 2019 random forest and pls pm analyses were used as complementary approaches to identify the complex relationship between environmental drivers and the multi nutrient cycling following typhoon events random forest analysis does not require the a priori hypotheses that are needed in the initial pls pm analyses and it is therefore not limited by previous knowledge however pls pm can be used to partition the direct and indirect effects of the predictors on the multi nutrient cycling index 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions most typhoons reach our study site tingxi reservoir from july to october table s1 in this study four nepartak meranti megi and haima and two haitang and mawar typhoons were observed within a distance of 300 km from the typhoon center to tingxi reservoir in 2016 and 2017 respectively of these nepartak was the first typhoon with an accumulated 10 days precipitation of 97 3 mm and a maximum wind speed of 7 8 m s 1 fig 1 meranti was the strongest typhoon with a typhoon index 12 5 m2 s 1 an accumulated precipitation of 348 3 mm and a maximum wind speed of 36 4 m s 1 fig 1 table s1 these typhoons were typically accompanied by a decrease in air temperature and sunshine hours and increased local wind speed and precipitation however the meteorological conditions recovered rapidly within one or two days after the typhoon events 3 2 variations in nutrients and phytoplankton the typhoons significantly changed the nutrients in the deep waters fig 2 and deepened the thermocline of the reservoir fig s1c while the nutrient concentrations were relatively stable in the surface waters the concentration of nitrate nitrogen no3 n was significantly lower after the typhoons in the middle waters fig 2 and the concentration did not reach previous levels until 23 days after the typhoon haima fig s2 table s1 the concentration of nh4 n by contrast was significantly higher in the bottom waters after typhoon events fig 2 the concentrations of tn nh4 n and total phosphorus tp doubled in the bottom waters with a steep increase within the first month after the typhoons haima and mawar in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig s2 the pico and nano phytoplankton abundances increased sharply in the surface waters of the reservoir after the typhoon meranti in 2016 while a small increase was recorded after the typhoon haitang in 2017 fig s3 the responses of algae to typhoons varied between different algal groups but for all size classes algal abundances had recovered in the surface waters within the first month after the typhoons fig s3 3 3 stable isotopes and stoichiometry of particulate organic matter we found that the mass of pico pom increased significantly in the bottom waters after typhoon events fig 3 and a steep increase occurred following the typhoons haima and mawar in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig s4 the δ13c values displayed slight decrease in every size class and showed low ability to recover from the typhoons in the surface waters fig 3 fig s5 whereas the values were relatively stable and recovered rapidly in the middle and bottom waters after typhoons fig s6 the average δ13c of nano pom displayed a decrease of 3 1 in the surface waters fig s5 although the decrease was not significant fig 3 by contrast the δ15n of pom in the surface waters was relatively stable but decreased in the middle and bottom waters after typhoon events fig 3 fig s5 overall the δ15n values of pico pom were more sensitive to typhoons than other size classes table 1 the average δ15n value of pico pom had a decrease of 2 6 in both middle and bottom waters after typhoon events fig s6 although the decrease was not significant fig 3 the δ15n of pico and nano pom in the middle waters tended to recover within 23 days after the typhoon events fig s6 contrarily the lowest δ15n values of pico and nano pom were observed in the bottom waters after the meranti typhoon and the values remained extremely low 0 until the following year the c n ratios were relatively stable for every size class in the surface and middle waters whereas the value increased significantly for pico pom in the bottom waters after typhoons fig 3 for pico pom the highest c n ratio in the middle waters was observed after the megi typhoon followed by a rapid decrease from 11 to 8 after the haima typhoon fig s7 for pico and nano pom in the bottom waters the c n ratios displayed a steep increase and did not recover during the first month after the typhoon events whereas the c p and n p ratios remained low after the typhoons nepartak and haitang in 2016 and 2017 respectively for pico and net pom the δ13c and c n ratios were more similar to those of terrestrial sources after typhoon events in the bottom and middle waters respectively fig s8 the concentrations of particulate organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited a steep increase within the first month after typhoon events fig s7 3 4 potential indicators of nutrient cycling the δ13c of all pom size classes exhibited a positive correlation with total carbon tc and total organic carbon toc and a negative correlation with total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrogen no3 n in the surface waters p 0 05 fig s9 the δ15n values of pico pom demonstrated the strongest positive correlation with tn and no3 n in the middle waters in the bottom waters the δ15n c p and n p of pico pom were negatively correlated with nh4 n and tp but the c n and the mass of pico pom showed a positive correlation with nh4 n the large size classes displayed weak correlations with the concentration of nutrients compared with pico pom in deep waters the δ13c of nano and net pom and c p of pico pom were key indicators in the multi nutrient cycling index for surface waters while the chlorophyll a of the green algal group was the important indicator for middle waters fig 4 c n n p and the mass of pico pom were important indicators in the multi nutrient cycling index for bottom waters despite of the key role played by electrical conductivity ec and the fv fm of the brown algal group overall pico pom was the most important factor for the nutrient cycling of bottom waters fig 4 fig s9 the δ13c of pico and nano pom were found to be important indicators in the multi nutrient cycling index followed by chlorophyll a throughout the water column fig 4 the multi nutrient cycling index was well explained by our partial least squares path modeling pls pm in the surface r2 0 41 middle r2 0 79 bottom r2 0 83 and all water layers r2 0 43 fig s10 for surface waters the δ13c and stoichiometry of pom had a direct but non significant effect on the multi nutrient cycling index while the meteorological factors exerted a direct effect on the algae and an indirect effect on the multi nutrient cycling index fig 5 for the middle waters the δ13c and δ15n of pom were the most important drivers having a direct and significant effect on the multi nutrient cycling index for the bottom waters the δ13c δ15n and mass of pom were the main drivers with direct and significant effect on the multi nutrient cycling index and algae exerted a strong and indirect effect on the multi nutrient cycling index through δ15n and mass of pom fig 5 fig s10 for the whole water column meteorological factors physicochemical factors δ13c and the mass of pom had a direct and significant effect on the multi nutrient cycling index fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 the prolonged response of deep waters to typhoon events although previous studies have shown distinct responses of plankton communities and ecosystem metabolism to artificial mixing disturbances between upper and deep waters shade et al 2011 2012 giling et al 2017 the response of these waters to typhoon events is poorly understood especially for the deep reservoirs 30 m we found that nutrients and pom exhibited a more prolonged response to typhoon events in the bottom than in the surface and middle waters of the reservoir we studied furthermore the events were accompanied by strong mixing disturbance that deepened the thermocline and the hypoxic boundary the thermocline re established one day after the typhoons which was faster than typically found in artificial mixing experiments shade et al 2012 giling et al 2017 unlike the artificial mixing disturbances typhoons typically bring large amounts of dissolved and particulate nutrients into aquatic ecosystems through runoff paerl et al 2006 tseng et al 2010 johnson et al 2018 the c n and δ13c values of the pico and net pom in the bottom and middle waters respectively were similar to those of terrestrial organic matter tom after typhoon events indicating input and decomposition of tom in deep waters fig s8 similarly we found depleted δ15n values of the pico and nano pom following typhoon events suggesting that 15n depleted tom contributed to the nitrogen cycling processes in bottom waters further the significant correlation between δ15n and nutrient cycling provided evidence of a distinct nitrogen cycling following typhoon events in deep waters the decomposition and nitrogen cycling processes are typically controlled by the input of terrestrial organic matter and the microbial communities gu 2009 particulate organic matter sinking from the surface to bottom waters is another important contributor to the biogeochemical processes of deep waters paerl et al 2006 schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 although the algal abundance did not change and remained low in the bottom waters after typhoon events the concentration and mass of pom algae and dead organic matter in the bottom waters increased steeply after the typhoons most notable in 2016 fig s3 fig s4 indicating that most of the algae in the bottom waters were senescent being undetected in the autofluorescence based chlorophyll a measurement further sediment resuspension might contribute to the increase in pom and thus the nutrient cycling in bottom waters especially immediately after the strong typhoon if sediment resuspension was the main contributor to the increase in the pom concentration of bottom waters the concentration and mass of pom should have been higher in the bottom than in the middle waters however we found that the concentration and mass of pom were higher in the middle than bottom waters during the first 10 days after typhoons meranti and megi in 2016 fig s3 fig s4 indicating that the contribution of sediment resuspension was less than particle sinking already 3 days after the typhoons this is further supported by the fact that the concentration and mass of pom increased steeply immediately after the typhoons and then recovered to the pre disturbance level again within the first month after the typhoons in the middle waters concurrent with an accumulation and a prolonged increase in chlorophyll a and the mass of pom in the bottom waters fig s2 fig s4 moreover our random forest regression fig 4 and final partial least squares path models fig 5 indicated the algae i e chlorophyll a and fv fm played a key role in the particulate organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling in the middle and bottom waters therefore we assume that typhoon driven disturbance contributed substantially to the biogeochemical processes of deep waters through increased algae sinking overall the increased organic matter input algae sinking and subsequent decomposition may explain the steep accumulation of nutrients e g carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and prolonged response of the bottom water ecosystem to the typhoon induced disturbances 4 2 small sized pom is a key nutrient cycling indicator in bottom waters our result indicated that small sized or pico sized pom i e 0 2 3 μm was a key indicator of the nutrient cycling in bottom waters many studies mostly focusing on specific taxonomic groups have shown large variations in plankton communities following typhoons in subtropical lakes and reservoirs jones et al 2008 tseng et al 2013 ko et al 2017 stockwell et al 2020 however the response of different taxonomic groups to typhoon events can vary with size and chemical composition e g c n ratio johnson et al 2018 here we assessed the key drivers of nutrient cycling along the water column using different pom size classes covering the entire size spectrum of the taxonomic groups of microbial plankton we found a steep increase in mass and particulate organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus of pico pom in the bottom waters after the typhoons this was consistent with the 15n depleted pom and a steep increase of nh4 n concentrations after typhoons which may reflect a higher release rate of 15n depleted nh4 n from the tom and the uptake by the small sized pom supporting this view shade et al 2012 reported an increasing activity of bacteria in deep waters after an artificial mixing disturbance although the community structure can recover after typhoon induced disturbances jones et al 2008 ji et al 2018 the microbially mediated nutrient cycling processes showed a prolonged response to typhoon events in our study reservoir furthermore the bacteria and microalgae have been shown to accumulate polyphosphate by the luxury uptake of phosphorus in waters khoshmanesh et al 2002 powell et al 2009 this can explain the accumulation of total phosphorus and the particulate organic phosphorus in pico pom but not phosphate especially in deep waters after typhoons the ecological consequences of typhoon events in deep lakes reservoirs have been increasingly studied not least through artificial mixing experiments shade et al 2012 giling et al 2017 however natural typhoon driven disturbances have more complicated ecological consequences compared with artificial mixing disturbances and particulate organic matter of different sizes should be considered when elucidating the pathways and key drivers of the nutrient cycling in deep waters affecting the ecosystem functioning in a changing environment the c n ratio is a key indicator of the bottom up energy matter transfer efficiency sardans et al 2012 however the increased organic matter input and decomposition promoted by typhoons may cause large variations in elemental concentrations and the c n ratio of pom in freshwater ecosystems paerl et al 2006 sterner et al 2007 sardans et al 2012 johnson et al 2018 we found a high c n ratio of pico pom in the bottom waters after typhoon events the typhoon driven increase in the c n ratio of pico pom may reduce the energy transfer efficiency across trophic levels and accelerate the heterotrophic decomposition in deep waters this may increase the decomposition processes and organic matter mineralization and thus augment nh4 n concentration in deep waters schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 chen et al 2020 4 3 implications for water resource management and conservation typhoons can facilitate nutrient cycling and accumulation in deep waters thereby increasing the risk of eutrophication and cyanobacterial dominance of the drinking water reservoir and downstream waters stockwell et al 2020 the steep and prolonged increases of total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus in the bottom waters of the deep reservoir after typhoons could increase the risk of the eutrophication development and cyanobacterial dominance when these nutrients eventually reach the surface waters after mixing disturbances the typhoon driven higher release rate of nh4 n along with depletion in oxygen due to the mineralization may promote the release of phosphorus by stimulating alkaline phosphatase activity ma et al 2018 we did find an increased algal abundance in surface waters after the typhoons although there was no significant increase in the chlorophyll a concentration likely reflecting that algal groups differ in chlorophyll a quantities per cell canfield et al 2019 the cyanobacteria can be fueled by ammonium in the surface water and recovered quickly after typhoon chen et al 2018 and the algae sinking in turn acts as important source for nutrient accumulation in the deep waters thus the increased typhoon driven organic matter input and nutrient cycling in the bottom waters potentially drive harmful algal blooms in deep reservoirs maavara et al 2020 and increase export of the bioavailable nutrients to downstream waters chen et al 2020 and cause serious water quality problems in this study we focus on the short term effect of typhoon but longer term high resolution sampling is needed to gain a better understanding of the differential effect of different typhoons and potential carry over effect from one typhoon to the next 5 conclusions this study evaluated the ecological consequences of typhoon events by combining stable isotope and stoichiometry analyses with a multi nutrient cycling index in a subtropical deep reservoir we found a more prolonged response of nutrients and pom in the bottom than in the surface and middle waters following typhoon events the connectivity between surface and deep waters through sinking algae could partially explain the prolonged responses of pom and nutrients in the bottom waters the increased c n ratio of small sized or pico sized pom i e 0 2 3 μm driven by typhoons may have inhibited the bottom up energy matter transfer efficiency and accelerated the heterotrophic decomposition in deep waters the pico pom was a key contributor to the enhanced nutrient cycling in deep waters the organic matter input algae sinking and heterotrophic bacteria interacted with each other to cause the steep and prolonged increases of total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus in the bottom waters of the reservoir the increasing intensity of typhoons might increase the risk of eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms in

17407,intense storms pose a serious threat to ecosystem functioning and services however the effects of typhoons tropical cyclones on the biogeochemical processes mediating risk of eutrophication in deep freshwater ecosystems remain unclear here we conducted a three year study to elucidate linkages between environmental change stable isotopes and the stoichiometry of particulate organic matter pom and nutrient cycling i e carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in a subtropical deep reservoir subjected to typhoon events the typhoons significantly changed the nutrient levels in the deep waters as well as the thermocline position increased typhoon driven organic matter input algae sinking and heterotrophic decomposition interacted with each other to cause steep and prolonged increases of total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus in the bottom waters of the reservoir small sized or pico sized pom i e 0 2 3 μm showed a substantial increase in bottom waters and it exhibited stronger response than large sized pom i e 3 20 20 64 64 200 μm to the typhoons our results also indicated that typhoons boost the nutrient cycling in deep waters mainly through pico sized pom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic matter deep water mixing microbial loop multi nutrient cycling index stable isotope stoichiometry 1 introduction in tropical and subtropical regions the intensity of typhoon events also termed tropical cyclones or hurricanes are expected to increase as a consequence of the ongoing climate changes as well as to cause economic and ecosystem functioning losses due to the strong wind and torrential rain mumby et al 2011 coumou and rahmstorf 2012 fang 2016 emanuel 2020 deep reservoirs and lakes are typically characterized by algae rich surface waters epilimnion and potential nutrient rich bottom waters hypolimnion boehrer and schultze 2008 yu et al 2014 wind induced mixing disturbances can bring the hypolimnetic nutrients up into the photic zone and heavy precipitation may lead to an increase in the influx of terrestrial material including nutrients into these waterbodies paerl et al 2006 sinha et al 2017 such pulse disturbances are typically accompanied by an increased algae biomass or a shift in the plankton community composition tseng et al 2013 ji et al 2018 stockwell et al 2020 however the underlying processes and mechanisms driving the variations of plankton community after typhoon are difficult to estimate from typical low frequency monitoring high frequency observations using novel methodology however may enhance our understanding of the biogeochemical processes following episodic climatic disturbances in freshwater ecosystems in an increasingly changing world the stoichiometry and stable isotopes of particulate organic matter pom are useful tools for the understanding of the biogeochemical processes associated with plankton dynamics and eutrophication processes leal et al 2017 glibert et al 2019 the stoichiometric variations of grazer and algae can influence the rates of nutrient release altering the structure and functioning of freshwater ecosystems elser and urabe 1999 stable isotopes of pom have been widely used to study the biogeochemical processes and to track element sources fry 2006 gu 2009 gu et al 2011 glibert et al 2019 the stable carbon isotope δ13c of pom is considered as a good proxy for co2 concentration and primary production and stable nitrogen isotope δ15n can be used as indicators of the n2 fixation process and trophic position along a food chain in lakes gu et al 2006 trochine et al 2017 therefore the temporally and spatially integrated information on biogeochemical processes provided by stable isotopes and the stoichiometry of pom are important for understanding the nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems following typhoon events the size of pom is an important functional trait as it affects the bioavailability and biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems woodward et al 2005 pom mainly consists of plankton and dead organic matter moore et al 2004 the sizes of most free living bacteria are typically 3 μm while most planktonic algae are larger and within the range 3 20 μm and most protozoans and metazoan are 20 μm and 64 μm respectively chételat et al 2006 the responses of plankton to typhoon driven disturbances vary among size classes and along the water column jones et al 2008 ji et al 2018 in a natural lake jones et al 2008 for example found that the bacterial community composition recovered fast after a typhoon disturbance while the algal communities did not moreover microbial communities exhibited a higher ability to recover from an artificial mixing disturbance in the surface waters than in the deep waters shade et al 2012 therefore studies should not only focus on the microbial communities in the surface waters but also explore the potentially prolonged responses of the microbially mediated biogeochemical processes in the deep waters following strong winds e g typhoons stoichiometry plays a key role for the nutrient cycling and community composition sardans et al 2012 the c p ratio of organic matter for example can greatly influence the global nitrogen fixation rate wang et al 2019 the multi nutrient cycling index i e carbon nitrogen and phosphorus has been used to address the importance of different taxonomic groups for the nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems delgado baquerizo et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 however less is known about the contribution of key drivers and the implications of different pom size classes for the multi nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems especially following typhoon events we explored the susceptibility and drivers of nutrient cycling using meteorological and physicochemical variables stable isotopes and the stoichiometry of different pom size classes following typhoon events in a subtropical reservoir fig s1 we focused on the two questions 1 how did the typhoon affect the biotic and abiotic conditions in different water layers of the reservoir 2 which size fraction of poms can be a key indicator of changes in nutrient cycling to answer these questions we explored the environmental change throughout the water column during one month before and after typhoon events in tingxi reservoir in southeast china we then assessed the importance of different pom size classes for the multi nutrient cycling using the stable isotopes and stoichiometry of pom we hypothesized that 1 pom changes concentration and size driven by the typhoon events would differ among the different water layers and that 2 pom would be a key contributor to the nutrient cycling differing though in importance among particle size classes and water layers this study highlights the importance of using stable isotopes and stoichiometry of pom to elucidate the nutrient cycling in different water layers and provides new insight into the biogeochemical processes of freshwater ecosystems following typhoon events 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling processes a three year 2015 2017 field sampling campaign was conducted near the dam of the tingxi reservoir 24 48 n 118 08 e in xiamen city fujian province southeast china tingxi reservoir was built in 1956 and has a drainage area of about 100 km2 and a total storage of 48 106 m3 yang et al 2012 the trophic state of the reservoir was light eutrophic level with a trophic state index ranging from 50 8 to 56 3 which were calculated using chlorophyll a secchi depth and total phosphorus yang et al 2012 the reservoir is deep with surface chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 9 5 to 22 2 μg dm 3 details of the reservoir are given in our previous studies yang et al 2012 2016 gao et al 2019 annual mean precipitation is about 1336 mm and annual mean temperature 20 7 c liu et al 2019 xiamen is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate and is located at the westbound belt of typhoon movement in the northwestern pacific ocean typhoons are a common disturbance of the tingxi reservoir especially during the water stratification period in summer and autumn samples of particulate organic matter pom were collected every 20 days every 10 days in september 2016 after the typhoon meranti from 2015 to 2017 samples were collected from the subsurface layer depth 0 5 m the hypoxic boundary depth 21 27 m and subbottom layer 2 m above the bottom sediments fig s1a b pom was partitioned into four size classes fractions 0 2 3 μm pico sized 3 20 μm nano sized 20 64 μm micro sized and 64 200 μm net sized briefly we pre filtered the samples through 200 μm 64 μm and 20 μm nylon sieves in situ followed by sequential filtering through 3 μm and 0 2 μm pore size polycarbonate filters 47 mm diameter millipore billerica ma usa in the laboratory the samples were then gently backwashed from filters into 15 cm3 plastic centrifuge tubes finally all the samples were freeze dried at 80 c for at least 72 h prior to nitrogen and carbon elemental and isotopic analyses 2 2 meteorological data collection fujian province is a perfect region for studying typhoon induced disturbances sajjad et al 2019 we focused on typhoons within a 300 km distance from the typhoon center to the tingxi reservoir table s1 fig 1 data on air temperature at precipitation and wind speed ws were collected from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn at station xiamen id 59 134 coordinates 24 29 n 118 04 e to evaluate the effect of typhoon we applied 10 days average air temperature 10 days average wind speed 10 days accumulated precipitation and 10 days accumulated sunshine duration prior to the sampling dates 2 3 abiotic and phytoplankton data collection water depth was measured with a speedtech sm 5 depthmate portable sounder speedtech instruments great falls va usa water temperature wt ph dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ at 0 5 m intervals using a multiparameter water quality analyzer hydrolab ds5 hach company loveland co usa total carbon tc and total organic carbon toc were determined using a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and phosphate phosphorus po4 p were analyzed by spectrophotometry total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured by spectrophotometry after digestion greenberg et al 1992 water transparency was measured with a 30 cm diameter secchi disk depth of euphotic zone zeu was estimated as 2 7 times the secchi depth cole 1994 the masses of the nano and pico pom size classes were sampled by sequential filtering of the samples through 20 μm 3 μm and 0 2 μm pore size polycarbonate filters 47 mm diameter millipore billerica ma usa respectively subsequently the filters were weighed after drying at 50 c for at least 72 h chlorophyll a and fv fm of blue green cyanobacteria green chlorophytes and brown mostly diatoms and dinoflagellates algae and the total phytoplankton were measured ex situ with a phyto pam phytoplankton analyzer heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter fv fm indicates the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem ii psii photochemistry and can be used as an early disturbance indicator in algae dittami et al 2016 the dominant algal groups were counted using a flowsight cytometer amnis merck millipore darmstadt germany equipped with blue green 488 nm 60 mv and sideward scatter ssc 785 nm 12 mv solid state lasers and high image resolution 20 magnification the analyses were performed on amnis ideas software version 6 2 red autofluorescence of photosynthetic pigments and ssc were used to distinguish the algae from dead particles red and yellow autofluorescences were defined as algal group 1 and group 2 respectively 2 4 stable isotopes and stoichiometry of particulate organic matter percent carbon percent nitrogen and δ13c and δ15n of pom samples were measured using a thermo electron flash ea 2000 elemental analyzer ea coupled to a delta v isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma usa carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were presented as δ13c and δ15n relative to vienna pee dee belemnite carbonate and atmospheric n2 isotopes respectively fry 2006 average analytical errors for δ13c and δ15n were approximately 0 13 and 0 1 respectively in this study we used the carbon content and c n ratios to correct the δ13c of the net pom for lipid bias syväranta and rautio 2010 other pom size classes typically consisted of algae or bacteria and the carbon content c of these pom samples was almost less than 40 in our study therefore we did not correct the δ13c of the other pom size classes following the method of a previous study post et al 2007 all stoichiometric ratios were calculated using the elemental content of pom 2 5 analysis of temporal changes in water parameters to track the ecological consequences of typhoon events samples taken within one month before and after typhoon events were selected as pre and post typhoon periods respectively table s1 since the different pom size classes from different water layers were only available from 2016 to 2017 further data analyses were thus performed based on data from the two years we compared the differences in nutrients between pre and post typhoon periods using the nonparametric mann whitney u test the effects of typhoon and water depth on the δ13c δ15n and stoichiometry of the different pom size classes were evaluated by two way permanova analyses in past v3 0 2 6 multi nutrient cycling index the multi nutrient cycling index was calculated to track the cycling of multiple nutrients it is analogous to the widely used multi functionality index for nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems maestre et al 2012 delgado baquerizo et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 we constructed the multi nutrient cycling index including eight measured nutrient properties total carbon tc total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total phosphorus tp and phosphate phosphorus po4 p to quantify the multi nutrient cycling index for each sample we first normalized log transformed and then standardized each of the eight nutrient properties using z score transformation the standardized functions were then averaged to obtain the multi nutrient cycling index 2 7 indicators of multi nutrient cycling we assessed spearman s correlation coefficients between stable isotopes and the stoichiometry of different pom size classes and nutrients along the water column then the key predictors for the multi nutrient cycling index were explored using random forest regression analyses the analyses were conducted using the randomforest package in r environment r core team 2019 the higher mean square error mse value indicates the variable is more important we applied the a3 package to calculate the significance and cross validated r2 values with 5000 permutations of the response variables we simultaneously evaluated the significance of each predictor for the multifunctionality index using the rfpermute package 2 8 direct and indirect effects of key drivers on multi nutrient cycling finally we constructed partial least squares path models pls pm using the plspm package to illustrate the direct and indirect effects of the drivers on the multi nutrient cycling index in the surface middle and bottom waters respectively the drivers were categorized into 7 block variables meteorological factors meteo physicochemical factors env algae properties algae the mass of pom mass δ13c δ15n and stoichiometry stoichio we did not consider the complex relationships among δ13c δ15n and stoichiometry in our initial pls pm structure equation meteorological factors average 10 days included precipitation sunshine air temperature and wind speed physicochemical factors included water depth water level fluctuation euphotic depth water temperature ph dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity algae properties included chlorophyll a and the fv fm of algae groups we removed the variables with loadings 0 7 goodness of fit index gof and r2 were used to estimate model performance gao et al 2019 random forest and pls pm analyses were used as complementary approaches to identify the complex relationship between environmental drivers and the multi nutrient cycling following typhoon events random forest analysis does not require the a priori hypotheses that are needed in the initial pls pm analyses and it is therefore not limited by previous knowledge however pls pm can be used to partition the direct and indirect effects of the predictors on the multi nutrient cycling index 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions most typhoons reach our study site tingxi reservoir from july to october table s1 in this study four nepartak meranti megi and haima and two haitang and mawar typhoons were observed within a distance of 300 km from the typhoon center to tingxi reservoir in 2016 and 2017 respectively of these nepartak was the first typhoon with an accumulated 10 days precipitation of 97 3 mm and a maximum wind speed of 7 8 m s 1 fig 1 meranti was the strongest typhoon with a typhoon index 12 5 m2 s 1 an accumulated precipitation of 348 3 mm and a maximum wind speed of 36 4 m s 1 fig 1 table s1 these typhoons were typically accompanied by a decrease in air temperature and sunshine hours and increased local wind speed and precipitation however the meteorological conditions recovered rapidly within one or two days after the typhoon events 3 2 variations in nutrients and phytoplankton the typhoons significantly changed the nutrients in the deep waters fig 2 and deepened the thermocline of the reservoir fig s1c while the nutrient concentrations were relatively stable in the surface waters the concentration of nitrate nitrogen no3 n was significantly lower after the typhoons in the middle waters fig 2 and the concentration did not reach previous levels until 23 days after the typhoon haima fig s2 table s1 the concentration of nh4 n by contrast was significantly higher in the bottom waters after typhoon events fig 2 the concentrations of tn nh4 n and total phosphorus tp doubled in the bottom waters with a steep increase within the first month after the typhoons haima and mawar in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig s2 the pico and nano phytoplankton abundances increased sharply in the surface waters of the reservoir after the typhoon meranti in 2016 while a small increase was recorded after the typhoon haitang in 2017 fig s3 the responses of algae to typhoons varied between different algal groups but for all size classes algal abundances had recovered in the surface waters within the first month after the typhoons fig s3 3 3 stable isotopes and stoichiometry of particulate organic matter we found that the mass of pico pom increased significantly in the bottom waters after typhoon events fig 3 and a steep increase occurred following the typhoons haima and mawar in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig s4 the δ13c values displayed slight decrease in every size class and showed low ability to recover from the typhoons in the surface waters fig 3 fig s5 whereas the values were relatively stable and recovered rapidly in the middle and bottom waters after typhoons fig s6 the average δ13c of nano pom displayed a decrease of 3 1 in the surface waters fig s5 although the decrease was not significant fig 3 by contrast the δ15n of pom in the surface waters was relatively stable but decreased in the middle and bottom waters after typhoon events fig 3 fig s5 overall the δ15n values of pico pom were more sensitive to typhoons than other size classes table 1 the average δ15n value of pico pom had a decrease of 2 6 in both middle and bottom waters after typhoon events fig s6 although the decrease was not significant fig 3 the δ15n of pico and nano pom in the middle waters tended to recover within 23 days after the typhoon events fig s6 contrarily the lowest δ15n values of pico and nano pom were observed in the bottom waters after the meranti typhoon and the values remained extremely low 0 until the following year the c n ratios were relatively stable for every size class in the surface and middle waters whereas the value increased significantly for pico pom in the bottom waters after typhoons fig 3 for pico pom the highest c n ratio in the middle waters was observed after the megi typhoon followed by a rapid decrease from 11 to 8 after the haima typhoon fig s7 for pico and nano pom in the bottom waters the c n ratios displayed a steep increase and did not recover during the first month after the typhoon events whereas the c p and n p ratios remained low after the typhoons nepartak and haitang in 2016 and 2017 respectively for pico and net pom the δ13c and c n ratios were more similar to those of terrestrial sources after typhoon events in the bottom and middle waters respectively fig s8 the concentrations of particulate organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited a steep increase within the first month after typhoon events fig s7 3 4 potential indicators of nutrient cycling the δ13c of all pom size classes exhibited a positive correlation with total carbon tc and total organic carbon toc and a negative correlation with total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrogen no3 n in the surface waters p 0 05 fig s9 the δ15n values of pico pom demonstrated the strongest positive correlation with tn and no3 n in the middle waters in the bottom waters the δ15n c p and n p of pico pom were negatively correlated with nh4 n and tp but the c n and the mass of pico pom showed a positive correlation with nh4 n the large size classes displayed weak correlations with the concentration of nutrients compared with pico pom in deep waters the δ13c of nano and net pom and c p of pico pom were key indicators in the multi nutrient cycling index for surface waters while the chlorophyll a of the green algal group was the important indicator for middle waters fig 4 c n n p and the mass of pico pom were important indicators in the multi nutrient cycling index for bottom waters despite of the key role played by electrical conductivity ec and the fv fm of the brown algal group overall pico pom was the most important factor for the nutrient cycling of bottom waters fig 4 fig s9 the δ13c of pico and nano pom were found to be important indicators in the multi nutrient cycling index followed by chlorophyll a throughout the water column fig 4 the multi nutrient cycling index was well explained by our partial least squares path modeling pls pm in the surface r2 0 41 middle r2 0 79 bottom r2 0 83 and all water layers r2 0 43 fig s10 for surface waters the δ13c and stoichiometry of pom had a direct but non significant effect on the multi nutrient cycling index while the meteorological factors exerted a direct effect on the algae and an indirect effect on the multi nutrient cycling index fig 5 for the middle waters the δ13c and δ15n of pom were the most important drivers having a direct and significant effect on the multi nutrient cycling index for the bottom waters the δ13c δ15n and mass of pom were the main drivers with direct and significant effect on the multi nutrient cycling index and algae exerted a strong and indirect effect on the multi nutrient cycling index through δ15n and mass of pom fig 5 fig s10 for the whole water column meteorological factors physicochemical factors δ13c and the mass of pom had a direct and significant effect on the multi nutrient cycling index fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 the prolonged response of deep waters to typhoon events although previous studies have shown distinct responses of plankton communities and ecosystem metabolism to artificial mixing disturbances between upper and deep waters shade et al 2011 2012 giling et al 2017 the response of these waters to typhoon events is poorly understood especially for the deep reservoirs 30 m we found that nutrients and pom exhibited a more prolonged response to typhoon events in the bottom than in the surface and middle waters of the reservoir we studied furthermore the events were accompanied by strong mixing disturbance that deepened the thermocline and the hypoxic boundary the thermocline re established one day after the typhoons which was faster than typically found in artificial mixing experiments shade et al 2012 giling et al 2017 unlike the artificial mixing disturbances typhoons typically bring large amounts of dissolved and particulate nutrients into aquatic ecosystems through runoff paerl et al 2006 tseng et al 2010 johnson et al 2018 the c n and δ13c values of the pico and net pom in the bottom and middle waters respectively were similar to those of terrestrial organic matter tom after typhoon events indicating input and decomposition of tom in deep waters fig s8 similarly we found depleted δ15n values of the pico and nano pom following typhoon events suggesting that 15n depleted tom contributed to the nitrogen cycling processes in bottom waters further the significant correlation between δ15n and nutrient cycling provided evidence of a distinct nitrogen cycling following typhoon events in deep waters the decomposition and nitrogen cycling processes are typically controlled by the input of terrestrial organic matter and the microbial communities gu 2009 particulate organic matter sinking from the surface to bottom waters is another important contributor to the biogeochemical processes of deep waters paerl et al 2006 schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 although the algal abundance did not change and remained low in the bottom waters after typhoon events the concentration and mass of pom algae and dead organic matter in the bottom waters increased steeply after the typhoons most notable in 2016 fig s3 fig s4 indicating that most of the algae in the bottom waters were senescent being undetected in the autofluorescence based chlorophyll a measurement further sediment resuspension might contribute to the increase in pom and thus the nutrient cycling in bottom waters especially immediately after the strong typhoon if sediment resuspension was the main contributor to the increase in the pom concentration of bottom waters the concentration and mass of pom should have been higher in the bottom than in the middle waters however we found that the concentration and mass of pom were higher in the middle than bottom waters during the first 10 days after typhoons meranti and megi in 2016 fig s3 fig s4 indicating that the contribution of sediment resuspension was less than particle sinking already 3 days after the typhoons this is further supported by the fact that the concentration and mass of pom increased steeply immediately after the typhoons and then recovered to the pre disturbance level again within the first month after the typhoons in the middle waters concurrent with an accumulation and a prolonged increase in chlorophyll a and the mass of pom in the bottom waters fig s2 fig s4 moreover our random forest regression fig 4 and final partial least squares path models fig 5 indicated the algae i e chlorophyll a and fv fm played a key role in the particulate organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling in the middle and bottom waters therefore we assume that typhoon driven disturbance contributed substantially to the biogeochemical processes of deep waters through increased algae sinking overall the increased organic matter input algae sinking and subsequent decomposition may explain the steep accumulation of nutrients e g carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and prolonged response of the bottom water ecosystem to the typhoon induced disturbances 4 2 small sized pom is a key nutrient cycling indicator in bottom waters our result indicated that small sized or pico sized pom i e 0 2 3 μm was a key indicator of the nutrient cycling in bottom waters many studies mostly focusing on specific taxonomic groups have shown large variations in plankton communities following typhoons in subtropical lakes and reservoirs jones et al 2008 tseng et al 2013 ko et al 2017 stockwell et al 2020 however the response of different taxonomic groups to typhoon events can vary with size and chemical composition e g c n ratio johnson et al 2018 here we assessed the key drivers of nutrient cycling along the water column using different pom size classes covering the entire size spectrum of the taxonomic groups of microbial plankton we found a steep increase in mass and particulate organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus of pico pom in the bottom waters after the typhoons this was consistent with the 15n depleted pom and a steep increase of nh4 n concentrations after typhoons which may reflect a higher release rate of 15n depleted nh4 n from the tom and the uptake by the small sized pom supporting this view shade et al 2012 reported an increasing activity of bacteria in deep waters after an artificial mixing disturbance although the community structure can recover after typhoon induced disturbances jones et al 2008 ji et al 2018 the microbially mediated nutrient cycling processes showed a prolonged response to typhoon events in our study reservoir furthermore the bacteria and microalgae have been shown to accumulate polyphosphate by the luxury uptake of phosphorus in waters khoshmanesh et al 2002 powell et al 2009 this can explain the accumulation of total phosphorus and the particulate organic phosphorus in pico pom but not phosphate especially in deep waters after typhoons the ecological consequences of typhoon events in deep lakes reservoirs have been increasingly studied not least through artificial mixing experiments shade et al 2012 giling et al 2017 however natural typhoon driven disturbances have more complicated ecological consequences compared with artificial mixing disturbances and particulate organic matter of different sizes should be considered when elucidating the pathways and key drivers of the nutrient cycling in deep waters affecting the ecosystem functioning in a changing environment the c n ratio is a key indicator of the bottom up energy matter transfer efficiency sardans et al 2012 however the increased organic matter input and decomposition promoted by typhoons may cause large variations in elemental concentrations and the c n ratio of pom in freshwater ecosystems paerl et al 2006 sterner et al 2007 sardans et al 2012 johnson et al 2018 we found a high c n ratio of pico pom in the bottom waters after typhoon events the typhoon driven increase in the c n ratio of pico pom may reduce the energy transfer efficiency across trophic levels and accelerate the heterotrophic decomposition in deep waters this may increase the decomposition processes and organic matter mineralization and thus augment nh4 n concentration in deep waters schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 chen et al 2020 4 3 implications for water resource management and conservation typhoons can facilitate nutrient cycling and accumulation in deep waters thereby increasing the risk of eutrophication and cyanobacterial dominance of the drinking water reservoir and downstream waters stockwell et al 2020 the steep and prolonged increases of total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus in the bottom waters of the deep reservoir after typhoons could increase the risk of the eutrophication development and cyanobacterial dominance when these nutrients eventually reach the surface waters after mixing disturbances the typhoon driven higher release rate of nh4 n along with depletion in oxygen due to the mineralization may promote the release of phosphorus by stimulating alkaline phosphatase activity ma et al 2018 we did find an increased algal abundance in surface waters after the typhoons although there was no significant increase in the chlorophyll a concentration likely reflecting that algal groups differ in chlorophyll a quantities per cell canfield et al 2019 the cyanobacteria can be fueled by ammonium in the surface water and recovered quickly after typhoon chen et al 2018 and the algae sinking in turn acts as important source for nutrient accumulation in the deep waters thus the increased typhoon driven organic matter input and nutrient cycling in the bottom waters potentially drive harmful algal blooms in deep reservoirs maavara et al 2020 and increase export of the bioavailable nutrients to downstream waters chen et al 2020 and cause serious water quality problems in this study we focus on the short term effect of typhoon but longer term high resolution sampling is needed to gain a better understanding of the differential effect of different typhoons and potential carry over effect from one typhoon to the next 5 conclusions this study evaluated the ecological consequences of typhoon events by combining stable isotope and stoichiometry analyses with a multi nutrient cycling index in a subtropical deep reservoir we found a more prolonged response of nutrients and pom in the bottom than in the surface and middle waters following typhoon events the connectivity between surface and deep waters through sinking algae could partially explain the prolonged responses of pom and nutrients in the bottom waters the increased c n ratio of small sized or pico sized pom i e 0 2 3 μm driven by typhoons may have inhibited the bottom up energy matter transfer efficiency and accelerated the heterotrophic decomposition in deep waters the pico pom was a key contributor to the enhanced nutrient cycling in deep waters the organic matter input algae sinking and heterotrophic bacteria interacted with each other to cause the steep and prolonged increases of total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus in the bottom waters of the reservoir the increasing intensity of typhoons might increase the risk of eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms in

17408,the focus of infrastructure design and management has turned from a reliability based approach to a resilience based one resilience is a system s ability to maintain its function and minimize failure consequences when faced with exceptional conditions this study carries out a large scale computational experiment to study how resilience is affected by system s structure in a combined sewer system we build a stochastic generation model involving a random sampling of facility locations and a graph based random walk sampling algorithm to generate various layouts of pipelines the performance of these virtual systems are assessed in the storm water management model we apply statistical techniques on these samples to study the relation between resilience and system structure results show that the number of combined sewer overflow cso outfalls is a more important factor of resilience compared to the number of wastewater treatment plants wwtps some locations are found more preferable for wwtp or cso outfall placement while adding wwtps or outfalls at other locations might even lower the system s resilience size of the sub catchments of the cso outfalls also affects resilience although this effect is statistically significant the extent is not remarkable compared to other factors we further study the structural features of the cost effective systems the highest achievable resilience level increases as the number of cso outfalls decreases and so does system s cost this results from the difference in cso quantity therefore this dilemma can be cut off by end of pipe storage or treatment which specifically tackles cso the conclusion of this study provides an insight into the structural factors of combined sewer systems resilience and can provide guidance for system s planning graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords combined sewer system resilience system structure stochastic generation combined sewer overflow 1 introduction the urban drainage system uds usually massive in size with a complex structure and dynamic interrelation between its components provides fundamental services for the economy and society the uds is recognized as a critical infrastructure in that any functional failure would result in an unacceptably huge damage u s niac 2010 2016 they are constantly threatened by impact from both outside and within the system e g climate change urbanization aging components etc due to the diversity and unpredictability of these impacts it is impossible to take precautions against all kinds of hidden threats by a scenario based strategy instead the resilience based approach or safe to fail approach looks into system s performance under the black swan events and requires that the system should be safe even after it fails in other words it emphasizes that systems should have certain ability to minimize failure consequences under exceptional loading conditions as well as satisfying the traditional reliability based requirements i e to operate regularly under the standard loading condition ahern 2011 butler et al 2014 to enhance uds s performance in the uncertain future the resilience based approach should be applied to the management rehabilitation and most importantly to the planning of uds obviously adopting a better structure at the planning stage would be much more cost effective than rehabilitation but by far no guidance could be provided in this respect therefore we carry out a large scale stochastic computational experiment to address this need and explore the patterns between resilience and system structure resilience was first defined for ecosystems holling 1973 and later extended to other domains including engineering systems hosseini et al 2016 an infrastructure s resilience is the system s ability to minimize failure magnitude and or duration under disruptive events u s niac 2010 two types of definition for uds s resilience can be found in literature 1 a multi criteria assessment with quantitative or semi quantitative indicators related to the equipment and management level of the system bruneau et al 2003 milman et al 2008 karamouz et al 2016 2 a single quantitative index calculated from process simulation taking into account the magnitude and duration of system s functional failure during disaster prevention damage propagation and the assessment and recovery ouyang et al 2012 behzadiana et al 2014 mugume et al 2015a 2015b yazdi 2018 correspondingly there are direct and indirect strategies to enhance uds s resilience direct strategies enhance resilience by directly promoting one or some of the assessment criteria indicators these include post disaster recovery actions zhang et al 2020a sensor placement zhang et al 2020b risk management systems birgani et al 2016 public private engagement johannessen et al 2014 or integration with other urban infrastructure nie 2016 indirect strategies include redesigning system components altering the system s structure etc the effect of these indirect strategies on uds s resilience requires detailed and comprehensive studies in previous studies it was shown that decentralized storage tanks could offer higher resilience under an acute rainfall event than a centralized one given the same total tank volume mugume et al 2015a 2015b and that similar effect could be achieved by multi functional rainwater harvesting tanks mugume et al 2017 green infrastructures green roof and permeable pavement in particular are more cost effective than storage tanks in system rehabilitation when the demanded resilience is relatively high dong et al 2017 multi objective optimization models can be applied to optimize system s resilience yazdi 2018 mohammadiun et al 2018 we note that these studies were devoted to uds rehabilitation and focused on redesigning or adding system components to the authors best knowledge the influence of system s structure on a larger scale i e overall layout on resilience has not been studied studies on the resilience of other infrastructures offer implications for udss network topological metrics were used as estimators for system s resilience in water distribution systems wdss yazdani et al 2011 soldi et al 2015 power grids chanda and srivastava 2016 bajpai et al 2016 transportation zhang et al 2015 and communication networks çetinkaya et al 2015 simulation analysis proved that some topological metrics e g link density average path length and modularity did have correlation with system resilience in wdss meng et al 2018 while these studies indicate that system structure greatly affects resilience the same framework cannot be applied to udss on the one hand the structure of most udss is a tree with no loops where many topological metrics become meaningless or inapplicable for example the metric of redundancy an attribute closely related to resilience is defined by the number of loops in the network while trees have no loops link density a metric for connectivity has the same value in any tree with the same number of nodes yazdani et al 2011 on the other hand the design of uds s structure is subject to more topological constraints than other infrastructures for example uds consists mostly of gravity driven conduits so that its topological structure depends heavily on local conditions especially on surface elevation decision makers are often limited in terms of altering the value of those topological metrics thus the theoretical discussion of topological metrics is not so valuable in practice a new perspective is required to discuss the structure of uds in this paper we focus on the combined sewer system css due to the practical need aroused by both the complexity of its structure and the often competing planning objectives i e to minimize nodal flooding and combined sewer overflow cso möderl et al 2012 the structure of css is not only determined by the layout of pipelines but also by the location of key facilities i e wastewater treatment plants wwtps and cso outfalls and their corresponding sub catchments in order to obtain csss with various structures as samples for this study we develop a stochastic generation model to design virtual systems under realistic boundary conditions this kind of models have been proven useful to study the relation between the performance and structure of udss möderl et al 2009 urich et al 2010 this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides details on the methodology including the stochastic generation model the calculation of resilience and cost and the techniques for result analysis section 3 take two perspectives to discuss the results 1 we discuss the structural factors influencing system s resilience and 2 using a multi objective sorting technique we study the structural characteristics of the cost effective systems finally section 4 gives some concluding remarks 2 material and methods this section provides a framework to generate and evaluate virtual csss so as to study the relation between system s performance and structural characteristics the stochastic generation model of csss to acquire a large number of sample systems is described in section 2 1 the evaluation of systems is based on two criteria i e resilience and economic cost whose calculation process is shown in section 2 2 section 2 3 briefly introduces the setup of a case study and explains how the information of a real world area serves as the boundary condition for the stochastic generation model 2 1 stochastic generation model of combined sewer systems the structure spatial layout of uds is designed in system s planning stage during which decision makers face much less constraints than in the rehabilitation stage to study the relation between system performance and its structure a variety of system structures should be considered comparing several experience based scenarios would not satisfy this need comparing different real world systems is also limited by the available sample size and the results would be influenced by too many local factors to form any general conclusions on the other hand the study of virtual systems overcomes these weaknesses a stochastic generation model of uds is built to obtain a large sample of systems independent of human experience assumptions are made to the design procedure so that most results are realizable as a result this methodology have the same principle as comparing real world cases but with a much larger sample size the design of css for a densely populated urban area is subject to the urban form pipelines follow the topology of street networks mair et al 2017 key facilities like wwtps and cso outfalls can only be located at certain points alongside surface water due to their space requirements more than one of these facilities may exist in a large area the division of sub catchments service area of each facility in a highly impervious area is determined by pipe connections therefore can be different from that determined by natural topography the system is assumed to adopt the type of intercepted css where the amount of intercepted surface runoff is chosen as a multiple n0 intercept ratio of the dry weather flow it typically consists of i pipes connecting every wastewater stormwater discharge point to one of the cso outfalls hereinafter as upstream pipes and ii pipes connecting each cso outfall to a wwtp hereinafter as intercept pipes the adopted design procedure in the stochastic generation model is top down fig 1 before starting the model information on the case area is provided including sub catchments street networks and feasible locations of wwtps and cso outfalls to start the model the locations of these facilities are randomly chosen among the potential locations then the division of sub catchments is determined by an iterative random addition of adjacent streets beginning with the street closest to each cso outfall afterwards the layouts of upstream and intercept pipes are designed separately for the upstream pipes a variety of choices existed so they are designed by a graph based random walk process broder 1989 for the intercept pipes an approximate minimal steiner tree algorithm kou et al 1981 is applied to obtain the shortest paths connecting each cso outfall to its closest wwtp the design flow rates of the pipes are determined by the rational formula finally the size and slope of the pipes the size of cso weirs the placement and capacity of pumps etc are designed according to national standards see supplementary information si to summarize random factors appear at three points of the design procedure a the location choice of wwtp s and cso outfall s b the division of sub catchments and c the layout of upstream pipelines 2 2 resilience definition and economic cost estimation the performance of the virtual systems is modelled under several acute rainfall events to obtain the severity of system s functional failure from which the resilience index is calculated in this study we adopt the resilience index res defined for css in dong et al 2017 1 r e s t 1 t r e s t t 1 t 1 1 k e s e v e

which is the resilience index calculated under the rainfall event of t year return period each rest is calculated based on the severity sev of three kinds of failure impacts i e cso environmental impact nodal flooding social impact and wwtp overload technical impact ke ks and kt are weights indicating the relative importance of each impact usually subjected to the decision maker according to formulas 2 4 each sev is calculated as the sum of failure magnitude times duration where q i o v e r f l o w q i f l o o d i n g and q i w w t p are the flow rates at each node or facility and t i o v e r f l o w t i f l o o d i n g and t i o v e r l o a d are the respective duration of failure for cso and nodal flooding any flow rate larger than zero is considered as failure while for the overload to wwtp a flow rate larger than its design capacity q i c a p a c i t y is considered as failure t 0 and tn are the starting and ending times of simulation respectively when combining the sev into res each sev is normalized by the total wastewater flow rate qtw of the area so that the value of res is not affected by the size of the case area the value of res is always between 0 and t 1 t generally a larger res means better resilience but due to the existence of subjective and case dependent coefficients in the formula the absolute value of res is not meaningful the total cost tc of the system consists of construction cost cc and operation maintenance cost omc cc and omc include the cost of pipes pumps and wwtps formula 6 intercepting weirs are not explicitly included in cost estimation because their cost is similar to inspection wells and the latter are already included in the cost function of pipes local empirical cost functions are applied to ccpipe ccpump ccwwtp and omcwwtp dong et al 2008 liu et al 2010 omcpipe and omcpump are estimated as a proportion of their cc a design life of 30 years is assumed to obtain the discounted omc over the system s life cycle see si section 2

we use an area generalized from the northern catchment of kunming city located in southwest china fig s1 it is highly urbanized with approximately 830 000 people dwelling in an area of 42 km2 taking landscape and the topology of street networks into consideration the area is generalized as 584 blocks fig s1a they form the basic units to calculate rainfall runoff and dry weather flow there are 682 street sections serving as potential route for pipelines using geospatial analysis we identify 6 potential locations for wwtps and 38 for cso outfalls under realistic constraints see fig s1b and si section 3 for more totally 100 000 virtual systems are generated and evaluated with the number of wwtps ranging from 1 to 6 the number of cso outfalls from 8 to 38 for each combination of the facility locations 50 random layouts of upstream pipes are generated each results in different division of sub catchments the intercept ratio is fixed as n 0 1 basic statistics on the samples and some examples of the generated system structures can be seen in si section 3 the storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 is used to simulate and evaluate the systems performance two hour synthetic rainfall events with the chicago hyetograph keifer and chu 1957 cen et al 1998 are applied as test events their return periods are chosen as 1 5 10 and 50 years considering the local preference the coefficients ke ks and kt are selected as k e k s k t 1 all samples are analyzed with regard to the number and location of wwtps or cso outfalls the design capacity of wwtps and the size of the service areas of each cso outfall regression analysis is used to evaluate the influence of these structural characteristics on system resilience non dominated sorting deb et al 2002 is used to select samples with both higher resilience and lower life cycle cost 3 results and discussion section 3 1 gives the basic result of resilience simulation and a comparison between the severities of different impacts in section 3 2 three aspects that would influence the system s resilience are discussed section 3 3 evaluates the structural characteristics of systems with both high resilience and low economic cost 3 1 resilience and its components of the case systems the value and distribution of resilience index res and its three components i e environmental social and technical impact severity seve sevs and sevt are shown in fig 2 the range of res is calculated to be between 0 107 and 0 216 with a percentage difference of 102 the 5 ile and 95 ile of the res distribution are 0 125 and 0 159 with a difference of 28 this roughly represents the difference in resilience that could be achieved by altering system s structure seve and sevs are the two major contributors to res regardless of the return period of test rainfall fig 2c there are great differences between extreme values and the 25th or 75th percentiles of seve and sevs this further emphasizes that different system structures would result in dramatic changes in system performance a slight negative correlation is found between seve and sevs fig 2b this describes the trade off relationship between cso and urban flooding in case area res seve and sevs are close to normal distribution fig 2a b randomly and independently generated systems under certain constraints have small differences these small independent differences cause res seve and sevs to change and exhibit a normal distribution sevt follows a normal distribution truncated at 0 fig 2b because the wwtps in css are designed to have the capability to cope with a certain level of wet weather flow so that there is no failure under many scenarios no such truncations are found in the distribution of seve or sevs indicating that the magnitude of stress is far beyond the capacity of pipes and intercept weirs considerable amount of nodal flooding took place even under the rainfall with 1 year return period equal to the design return period this is not surprising because the rational formula to design the pipes assumed a block hyetograph while the test rainfall adopted the chicago hyetograph a typical peaked hyetograph 3 2 structural factors influencing system s resilience 3 2 1 the number of wwtps and cso outfalls grouping the samples according to the total number of wwtps nwwtp and cso outfalls ncso the average maximum and minimum of res within each group are shown in fig 3 the percentage change in res between each group can be as large as 17 in terms of average from n w w t p 6 n c s o 14 to n w w t p 6 n c s o 34 and 43 in terms of maximum from n w w t p 1 n c s o 38 to n w w t p 1 n c s o 13 in general we find that ncso plays a larger role than nwwtp in determining res with ncso increasing average res increased however the maximum res is found with small ncso this is because res is also influenced by other factors e g the layout of pipelines and the uncertainty brought by these factors is larger when ncso is smaller i e the size of each sub catchment larger this implicated that there is no universal choice for ncso practically ncso should be determined by both the required level of res and the capability to design the other factors a small ncso is recommended if a high level of resilience is required and a proper design tools e g optimization model is available to minimize the uncertainty brought by the other factors otherwise a large ncso is recommended so that res is moderately high and the uncertainty is smaller while nwwtp only affects res to a small extent systems with only 1 wwtp performed the worst on most occasions specifically of the 31 possible values of ncso 23 are found where n w w t p 1 have the lowest value of average res on the other hand n w w t p 4 outperforms other values of nwwtp under 22 values of ncso this shows that 1 wwtp is too few for the area while too many wwtps might also hinder system s resilience 3 2 2 the locations of wwtps and cso outfalls the choice for locations of wwtps or cso outfalls also resulted in significant difference in res even when their numbers are fixed with each potential location as a binary independent variable the linear regression analysis is used to show whether certain locations are more preferable than others for facility placement 7 ln r e s α 0 i 1 n w w t p β i l i w w t p i 1 n c s o γ i l i c s o ε where l i w w t p and l i c s o are binary 0 1 variables indicating whether location i is chosen or not α 0 βi and γ i are regression coefficients and ɛ is the residual including all other factors that are not accounted for in the explanatory variables with natural log ln of res as the dependent variable all coefficients should be interpreted as percentage change the coefficients are estimated by ordinary least squares ols and the regression is overall significant all βi and most γ i are significantly different from zero at a confident level of 95 table s1 and s2 fig s6 the most critical location of cso outfalls l 10 c s o brought about 3 5 change in average res while a location of wwtp could cause at most 1 3 change four positive βi indicated that those locations of wwtps are helpful for increasing res while the other two locations are not recommended fig 4 a similar results can be found in terms of cso outfalls 19 locations have a significantly positive effect on res 15 significantly negative and 4 insignificant fig 4b we note that adding wwtps or cso outfalls would inevitably change the layout of pipelines which is a factor not included in the explanatory variables this analysis only points out that choosing the more preferable facility locations the planner is likely to end up with a higher res the coefficient of determination r 2 0 15 indicates that the locations of wwtps and cso outfalls only account for 15 of the total variance in res 3 2 3 service areas of wwtps and cso outfalls as a further attempt we try to study the influence of sub catchment partitioning on res the design capacity of each wwtp q i w w t p and service areas for each cso outfall a i c s o are two major concerns of the decision makers we use their standard deviation σwwtp and σcso as explanatory variables to represent the relative size of each sub catchment linear regression analysis is applied by adding these variables into the equation 8 ln r e s β 0 β 1 σ w w t p ε n w w t p 2 6 9 ln r e s γ 0 γ 1 σ c s o ε n c s o 8 38 where β 0 β 1 and γ 0 γ 1 are the coefficients of interest and 10 σ w w t p i 1 n w w t p q i w w t p q w w t p n w w t p 1 10 4 m 3 d 11 σ c s o i 1 n c s o a i c s o a c s o n c s o 1 h a since it is meaningless to compare the absolute values of σwwtp or σcso among different nwwtp or ncso the regression analyses are performed separately controlling for different nwwtp or ncso therefore formulas 8 and 9 each contains 5 and 31 regression equations the results of ols estimation is shown in table s2 and s3 we notice that for the 5 regression models in equation 8 4 of them have β 1 significantly larger than zero however the magnitude of this influence is quite small around 0 01 which means that an increase of 104 m3 d in σwwtp would result in about 1 increase of res in addition the r2 of all 5 models are less than 0 005 indicating that the design capacity of wwtps accounted for almost no influence on res compared to σwwtp σcso show a slightly stronger influence on res among the 31 regression models in equation 9 27 have γ 1 significantly different from zero but the direction and magnitude varies greatly some of the largest influences in terms of both γ 1 and r2 are γ 1 4 2 when n c s o 9 r 2 0 17 and γ 1 3 6 when n c s o 33 r 2 0 18 in these scenarios an increase of 0 01 ha in σcso results in either a 4 2 increase or a 3 6 decrease in res depending on ncso of the system no pattern could be found for the direction or magnitude of γ 1 from different ncso no general conclusion can be drawn from this case study on how the σwwtp and σcso would influence res because these factors cannot be captured by the linear regression model in fact neither σwwtp nor σcso are exogenous variables because they are influenced by the actual locations of wwtps and cso outfalls even when nwwtp or ncso are controlled for for example the service area of each cso outfall is influenced by the relative distance between these outfalls if a certain outfall is far from the others its service area would surely become larger therefore the regression models 8 and 9 are not quite valid because we cannot vary σwwtp or σcso given the same values of other factors we conclude that the current sampling strategy pays much attention on the variety of the location of the facilities and therefore is not best suitable to study their service area the sampling process should be re designed to obtain a wider range of σwwtp and σcso while controlling for the other factors as much as possible 3 3 characteristics of the cost effective resilient systems the influence of nwwtp and ncso on system s economic cost is quite straightforward the increase in ncso will decrease average cost while nwwtp has very little influence fig s7 based on non dominated sorting 1 008 approximately 1 of total samples with higher resilience and lower cost are selected for further analysis they form the cost effective frontier fig 5 we can see that ncso is a more determining factor for a system s cost effectiveness in two ways firstly we calculated the proportion that a system would appear on the frontier against all systems of the same nwwtp or ncso formula 12 it represents the probability of getting a frontier solution when choosing different nwwtp or ncso this proportion is almost the same among different nwwtp fig 6 a while it sharply increases with ncso fig 6b the probability to achieve a frontier solution is larger than 2 when ncso 32 and could be as high as 9 when ncso 38 however this probability remains less than 1 which is the average for ncso between 9 and 26 and almost hits zero when ncso 14 21 26 or 28 secondly ncso determines in which part of the frontier the systems would appear with ncso 25 the systems are of lower resilience and cost and the highest achievable res is around 0 19 as the system structure switches to ncso 25 the highest achievable res reaches 0 22 while the cost would also increase sharply from less than 16 to 16 30 million cny 12 proportion i n frontier n wwtp or n cso i n total n wwtp or n cso i by looking into the two major contributors of res i e nodal flooding and cso we found that the two groups i e ncso or 25 mainly differ in their ability to control cso while the ranges of flooding severity sevs in the two groups are similar fig 7 systems with ncso 25 have lower cso severity seve that cannot be achieved with ncso 25 however choosing ncso 25 can limit the uncertainty of seve and sevs thus increasing the probability to end up in a cost effective system in fig 7 the red dots cover a large part of the red circle meaning that once the decision maker limits the system in the red circle there is a higher probability to hit one of the red dots while blue dots take up only a small part in the blue circle meaning that the probability to hit the blue dots is low the recommended strategy to choose ncso in section 3 2 1 doesn t take into account economic cost nor the non structural measures to specifically deal with seve the revised suggestion would be that if other measures to tackle cso are available e g storage tanks or treatment facilities their cost effectiveness should be compared to altering ncso before making decision on system s structure 3 4 limitations the results of the case study reveal patterns underlying resilience and system s structure in a combined sewer system however a direct application of the results to another case is not recommended since they are highly dependent on the size population imperviousness and especially the feasible locations of key facilities in the area nevertheless the method presented can be used to guide the system s planning in terms of finding the suitable number and locations for key facilities and searching for a better layout for pipelines to achieve a higher resilience cost effectively the current version of the stochastic generation model is built solely for studying the spatial layout of the system therefore other important facilities to enhance resilience such as storage tanks and low impact development are not included to assess resilience the systems are tested under rainfall events of different return periods but without any spatial or temporal variations zheng et al 2015 while these factors are present and may considerably affect the resulted res value most importantly systems with some structural might perform better under these different test conditions but the current study framework failed to capture this pattern therefore more research is needed for a comprehensive resilience assessment framework of the urban drainage systems urban drainage systems especially combined sewer systems are multifunctional and trade off exists between these functions the coefficients ke ks and kt to combine them into the single resilience index are subjective to the decision maker and they inevitably have a large effect on the final result si section 6 offers more discussion on this 4 conclusions the resilience based design of udss has mainly focused on rehabilitation of local facilities while adopting a better global structure beforehand can be much more cost effective to address this need we develop a large scale computational experiment combining stochastic system generation and statistical analysis techniques this method is able to explore the general pattern behind resilience and system structure and sort out the cost effective system congifurations to aid system planning the stochastic generation model of combined sewer systems is able to obtain a large amount of system structures for analysis spatial and hydraulic constraints of system design are embedded in the model so that all system configurations generated are realizable the model only requires basic information on urban blocks and streets as inputs therefore it is easily applicable to another area it is a powerful tool to overcome the problem of data scarcity or poor diversity of system s structure data in real world cases the case study of a real world urban area demonstrates that adopting a better structure in the planning stage can bring about considerable amount of change in resilience the preferable number and locations of wwtps and cso outfalls for the case area are identified as for the design capacity of the wwtps and the service area sizes of the cso outfalls the direction of their influence on resilience is uncertain in this case due to insufficient sampling although the case study has demonstrated the capability of the computational experiment limitations are found with respect to designing the virtual systems and choosing the test conditions for resilience which are improvements to be made in future research furthermore a certain degree of subjective arbitrariness exist in the sampling strategy and resilience calculation these have to be considered before applying this method to the planning of udss in practice declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17408,the focus of infrastructure design and management has turned from a reliability based approach to a resilience based one resilience is a system s ability to maintain its function and minimize failure consequences when faced with exceptional conditions this study carries out a large scale computational experiment to study how resilience is affected by system s structure in a combined sewer system we build a stochastic generation model involving a random sampling of facility locations and a graph based random walk sampling algorithm to generate various layouts of pipelines the performance of these virtual systems are assessed in the storm water management model we apply statistical techniques on these samples to study the relation between resilience and system structure results show that the number of combined sewer overflow cso outfalls is a more important factor of resilience compared to the number of wastewater treatment plants wwtps some locations are found more preferable for wwtp or cso outfall placement while adding wwtps or outfalls at other locations might even lower the system s resilience size of the sub catchments of the cso outfalls also affects resilience although this effect is statistically significant the extent is not remarkable compared to other factors we further study the structural features of the cost effective systems the highest achievable resilience level increases as the number of cso outfalls decreases and so does system s cost this results from the difference in cso quantity therefore this dilemma can be cut off by end of pipe storage or treatment which specifically tackles cso the conclusion of this study provides an insight into the structural factors of combined sewer systems resilience and can provide guidance for system s planning graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords combined sewer system resilience system structure stochastic generation combined sewer overflow 1 introduction the urban drainage

g climate change urbanization aging components etc due to the diversity and unpredictability of these impacts it is impossible to take precautions against all kinds of hidden threats by a scenario based strategy instead the resilience based approach or safe to fail approach looks into system s performance under the black swan events and requires that the system should be safe even after it fails in other words it emphasizes that systems should have certain ability to minimize failure consequences under exceptional loading conditions as well as satisfying the traditional reliability based requirements i e to operate regularly under the standard loading condition ahern 2011 butler et al 2014 to enhance uds s performance in the uncertain future the resilience based approach should be applied to the management rehabilitation and most importantly to the planning of uds obviously adopting a better structure at the planning stage would be much more cost effective than rehabilitation but by far no guidance could be provided in this respect therefore we carry out a large scale stochastic computational experiment to address this need and explore the patterns between resilience and system structure resilience was first defined for ecosystems holling 1973 and later extended to other domains including engineering systems hosseini et al 2016 an infrastructure s resilience is the system s ability to minimize failure magnitude and or duration under disruptive events u s niac 2010 two types of definition for uds s resilience can be found in literature 1 a multi criteria assessment with quantitative or semi quantitative indicators related to the equipment and management level of the system bruneau et al 2003 milman et al 2008 karamouz et al 2016 2 a single quantitative index calculated from process simulation taking into account the magnitude and duration of system s functional failure during disaster prevention damage propagation and the assessment and recovery ouyang et al 2012 behzadiana et al 2014 mugume et al 2015a 2015b yazdi 2018 correspondingly there are direct and indirect strategies to enhance uds s resilience direct strategies enhance resilience by directly promoting one or some of the assessment criteria indicators these include post disaster recovery actions zhang et al 2020a sensor placement zhang et al 2020b risk management systems birgani et al 2016 public private engagement johannessen et al 2014 or integration with other urban infrastructure nie 2016 indirect strategies include redesigning system components altering the system s structure etc the effect of these indirect strategies on uds s resilience requires detailed and comprehensive studies in previous studies it was shown that decentralized storage tanks could offer higher resilience under an acute rainfall event than a centralized one given the same total tank volume mugume et al 2015a 2015b and that similar effect could be achieved by multi functional rainwater harvesting tanks mugume et al 2017 green infrastructures green roof and permeable pavement in particular are more cost effective than storage tanks in system rehabilitation when the demanded resilience is relatively high dong et al 2017 multi objective optimization models can be applied to optimize system s resilience yazdi 2018 mohammadiun et al 2018 we note that these studies were devoted to uds rehabilitation and focused on redesigning or adding system components to the authors best knowledge the influence of system s structure on a larger scale i e overall layout on resilience has not been studied studies on the resilience of other infrastructures offer implications for udss network topological metrics were used as estimators for system s resilience in water distribution systems wdss yazdani et al 2011 soldi et al 2015 power grids chanda and srivastava 2016 bajpai et al 2016 transportation zhang et al 2015 and communication networks çetinkaya et al 2015 simulation analysis proved that some topological metrics e g link density average path length and modularity did have correlation with system resilience in wdss meng et al 2018 while these studies indicate that system structure greatly affects resilience the same framework cannot be applied to udss on the one hand the structure of most udss is a tree with no loops where many topological metrics become meaningless or inapplicable for example the metric of redundancy an attribute closely related to resilience is defined by the number of loops in the network while trees have no loops link density a metric for connectivity has the same value in any tree with the same number of nodes yazdani et al 2011 on the other hand the design of uds s structure is subject to more topological constraints than other infrastructures for example uds consists mostly of gravity driven conduits so that its topological structure depends heavily on local conditions especially on surface elevation decision makers are often limited in terms of altering the value of those topological metrics thus the theoretical discussion of topological metrics is not so valuable in practice a new perspective is required to discuss the structure of uds in this paper we focus on the combined sewer system css due to the practical need aroused by both the complexity of its structure and the often competing planning objectives i e to minimize nodal flooding and combined sewer overflow cso möderl et al 2012 the structure of css is not only determined by the layout of pipelines but also by the location of key facilities i e wastewater treatment plants wwtps and cso outfalls and their corresponding sub catchments in order to obtain csss with various structures as samples for this study we develop a stochastic generation model to design virtual systems under realistic boundary conditions this kind of models have been proven useful to study the relation between the performance and structure of udss möderl et al 2009 urich et al 2010 this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides details on the methodology including the stochastic generation model the calculation of resilience and cost and the techniques for result analysis section 3 take two perspectives to discuss the results 1 we discuss the structural factors influencing system s resilience and 2 using a multi objective sorting technique we study the structural characteristics of the cost effective systems finally section 4 gives some concluding remarks 2 material and methods this section provides a framework to generate and evaluate virtual csss so as to study the relation between system s performance and structural characteristics the stochastic generation model of csss to acquire a large number of sample systems is described in section 2 1 the evaluation of systems is based on two criteria i e resilience and economic cost whose calculation process is shown in section 2 2 section 2 3 briefly introduces the setup of a case study and explains how the information of a real world area serves as the boundary condition for the stochastic generation model 2 1 stochastic generation model of combined sewer systems the structure spatial layout of uds is designed in system s planning stage during which decision makers face much less constraints than in the rehabilitation stage to study the relation between system performance and its structure a variety of system structures should be considered comparing several experience based scenarios would not satisfy this need comparing different real world systems is also limited by the available sample size and the results would be influenced by too many local factors to form any general conclusions on the other hand the study of virtual systems overcomes these weaknesses a stochastic generation model of uds is built to obtain a large sample of systems independent of human experience assumptions are made to the design procedure so that most results are realizable as a result this methodology have the same principle as comparing real world cases but with a much larger sample size the design of css for a densely populated urban area is subject to the urban form pipelines follow the topology of street networks mair et al 2017 key facilities like wwtps and cso outfalls can only be located at certain points alongside surface water due to their space requirements more than one of these facilities may exist in a large area the division of sub catchments service area of each facility in a highly impervious area is determined by pipe connections therefore can be different from that determined by natural topography the system is assumed to adopt the type of intercepted css where the amount of intercepted surface runoff is chosen as a multiple n0 intercept ratio of the dry weather flow it typically consists of i pipes connecting every wastewater stormwater discharge point to one of the cso outfalls hereinafter as upstream pipes and ii pipes connecting each cso outfall to a wwtp hereinafter as intercept pipes the adopted design procedure in the stochastic generation model is top down fig 1 before starting the model information on the case area is provided including sub catchments street networks and feasible locations of wwtps and cso outfalls to start the model the locations of these facilities are randomly chosen among the potential locations then the division of sub catchments is determined by an iterative random addition of adjacent streets beginning with the street closest to each cso outfall afterwards the layouts of upstream and intercept pipes are designed separately for the upstream pipes a variety of choices existed so they are designed by a graph based random walk process broder 1989 for the intercept pipes an approximate minimal steiner tree algorithm kou et al 1981 is applied to obtain the shortest paths connecting each cso outfall to its closest wwtp the design flow rates of the pipes are determined by the rational formula finally the size and slope of the pipes the size of cso weirs the placement and capacity of pumps etc are designed according to national standards see supplementary information si to summarize random factors appear at three points of the design procedure a the location choice of wwtp s and cso outfall s b the division of sub catchments and c the layout of upstream pipelines 2 2 resilience definition and economic cost estimation the performance of the virtual systems is modelled under several acute rainfall events to obtain the severity of system s functional failure from which the resilience index is calculated in this study we adopt the resilience index res defined for css in dong et al 2017 1 r e s t 1 t r e s t t 1 t 1 1 k e s e v e

which is the resilience index calculated under the rainfall event of t year return period each rest is calculated based on the severity sev of three kinds of failure impacts i e cso environmental impact nodal flooding social impact and wwtp overload technical impact ke ks and kt are weights indicating the relative importance of each impact usually subjected to the decision maker according to formulas 2 4 each sev is calculated as the sum of failure magnitude times duration where q i o v e r f l o w q i f l o o d i n g and q i w w t p are the flow rates at each node or facility and t i o v e r f l o w t i f l o o d i n g and t i o v e r l o a d are the respective duration of failure for cso and nodal flooding any flow rate larger than zero is considered as failure while for the overload to wwtp a flow rate larger than its design capacity q i c a p a c i t y is considered as failure t 0 and tn are the starting and ending times of simulation respectively when combining the sev into res each sev is normalized by the total wastewater flow rate qtw of the area so that the value of res is not affected by the size of the case area the value of res is always between 0 and t 1 t generally a larger res means better resilience but due to the existence of subjective and case dependent coefficients in the formula the absolute value of res is not meaningful the total cost tc of the system consists of construction cost cc and operation maintenance cost omc cc and omc include the cost of pipes pumps and wwtps formula 6 intercepting weirs are not explicitly included in cost estimation because their cost is similar to inspection wells and the latter are already included in the cost function of pipes local empirical cost functions are applied to ccpipe ccpump ccwwtp and omcwwtp dong et al 2008 liu et al 2010 omcpipe and omcpump are estimated as a proportion of their cc a design life of 30 years is assumed to obtain the discounted omc over the system s life cycle see si section 2

we use an area generalized from the northern catchment of kunming city located in southwest china fig s1 it is highly urbanized with approximately 830 000 people dwelling in an area of 42 km2 taking landscape and the topology of street networks into consideration the area is generalized as 584 blocks fig s1a they form the basic units to calculate rainfall runoff and dry weather flow there are 682 street sections serving as potential route for pipelines using geospatial analysis we identify 6 potential locations for wwtps and 38 for cso outfalls under realistic constraints see fig s1b and si section 3 for more totally 100 000 virtual systems are generated and evaluated with the number of wwtps ranging from 1 to 6 the number of cso outfalls from 8 to 38 for each combination of the facility locations 50 random layouts of upstream pipes are generated each results in different division of sub catchments the intercept ratio is fixed as n 0 1 basic statistics on the samples and some examples of the generated system structures can be seen in si section 3 the storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 is used to simulate and evaluate the systems performance two hour synthetic rainfall events with the chicago hyetograph keifer and chu 1957 cen et al 1998 are applied as test events their return periods are chosen as 1 5 10 and 50 years considering the local preference the coefficients ke ks and kt are selected as k e k s k t 1 all samples are analyzed with regard to the number and location of wwtps or cso outfalls the design capacity of wwtps and the size of the service areas of each cso outfall regression analysis is used to evaluate the influence of these structural characteristics on system resilience non dominated sorting deb et al 2002 is used to select samples with both higher resilience and lower life cycle cost 3 results and discussion section 3 1 gives the basic result of resilience simulation and a comparison between the severities of different impacts in section 3 2 three aspects that would influence the system s resilience are discussed section 3 3 evaluates the structural characteristics of systems with both high resilience and low economic cost 3 1 resilience and its components of the case systems the value and distribution of resilience index res and its three components i e environmental social and technical impact severity seve sevs and sevt are shown in fig 2 the range of res is calculated to be between 0 107 and 0 216 with a percentage difference of 102 the 5 ile and 95 ile of the res distribution are 0 125 and 0 159 with a difference of 28 this roughly represents the difference in resilience that could be achieved by altering system s structure seve and sevs are the two major contributors to res regardless of the return period of test rainfall fig 2c there are great differences between extreme values and the 25th or 75th percentiles of seve and sevs this further emphasizes that different system structures would result in dramatic changes in system performance a slight negative correlation is found between seve and sevs fig 2b this describes the trade off relationship between cso and urban flooding in case area res seve and sevs are close to normal distribution fig 2a b randomly and independently generated systems under certain constraints have small differences these small independent differences cause res seve and sevs to change and exhibit a normal distribution sevt follows a normal distribution truncated at 0 fig 2b because the wwtps in css are designed to have the capability to cope with a certain level of wet weather flow so that there is no failure under many scenarios no such truncations are found in the distribution of seve or sevs indicating that the magnitude of stress is far beyond the capacity of pipes and intercept weirs considerable amount of nodal flooding took place even under the rainfall with 1 year return period equal to the design return period this is not surprising because the rational formula to design the pipes assumed a block hyetograph while the test rainfall adopted the chicago hyetograph a typical peaked hyetograph 3 2 structural factors influencing system s resilience 3 2 1 the number of wwtps and cso outfalls grouping the samples according to the total number of wwtps nwwtp and cso outfalls ncso the average maximum and minimum of res within each group are shown in fig 3 the percentage change in res between each group can be as large as 17 in terms of average from n w w t p 6 n c s o 14 to n w w t p 6 n c s o 34 and 43 in terms of maximum from n w w t p 1 n c s o 38 to n w w t p 1 n c s o 13 in general we find that ncso plays a larger role than nwwtp in determining res with ncso increasing average res increased however the maximum res is found with small ncso this is because res is also influenced by other factors e g the layout of pipelines and the uncertainty brought by these factors is larger when ncso is smaller i e the size of each sub catchment larger this implicated that there is no universal choice for ncso practically ncso should be determined by both the required level of res and the capability to design the other factors a small ncso is recommended if a high level of resilience is required and a proper design tools e g optimization model is available to minimize the uncertainty brought by the other factors otherwise a large ncso is recommended so that res is moderately high and the uncertainty is smaller while nwwtp only affects res to a small extent systems with only 1 wwtp performed the worst on most occasions specifically of the 31 possible values of ncso 23 are found where n w w t p 1 have the lowest value of average res on the other hand n w w t p 4 outperforms other values of nwwtp under 22 values of ncso this shows that 1 wwtp is too few for the area while too many wwtps might also hinder system s resilience 3 2 2 the locations of wwtps and cso outfalls the choice for locations of wwtps or cso outfalls also resulted in significant difference in res even when their numbers are fixed with each potential location as a binary independent variable the linear regression analysis is used to show whether certain locations are more preferable than others for facility placement 7 ln r e s α 0 i 1 n w w t p β i l i w w t p i 1 n c s o γ i l i c s o ε where l i w w t p and l i c s o are binary 0 1 variables indicating whether location i is chosen or not α 0 βi and γ i are regression coefficients and ɛ is the residual including all other factors that are not accounted for in the explanatory variables with natural log ln of res as the dependent variable all coefficients should be interpreted as percentage change the coefficients are estimated by ordinary least squares ols and the regression is overall significant all βi and most γ i are significantly different from zero at a confident level of 95 table s1 and s2 fig s6 the most critical location of cso outfalls l 10 c s o brought about 3 5 change in average res while a location of wwtp could cause at most 1 3 change four positive βi indicated that those locations of wwtps are helpful for increasing res while the other two locations are not recommended fig 4 a similar results can be found in terms of cso outfalls 19 locations have a significantly positive effect on res 15 significantly negative and 4 insignificant fig 4b we note that adding wwtps or cso outfalls would inevitably change the layout of pipelines which is a factor not included in the explanatory variables this analysis only points out that choosing the more preferable facility locations the planner is likely to end up with a higher res the coefficient of determination r 2 0 15 indicates that the locations of wwtps and cso outfalls only account for 15 of the total variance in res 3 2 3 service areas of wwtps and cso outfalls as a further attempt we try to study the influence of sub catchment partitioning on res the design capacity of each wwtp q i w w t p and service areas for each cso outfall a i c s o are two major concerns of the decision makers we use their standard deviation σwwtp and σcso as explanatory variables to represent the relative size of each sub catchment linear regression analysis is applied by adding these variables into the equation 8 ln r e s β 0 β 1 σ w w t p ε n w w t p 2 6 9 ln r e s γ 0 γ 1 σ c s o ε n c s o 8 38 where β 0 β 1 and γ 0 γ 1 are the coefficients of interest and 10 σ w w t p i 1 n w w t p q i w w t p q w w t p n w w t p 1 10 4 m 3 d 11 σ c s o i 1 n c s o a i c s o a c s o n c s o 1 h a since it is meaningless to compare the absolute values of σwwtp or σcso among different nwwtp or ncso the regression analyses are performed separately controlling for different nwwtp or ncso therefore formulas 8 and 9 each contains 5 and 31 regression equations the results of ols estimation is shown in table s2 and s3 we notice that for the 5 regression models in equation 8 4 of them have β 1 significantly larger than zero however the magnitude of this influence is quite small around 0 01 which means that an increase of 104 m3 d in σwwtp would result in about 1 increase of res in addition the r2 of all 5 models are less than 0 005 indicating that the design capacity of wwtps accounted for almost no influence on res compared to σwwtp σcso show a slightly stronger influence on res among the 31 regression models in equation 9 27 have γ 1 significantly different from zero but the direction and magnitude varies greatly some of the largest influences in terms of both γ 1 and r2 are γ 1 4 2 when n c s o 9 r 2 0 17 and γ 1 3 6 when n c s o 33 r 2 0 18 in these scenarios an increase of 0 01 ha in σcso results in either a 4 2 increase or a 3 6 decrease in res depending on ncso of the system no pattern could be found for the direction or magnitude of γ 1 from different ncso no general conclusion can be drawn from this case study on how the σwwtp and σcso would influence res because these factors cannot be captured by the linear regression model in fact neither σwwtp nor σcso are exogenous variables because they are influenced by the actual locations of wwtps and cso outfalls even when nwwtp or ncso are controlled for for example the service area of each cso outfall is influenced by the relative distance between these outfalls if a certain outfall is far from the others its service area would surely become larger therefore the regression models 8 and 9 are not quite valid because we cannot vary σwwtp or σcso given the same values of other factors we conclude that the current sampling strategy pays much attention on the variety of the location of the facilities and therefore is not best suitable to study their service area the sampling process should be re designed to obtain a wider range of σwwtp and σcso while controlling for the other factors as much as possible 3 3 characteristics of the cost effective resilient systems the influence of nwwtp and ncso on system s economic cost is quite straightforward the increase in ncso will decrease average cost while nwwtp has very little influence fig s7 based on non dominated sorting 1 008 approximately 1 of total samples with higher resilience and lower cost are selected for further analysis they form the cost effective frontier fig 5 we can see that ncso is a more determining factor for a system s cost effectiveness in two ways firstly we calculated the proportion that a system would appear on the frontier against all systems of the same nwwtp or ncso formula 12 it represents the probability of getting a frontier solution when choosing different nwwtp or ncso this proportion is almost the same among different nwwtp fig 6 a while it sharply increases with ncso fig 6b the probability to achieve a frontier solution is larger than 2 when ncso 32 and could be as high as 9 when ncso 38 however this probability remains less than 1 which is the average for ncso between 9 and 26 and almost hits zero when ncso 14 21 26 or 28 secondly ncso determines in which part of the frontier the systems would appear with ncso 25 the systems are of lower resilience and cost and the highest achievable res is around 0 19 as the system structure switches to ncso 25 the highest achievable res reaches 0 22 while the cost would also increase sharply from less than 16 to 16 30 million cny 12 proportion i n frontier n wwtp or n cso i n total n wwtp or n cso i by looking into the two major contributors of res i e nodal flooding and cso we found that the two groups i e ncso or 25 mainly differ in their ability to control cso while the ranges of flooding severity sevs in the two groups are similar fig 7 systems with ncso 25 have lower cso severity seve that cannot be achieved with ncso 25 however choosing ncso 25 can limit the uncertainty of seve and sevs thus increasing the probability to end up in a cost effective system in fig 7 the red dots cover a large part of the red circle meaning that once the decision maker limits the system in the red circle there is a higher probability to hit one of the red dots while blue dots take up only a small part in the blue circle meaning that the probability to hit the blue dots is low the recommended strategy to choose ncso in section 3 2 1 doesn t take into account economic cost nor the non structural measures to specifically deal with seve the revised suggestion would be that if other measures to tackle cso are available e g storage tanks or treatment facilities their cost effectiveness should be compared to altering ncso before making decision on system s structure 3 4 limitations the results of the case study reveal patterns underlying resilience and system s structure in a combined sewer system however a direct application of the results to another case is not recommended since they are highly dependent on the size population imperviousness and especially the feasible locations of key facilities in the area nevertheless the method presented can be used to guide the system s planning in terms of finding the suitable number and locations for key facilities and searching for a better layout for pipelines to achieve a higher resilience cost effectively the current version of the stochastic generation model is built solely for studying the spatial layout of the system therefore other important facilities to enhance resilience such as storage tanks and low impact development are not included to assess resilience the systems are tested under rainfall events of different return periods but without any spatial or temporal variations zheng et al 2015 while these factors are present and may considerably affect the resulted res value most importantly systems with some structural might perform better under these different test conditions but the current study framework failed to capture this pattern therefore more research is needed for a comprehensive resilience assessment framework of the urban drainage systems urban drainage systems especially combined sewer systems are multifunctional and trade off exists between these functions the coefficients ke ks and kt to combine them into the single resilience index are subjective to the decision maker and they inevitably have a large effect on the final result si section 6 offers more discussion on this 4 conclusions the resilience based design of udss has mainly focused on rehabilitation of local facilities while adopting a better global structure beforehand can be much more cost effective to address this need we develop a large scale computational experiment combining stochastic system generation and statistical analysis techniques this method is able to explore the general pattern behind resilience and system structure and sort out the cost effective system congifurations to aid system planning the stochastic generation model of combined sewer systems is able to obtain a large amount of system structures for analysis spatial and hydraulic constraints of system design are embedded in the model so that all system configurations generated are realizable the model only requires basic information on urban blocks and streets as inputs therefore it is easily applicable to another area it is a powerful tool to overcome the problem of data scarcity or poor diversity of system s structure data in real world cases the case study of a real world urban area demonstrates that adopting a better structure in the planning stage can bring about considerable amount of change in resilience the preferable number and locations of wwtps and cso outfalls for the case area are identified as for the design capacity of the wwtps and the service area sizes of the cso outfalls the direction of their influence on resilience is uncertain in this case due to insufficient sampling although the case study has demonstrated the capability of the computational experiment limitations are found with respect to designing the virtual systems and choosing the test conditions for resilience which are improvements to be made in future research furthermore a certain degree of subjective arbitrariness exist in the sampling strategy and resilience calculation these have to be considered before applying this method to the planning of udss in practice declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17409,although permanganate activation by sodium sulfite mn vii na2so3 has shown great potential for rapid abatement of organic contaminants the limited reactivity under alkaline conditions and undesirable mn residual may prevent its widespread application to solve these challenges calcium sulfite caso3 was employed as a slow release source of so3 2 hso3 s iv to activate mn vii in this study it was found that the application of caso3 solid could extend the effective working ph range of mn vii s iv from 7 0 to 9 0 moreover due to the enhanced precipitation of mno2 with the presence of ca2 very low mn residual 0 05 mg l was achieved in mn vii caso3 system mn vii caso3 system is a unique two stage oxidation process in terms of reaction kinetics and reactive oxidants specifically mn vii was rapidly consumed and reactive mn intermediates e g mn vi mn v so4 and ho were produced in the first stage however the second stage was governed by the interaction between mno2 and s iv with so4 and ho serving as the dominant reactive oxidants taking advantage of an automatic titrator excess s iv was found to greatly quench the generated radicals whereas it did not cause a significant consumption of reactive mn species all these results improved our understanding of the mn vii s iv process and could thus facilitate its application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate calcium sulfite radicals reactive manganese species emerging organic contaminants 1 introduction permanganate mno4 mn vii oxidation has been applied to water pollution control for decades due to its advantages of safety low cost and easy to use guan et al 2010 rodríguez et al 2007 however as a selective oxidant preferring to react with electrophilic organics mn vii also suffers some drawbacks such as limited reactivity toward many refractory contaminants e g caffeine caf and nitrobenzene nb and unpleasant color if it is overdosed ladbury and cullis 1958 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 to solve these challenges many attempts have been made so far by researchers with focuses on improving the oxidation ability or capacity of mn vii tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 zhu et al 2019a by utilizing a readily available and low toxic chemical na2so3 we recently proposed a new method to effectively activate mn vii denoted as mn vii na2so3 system by which a variety of organic contaminants including caf and nb can be degraded in milliseconds sun et al 2015 and 2016 given its great advantages in terms of extremely high reactivity mn vii na2so3 process has attracted increasing interest since it was reported for example it was found that many frequently detected micropollutants in natural waters including phenol sun et al 2015 ciprofloxacin sun et al 2015 and 2018 benzene sun et al 2016 and atrazine hu et al 2017 could be effectively degraded by mn vii na2so3 process besides its broad reactivity mn vii na2so3 system was also demonstrated to be able to minimize the toxicity of disinfection byproducts generated from chlorination of humic acid solution with the presence of br when it was applied as a pre oxidation process zhu et al 2019b additionally mn vii na2so3 can also be employed as a conditioning method to improve the activated sludge dewatering performance according to the results of guo et al 2017 from the perspective of reactive oxidants involved in the mn vii na2so3 process it has been reported that both radicals e g so4 and ho and reactive mn intermediates e g mn vi mn v and mn iii could be involved in the mn vii na2so3 system and their respective contributions to the degradation of organic contaminants are dependent on the properties of contaminants and solution ph chen et al 2019 gao et al 2019 obviously it is the multiple reactive oxidants generated in mn vii na2so3 process that enable this technology to degrade a variety of contaminants although all the above outcomings highlight the potential of applying mn vii na2so3 in drinking water or advanced wastewater treatment there are still some shortcomings that hamper its wide use in practical application one major concern is related to the fact that the high reactivity of mn vii na2so3 was generally achieved under acidic conditions while it dropped greatly at ph above 7 0 gao et al 2017 sun et al 2015 taking into consideration that the typical ph values of natural waters generally fall in the range of 6 5 8 5 this declined reactivity at high ph would undoubtedly impact the application of mn vii na2so3 in field moreover the exact mechanisms behind the ph dependent performance are yet to be elucidated and no countermeasures to solve this issue have been developed so far two aspects including decreased reactivity and decreased available reactive oxidants with elevating ph might account for the ph dependent reactivity of mn vii na2so3 nevertheless improving the reactivity of radicals and or mn intermediates seems difficult without introducing other concerns because their reactivity is determined by their inherent chemical properties alternatively it may be more feasible to achieve the goal of improving the oxidation capacity of mn vii na2so3 through increasing the available percentage of reactive oxidants for target contaminants under alkaline conditions as shown in table s1 in the supporting information si in mn vii na2so3 system so3 2 hso3 s iv could induce the generation of highly reactive mn intermediates by reducing mn vii and at the same time s iv itself could be transformed to so4 and subsequently to ho obviously besides acting as an activator or precursor s iv is also capable of reducing the generated reactive oxidizing species r1 r9 and r10 in table s1 in previous studies na2so3 was always added in single addition mode where the excess amount of na2so3 present in solution may quench the reactive oxidants and deteriorate contaminants removal and this may become more significant at higher ph one approach to test this hypothesis is to evaluate the performance of mn vii na2so3 by adding na2so3 in a multiple addition mode instead of dosing it in a single addition mode however from the perspective of easy to use in practical application the multiple addition mode of na2so3 will complicate the water treatment process to address this issue calcium sulfite caso3 a sparingly soluble chemical that can release so3 2 slowly and sustainedly may be used as a viable alternative to na2so3 accordingly in this study we proposed a new method by employing caso3 as a slow releasing source of s iv to effectively activate permanganate under environmentally relevant ph conditions the objectives of this study were to i explore the decontamination performance of mn vii caso3 under various conditions and compare it with that of mn vii na2so3 system ii identify the types and contributions of reactive oxidants involved in mn vii caso3 system iii quantify the scavenging effect of excessive s iv on the evolution of reactive oxidants in mn vii s iv system by controlling the s iv dosing rate this work will gain further insights into the fundamental understanding of mn vii s iv system and thus facilitate its practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were of the highest purity available and used as received potassium permanganate was supplied by tianjin

aladdin industrial corporation for a complete listing of reagents see text s1 in si all solutions were prepared with high purity milli q deionized water 18 mω cm millipore the stock solutions of mn vi

vis spectra of the stock solutions of mn vi and mno2 the stock solution of na2so3 was freshly prepared every 2 hours to minimize its deterioration 2 2 experimental procedures typically batch experiments were performed open to the air in a 250 ml water bathed beaker at 25 1 c with stirring at 800 rpm the experiments investigating the oxidation performance of mn vii caso3 and mno2 caso3 processes were initiated by dosing mn vii or mno2 stock solution immediately after adding commercial caso3 solid into the 100 ml working solution containing target organics the initial dosage of added solid caso3 was evaluated by its total dissolution to generate mn v mn vii 50 μl 100 mm 50 μm final concentration was spiked into the working solution containing 100 μm arsenious acid as iii following a published method simándi and záhonyi budó 1998 detailed process is present in text s3 the transformation kinetics of manganese species in mn vii na2so3 mno2 na2so3 and acidified mn vi processes were determined with a stopped flow spectrophotometer sfs model sx20 applied photophysics ltd leatherhead uk and more details on the experimental design can be found in text s4 in order to quantitatively investigate the potential influence of s iv addition mode on the performance of mn vii na2so3 process an automatic titrator 905 titrando metrohm ag switzerland was employed to pump na2so3 solution procedurally into the working solution specifically 2 0 ml na2so3 stock solution 62 5 mm was pumped at different predetermined rates 1 00 0 0033 ml s corresponding to 250 0 83 μm na2so3 s into a 250 ml working solution containing 50 μm mn vii and target contaminant i e 5 0 μm ba or 20 0 μm pmso throughout the titration process the working solution was stirred at 800 rpm to avoid the influence of strong local gradients according to the preliminary experimental results demonstrated in fig s2 unless otherwise noted 25 0 mm and 10 0 mm borate buffer were used to keep ph constant at ph 7 0 and ph 8 0 9 0 respectively while 5 0 mm phosphate buffer was employed at ph 6 0 to eliminate the interference from buffer agents for reactions at ph 3 0 5 0 no buffer was used and ph was held constant varied by less than 0 2 ph units by manual addition of hclo4 and naoh as needed to track the removal of organic contaminants 2 0 ml aliquots were periodically collected during oxidation processes quenched by 10 μl of 1 0 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl and filtered with 0 22 μm filter membranes before analyses it should be noted that the sample collected at 0 min was subject to the identical pre treatment and analysis process unless otherwise noted all experiments were performed in at least duplicate and the average data along with the corresponding standard deviations were presented 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of ibuprofen ibu pmso pmso2 nb benzoic acid ba and other target organics were determined with an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters acquity uplc h class waters co and the details were provided in text s5 and table s2 the concentration of unfilterable mn after reaction was determined with atomic absorption spectroscopy aas thermo fisher scientific ice 3300 aas the details are described in text s6 the morphology of the caso3 particles was characterized with a hitachi 4800 field emission scanning electron microscope sem at 3 kv solution ph was monitored by a shanghai leici ph meter to quantify the concentration of s iv in solution aliquots were periodically collected filtered through 0 22 μm filter membranes immediately within 3 seconds to remove caso3 solids and then subject to analysis with a modified colorimetric procedure with 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid dntb as the chromogenic agent as described in our previous work rao et al 2019 in batch experiments the uv vis spectra were collected with a purkinje tu 1902 uv vis spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 decontamination behavior of mn vii caso3 system the commercial caso3 particles used in this study had a mean diameter of about 10 μm and a rosette morphology composed of smaller hexagonal prismatic crystals fig s3 firstly the feasibility of applying caso3 to activate mn vii was determined by taking ibu a commonly detected pharmaceutical in contaminated waters as a probe blair et al 2013 as depicted in fig s4a negligible ibu was removed by mn vii alone after 30 min oxidation at ph 7 0 however upon the introduction of 150 μm caso3 solid 48 of ibu disappeared within 6 0 min fig s4b further increasing the initial dosage of caso3 solid to 500 or 750 μm could lead to a more efficient ibu removal where ibu was almost completely removed within 2 0 min the potential adsorptive removal of contaminants by the insoluble part of caso3 ca oh 2 precipitates or the precipitates formed from ca2 with buffer anions was confirmed to be very minor at ph 6 0 buffered with 5 0 mm phosphate buffer and ph 9 0 buffered with 10 0 mm borate buffer fig s5 all these results implied that caso3 could be employed as an activator for mn vii and its performance was thus further explored in the following sections 3 1 1 decontamination performance of mn vii caso3 system versus mn vii na2so3 system fig 1 a depicts the influence of ph ph 5 0 9 0 on ibu removal by mn vii na2so3 process as expected high ph diminished the mn vii na2so3 performance dramatically in specific 100 ibu removal could be achieved within 5 s at ph below 7 0 while only 18 4 37 9 of the added ibu was degraded when ph was increased to 8 0 9 0 such a notable decrease in oxidation efficiency under weak alkaline conditions would undoubtedly deteriorate the potential of applying mn vii na2so3 process in field as a comparison for mn vii caso3 system complete removal of ibu could be achieved at ph 5 0 7 0 fig 1 b despite with smaller rates than those in mn vii na2so3 process moreover it is interesting to find that 86 4 and 66 8 of the added ibu could be removed by mn vii caso3 process within 600 s at ph 8 0 and 9 0 respectively which were 2 3 3 6 folds higher than that in mn vii na2so3 in other words replacing na2so3 with caso3 solid could extend the working ph range of bi sulfite activated permanganate system for effective contaminants removal from 7 0 to 9 0 to fully reflect the broad spectrum reactivity of mn vii caso3 process its performance toward some other refractory organics was further tested at ph 8 0 fig 1 c it was found that mn vii caso3 also achieved much more efficient removal of sulfamethoxazole smx nb caf ba and p chlorobenzoic acid pcba compared to mn vii alone and mn vii na2so3 process which further suggested caso3 could enhance the oxidation performance of mn vii s iv under environmentally relevant conditions note that although the reaction time needed for contaminants removal in mn vii caso3 process was longer than that in mn vii na2so3 system 100 600 s vs 5 s this may be more preferred in real practice since the vigorous mixing equipment necessary for mn vii na2so3 system is not needed for mn vii caso3 process instead a traditional pipeline mixer is enough to satisfy the reaction needs in mn vii caso3 system furthermore given the introduction of mn species in mn vii s iv system residual mn ii may also become an obstacle in the real practice indeed as demonstrated in fig 1 d the manganese residual in mn vii na2so3 was as high as 2 5 mg l after reaction at ph 7 0 which is much higher than the drinking water guideline limit 0 05 mg l recommended by the world health organization who however in mn vii caso3 system negligible dissolved mn ii was left under the same conditions revealing the superiority of mn vii caso3 over mn vii na2so3 in avoiding secondary pollution fig s6a this phenomenon should be mainly attributed to the enhanced precipitation of mno2 and the incorporation of mn ii to the mno2 precipitates in the presence of ca2 in mn vii caso3 process chen and yeh 2005 colthurst and singer 1982 in fact ca2 application can also considerably improve the removal of residual soluble mn in the mn vii na2so3 process as shown in fig s6b in sum compared with mn vii na2so3 system mn vii caso3 system holds some important merits such as higher contaminants removal capacity at ph 7 0 and less residual mn in solution which make it more suitable for application under environmentally relevant conditions 3 1 2 two stage oxidation in mn vii caso3 system to better understand the mn vii caso3 oxidation process the consumption of mn vii and the release of s iv from caso3 were further explored as demonstrated in fig s7 the characteristic double peaks of mn vii disappeared quickly within 40 s s iv releasing is the rate determining step and afterwards only the characteristic spectrum of mno2 could be observed irrespective of the solution ph the rate of reaction between mn vii and s iv i e r1a in table s1 in mn vii caso3 system varied slightly from 1 27 104 m 1s 1 to 2 68 104 m 1s 1 with elevating ph from 6 0 to 8 0 and thus this step should not account for the varied ibu removal capacities at different ph levels instead it is more likely to be ascribed to the transformations of mn and s centered intermediates generated from r1a and this will be discussed further in the following sections based on the mn vii loss trend the kinetics of contaminants removal in mn vii caso3 system can be divided into two reaction stages a fast degradation process by mn vii s iv within the first 40 s stage i and a subsequent slow degradation process by mno2 s iv stage ii t 40 s such a two stage oxidation has not been reported in mn vii na2so3 system the removal kinetics of ibu in stage i could be simulated with the pseudo first order rate law and the calculated rate constants were found to decrease from 0 05 s 1 to 0 01 s 1 with ph increasing from 5 0 to 9 0 fig 1 b for stage ii although the rates of s iv oxidation by mno2 9 4 0 6 m 1s 1 at ph 6 0 8 0 were 3 4 orders of magnitude slower than those by mn vii table s1 this reaction was important for sustained contaminants removal and its contribution could become more pronounced at high ph values for example despite 18 5 37 9 of ibu was removed in stage i at ph 8 0 9 0 more ibu 29 3 45 8 was abated in stage ii fig 1 b to explore the role of the s iv releasing step on ibu removal by mn vii caso3 the dissolution behavior of caso3 in the absence of mn vii was monitored independently as expected s iv released gradually from suspended caso3 solid into solution and this process was favored at lower ph as demonstrated in fig s8 this is because s iv is mainly present in the form of hso3 at acidic conditions pka2 of h2so3 is 7 2 neta and huie 1985 and ca hso3 2 is much more readily soluble than caso3 ksp ca2 so3 2 3 1 1 5 10 7 m2 at 25 c pasiuk bronikowska et al 1992 consequently the dissolution of s iv from caso3 cas o 3 solid c a 2 so 3 2 accelerated with decreasing ph and this partially contributed to the faster ibu removal under acidic conditions in mn vii caso3 a more detailed discussion of the influence of s iv dosing rate can be found elsewhere section 3 3 3 2 reactive oxidants involved in each stage of mn vii caso3 previous studies have verified that reactive mn intermediates e g mn vi mn v mn iii along with radicals e g so4 and ho are involved in mn vii na2so3 system as oxidants responsible for the decomposition of contaminants chen et al 2019 gao et al 2019 one can thus infer that these reactive species should also be generated in the mn vii caso3 system however considering the two oxidation stages involved in mn vii caso3 system the contribution of the reactive oxidants in each stage may be different and deserves further investigation consequently taking some probe compounds such as pmso nb and ba the types and contribution of reactive oxidants were explored in mn vii caso3 system 3 2 1 contribution of reactive manganese species fig 2 illustrates the pmso transformation in both mn vii caso3 and mno2 caso3 systems under different ph values according to the time profiles of pmso loss and pmso2 generation the two stage oxidation phenomenon in mn vii caso3 process was further verified and more importantly the different pmso2 formation trends in the two stages suggested that different reactive oxidants should be involved in these two stages in specific prior studies have shown that pmso can be oxidized to pmso2 by some mn intermediates e g mn v mn vi through an oxygen transfer step chellamani et al 1999 chen et al 2019 while pmso2 will not be generated when pmso reacts with radicals like ho and so4 simándi et al 1987 wang et al 2018 therefore the generation of pmso2 could be served as an indicator of the existence of reactive mn intermediates and the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 i e δpmso2 δpmso could indicate the contribution of reactive mn intermediates for stage i figs 2 a c pmso was degraded accompanying with the generation of pmso2 the yield of pmso2 could achieve 100 at the very beginning of the reaction but declined to 40 85 at 40 s depending on solution ph this phenomenon suggested that reactive mn intermediates were generated in stage i but their contribution varied with operating conditions and declined with time note that besides mn intermediates some one electron oxidants like so4 and ho may also be formed in this stage since the yield of pmso2 was not always 100 throughout the stage and this will be discussed in detail in the next section experiments with mn vii mn vi mn v or mno2 were conducted to identify the potential reactive mn species in mn vii caso3 process as demonstrated in fig s9a the oxidation of pmso by mno2 was very slow k 1 0 2 0 m 1s 1 thus its possible role in the fast oxidation of pmso was ruled out mn vii alone could oxidize pmso to pmso2 with a second order reaction rate constant of 100 m 1s 1 at ph 5 0 9 0 fig s9b since this reaction is two orders of magnitude slower than the reaction between mn vii and s iv table s1 the rapid transformation of pmso to pmso2 in mn vii caso3 system cannot be mainly caused by mn vii itself the contribution of mn iii can been excluded by the ethanol etoh scavenging experiments as demonstrated in fig s10 in brief etoh is an efficient scavenger for so4 ho buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 mn v and mn vi pode and waters 1956 but it is inert to mn iii drummond and waters 1953 therefore the fact that the addition of 100 mm etoh completely scavenged the oxidation of pmso in mn vii caso3 system indicated that mn iii may not act as an important oxidant herein to further illustrate the possible involvement of mn vi and mn v in mn vii caso3 system the transformation kinetics of pmso in acidified mn vi and mn vii as iii a typical mn v involved system systems were examined over a wide ph range fig s11 in acidified mn vi system disproportionation of mn vi would complete in 1 0 s at ph 8 0 generating mn vii and mno2 as end products fig s12 considering that mn vii could also oxidize pmso to pmso2 we try to discriminate the contribution of mn vii from that of mn vi by determining the removal efficacy of pmso in acidified mn vi system within 1 0 s of reaction using the stopped flow method it turns out 2 2 μm pmso was selectively oxidized to pmso2 in acidified mn vi system mn vi 0 179 mm at final ph of 3 0 while only 0 5 μm pmso was oxidized by 180 μm mn vii within 1 0 s of reaction moreover at ph 11 4 where mn vi disproportionation is negligible in 5 0 s fig s12 the oxidation of pmso within 1 0 s of reaction in acidified mn vi system is still significant these results unraveled that mn vi can rapidly transform pmso to pmso2 in mn vii as iii system mn vii 0 50 μm as iii 0 100 μm mn vii was depleted in milliseconds to generate mno2 as end product but mno2 can hardly oxidize pmso in 1 0 s fig s9a at ph 3 0 about 5 1 μm pmso was oxidized and transformed to pmso2 in mn vii as iii system within 1 0 s of reaction fig s11 verifying the high reactivity of mn v towards pmso at ph 3 0 although negligible pmso was oxidized in mn vii as iii system at ph over 3 0 this may be ascribed to the rapid consumption of mn v by as iii at ph over 3 0 taking together it can be inferred that the predominant reactive mn intermediates responsible for the pmso oxidation in stage i of mn vii caso3 system should be mn v and mn vi indeed since the first step of s iv oxidation is always starting with a one electron transfer step to generate so3 connick et al 1995 mn vii is most likely to be reduced to mn vi firstly when it comes to in contact with s iv then the generated mn vi may react either with contaminants to generate mn iv or with s iv to yield mn v mn vi may also undergo disproportionation to generate mn v and mn vii likewise the generated mn v will react with contaminants or s iv to form mn iii or mn iv respectively during stage ii of the mn vii caso3 process where mn vii has been depleted pmso could still be degraded but the amount of pmso2 in solution kept constant or even decreased with time figs 2 a c similarly independent experiments in the mno2 caso3 system also revealed negligible pmso2 was formed during this process fig 2 d all these results indicated that there should exist some other reactive oxidants different from mn based intermediates e g reactive radicals in the second stage of mn vii caso3 process actually as shown in fig s13 radicals such as so4 and ho their identification was discussed in section 3 2 2 are able to degrade pmso but no pmso2 was generated in addition pmso2 could be oxidized by ho and this reaction should account for the observed slight decomposition of pmso2 in stage ii of mn vii caso3 figs 2 a c the feature that the amount of pmso consumed in mn vii caso3 system decreased with increasing ph is in line with the decreased oxidation efficiency of mn vii na2so3 under alkaline conditions nevertheless another notable feature in fig 2 was that the amount of pmso2 generated in stage i which could represent the contribution of mn v and mn vi to pmso oxidation decreased from 9 35 μm to 1 44 μm as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 while the value dpmso dpmso2 which could represent the amount of pmso oxidized by so4 and ho varied from 4 7 μm to 5 6 μm over ph range of 5 0 9 0 moreover the pmso removal trends in mno2 caso3 system fig 2 d demonstrate that increasing ph did not notably deteriorate the oxidation of pmso in mno2 caso3 process all these results suggested that the inhibiting effect of ph on the overall oxidizing capacity of mn vii caso3 system should be mainly induced by the decreased reactivity of mn v and mn vi in stage i while the contribution of so4 and ho varied slightly within the ph range of 5 0 to 9 0 this point was further illustrated in section 3 3 3 2 2 contribution of so4 and ho as mentioned earlier the facts that the pmso2 yield was less than 100 in stage i and negligible pmso2 was formed in stage ii suggested the involvement of one electron transfer oxidants in both stages in mn vii caso3 system considering the involvement of s species in mn vii caso3 system and that the transformation of s iv under aerobic conditions could produce so4 in principle berglund et al 1993 the generation of so4 and ho derived from so4 was examined in this section to this end nb and ba were selected as the probe compounds nb is inert to most oxidants but could react rapidly with ho while ba is prone to be oxidatively attacked by both ho and so4 table s3 independent experiments have verified that the potential oxidative manganese species in mn vii caso3 process including mn vii mn vi mn v mno2 and mn iii could not oxidize nb and ba under the tested conditions fig s14 fig 3 a shows that significant nb removal could be achieved in both stage i and stage ii in mn vii caso3 system over the tested ph range of 5 0 9 0 suggesting the involvement of ho in both stages it is noteworthy that with ph increased from 7 0 to 9 0 the amount of oxidized nb decreased by 24 in stage i but only by 4 in stage ii these results offer further support to our previous conclusion that the decreased oxidation capacity of mn vii caso3 system under alkaline conditions was mainly ascribed to the dropped oxidation capacity in stage i to explore the generation of so4 alcohol scavenging experiments were carried out using ba and nb as probe organics as shown in fig 3 b tert butanol tba an efficient scavenger for ho but not for so4 table s3 completely suppressed nb transformation with a low dosage 10 mm tba whereas it partially inhibited the transformation of ba from 91 0 mm tba to 51 with 10 mm tba and to 20 with 100 mm tba on the other hand etoh which is able to effectively scavenge both so4 and ho table s3 completely suppressed both nb and ba transformation in the mn vii caso3 system all these results confirmed that both so4 and ho are involved during the mn vii caso3 process since ho are most possibly generated from the reaction between so4 and water or oh r8 in table s1 the concentration of so4 in the mn vii caso3 system should be greater than that of ho to test this point their steady state concentrations in mn vii caso3 system were calculated using nb and ba as probe compounds as depicted in fig 3 c the disappearance of nb and ba in each stage of mn vii caso3 process was simulated with the pseudo first order rate law and the observed rate constants were determined to be 0 0037 s 1 0 0016 s 1 0 0329 s 1 and 0 0122 s 1 respectively then according to eqs 1 2 the steady state concentrations of ho ho ss and so4 so4 ss in stage i 40 s were calculated to be 9 49 10 13 m and 2 66 10 11 m respectively while ho ss and so4 ss in stage ii 40 s were calculated to be 3 72 10 13 m and 9 79 10 12 m respectively these concentrations are comparable to that derived in other optimized advanced oxidation processes where the maximum concentrations of ho and so4 generally fall in the range of 10 12 10 14 m schwarzenbach et al 1993 in addition it turns out the ratios of the steady state concentration of ho to that of so4 i e ho ss so4 ss 100 in stage i and stage ii were only 3 6 and 3 8 respectively these results confirmed that so4 was the precursor of ho in mn vii caso3 system 1 h o ss k obs nb k h o n b 2 so 4 ss k obs ba h o ss k h o ba k so 4 ba here k obs nb and k obs ba were the apparent pseudo first order rate constants for nb and ba removal obtained in this work and k ho reductant and k so4 reductant were the corresponding second order rate constants adopted from previous studies see table s1 and table s3 for specific values 3 2 3 proposed reaction pathways and mechanism collectively the transformation pathways of manganese species and sulfur species in mn vii caso3 system were proposed scheme 1 in general the process of mn vii caso3 is composed of two stages depending on the consumption of mn vii in stage i mn vii reacts rapidly with s iv along with mn vi and so3 generated as primary products mn vi then through a series of reduction reactions with s iv and or self disproportionation gradually transforms to other mn species like mn v mn iv mn iii mno2 and mn ii meanwhile so3 undergoes a series of chain reactions to form so5 so4 and ho sequentially among these intermediate species mn vi mn v so4 and ho are responsible for the oxidation of target contaminants tested in this study once all the added mn vii is consumed the oxidation process advances to the second stage of mno2 caso3 in this stage mno2 is reduced to mn iii by s iv and concomitantly s iv is oxidized to so3 then the reactive oxidants such as so4 and ho are produced it should be noted that depending on the operating conditions mn intermediates like mn iii generated in both stages may be responsible for the removal of some contaminants e g phenolic compounds chen et al 2019 more importantly as an important chain carrier for the s iv chain oxidation process connick and zhang 1996 mn iii may play a critical role for the generation of so4 in both stage i and stage ii as sketched in scheme 1 3 3 effect of s iv dosing rate on contaminants removal by mn vii s iv at various ph levels given that the decontamination behaviors and the two stage oxidation mechanism in the mn vii caso3 system have been successfully identified we tried to use these information to illuminate i why the overall reactivity of mn vii s iv toward contaminants removal declines with increasing ph values and ii why the slow release of s iv from caso3 can increase the oxidation capacity of mn vii s iv 3 3 1 effect of s iv dosing rate on the evolution of radicals using an automatic titrator the influence of na2so3 dosing rate on the ba removal kinetics was investigated at ph 6 0 8 0 by fixing the total dosage of na2so3 being 125 μmol see fig s15 for the removal kinetics of ba fig 4 a shows that the calculated ba removal rates increased progressively with the elevating na2so3 dosing rate at all the investigated ph levels meanwhile the ba removal rates were generally higher at lower ph and the discrepancy among ba removal rates at different ph levels became more pronounced with the increasing s iv dosing rate as mentioned above so4 and ho are responsible for the ba removal therefore the increasing ba removal rate with elevating na2so3 dosing rate indicated that higher na2so3 dosing rates were favorable for fast generation of radicals in the system irrespective of the solution ph however as illustrated in fig 4 b it was interesting to find that although ba removal efficacy at the end of titration kept almost constant 89 92 under varying na2so3 dosing rates 0 83 250 μm s at ph 6 0 it declined notably from 84 89 to 77 86 and to 46 68 when the na2so3 dosing rate increased from 0 83 μm s to 8 33 μm s and to 250 μm s respectively at ph 7 0 and 8 0 this suggested that although radicals can be produced faster with larger na2so3 dosing rates the radicals available for ba degradation were greatly suppressed by large amount of na2so3 in aqueous phase at ph 7 0 in mn vii caso3 system the rate of s iv release from caso3 solids was 4 0 μm s at ph 7 0 8 0 fig s8 therefore the scavenging effect of s iv on the reactive oxidants in the mn vii caso3 system was much less significant than that in the mn vii na2so3 system where s iv was dosed into the working solution instantaneously the influence of ph on the formation of so4 and ho was evaluated at low na2so3 dosing rate 0 83 μm s where the quenching effects of s iv on so4 and ho could be negligible and s iv acts mainly as a precursor it turns out that the ba removal rate decreased in the order of ph 6 0 0 0144 s 1 ph 7 0 0 0042 s 1 ph 8 0 0 0028 s 1 pk a of ba is 4 19 hollingsworth et al 2002 implying that the generation of so4 and ho was favored under acidic conditions in mn vii s iv system however according to the reported rate constants listed in table s1 the transformation rate of so3 2 1 0 0 1 108 m 1s 1 by so5 to so4 is slightly higher than that of hso3 6 0 0 4 107 m 1s 1 furthermore the rate constants of s iv oxidation by mn vii at ph 7 0 1 78 104 m 1s 1 and 8 0 2 65 104 m 1s 1 are slightly larger than that at ph 6 0 1 27 104 m 1s 1 therefore some other reactions should account for the much higher transformation efficiency of s iv to so4 and ho at ph 6 0 than that at ph 7 0 8 0 mn iii besides so5 is another important chain carrier involved in mn vii caso3 process which can oxidize s iv to so3 and initiate the chain reaction berglund et al 1993 it is well documented that mn iii is apt to disproportionate under alkaline conditions to generate mno2 and mn ii connick and zhang 1996 klewicki and morgan 1998 in agreement with our finding that mno2 accumulated significantly at ph 7 0 in mn vii na2so3 system fig s16 furthermore the reactivity of mno2 towards s iv decreased notably with the elevating solution ph fig s16 consequently compared with the scenario under acidic conditions the lower generation rate of radicals under alkaline conditions in mn vii na2so3 system might be associated with the slower oxidation rate of s iv by mn iii and mno2 under alkaline conditions in addition from another perspective the slower s iv transformation under neutral and alkaline conditions would leave more s iv in solution to compete with target contaminants for radicals therefore the increased na2so3 dosing rate severely impaired the apparent oxidation capacity of radical oxidants in the titration system at ph 7 0 as shown in fig 4b 3 3 2 effect of s iv dosing rate on the evolution of reactive mn intermediates since pmso can be oxidized by mn v and mn vi to generate pmso2 pmso was taken as the probe molecular in this section to examine the influence of na2so3 dosing rates on the contribution of reactive manganese species in mn vii na2so3 system the pmso transformation profiles in mn vii na2so3 system with varying na2so3 dosing rates were determined fig s17 and the corresponding pmso loss and pmso2 generation values were summarized in fig 5 it was found that at each ph value tested the amount of pmso2 generated changed slightly with varying na2so3 dosing rates which suggested that the amounts of s iv excessive in solution did not exhibit significant influence on the evolution of reactive mn intermediates this phenomenon was different from that of ba decomposition at varying na2so3 dosing rates furthermore regardless of the varying na2so3 dosing rates both the pmso consumption and pmso2 generation declined with the increasing ph fig 5 implying high ph levels could inhibit the formation or the reactivity of mn intermediates as mentioned above and shown in fig s16 mn vii could readily react with s iv under the tested ph values thus the increasing ph may not affect the generation of mn vi and mn v remarkably in mn vii s iv system alternatively it is more likely that the declined reactivity of mn vi and mn v account for the decreased the pmso2 generation at high ph values indeed that both mn v and mn vi are more effective in oxidizing organics under acidic conditions has been verified in this study fig s11 and also been reported by previous studies záhonyi budó and simándi 1994 and 1995 taken together due to the decreased reactivity of mn intermediates i e mn vi mn v mno2 and mn iii at high ph values it is inefficient to degrade contaminants directly by these mn intermediates themselves or to trigger the generation of s centered radicals by mn iii and mno2 under environmentally relevant conditions moreover although s iv is essential for radical formation excess s iv can also quench the generated radicals and further deteriorate the decontamination performance of mn vii s iv system hence from another perspective the slow supply of s iv from caso3 could alleviate the scavenging effect of s iv on radicals thereby enhancing the oxidation capacity of mn vii s iv system 4 conclusion the present study systematically evaluated the feasibility of applying caso3 as a slow release source of s iv to activate mn vii for organic contaminants removal under environmentally relevant conditions generally it was found that mn vii caso3 system could effectively degrade organic contaminants over a wide ph range of 5 0 9 0 more importantly at ph 7 0 mn vii caso3 system performed much better than mn vii na2so3 system in terms of contaminants removal efficiency and residual mn highlighting its applicability in real water treatment due to the rapid consumption of mn vii the overall process of mn vii caso3 could be divided into two stages mn vii caso3 stage and mno2 caso3 stage and the contribution of the second stage to contaminants removal became more pronounced at high ph values with respect to the reactive oxidants responsible for contaminants removal both radicals and reactive mn species were determined to be involved in mn vii caso3 system furthermore by changing the na2so3 dosing rate it was found that excess s iv could scavenge the generated free radicals especially under alkaline conditions but it exhibited little influence on the evolution of reactive mn intermediates it was thus reasonable to conclude that the slow release of s iv from caso3 could minimize the competition of s iv with contaminants for radicals and thus improve the decontamination performance at high ph values all these results not only shed new insights into the mechanisms of mn vii s iv process but also are helpful to facilitate the real application of this technology mn v and mn vi were identified as reactive manganese species in mn vii caso3 system but their reactivity and individual contributions to the oxidation of different contaminants deserve further investigation moreover we will make more

17409,although permanganate activation by sodium sulfite mn vii na2so3 has shown great potential for rapid abatement of organic contaminants the limited reactivity under alkaline conditions and undesirable mn residual may prevent its widespread application to solve these challenges calcium sulfite caso3 was employed as a slow release source of so3 2 hso3 s iv to activate mn vii in this study it was found that the application of caso3 solid could extend the effective working ph range of mn vii s iv from 7 0 to 9 0 moreover due to the enhanced precipitation of mno2 with the presence of ca2 very low mn residual 0 05 mg l was achieved in mn vii caso3 system mn vii caso3 system is a unique two stage oxidation process in terms of reaction kinetics and reactive oxidants specifically mn vii was rapidly consumed and reactive mn intermediates e g mn vi mn v so4 and ho were produced in the first stage however the second stage was governed by the interaction between mno2 and s iv with so4 and ho serving as the dominant reactive oxidants taking advantage of an automatic titrator excess s iv was found to greatly quench the generated radicals whereas it did not cause a significant consumption of reactive mn species all these results improved our understanding of the mn vii s iv process and could thus facilitate its application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate calcium sulfite radicals reactive manganese species emerging organic contaminants 1 introduction permanganate mno4 mn vii oxidation has been applied to water pollution control for decades due to its advantages of safety low cost and easy to use guan et al 2010 rodríguez et al 2007 however as a selective oxidant preferring to react with electrophilic organics mn vii also suffers some drawbacks such as limited reactivity toward many refractory contaminants e g caffeine caf and nitrobenzene nb and unpleasant color if it is overdosed ladbury and cullis 1958 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 to solve these challenges many attempts have been made so far by researchers with focuses on improving the oxidation ability or capacity of mn vii tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 zhu et al 2019a by utilizing a readily available and low toxic chemical na2so3 we recently proposed a new method to effectively activate mn vii denoted as mn vii na2so3 system by which a variety of organic contaminants including caf and nb can be degraded in milliseconds sun et al 2015 and 2016 given its great advantages in terms of extremely high reactivity mn vii na2so3 process has attracted increasing interest since it was reported for example it was found that many frequently detected micropollutants in natural waters including phenol sun et al 2015 ciprofloxacin sun et al 2015 and 2018 benzene sun et al 2016 and atrazine hu et al 2017 could be effectively degraded by mn vii na2so3 process besides its broad reactivity mn vii na2so3 system was also demonstrated to be able to minimize the toxicity of disinfection byproducts generated from chlorination of humic acid solution with the presence of br when it was applied as a pre oxidation process zhu et al 2019b additionally mn vii na2so3 can also be employed as a conditioning method to improve the activated sludge dewatering performance according to the results of guo et al 2017 from the perspective of reactive oxidants involved in the mn vii na2so3 process it has been reported that both radicals e g so4 and ho and reactive mn intermediates e g mn vi mn v and mn iii could be involved in the mn vii na2so3 system and their respective contributions to the degradation of organic contaminants are dependent on the properties of contaminants and solution ph chen et al 2019 gao et al 2019 obviously it is the multiple reactive oxidants generated in mn vii na2so3 process that enable this technology to degrade a variety of contaminants although all the above outcomings highlight the potential of applying mn vii na2so3 in drinking water or advanced wastewater treatment there are still some shortcomings that hamper its wide use in practical application one major concern is related to the fact that the high reactivity of mn vii na2so3 was generally achieved under acidic conditions while it dropped greatly at ph above 7 0 gao et al 2017 sun et al 2015 taking into consideration that the typical ph values of natural waters generally fall in the range of 6 5 8 5 this declined reactivity at high ph would undoubtedly impact the application of mn vii na2so3 in field moreover the exact mechanisms behind the ph dependent performance are yet to be elucidated and no countermeasures to solve this issue have been developed so far two aspects including decreased reactivity and decreased available reactive oxidants with elevating ph might account for the ph dependent reactivity of mn vii na2so3 nevertheless improving the reactivity of radicals and or mn intermediates seems difficult without introducing other concerns because their reactivity is determined by their inherent chemical properties alternatively it may be more feasible to achieve the goal of improving the oxidation capacity of mn vii na2so3 through increasing the available percentage of reactive oxidants for target contaminants under alkaline conditions as shown in table s1 in the supporting information si in mn vii na2so3 system so3 2 hso3 s iv could induce the generation of highly reactive mn intermediates by reducing mn vii and at the same time s iv itself could be transformed to so4 and subsequently to ho obviously besides acting as an activator or precursor s iv is also capable of reducing the generated reactive oxidizing species r1 r9 and r10 in table s1 in previous studies na2so3 was always added in single addition mode where the excess amount of na2so3 present in solution may quench the reactive oxidants and deteriorate contaminants removal and this may become more significant at higher ph one approach to test this hypothesis is to evaluate the performance of mn vii na2so3 by adding na2so3 in a multiple addition mode instead of dosing it in a single addition mode however from the perspective of easy to use in practical application the multiple addition mode of na2so3 will complicate the water treatment process to address this issue calcium sulfite caso3 a sparingly soluble chemical that can release so3 2 slowly and sustainedly may be used as a viable alternative to na2so3 accordingly in this study we proposed a new method by employing caso3 as a slow releasing source of s iv to effectively activate permanganate under environmentally relevant ph conditions the objectives of this study were to i explore the decontamination performance of mn vii caso3 under various conditions and compare it with that of mn vii na2so3 system ii identify the types and contributions of reactive oxidants involved in mn vii caso3 system iii quantify the scavenging effect of excessive s iv on the evolution of reactive oxidants in mn vii s iv system by controlling the s iv dosing rate this work will gain further insights into the fundamental understanding of mn vii s iv system and thus facilitate its practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were of the highest purity available and used as received potassium permanganate was supplied by tianjin

aladdin industrial corporation for a complete listing of reagents see text s1 in si all solutions were prepared with high purity milli q deionized water 18 mω cm millipore the stock solutions of mn vi

vis spectra of the stock solutions of mn vi and mno2 the stock solution of na2so3 was freshly prepared every 2 hours to minimize its deterioration 2 2 experimental procedures typically batch experiments were performed open to the air in a 250 ml water bathed beaker at 25 1 c with stirring at 800 rpm the experiments investigating the oxidation performance of mn vii caso3 and mno2 caso3 processes were initiated by dosing mn vii or mno2 stock solution immediately after adding commercial caso3 solid into the 100 ml working solution containing target organics the initial dosage of added solid caso3 was evaluated by its total dissolution to generate mn v mn vii 50 μl 100 mm 50 μm final concentration was spiked into the working solution containing 100 μm arsenious acid as iii following a published method simándi and záhonyi budó 1998 detailed process is present in text s3 the transformation kinetics of manganese species in mn vii na2so3 mno2 na2so3 and acidified mn vi processes were determined with a stopped flow spectrophotometer sfs model sx20 applied photophysics ltd leatherhead uk and more details on the experimental design can be found in text s4 in order to quantitatively investigate the potential influence of s iv addition mode on the performance of mn vii na2so3 process an automatic titrator 905 titrando metrohm ag switzerland was employed to pump na2so3 solution procedurally into the working solution specifically 2 0 ml na2so3 stock solution 62 5 mm was pumped at different predetermined rates 1 00 0 0033 ml s corresponding to 250 0 83 μm na2so3 s into a 250 ml working solution containing 50 μm mn vii and target contaminant i e 5 0 μm ba or 20 0 μm pmso throughout the titration process the working solution was stirred at 800 rpm to avoid the influence of strong local gradients according to the preliminary experimental results demonstrated in fig s2 unless otherwise noted 25 0 mm and 10 0 mm borate buffer were used to keep ph constant at ph 7 0 and ph 8 0 9 0 respectively while 5 0 mm phosphate buffer was employed at ph 6 0 to eliminate the interference from buffer agents for reactions at ph 3 0 5 0 no buffer was used and ph was held constant varied by less than 0 2 ph units by manual addition of hclo4 and naoh as needed to track the removal of organic contaminants 2 0 ml aliquots were periodically collected during oxidation processes quenched by 10 μl of 1 0 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl and filtered with 0 22 μm filter membranes before analyses it should be noted that the sample collected at 0 min was subject to the identical pre treatment and analysis process unless otherwise noted all experiments were performed in at least duplicate and the average data along with the corresponding standard deviations were presented 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of ibuprofen ibu pmso pmso2 nb benzoic acid ba and other target organics were determined with an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters acquity uplc h class waters co and the details were provided in text s5 and table s2 the concentration of unfilterable mn after reaction was determined with atomic absorption spectroscopy aas thermo fisher scientific ice 3300 aas the details are described in text s6 the morphology of the caso3 particles was characterized with a hitachi 4800 field emission scanning electron microscope sem at 3 kv solution ph was monitored by a shanghai leici ph meter to quantify the concentration of s iv in solution aliquots were periodically collected filtered through 0 22 μm filter membranes immediately within 3 seconds to remove caso3 solids and then subject to analysis with a modified colorimetric procedure with 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid dntb as the chromogenic agent as described in our previous work rao et al 2019 in batch experiments the uv vis spectra were collected with a purkinje tu 1902 uv vis spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 decontamination behavior of mn vii caso3 system the commercial caso3 particles used in this study had a mean diameter of about 10 μm and a rosette morphology composed of smaller hexagonal prismatic crystals fig s3 firstly the feasibility of applying caso3 to activate mn vii was determined by taking ibu a commonly detected pharmaceutical in contaminated waters as a probe blair et al 2013 as depicted in fig s4a negligible ibu was removed by mn vii alone after 30 min oxidation at ph 7 0 however upon the introduction of 150 μm caso3 solid 48 of ibu disappeared within 6 0 min fig s4b further increasing the initial dosage of caso3 solid to 500 or 750 μm could lead to a more efficient ibu removal where ibu was almost completely removed within 2 0 min the potential adsorptive removal of contaminants by the insoluble part of caso3 ca oh 2 precipitates or the precipitates formed from ca2 with buffer anions was confirmed to be very minor at ph 6 0 buffered with 5 0 mm phosphate buffer and ph 9 0 buffered with 10 0 mm borate buffer fig s5 all these results implied that caso3 could be employed as an activator for mn vii and its performance was thus further explored in the following sections 3 1 1 decontamination performance of mn vii caso3 system versus mn vii na2so3 system fig 1 a depicts the influence of ph ph 5 0 9 0 on ibu removal by mn vii na2so3 process as expected high ph diminished the mn vii na2so3 performance dramatically in specific 100 ibu removal could be achieved within 5 s at ph below 7 0 while only 18 4 37 9 of the added ibu was degraded when ph was increased to 8 0 9 0 such a notable decrease in oxidation efficiency under weak alkaline conditions would undoubtedly deteriorate the potential of applying mn vii na2so3 process in field as a comparison for mn vii caso3 system complete removal of ibu could be achieved at ph 5 0 7 0 fig 1 b despite with smaller rates than those in mn vii na2so3 process moreover it is interesting to find that 86 4 and 66 8 of the added ibu could be removed by mn vii caso3 process within 600 s at ph 8 0 and 9 0 respectively which were 2 3 3 6 folds higher than that in mn vii na2so3 in other words replacing na2so3 with caso3 solid could extend the working ph range of bi sulfite activated permanganate system for effective contaminants removal from 7 0 to 9 0 to fully reflect the broad spectrum reactivity of mn vii caso3 process its performance toward some other refractory organics was further tested at ph 8 0 fig 1 c it was found that mn vii caso3 also achieved much more efficient removal of sulfamethoxazole smx nb caf ba and p chlorobenzoic acid pcba compared to mn vii alone and mn vii na2so3 process which further suggested caso3 could enhance the oxidation performance of mn vii s iv under environmentally relevant conditions note that although the reaction time needed for contaminants removal in mn vii caso3 process was longer than that in mn vii na2so3 system 100 600 s vs 5 s this may be more preferred in real practice since the vigorous mixing equipment necessary for mn vii na2so3 system is not needed for mn vii caso3 process instead a traditional pipeline mixer is enough to satisfy the reaction needs in mn vii caso3 system furthermore given the introduction of mn species in mn vii s iv system residual mn ii may also become an obstacle in the real practice indeed as demonstrated in fig 1 d the manganese residual in mn vii na2so3 was as high as 2 5 mg l after reaction at ph 7 0 which is much higher than the drinking water guideline limit 0 05 mg l recommended by the world health organization who however in mn vii caso3 system negligible dissolved mn ii was left under the same conditions revealing the superiority of mn vii caso3 over mn vii na2so3 in avoiding secondary pollution fig s6a this phenomenon should be mainly attributed to the enhanced precipitation of mno2 and the incorporation of mn ii to the mno2 precipitates in the presence of ca2 in mn vii caso3 process chen and yeh 2005 colthurst and singer 1982 in fact ca2 application can also considerably improve the removal of residual soluble mn in the mn vii na2so3 process as shown in fig s6b in sum compared with mn vii na2so3 system mn vii caso3 system holds some important merits such as higher contaminants removal capacity at ph 7 0 and less residual mn in solution which make it more suitable for application under environmentally relevant conditions 3 1 2 two stage oxidation in mn vii caso3 system to better understand the mn vii caso3 oxidation process the consumption of mn vii and the release of s iv from caso3 were further explored as demonstrated in fig s7 the characteristic double peaks of mn vii disappeared quickly within 40 s s iv releasing is the rate determining step and afterwards only the characteristic spectrum of mno2 could be observed irrespective of the solution ph the rate of reaction between mn vii and s iv i e r1a in table s1 in mn vii caso3 system varied slightly from 1 27 104 m 1s 1 to 2 68 104 m 1s 1 with elevating ph from 6 0 to 8 0 and thus this step should not account for the varied ibu removal capacities at different ph levels instead it is more likely to be ascribed to the transformations of mn and s centered intermediates generated from r1a and this will be discussed further in the following sections based on the mn vii loss trend the kinetics of contaminants removal in mn vii caso3 system can be divided into two reaction stages a fast degradation process by mn vii s iv within the first 40 s stage i and a subsequent slow degradation process by mno2 s iv stage ii t 40 s such a two stage oxidation has not been reported in mn vii na2so3 system the removal kinetics of ibu in stage i could be simulated with the pseudo first order rate law and the calculated rate constants were found to decrease from 0 05 s 1 to 0 01 s 1 with ph increasing from 5 0 to 9 0 fig 1 b for stage ii although the rates of s iv oxidation by mno2 9 4 0 6 m 1s 1 at ph 6 0 8 0 were 3 4 orders of magnitude slower than those by mn vii table s1 this reaction was important for sustained contaminants removal and its contribution could become more pronounced at high ph values for example despite 18 5 37 9 of ibu was removed in stage i at ph 8 0 9 0 more ibu 29 3 45 8 was abated in stage ii fig 1 b to explore the role of the s iv releasing step on ibu removal by mn vii caso3 the dissolution behavior of caso3 in the absence of mn vii was monitored independently as expected s iv released gradually from suspended caso3 solid into solution and this process was favored at lower ph as demonstrated in fig s8 this is because s iv is mainly present in the form of hso3 at acidic conditions pka2 of h2so3 is 7 2 neta and huie 1985 and ca hso3 2 is much more readily soluble than caso3 ksp ca2 so3 2 3 1 1 5 10 7 m2 at 25 c pasiuk bronikowska et al 1992 consequently the dissolution of s iv from caso3 cas o 3 solid c a 2 so 3 2 accelerated with decreasing ph and this partially contributed to the faster ibu removal under acidic conditions in mn vii caso3 a more detailed discussion of the influence of s iv dosing rate can be found elsewhere section 3 3 3 2 reactive oxidants involved in each stage of mn vii caso3 previous studies have verified that reactive mn intermediates e g mn vi mn v mn iii along with radicals e g so4 and ho are involved in mn vii na2so3 system as oxidants responsible for the decomposition of contaminants chen et al 2019 gao et al 2019 one can thus infer that these reactive species should also be generated in the mn vii caso3 system however considering the two oxidation stages involved in mn vii caso3 system the contribution of the reactive oxidants in each stage may be different and deserves further investigation consequently taking some probe compounds such as pmso nb and ba the types and contribution of reactive oxidants were explored in mn vii caso3 system 3 2 1 contribution of reactive manganese species fig 2 illustrates the pmso transformation in both mn vii caso3 and mno2 caso3 systems under different ph values according to the time profiles of pmso loss and pmso2 generation the two stage oxidation phenomenon in mn vii caso3 process was further verified and more importantly the different pmso2 formation trends in the two stages suggested that different reactive oxidants should be involved in these two stages in specific prior studies have shown that pmso can be oxidized to pmso2 by some mn intermediates e g mn v mn vi through an oxygen transfer step chellamani et al 1999 chen et al 2019 while pmso2 will not be generated when pmso reacts with radicals like ho and so4 simándi et al 1987 wang et al 2018 therefore the generation of pmso2 could be served as an indicator of the existence of reactive mn intermediates and the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 i e δpmso2 δpmso could indicate the contribution of reactive mn intermediates for stage i figs 2 a c pmso was degraded accompanying with the generation of pmso2 the yield of pmso2 could achieve 100 at the very beginning of the reaction but declined to 40 85 at 40 s depending on solution ph this phenomenon suggested that reactive mn intermediates were generated in stage i but their contribution varied with operating conditions and declined with time note that besides mn intermediates some one electron oxidants like so4 and ho may also be formed in this stage since the yield of pmso2 was not always 100 throughout the stage and this will be discussed in detail in the next section experiments with mn vii mn vi mn v or mno2 were conducted to identify the potential reactive mn species in mn vii caso3 process as demonstrated in fig s9a the oxidation of pmso by mno2 was very slow k 1 0 2 0 m 1s 1 thus its possible role in the fast oxidation of pmso was ruled out mn vii alone could oxidize pmso to pmso2 with a second order reaction rate constant of 100 m 1s 1 at ph 5 0 9 0 fig s9b since this reaction is two orders of magnitude slower than the reaction between mn vii and s iv table s1 the rapid transformation of pmso to pmso2 in mn vii caso3 system cannot be mainly caused by mn vii itself the contribution of mn iii can been excluded by the ethanol etoh scavenging experiments as demonstrated in fig s10 in brief etoh is an efficient scavenger for so4 ho buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 mn v and mn vi pode and waters 1956 but it is inert to mn iii drummond and waters 1953 therefore the fact that the addition of 100 mm etoh completely scavenged the oxidation of pmso in mn vii caso3 system indicated that mn iii may not act as an important oxidant herein to further illustrate the possible involvement of mn vi and mn v in mn vii caso3 system the transformation kinetics of pmso in acidified mn vi and mn vii as iii a typical mn v involved system systems were examined over a wide ph range fig s11 in acidified mn vi system disproportionation of mn vi would complete in 1 0 s at ph 8 0 generating mn vii and mno2 as end products fig s12 considering that mn vii could also oxidize pmso to pmso2 we try to discriminate the contribution of mn vii from that of mn vi by determining the removal efficacy of pmso in acidified mn vi system within 1 0 s of reaction using the stopped flow method it turns out 2 2 μm pmso was selectively oxidized to pmso2 in acidified mn vi system mn vi 0 179 mm at final ph of 3 0 while only 0 5 μm pmso was oxidized by 180 μm mn vii within 1 0 s of reaction moreover at ph 11 4 where mn vi disproportionation is negligible in 5 0 s fig s12 the oxidation of pmso within 1 0 s of reaction in acidified mn vi system is still significant these results unraveled that mn vi can rapidly transform pmso to pmso2 in mn vii as iii system mn vii 0 50 μm as iii 0 100 μm mn vii was depleted in milliseconds to generate mno2 as end product but mno2 can hardly oxidize pmso in 1 0 s fig s9a at ph 3 0 about 5 1 μm pmso was oxidized and transformed to pmso2 in mn vii as iii system within 1 0 s of reaction fig s11 verifying the high reactivity of mn v towards pmso at ph 3 0 although negligible pmso was oxidized in mn vii as iii system at ph over 3 0 this may be ascribed to the rapid consumption of mn v by as iii at ph over 3 0 taking together it can be inferred that the predominant reactive mn intermediates responsible for the pmso oxidation in stage i of mn vii caso3 system should be mn v and mn vi indeed since the first step of s iv oxidation is always starting with a one electron transfer step to generate so3 connick et al 1995 mn vii is most likely to be reduced to mn vi firstly when it comes to in contact with s iv then the generated mn vi may react either with contaminants to generate mn iv or with s iv to yield mn v mn vi may also undergo disproportionation to generate mn v and mn vii likewise the generated mn v will react with contaminants or s iv to form mn iii or mn iv respectively during stage ii of the mn vii caso3 process where mn vii has been depleted pmso could still be degraded but the amount of pmso2 in solution kept constant or even decreased with time figs 2 a c similarly independent experiments in the mno2 caso3 system also revealed negligible pmso2 was formed during this process fig 2 d all these results indicated that there should exist some other reactive oxidants different from mn based intermediates e g reactive radicals in the second stage of mn vii caso3 process actually as shown in fig s13 radicals such as so4 and ho their identification was discussed in section 3 2 2 are able to degrade pmso but no pmso2 was generated in addition pmso2 could be oxidized by ho and this reaction should account for the observed slight decomposition of pmso2 in stage ii of mn vii caso3 figs 2 a c the feature that the amount of pmso consumed in mn vii caso3 system decreased with increasing ph is in line with the decreased oxidation efficiency of mn vii na2so3 under alkaline conditions nevertheless another notable feature in fig 2 was that the amount of pmso2 generated in stage i which could represent the contribution of mn v and mn vi to pmso oxidation decreased from 9 35 μm to 1 44 μm as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 while the value dpmso dpmso2 which could represent the amount of pmso oxidized by so4 and ho varied from 4 7 μm to 5 6 μm over ph range of 5 0 9 0 moreover the pmso removal trends in mno2 caso3 system fig 2 d demonstrate that increasing ph did not notably deteriorate the oxidation of pmso in mno2 caso3 process all these results suggested that the inhibiting effect of ph on the overall oxidizing capacity of mn vii caso3 system should be mainly induced by the decreased reactivity of mn v and mn vi in stage i while the contribution of so4 and ho varied slightly within the ph range of 5 0 to 9 0 this point was further illustrated in section 3 3 3 2 2 contribution of so4 and ho as mentioned earlier the facts that the pmso2 yield was less than 100 in stage i and negligible pmso2 was formed in stage ii suggested the involvement of one electron transfer oxidants in both stages in mn vii caso3 system considering the involvement of s species in mn vii caso3 system and that the transformation of s iv under aerobic conditions could produce so4 in principle berglund et al 1993 the generation of so4 and ho derived from so4 was examined in this section to this end nb and ba were selected as the probe compounds nb is inert to most oxidants but could react rapidly with ho while ba is prone to be oxidatively attacked by both ho and so4 table s3 independent experiments have verified that the potential oxidative manganese species in mn vii caso3 process including mn vii mn vi mn v mno2 and mn iii could not oxidize nb and ba under the tested conditions fig s14 fig 3 a shows that significant nb removal could be achieved in both stage i and stage ii in mn vii caso3 system over the tested ph range of 5 0 9 0 suggesting the involvement of ho in both stages it is noteworthy that with ph increased from 7 0 to 9 0 the amount of oxidized nb decreased by 24 in stage i but only by 4 in stage ii these results offer further support to our previous conclusion that the decreased oxidation capacity of mn vii caso3 system under alkaline conditions was mainly ascribed to the dropped oxidation capacity in stage i to explore the generation of so4 alcohol scavenging experiments were carried out using ba and nb as probe organics as shown in fig 3 b tert butanol tba an efficient scavenger for ho but not for so4 table s3 completely suppressed nb transformation with a low dosage 10 mm tba whereas it partially inhibited the transformation of ba from 91 0 mm tba to 51 with 10 mm tba and to 20 with 100 mm tba on the other hand etoh which is able to effectively scavenge both so4 and ho table s3 completely suppressed both nb and ba transformation in the mn vii caso3 system all these results confirmed that both so4 and ho are involved during the mn vii caso3 process since ho are most possibly generated from the reaction between so4 and water or oh r8 in table s1 the concentration of so4 in the mn vii caso3 system should be greater than that of ho to test this point their steady state concentrations in mn vii caso3 system were calculated using nb and ba as probe compounds as depicted in fig 3 c the disappearance of nb and ba in each stage of mn vii caso3 process was simulated with the pseudo first order rate law and the observed rate constants were determined to be 0 0037 s 1 0 0016 s 1 0 0329 s 1 and 0 0122 s 1 respectively then according to eqs 1 2 the steady state concentrations of ho ho ss and so4 so4 ss in stage i 40 s were calculated to be 9 49 10 13 m and 2 66 10 11 m respectively while ho ss and so4 ss in stage ii 40 s were calculated to be 3 72 10 13 m and 9 79 10 12 m respectively these concentrations are comparable to that derived in other optimized advanced oxidation processes where the maximum concentrations of ho and so4 generally fall in the range of 10 12 10 14 m schwarzenbach et al 1993 in addition it turns out the ratios of the steady state concentration of ho to that of so4 i e ho ss so4 ss 100 in stage i and stage ii were only 3 6 and 3 8 respectively these results confirmed that so4 was the precursor of ho in mn vii caso3 system 1 h o ss k obs nb k h o n b 2 so 4 ss k obs ba h o ss k h o ba k so 4 ba here k obs nb and k obs ba were the apparent pseudo first order rate constants for nb and ba removal obtained in this work and k ho reductant and k so4 reductant were the corresponding second order rate constants adopted from previous studies see table s1 and table s3 for specific values 3 2 3 proposed reaction pathways and mechanism collectively the transformation pathways of manganese species and sulfur species in mn vii caso3 system were proposed scheme 1 in general the process of mn vii caso3 is composed of two stages depending on the consumption of mn vii in stage i mn vii reacts rapidly with s iv along with mn vi and so3 generated as primary products mn vi then through a series of reduction reactions with s iv and or self disproportionation gradually transforms to other mn species like mn v mn iv mn iii mno2 and mn ii meanwhile so3 undergoes a series of chain reactions to form so5 so4 and ho sequentially among these intermediate species mn vi mn v so4 and ho are responsible for the oxidation of target contaminants tested in this study once all the added mn vii is consumed the oxidation process advances to the second stage of mno2 caso3 in this stage mno2 is reduced to mn iii by s iv and concomitantly s iv is oxidized to so3 then the reactive oxidants such as so4 and ho are produced it should be noted that depending on the operating conditions mn intermediates like mn iii generated in both stages may be responsible for the removal of some contaminants e g phenolic compounds chen et al 2019 more importantly as an important chain carrier for the s iv chain oxidation process connick and zhang 1996 mn iii may play a critical role for the generation of so4 in both stage i and stage ii as sketched in scheme 1 3 3 effect of s iv dosing rate on contaminants removal by mn vii s iv at various ph levels given that the decontamination behaviors and the two stage oxidation mechanism in the mn vii caso3 system have been successfully identified we tried to use these information to illuminate i why the overall reactivity of mn vii s iv toward contaminants removal declines with increasing ph values and ii why the slow release of s iv from caso3 can increase the oxidation capacity of mn vii s iv 3 3 1 effect of s iv dosing rate on the evolution of radicals using an automatic titrator the influence of na2so3 dosing rate on the ba removal kinetics was investigated at ph 6 0 8 0 by fixing the total dosage of na2so3 being 125 μmol see fig s15 for the removal kinetics of ba fig 4 a shows that the calculated ba removal rates increased progressively with the elevating na2so3 dosing rate at all the investigated ph levels meanwhile the ba removal rates were generally higher at lower ph and the discrepancy among ba removal rates at different ph levels became more pronounced with the increasing s iv dosing rate as mentioned above so4 and ho are responsible for the ba removal therefore the increasing ba removal rate with elevating na2so3 dosing rate indicated that higher na2so3 dosing rates were favorable for fast generation of radicals in the system irrespective of the solution ph however as illustrated in fig 4 b it was interesting to find that although ba removal efficacy at the end of titration kept almost constant 89 92 under varying na2so3 dosing rates 0 83 250 μm s at ph 6 0 it declined notably from 84 89 to 77 86 and to 46 68 when the na2so3 dosing rate increased from 0 83 μm s to 8 33 μm s and to 250 μm s respectively at ph 7 0 and 8 0 this suggested that although radicals can be produced faster with larger na2so3 dosing rates the radicals available for ba degradation were greatly suppressed by large amount of na2so3 in aqueous phase at ph 7 0 in mn vii caso3 system the rate of s iv release from caso3 solids was 4 0 μm s at ph 7 0 8 0 fig s8 therefore the scavenging effect of s iv on the reactive oxidants in the mn vii caso3 system was much less significant than that in the mn vii na2so3 system where s iv was dosed into the working solution instantaneously the influence of ph on the formation of so4 and ho was evaluated at low na2so3 dosing rate 0 83 μm s where the quenching effects of s iv on so4 and ho could be negligible and s iv acts mainly as a precursor it turns out that the ba removal rate decreased in the order of ph 6 0 0 0144 s 1 ph 7 0 0 0042 s 1 ph 8 0 0 0028 s 1 pk a of ba is 4 19 hollingsworth et al 2002 implying that the generation of so4 and ho was favored under acidic conditions in mn vii s iv system however according to the reported rate constants listed in table s1 the transformation rate of so3 2 1 0 0 1 108 m 1s 1 by so5 to so4 is slightly higher than that of hso3 6 0 0 4 107 m 1s 1 furthermore the rate constants of s iv oxidation by mn vii at ph 7 0 1 78 104 m 1s 1 and 8 0 2 65 104 m 1s 1 are slightly larger than that at ph 6 0 1 27 104 m 1s 1 therefore some other reactions should account for the much higher transformation efficiency of s iv to so4 and ho at ph 6 0 than that at ph 7 0 8 0 mn iii besides so5 is another important chain carrier involved in mn vii caso3 process which can oxidize s iv to so3 and initiate the chain reaction berglund et al 1993 it is well documented that mn iii is apt to disproportionate under alkaline conditions to generate mno2 and mn ii connick and zhang 1996 klewicki and morgan 1998 in agreement with our finding that mno2 accumulated significantly at ph 7 0 in mn vii na2so3 system fig s16 furthermore the reactivity of mno2 towards s iv decreased notably with the elevating solution ph fig s16 consequently compared with the scenario under acidic conditions the lower generation rate of radicals under alkaline conditions in mn vii na2so3 system might be associated with the slower oxidation rate of s iv by mn iii and mno2 under alkaline conditions in addition from another perspective the slower s iv transformation under neutral and alkaline conditions would leave more s iv in solution to compete with target contaminants for radicals therefore the increased na2so3 dosing rate severely impaired the apparent oxidation capacity of radical oxidants in the titration system at ph 7 0 as shown in fig 4b 3 3 2 effect of s iv dosing rate on the evolution of reactive mn intermediates since pmso can be oxidized by mn v and mn vi to generate pmso2 pmso was taken as the probe molecular in this section to examine the influence of na2so3 dosing rates on the contribution of reactive manganese species in mn vii na2so3 system the pmso transformation profiles in mn vii na2so3 system with varying na2so3 dosing rates were determined fig s17 and the corresponding pmso loss and pmso2 generation values were summarized in fig 5 it was found that at each ph value tested the amount of pmso2 generated changed slightly with varying na2so3 dosing rates which suggested that the amounts of s iv excessive in solution did not exhibit significant influence on the evolution of reactive mn intermediates this phenomenon was different from that of ba decomposition at varying na2so3 dosing rates furthermore regardless of the varying na2so3 dosing rates both the pmso consumption and pmso2 generation declined with the increasing ph fig 5 implying high ph levels could inhibit the formation or the reactivity of mn intermediates as mentioned above and shown in fig s16 mn vii could readily react with s iv under the tested ph values thus the increasing ph may not affect the generation of mn vi and mn v remarkably in mn vii s iv system alternatively it is more likely that the declined reactivity of mn vi and mn v account for the decreased the pmso2 generation at high ph values indeed that both mn v and mn vi are more effective in oxidizing organics under acidic conditions has been verified in this study fig s11 and also been reported by previous studies záhonyi budó and simándi 1994 and 1995 taken together due to the decreased reactivity of mn intermediates i e mn vi mn v mno2 and mn iii at high ph values it is inefficient to degrade contaminants directly by these mn intermediates themselves or to trigger the generation of s centered radicals by mn iii and mno2 under environmentally relevant conditions moreover although s iv is essential for radical formation excess s iv can also quench the generated radicals and further deteriorate the decontamination performance of mn vii s iv system hence from another perspective the slow supply of s iv from caso3 could alleviate the scavenging effect of s iv on radicals thereby enhancing the oxidation capacity of mn vii s iv system 4 conclusion the present study systematically evaluated the feasibility of applying caso3 as a slow release source of s iv to activate mn vii for organic contaminants removal under environmentally relevant conditions generally it was found that mn vii caso3 system could effectively degrade organic contaminants over a wide ph range of 5 0 9 0 more importantly at ph 7 0 mn vii caso3 system performed much better than mn vii na2so3 system in terms of contaminants removal efficiency and residual mn highlighting its applicability in real water treatment due to the rapid consumption of mn vii the overall process of mn vii caso3 could be divided into two stages mn vii caso3 stage and mno2 caso3 stage and the contribution of the second stage to contaminants removal became more pronounced at high ph values with respect to the reactive oxidants responsible for contaminants removal both radicals and reactive mn species were determined to be involved in mn vii caso3 system furthermore by changing the na2so3 dosing rate it was found that excess s iv could scavenge the generated free radicals especially under alkaline conditions but it exhibited little influence on the evolution of reactive mn intermediates it was thus reasonable to conclude that the slow release of s iv from caso3 could minimize the competition of s iv with contaminants for radicals and thus improve the decontamination performance at high ph values all these results not only shed new insights into the mechanisms of mn vii s iv process but also are helpful to facilitate the real application of this technology mn v and mn vi were identified as reactive manganese species in mn vii caso3 system but their reactivity and individual contributions to the oxidation of different contaminants deserve further investigation moreover we will make more efforts to provide direct evidences for the contributions of mn vi and mn v in mn vii s iv system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
