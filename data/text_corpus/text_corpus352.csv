1760,in cold regions climate warming is causing permafrost to thaw which modifies the dynamics of groundwater flow from a local system constrained by frozen ground to a regional system of interconnected aquifers under the assumption presented in brutsaert 2005 the recession slope of an arctic catchment hydrograph is linearly related to permafrost thawing depth the recession analysis of arctic river flow may therefore reflect permafrost thawing dynamics in areas where permafrost observations are rare recession analysis appears as a valuable method to be exploited since there are extensive datasets of river discharge for the arctic with an exceptionally large temporal and spatial coverage yet it has been shown that the linear relationship between recession slope and permafrost thaw depth may be complicated by the extent of the permafrost the landscape topography as well as the hydraulic properties of the aquifer the integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model hydrogeosphere hgs is used here to account for hydrological complexifications and mechanisms involved when permafrost extent decreases and landscape hillslope increases previous modeling studies have already tested the impacts of these factors on the hydrological signature of arctic catchments however few have been able to 1 simulate permafrost extent catchment hillslope and the resulting groundwater flowpaths in three dimensions 2 distinguish the impact of permafrost thawing in extent from those of permafrost thawing in thickness and 3 represent the connection between surface and subsurface with a coupled approach these assets allow to conclude that river tàlik development and valley incision both clearly increase the vertical connectivity of the subsurface flowpaths as well as the non linearity of the reservoir the flexibility and the realism of hgs model allow to compare the modeling outputs with the dynamics of 336 real catchments from the arctic the comparison corroborates our results below continuous assumptions behind brutsaert conceptual model are not verified and it is no longer possible to relate recession constant to permafrost thaw depth finally this study gives the keys to start elaborating on the recession analysis method to be able to relate the hydrological signature of arctic rivers to permafrost thawing rate in any type of permafrost extent and catchment topography keywords arctic hydrology recession analysis thawing permafrost active layer thickening numerical modeling isshm data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction quantifying and forecasting permafrost dynamics in space and time is a major scientific challenge for arctic regions that are impacted by the polar amplification of climate change even if the environmental consequences of permafrost thawing induced by climate warming are known and documented quantifying the thawing rate at a fine spatial scale remains a challenge for poorly instrumented regions such as the arctic river discharge data appear to be a valuable source of information the brutsaert conceptual model 2005 presented in more detail in section 2 3 is based on a simplified representation of unconfined aquifers and assumes a linear relationship between the recession slope of a river hydrograph and the permafrost thawing depth based on this conceptual model many arctic studies have used a recession slope analysis for arctic rivers e g lyon and destouni 2010 sjöberg et al 2013 ploum et al 2019 sergeant et al 2021 to assess permafrost thawing rates at the catchment scale however it has been shown that the extent of the permafrost evans et al 2020 the climatic conditions hinzman et al 2020 the landscape topography tananaev and lotsari 2022 as well as the hydraulic properties of the catchment ploum et al 2019 may invalidate brutsaert conceptual model 2005 a multifactor analysis of the recession behavior of 336 arctic catchments sergeant et al 2021 corroborates the above findings and reveals that the applicability of the brutsaert conceptual model 2005 is limited to supra permafrost conditions only factors that typically result from permafrost thawing such as permafrost extent loss subsurface permeability increase or catchment hillslope increase are found to limit the capacity of the recession analysis to reflect the permafrost dynamic of a catchment sergeant et al 2021 associated these limitations to the non linear behaviors of the reservoir that may invalidate brutsaert s conceptual model 2005 the mechanisms responsible for non linear behaviors are the increase of hydrologic connectivity the increase of flow path diversity and the multiplication of the contributing drainage area there is therefore a need to assess the impact of the factors and mechanisms mentioned by sergeant et al 2021 on the catchment recession behavior and to understand how they could be included into the brutsaert conceptual model 2005 the objective of this simulation study is to meet this need to allow future use of river flow observations to reflect permafrost dynamics at the catchment scale a trade off between the simplicity of brutsaert conceptual model 2005 and the realism of permafrost dominated catchment is found to be able to detect behaviors that invalidate brutsaert conceptual model 2005 to this end simulations start with an integrated surface subsurface hydrologic model isshm of a synthetic permafrost dominated catchment as close as possible to brutsaert 2005 assumptions then modifications of the extent of the permafrost the hydraulic properties of the subsurface and of the catchment hillslope are explored isshm such as catchment hydrology cathy camporese et al 2010 mike she long et al 2015 hydrogeosphere aquanty 2022 or parflow kuffour et al 2020 are capable of simulating surface subsurface water flow at the catchment scale in a single three dimensional framework and have proven to be theoretically aesthetically and computationally more satisfying than externally and iteratively coupled approaches to reproduce highly nonlinear rainfall responses panday and huyakorn 2004 the advantages of isshm to simulate the behavior of arctic catchments in a context of thawing permafrost are the following first unlike several studies that are based on one or two dimensional models and restrict flow paths and reduction in permafrost extent to one direction only mckenzie et al 2007 voss and provost 2010 painter 2011 soetaert and meysman 2012 isshm allows for three dimensional simulations a 3 d model has the advantage of 1 being more representative of real catchments and flowpath geometries 2 accounting for reduction in permafrost extent in all three directions and 3 enabling to test the impact of slope changes in the x and y directions which has been proven to activate different hydrological processes park et al 2011 isshm also offers larger panels of less constraining boundary conditions for the river outlet which is typically limited to a single constant head boundary condition for other types of models bense et al 2012 frampton et al 2013 kurylyk et al 2014 evans and ge 2017 evans et al 2018 lamontagne hallé et al 2018 hinzman et al 2022 this is a crucial asset considering that choosing an appropriate combination of boundary conditions to represent at best the reality is a persistent challenge in the modeling of cold regions groundwater dynamics sanford 2002 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 finally the insight gained from the simulations on catchment behavior is then compared with the behavior of the 336 arctic catchments analyzed in sergeant et al 2021 2 data and methods 2 1 the numerical model and base case representation of the catchment the isshm selected for the simulations is hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2022 which is a physically based numerical model that simulates coupled three dimensional subsurface and two dimensional surface water flow variably saturated subsurface flow is represented by richards equation in three dimensions while surface flow is represented by the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equations with the assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution in the vertical direction and depth averaged flow velocities in the two other directions for the base case the model domain is an 80 m long and 18 m wide three dimensional catchment fig 1 although it can be considered as a synthetic catchment for the purpose of our simulations it is based on a catchment located in ontario canada and investigated by abdul and gillham 1989 the catchment is in a low relief area covered by grassy land and underlain by a shallow sandy aquifer abdul and gillham 1989 conducted a rainfall runoff field experiment in the catchment where the flow behavior of the system is governed by infiltration in upland regions discharge in lower regions and runoff vanderkwaak 1999 used a coupled surface and subsurface flow model to reproduce streamflow measured by abdul and gillham 1989 the abdul and gillham 1989 is also used as a verification example of the capabilities of the hgs model for three dimensional surface subsurface flow simulations the abdul and gillham 1989 catchment is chosen here for its simplicity that allows to start with the behavior of a synthetic catchment and to easily simulate derived scenarios that detect the behaviors of diverse types of permafrost dominated catchments a triangular mesh is first generated to represent the catchment extent in the horizontal x and y directions the mesh is then duplicated in the vertical z direction to generate 3d triangular prism elements three hydrostratigraphic units are represented in the model with permafrost and aquifer thicknesses typical of the umiujaq region of northern canada lemieux et al 2020 the first unit is the supra permafrost sand aquifer assumed to represent the active layer which extends from ground surface down to a depth of 1 m for simplicity we refer to this unit as the shallow aquifer in the following text the second unit located below the shallow aquifer is the permafrost and has a thickness of 20 m the third unit is a sand aquifer located sub permafrost and whose thickness is 10 m for simplicity we refer to this unit as the deeper aquifer in the following text the shallow aquifer is discretized vertically with 5 sub layers of 3d elements each having a uniform thickness of 0 2 m the permafrost is discretized vertically with 15 sub layers of 3d elements whose thickness is finer close to the shallow aquifer and then increases to reach a maximum value of 4 4 m near the bottom at the contact with the deeper aquifer the deeper aquifer is discretized with 5 sub layers of 3d elements each having a uniform thickness of 2 m the elevation of the top of the mesh is adjusted to follow the surface topography the approximately 50 000 m2 catchment is discretized with 86 675 nodes and 167 525 triangular prism elements both shallow and deeper aquifers have similar properties and consist of homogeneous sand with an isotropic hydraulic conductivity of 10 5 m s permafrost is represented as a unit having a low isotropic hydraulic conductivity of 10 14 m s the properties of the thawed permafrost correspond to those of both aquifers the hydraulic properties of the subsurface and the surface roughness coefficients are provided in table 1 the saturation pressure head and relative permeability saturation relationships for the sand aquifers are those of the borden sand described in vanderkwaak 1999 and in the hgs verification manual aquanty 2022 flow through macropores present in unsaturated frozen or partially frozen permafrost e g mackay 1983 boike et al 1998 scherler et al 2010 are neglected here for the sake of simplicity the slope of the ground surface is 2 in the x direction and 9 in the y direction a river channel is located in the central portion of the catchment river flows in the direction of the increasing x coordinate and the river outlet is located at the right hand boundary of the catchment fig 1 a critical depth boundary condition for the surface water flow domain is assigned to the outlet where the water depth is equal to the critical depth cd and the volumetric discharge per unit width is given by g cd 3 aquanty 2022 where g is the gravitational acceleration constant a no flow boundary is assigned to the bottom of the domain which is deep enough to reach unfractured bedrock or any layer in which the permeability is too low to produce any significant groundwater flow compared to the above layers lamontagne hallé et al 2020 the lateral boundaries of the domain for the shallow aquifer and for the permafrost are assumed impermeable for groundwater flow however a larger scale groundwater flow component is assumed for the deeper aquifer this component is generated by imposing a constant incoming flux of 5 56 10 7 m s at the left boundary of the deeper aquifer at 0 m and a constant head of 2 78 m at the right boundary following abdul and gillham 1989 fig 1 the set of boundary conditions generates groundwater flow in the deeper aquifer in the direction of the increasing x axis which is similar to the direction of streamflow at the surface for all simulations the water table everywhere in the catchment is initially located 22 cm below ground surface a rainfall event is simulated by applying to the surface domain a rainfall rate of 5 56 10 6 m s i e 20 mm hr for a one hour stress period followed by a 3 hour period without any rainfall adaptive time stepping is used with an initial time step size of 0 5 s a maximum time step size of 100 s and time step incrementing and decrementing factor limits of 8 0 and 0 5 respectively an absolute convergence criterion of 10 3 m is used for the newton raphson iterative solution of the nonlinear flow equations a dual node approach was used to couple surface and subsurface flow and the flow coupling term between the surface and the subsurface meshes is equal to 10 1 m length a rill storage height of 2 10 3 m is used for the surface flow domain the reader is referred to the hgs manual for further details on the governing equations and solution methods aquanty 2022 2 2 scenarios 2 2 1 scenario a the base case scenario a shown in fig 1 and described above corresponds to a simple continuous permafrost catchment where a one meter shallow aquifer discharges into a river because permafrost is continuous the shallow aquifer and the deeper aquifer are hydraulically disconnected and the deeper aquifer does not contribute to baseflow in the stream to simulate the impact of the active layer thickening on the storage discharge relationship the thickness of the shallow aquifer or active layer which is 1 m for the base case is then modified a range of constant thicknesses ranging from 0 4 to 3 m is assigned for a series of simulations doing so we assess the validity of the linear relationship between the aquifer thickness and the resulting recession slope of the outflow hydrograph assumed by brutsaert 2005 for all simulations the active layer is sub divided into 5 layers of elements having a uniform thickness the permafrost remains continuous over the catchment and only the shallow aquifer contributes to streamflow 2 2 2 scenarios b and c for scenarios b and c the base case is modified to investigate the impact of thawing permafrost on the hydrological system for the rainfall event described in section 2 1 the thawing of the permafrost is not simulated numerically but investigated indirectly by imposing different spatial configurations of permafrost for the simulations for scenario b illustrated in fig 2 the extent of permafrost is reduced in the x direction down to isolated patches of permafrost that cover less than 10 of the catchment for scenario c illustrated in fig 3 the permafrost extent is reduced in the y direction first below the river channel down to the deep aquifer then the reduction in permafrost extent is extended laterally as mentioned previously it is assumed that the thawed permafrost has the same hydraulic properties as the two aquifers scenarios b and c result in two sets of 16 scenarios with permafrost coverage ranging from 0 to 100 of the catchment area the scenarios are labelled cont100 disc95 disc90 disc85 disc80 disc70 disc65 disc60 disc50 spo45 spo40 spo30 spo25 spo20 spo15 and iso10 where letters indicate the type of permafrost extent continuous discontinuous sporadic and isolated and numbers indicate the percent of the catchment area underlain by permafrost finally to test the impact the thickness of the shallow aquifer on brutsaert conceptual model 2005 validity for permafrost extents ranging from continuous to sporadic the thickness of the shallow aquifer is modified with values ranging from 0 4 to 3 m for both scenarios b and c 2 2 3 scenarios d and e for scenarios d and e illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 the catchment hillslope is increased to up to 24 and 30 in x and y directions respectively resulting in two sets of 11 and 10 scenarios this spectrum of watershed hillslopes allows to simulate a large swath of permafrost landscapes that range from low coastal plains slope lower than 5 to mountainous peaks slope greater than 15 that are shown to influence the impact of permafrost thawing on the storage discharge relationship sergeant et al 2021 tananaev and lotsari 2022 o connor et al 2019 the two sets of scenarios are tested for every type of permafrost extent described previously for scenarios b and c to investigate the mechanisms behind the coupling effect of permafrost thawing and topography gradient on the hydrological system for scenarios b to e permafrost reduction and modifications to topography create hydraulic connections between the shallow and the deeper aquifers we assume that because of these new hydraulic connections it takes 14 h before groundwater flow reaches equilibrium therefore for those scenarios a second rainfall event of 5 56 10 6 m s is applied to the surface for one hour 14 h after the first rainfall event occurs 2 3 recession curve analysis the recession curve analysis quantifies the storage discharge relationship of a catchment the conceptual model for the recession flow analysis is based on brutsaert 2005 who developed a one dimensional long term solution based on the linearization of boussinesq equation 1 1 h t k n d x h h x where h is hydraulic head k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and nd is its drainable porosity the brutsaert 2005 conceptual model assumes that the aquifer i is unconfined and initially fully saturated ii responds to a precipitation event by generating an 1d horizontal outflow q into the adjoining river and iii has a linear reservoir behavior i e its drawdown is small relative to its saturated thickness d under these assumptions the river discharge q can be computed with linearized equation 2 and its recession constant α can be related to the average aquifer thickness d by equation 3 2 q t q 0 exp α t where q is the outflow m3 s per unit length of river m to the river directly related to the volumetric discharge of the river q m3 s and q 0 is the initial outflow at the start of the recession the decay rate α in equation 2 represents a characteristic storage delay in the catchment called recession constant 3 α π 2 k c d 4 n d b 2 where c is a constant adjusted to compensate for the linearization of boussinesq equation and d is the average aquifer thickness the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer k the drainable porosity of the aquifer nd and the extent of the drainage system b are assumed to remain homogeneous and unchanged for the recession analysis of our base case catchment we applied a methodology similar to that detailed in sergeant et al 2021 we use records of simulated discharge q m3 s at the stream outlet over 4 h with a rainfall event occurring during the first hour of simulation periods of rising streamflow and a 30 minute period following the hydrograph peak are not considered for the analysis since they are likely influenced by rainfall the 30 minute period τ is adopted in agreement with equation 4 linsley et al 1975 and the catchment dimensions 4 τ 0 827 a 0 2 where τ is the time in days before recession starts after a peak and a is the catchment area in km2 which is equal to 5 10 3 km2 in our study flow recession d q d t is defined as the difference in discharge between two successive simulated discharges with d q d t q t q t d t d t the average discharge q av over a period of 100 s was defined as q av q t q t d t 2 values of d q d t versus q av in log log space were fitted with the following linear least square regression equation using the ordinary least squares function seabold et al 2010 5 ln dq dt ln α b ln q av the value of coefficient b in equation 5 is an indication of the linearity of the reservoir drainage troch et al 2013 with a value of 1 confirming the linearity assumption brutsaert 2005 of equations 2 and 3 for scenarios where catchments having different thicknesses d of their shallow aquifer are simulated the associated recession parameter α was obtained while fitting the simulated river discharge q to equation 5 and assuming b 1 the resulting d α relationship allows to test the validity of equation 3 which assumes a linear reservoir then to test the applicability of the linear reservoir assumption the value of parameter b is not set equal to 1 but rather estimated by calculating the slope of equation 5 using an approach similar to that of hinzman et al 2020 we relate the estimated coefficient b to the permafrost extent topography gradient and the hydraulic conductivity of the catchment in order to quantify the influence of those factors on reservoir linearity for scenarios with a deeper aquifer b to e the same methodology is applied to river discharges but that time to the second rainfall event which starts at t 14 h after flow in the aquifer has reached equilibrium 3 results the main outputs of the simulations for scenarios a to e are i the values of the hydrograph recession constant α which tests the applicability of equation 3 ii the values of parameter b resulting from the recession analysis which informs on the linear behavior of the reservoir and iii the simulated subsurface darcy flux q q x q y q z which illustrates groundwater flow direction and reveals the mechanisms behind the various behaviors 3 1 validity of the base case scenario a fig 6 a shows the hydrograph associated with each active layer thickness scenario on which the recession analysis is processed the discharge peak decreases from 8x10 3 m s to 3x10 3 m s as the active layer thickness increases indicating that the subsurface storage capacity increases with the aquifer thickening the recession analysis which assumed reservoir linearity for each simulation of scenario a is shown in fig 6b for the analysis parameter b is set equal to 1 in order to calculate the recession constant α fig 7 a shows for each simulated active layer thickness d the related parameter α resulting from the recession analysis described in fig 6b to test the linearity of the d α relationship a linear least square regression and its associated coefficient of determination r2 are added to fig 7a the regression confirms the applicability of equation 3 for the simulated catchment as parameter α increases linearly with the active layer thickness d with r2 0 99 the same trend is observed for α when running scenario a with other materials such as clay or gravel results not shown here simulations from scenario a allow to confirm the applicability of the brutsaert conceptual model for a flat catchment underlain by continuous permafrost recession was analyzed again but this time without fixing a value of b equal 1 but letting it vary the range of b values in that case is shown in fig 7b the median value of b is 1 10 and its maximum is 1 36 which remains close to the linear value of 1 confirming the assumption of a linear reservoir for all active layer thickness scenarios 3 2 reduction in permafrost extent and thickness 3 2 1 scenario b scenario b reduces the permafrost extent in the x direction while increasing the static thickness of the active layer and performs recession analysis for each simulated hydrograph by increasing the static thickness of the active layer by 20 cm from one simulation to the other scenario b tends to reflect the process of active layer thickening in different contexts of permafrost extent first fig 8 a shows the evolution of the recession constant α with the active layer thickness d when the permafrost coverage of the catchment reduces in the x direction from 100 to 80 60 then 20 the recession constant α is calculated assuming b 1 in equation 5 it results that for continuous permafrost marked with circles on fig 8a the recession constant α increases linearly with d with r2 0 99 when the underlying permafrost is discontinuous marked with triangles on fig 8a or sporadic marked with crosses on fig 8a the recession constant α decreases linearly with d with r2 0 98 0 99 then parameter b from equation 5 is no longer fixed equal to 1 but calculated permafrost extent of the catchment and its related b value are plotted in fig 8b results indicate that b generally increases when permafrost coverage decreases with the highest b increase occurring between simulation disc90 and disc85 above 90 of permafrost extent b values remain below 1 45 but exceed 1 54 as soon as permafrost extent reduces to 45 these results confirm the applicability of equation 3 which linearly relates parameters α and d for continuous permafrost only if permafrost coverage gets lower than 85 parameter b exceeds 1 5 fig 8b and equation 3 is no longer valid as α decreases while d increases fig 8a the computed darcy flux q q x q y q z in the subsurface are integrated into streamtraces that illustrate subsurface flowpaths shown in fig 9 for simulations disc60 and spo20 after the rainfall event for both simulations the deeper aquifer is saturated and the direction of groundwater flow indicated by darcy flux streamtraces show vertical flow from the deeper aquifer towards the shallow aquifer for disc60 the river edge is not saturated and the deeper aquifer is connected to the surface at three different locations through corridors of high hydraulic conductivity in spo20 the river edge is fully saturated downstream with a 40 m wide corridor of tortuous fluxes between deeper and shallow aquifers at the outlet and more connections all along the length of the catchment 3 2 2 scenario c the recession analysis for scenario c which reduces permafrost extent in the y direction by expanding the unfrozen zones below the river channel is performed for each simulated hydrograph fig 10 a which assumes b equals to 1 shows the evolution of recession constant α with the active layer thickness d when the permafrost coverage of the catchment reduces from 100 to 80 60 then 20 it results that for continuous permafrost the recession constant α increases linearly with d with r2 0 99 when the underlying permafrost is discontinuous or sporadic the recession constant α decreases linearly with d with r2 0 97 0 98 fig 10b shows the evolution of parameter b calculated from equation 5 for permafrost extent lower than 100 as soon as permafrost coverage is lower than 100 b moves and stays away from its lowest value of 1 4 between simulation disc95 and disc65 b values slightly increase then from simulations disc65 to spo10 b decreases but remains greater than 1 5 these results confirm the applicability of equation 3 which linearly relates parameters α and d for continuous permafrost only if permafrost coverage gets lower than 100 parameter b exceeds 1 5 fig 10b and equation 3 is no longer valid as α decreases while d increases fig 10a on fig 11 the location of the unfrozen zone blue shape are drawn and the subsurface darcy fluxes q q x q y q z are integrated into streamtraces to show groundwater flowpaths below the riverbed for simulations disc60 and spo20 after the rainfall event the subsurface darcy fluxes q q x q y q z are illustrated in yellow for vertical cross sections of the catchments along the y z plane and at x 2 10 40 and 60 m for disc60 at x 2 m the ground is frozen below the riverbed and there are no connections between the shadow and deep aquifers groundwater flow remains horizontal at x 40 m the unfrozen zone extends from the riverbed to the top of the deeper aquifer and connections between deeper and shallow aquifers are created darcy fluxes in the deeper aquifer tend to be vertical all along the unfrozen corridor for spo20 similar trends are observed with increasing curvature of the darcy flux vectors 3 3 impact of hillslope gradient 3 3 1 scenario d fig 12 shows parameter b computed for the 11 catchments with hillslope gradients in the x direction ranging from 2 to 24 the simulations have been run for 5 different permafrost extents cont100 disc80 disc60 spo40 and spo20 when permafrost extent exceeds 60 parameter b increases with the gradient of the hillslope when permafrost is sporadic or isolated i e permafrost extent below 50 the correlation between hillslope gradient and parameter b is not as clear as parameter b rapidly reaches values above 6 3 3 2 scenario e fig 13 shows parameter b computed for 10 catchments with valley gradients in the y direction ranging from 9 to 30 simulations have been run for 5 different permafrost extents cont100 disc80 disc60 spo40 and spo20 the correlation between valley gradient and parameter b is clear for any type of permafrost the steeper the valley is the higher parameter b gets while never reaching 5 for simulation cont100 the impact of catchment steepness on b values is even more prominent compared to lower permafrost extent catchments implying that catchment valley gradient may have a stronger impact on catchment linearity than permafrost extent 4 discussion 4 1 the advantages of our model the first advantage of our model is its ability to represent three dimensional groundwater flow in the catchment this 3d representation allows 1 to simulate the geometry of thawed permafrost more realistically and 2 to visualize the simulated flowpaths to understand the hydrological mechanisms involved first we were able to distinguish impacts on the catchment s hydrological signature that are associated with permafrost decrease in thickness scenario a from impacts associated with permafrost decrease in extent scenarios b and c scenario a does not alter the linearity of the reservoir and the brutsaert conceptual model remains applicable whereas for scenarios b and c the value of b shifts away from 1 as soon as permafrost extent decreases and the reservoir is no longer linear scenarios a b and c confirm that it is possible to infer annual rates of active layer thickening from the increase in recession slope α as long as the permafrost extent remains continuous below 100 of permafrost coverage the relation between α and d described in equation 3 is not valid secondly we were able to simulate more realistically the reduction in permafrost extent in most previous model applications in 2d the permafrost extent is reduced such as done for scenario b with permafrost coverage decreasing from continuous layers to sparse patches that extend along the x direction only which is the direction of the stream with scenario c the hgs model allows us to represent the decrease in permafrost extent in all three dimensions by expanding the unfrozen zones below the riverbed this representation is closer to real world permafrost degradation which is known to preferentially degrade beneath surface water bodies due to the high heat capacity of river water that freezes only at the river surface in winter walvoord and kurylyk 2016 these unfrozen zones are called river tàliks french 2018 once subsurface water flowpaths become connected through river tàliks advection can potentially add to the transfer of heat and accelerate thaw enlarging the tàlik beneath rivers rowland et al 2011 wellman et al 2013 as shown in fig 11 as soon as the river tàlik allows for a connection between the shallow and deeper aquifers open tàlik b values jump from 1 4 to 1 6 and the non linearity of the reservoir increases gradually with the expansion of the open tàlik likewise hgs allows for more realistic simulations of hillslope gradients like scenario d previous 2d model applications used to simulate hillslope increases in the x direction only these simulations are relevant when the slope of the river catchment gets steeper yet it does not account for other increases in the landscape slope scenario e adds another dimension to hillslope simulation as it increases the slope in the direction perpendicular to the river channel this additional scenario allows the simulation of more incised valley which has been shown to activate various hydrological processes park et al 2011 an increase in valley gradient clearly leads to an increase in parameter b causing the reservoir to move away from linearity the influence of valley gradient on reservoir linearity seems to even exceed the influence of permafrost extent reduction fig 13 third 3d visualisation of darcy fluxes fig 9 and fig 11 indicates that the non linearity of the reservoir is expressed by 1 groundwater flow connections between deep and shallow aquifers through intra permafrost unfrozen zones and 2 more vertical and tortuous flow components in both sub intra and supra permafrost aquifers indeed brutsaert 2005 conceptual model does not account for these flow paths as it is a solution to the 1d boussinesq equation that assumes that groundwater flow is horizontal and occurs only in the active layer finally hgs enables to simulate surface water and river flow with more realism it is a crucial asset considering that river hydrograph is central in recession analysis first hgs allows to integrate surface with subsurface flow which avoids the need to either neglect surface flow or create an artificial boundary condition to account for its interactions with the subsurface then while most previous model applications represent the river outlet as constant head or specified pressure hgs offers larger panels of less constraining boundary condtions for the river outlet such as the critical depth boundary used here 4 2 comparison with real catchments because our 3d model provides more flexibility in the representation of a catchment geometry and its boundary conditions our simulations are deemed more representative of a real catchment than the brutsaert conceptual model 2005 it is therefore possible to compare our simulation outputs with the hydrological behaviors from the 336 catchments analysed in sergeant et al 2021 with the recession analysis method described in sergeant et al 2021 we show the evolution of both parameter b and changes in recession constant δ α over 1970 2000 with permafrost extent and catchment hillslope the catchments are partitioned into continuous discontinuous sporadic isolated based on map from brown et al 2002 and into catchments of gentle hillslope such as taiga or tundra plateau and catchments of moderate hillslope such as mountain forests or alpine tundra based on map from olson et al 2001 fig 14 a shows lower b values for continuous permafrost with a median value equal to 1 2 while the median of b for catchments with lower extent of permafrost can reach 1 5 the greatest increase of parameter b is between continuous and discontinuous permafrost extents when the permafrost extent decreases further the trend in the value of b is decreasing these results corroborate both scenario b and c where the largest increase of b occurs between continuous and discontinuous simulations fig 8b and fig 10b yet beyond discontinuous permafrost the trend of b values for real catchments is closer to scenario c than b fig 14b shows higher b values for catchments of moderate hillslope topography with a median of 1 4 this confirms the trend observed in scenario e where b values are higher for catchments with hillslope gradient above 10 sergeant et al 2021 assume that permafrost is thawing over 1970 2020 and that the thickness of the active layer d increases as a result fig 15 shows that the assumed thickening of the active layer induces increasing recession slopes δα 0 as long as the permafrost extent remains continuous for permafrost extent less than continuous the opposite trend is observed and the recession slope decreases δα 0 with the assumed thickening of the active layer for these catchments equation 3 that relates changes in α and changes in d is not valid these results are consistent with those from scenario b and c where recession constant α increases with d only if permafrost coverage is 100 the unclear pattern for α parameter for permafrost extent below discontinuous might be explained by inaccuracies in the brown et al 2002 map that is used to partition the catchment dataset 4 3 limitations this study simulates the behavior of homogeneous catchments where only two different materials each with a uniform hydraulic conductivity are considered one for permeable aquifers and one for nearly impermeable permafrost permafrost thawing is though related to thermokarst formations such as closed tàlik ice wedges pingos palsas or peat plateaux that are known to locally modify the catchment hydraulic properties the surface topography and the position of the frost table while brutsaert s conceptual model 2005 assumes homogeneous hydraulic conductivity of the catchment other models such as rupp and selker 2006 relax this assumption allowing instead the hydraulic conductivity to vary with depth as a power law and reveal the impact of heterogeneous conductivity on the drainage characteristics besides micro topography relief in the surface catchment have shown to control subsurface flows creating depressions that have to be filled before water can spill over to generate flow downslope frei and fleckenstein 2014 boico 2022 and the permafrost environment is no exception to this behavior in a similar manner the distribution of the frost table depth has shown to influence lateral subsurface flow converging to frost table depressions tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wright et al 2009 while attractive in its simplicity brutsaert s conceptual model 2005 does not account for heterogeneities that have proven to influence the drainage of permafrost catchments and thus contributes to model uncertainty refsgaard et al 2012 it would be beneficial to conduct simulations and field based experiments that would include the above mentioned features essential to permafrost catchment behavior the analytical solution presented in brutsaert 2005 reaches its limits when the permafrost extent is not continuous and when the catchment hillslope is too high for large values of hillslope topography the effect of advection overwhelms the diffusion and boussinesq equation is modified to account for the gradient hillslope for scenarios d and e analytical solutions to nonlinear boussinesq equation for sloping aquifer daly and porporato 2004 bartlett and porporato 2018 kinematic wave approximation of henderson and wooding 1964 or other sloping aquifer models see review in rupp and selker 2006 should be considered for the interpretation of our simulation results besides for catchments where the permafrost extent is not continuous and equation 2 is not valid types of reservoirs different from linear such as exponential reservoirs bogaart et al 2016 brauer et al 2013 or hyperbolic reservoirs troch et al 2013 kirchner 2009 which assume b 2 and b 2 respectively hinzman et al 2020 should be tested finally for those catchments it would be interesting to check the applicability of non linear forms of boussinesq equations such as those presented by polubarinova kochina 1962 lockington 1997 or rupp and selker 2005 on both simulated and real catchment behavior 4 4 perspectives it would be worthwhile to refine the characterisation of permafrost extent and hillslope gradient of real catchments for example by using satellite images of the ground such information would improve the comparison of simulated and observed hydrological responses and help calibrate our numerical model based on these comparisons besides the simulation of the active layer thickening could be improved with hgs s pore water freeze thaw module from schilling et al 2019 this module could be adapted to simulate long term active layer thickening resulting from permafrost thawing from the top in scenario a b and c long term active layer thickening is simulated by increasing the constant thickness of the active layer by 20 cm from one simulation to the other the integration of schilling et al 2019 module would allow better comparisons between scenarios a b c and real catchment observations from fig 15 however activating the freeze thaw module in hgs increases simulation times significantly and it would be challenging to investigate the same number of scenarios as presented here the flexibility provided by hgs adaptable modules allows to bring more realism to our model it could also be used to test other factors such vegetation or snow cover by incorporating the evaporation module accordingly besides the hydraulic mixing cell approach incorporated in hgs partington et al 2011 which informs on the origin of the discharging water could complement our understanding of the hydrological mechanisms involved as shown for example in glaser et al 2021 5 conclusion the simulations confirm conclusions from previous studies evans et al 2020 sergeant et al 2021 tananaev and lotsari 2022 hinzman et al 2022 that are based on observations of real catchment hydrographs and 2d simulations permafrost extent and catchment hillslope influence the linearity of the reservoir and limit the applicability of brutsaert 2005 conceptual model for recession analysis besides decrease in permafrost extent creates connections and vertical flowpaths between shallow and deeper aquifers which are not considered in the brutsaert 2005 analytical solution a three dimensional representation of the subsurface as well as flexible boundary conditions and surface subsurface integration that better reflect the river behavior bring more realism to the simulated catchment the complexity of the 3d model allows to visualize the mechanisms involved and compare our simulations with real catchment behavior the comparison validates conclusions made based on simulations as soon as permafrost extent shifts from continuous to discontinuous the non linearity of the reservoir increases and equation 3 is not valid this pattern is amplified for mountainous catchments however when the permafrost extent is less than discontinuous the comparison is not straight forward and improvements are pointed out to better characterize the permafrost extent and the hillslope of real catchments besides as improvements we suggest to use hgs integrable modules to either test the impact of other factors visualize the origin of the discharging water or simulate the long term thickening of the active layer again the flexibility of hgs model which can integrate evaporation hydraulic mixing cell or pore water freeze thaw modules would help simulate even more realistic behavior of permafrost dominated catchments credit authorship contribution statement f sergeant conceptualization methodology

1760,in cold regions climate warming is causing permafrost to thaw which modifies the dynamics of groundwater flow from a local system constrained by frozen ground to a regional system of interconnected aquifers under the assumption presented in brutsaert 2005 the recession slope of an arctic catchment hydrograph is linearly related to permafrost thawing depth the recession analysis of arctic river flow may therefore reflect permafrost thawing dynamics in areas where permafrost observations are rare recession analysis appears as a valuable method to be exploited since there are extensive datasets of river discharge for the arctic with an exceptionally large temporal and spatial coverage yet it has been shown that the linear relationship between recession slope and permafrost thaw depth may be complicated by the extent of the permafrost the landscape topography as well as the hydraulic properties of the aquifer the integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model hydrogeosphere hgs is used here to account for hydrological complexifications and mechanisms involved when permafrost extent decreases and landscape hillslope increases previous modeling studies have already tested the impacts of these factors on the hydrological signature of arctic catchments however few have been able to 1 simulate permafrost extent catchment hillslope and the resulting groundwater flowpaths in three dimensions 2 distinguish the impact of permafrost thawing in extent from those of permafrost thawing in thickness and 3 represent the connection between surface and subsurface with a coupled approach these assets allow to conclude that river tàlik development and valley incision both clearly increase the vertical connectivity of the subsurface flowpaths as well as the non linearity of the reservoir the flexibility and the realism of hgs model allow to compare the modeling outputs with the dynamics of 336 real catchments from the arctic the comparison corroborates our results below continuous assumptions behind brutsaert conceptual model are not verified and it is no longer possible to relate recession constant to permafrost thaw depth finally this study gives the keys to start elaborating on the recession analysis method to be able to relate the hydrological signature of arctic rivers to permafrost thawing rate in any type of permafrost extent and catchment topography keywords arctic hydrology recession analysis thawing permafrost active layer thickening numerical modeling isshm data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction quantifying and forecasting permafrost dynamics in space and time is a major scientific challenge for arctic regions that are impacted by the polar amplification of climate change even if the environmental consequences of permafrost thawing induced by climate warming are known and documented quantifying the thawing rate at a fine spatial scale remains a challenge for poorly instrumented regions such as the arctic river discharge data appear to be a valuable source of information the brutsaert conceptual model 2005 presented in more detail in section 2 3 is based on a simplified representation of unconfined aquifers and assumes a linear relationship between the recession slope of a river hydrograph and the permafrost thawing depth based on this conceptual model many arctic studies have used a recession slope analysis for arctic rivers e g lyon and destouni 2010 sjöberg et al 2013 ploum et al 2019 sergeant et al 2021 to assess permafrost thawing rates at the catchment scale however it has been shown that the extent of the permafrost evans et al 2020 the climatic conditions hinzman et al 2020 the landscape topography tananaev and lotsari 2022 as well as the hydraulic properties of the catchment ploum et al 2019 may invalidate brutsaert conceptual model 2005 a multifactor analysis of the recession behavior of 336 arctic catchments sergeant et al 2021 corroborates the above findings and reveals that the applicability of the brutsaert conceptual model 2005 is limited to supra permafrost conditions only factors that typically result from permafrost thawing such as permafrost extent loss subsurface permeability increase or catchment hillslope increase are found to limit the capacity of the recession analysis to reflect the permafrost dynamic of a catchment sergeant et al 2021 associated these limitations to the non linear behaviors of the reservoir that may invalidate brutsaert s conceptual model 2005 the mechanisms responsible for non linear behaviors are the increase of hydrologic connectivity the increase of flow path diversity and the multiplication of the contributing drainage area there is therefore a need to assess the impact of the factors and mechanisms mentioned by sergeant et al 2021 on the catchment recession behavior and to understand how they could be included into the brutsaert conceptual model 2005 the objective of this simulation study is to meet this need to allow future use of river flow observations to reflect permafrost dynamics at the catchment scale a trade off between the simplicity of brutsaert conceptual model 2005 and the realism of permafrost dominated catchment is found to be able to detect behaviors that invalidate brutsaert conceptual model 2005 to this end simulations start with an integrated surface subsurface hydrologic model isshm of a synthetic permafrost dominated catchment as close as possible to brutsaert 2005 assumptions then modifications of the extent of the permafrost the hydraulic properties of the subsurface and of the catchment hillslope are explored isshm such as catchment hydrology cathy camporese et al 2010 mike she long et al 2015 hydrogeosphere aquanty 2022 or parflow kuffour et al 2020 are capable of simulating surface subsurface water flow at the catchment scale in a single three dimensional framework and have proven to be theoretically aesthetically and computationally more satisfying than externally and iteratively coupled approaches to reproduce highly nonlinear rainfall responses panday and huyakorn 2004 the advantages of isshm to simulate the behavior of arctic catchments in a context of thawing permafrost are the following first unlike several studies that are based on one or two dimensional models and restrict flow paths and reduction in permafrost extent to one direction only mckenzie et al 2007 voss and provost 2010 painter 2011 soetaert and meysman 2012 isshm allows for three dimensional simulations a 3 d model has the advantage of 1 being more representative of real catchments and flowpath geometries 2 accounting for reduction in permafrost extent in all three directions and 3 enabling to test the impact of slope changes in the x and y directions which has been proven to activate different hydrological processes park et al 2011 isshm also offers larger panels of less constraining boundary conditions for the river outlet which is typically limited to a single constant head boundary condition for other types of models bense et al 2012 frampton et al 2013 kurylyk et al 2014 evans and ge 2017 evans et al 2018 lamontagne hallé et al 2018 hinzman et al 2022 this is a crucial asset considering that choosing an appropriate combination of boundary conditions to represent at best the reality is a persistent challenge in the modeling of cold regions groundwater dynamics sanford 2002 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 finally the insight gained from the simulations on catchment behavior is then compared with the behavior of the 336 arctic catchments analyzed in sergeant et al 2021 2 data and methods 2 1 the numerical model and base case representation of the catchment the isshm selected for the simulations is hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2022 which is a physically based numerical model that simulates coupled three dimensional subsurface and two dimensional surface water flow variably saturated subsurface flow is represented by richards equation in three dimensions while surface flow is represented by the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equations with the assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution in the vertical direction and depth averaged flow velocities in the two other directions for the base case the model domain is an 80 m long and 18 m wide three dimensional catchment fig 1 although it can be considered as a synthetic catchment for the purpose of our simulations it is based on a catchment located in ontario canada and investigated by abdul and gillham 1989 the catchment is in a low relief area covered by grassy land and underlain by a shallow sandy aquifer abdul and gillham 1989 conducted a rainfall runoff field experiment in the catchment where the flow behavior of the system is governed by infiltration in upland regions discharge in lower regions and runoff vanderkwaak 1999 used a coupled surface and subsurface flow model to reproduce streamflow measured by abdul and gillham 1989 the abdul and gillham 1989 is also used as a verification example of the capabilities of the hgs model for three dimensional surface subsurface flow simulations the abdul and gillham 1989 catchment is chosen here for its simplicity that allows to start with the behavior of a synthetic catchment and to easily simulate derived scenarios that detect the behaviors of diverse types of permafrost dominated catchments a triangular mesh is first generated to represent the catchment extent in the horizontal x and y directions the mesh is then duplicated in the vertical z direction to generate 3d triangular prism elements three hydrostratigraphic units are represented in the model with permafrost and aquifer thicknesses typical of the umiujaq region of northern canada lemieux et al 2020 the first unit is the supra permafrost sand aquifer assumed to represent the active layer which extends from ground surface down to a depth of 1 m for simplicity we refer to this unit as the shallow aquifer in the following text the second unit located below the shallow aquifer is the permafrost and has a thickness of 20 m the third unit is a sand aquifer located sub permafrost and whose thickness is 10 m for simplicity we refer to this unit as the deeper aquifer in the following text the shallow aquifer is discretized vertically with 5 sub layers of 3d elements each having a uniform thickness of 0 2 m the permafrost is discretized vertically with 15 sub layers of 3d elements whose thickness is finer close to the shallow aquifer and then increases to reach a maximum value of 4 4 m near the bottom at the contact with the deeper aquifer the deeper aquifer is discretized with 5 sub layers of 3d elements each having a uniform thickness of 2 m the elevation of the top of the mesh is adjusted to follow the surface topography the approximately 50 000 m2 catchment is discretized with 86 675 nodes and 167 525 triangular prism elements both shallow and deeper aquifers have similar properties and consist of homogeneous sand with an isotropic hydraulic conductivity of 10 5 m s permafrost is represented as a unit having a low isotropic hydraulic conductivity of 10 14 m s the properties of the thawed permafrost correspond to those of both aquifers the hydraulic properties of the subsurface and the surface roughness coefficients are provided in table 1 the saturation pressure head and relative permeability saturation relationships for the sand aquifers are those of the borden sand described in vanderkwaak 1999 and in the hgs verification manual aquanty 2022 flow through macropores present in unsaturated frozen or partially frozen permafrost e g mackay 1983 boike et al 1998 scherler et al 2010 are neglected here for the sake of simplicity the slope of the ground surface is 2 in the x direction and 9 in the y direction a river channel is located in the central portion of the catchment river flows in the direction of the increasing x coordinate and the river outlet is located at the right hand boundary of the catchment fig 1 a critical depth boundary condition for the surface water flow domain is assigned to the outlet where the water depth is equal to the critical depth cd and the volumetric discharge per unit width is given by g cd 3 aquanty 2022 where g is the gravitational acceleration constant a no flow boundary is assigned to the bottom of the domain which is deep enough to reach unfractured bedrock or any layer in which the permeability is too low to produce any significant groundwater flow compared to the above layers lamontagne hallé et al 2020 the lateral boundaries of the domain for the shallow aquifer and for the permafrost are assumed impermeable for groundwater flow however a larger scale groundwater flow component is assumed for the deeper aquifer this component is generated by imposing a constant incoming flux of 5 56 10 7 m s at the left boundary of the deeper aquifer at 0 m and a constant head of 2 78 m at the right boundary following abdul and gillham 1989 fig 1 the set of boundary conditions generates groundwater flow in the deeper aquifer in the direction of the increasing x axis which is similar to the direction of streamflow at the surface for all simulations the water table everywhere in the catchment is initially located 22 cm below ground surface a rainfall event is simulated by applying to the surface domain a rainfall rate of 5 56 10 6 m s i e 20 mm hr for a one hour stress period followed by a 3 hour period without any rainfall adaptive time stepping is used with an initial time step size of 0 5 s a maximum time step size of 100 s and time step incrementing and decrementing factor limits of 8 0 and 0 5 respectively an absolute convergence criterion of 10 3 m is used for the newton raphson iterative solution of the nonlinear flow equations a dual node approach was used to couple surface and subsurface flow and the flow coupling term between the surface and the subsurface meshes is equal to 10 1 m length a rill storage height of 2 10 3 m is used for the surface flow domain the reader is referred to the hgs manual for further details on the governing equations and solution methods aquanty 2022 2 2 scenarios 2 2 1 scenario a the base case scenario a shown in fig 1 and described above corresponds to a simple continuous permafrost catchment where a one meter shallow aquifer discharges into a river because permafrost is continuous the shallow aquifer and the deeper aquifer are hydraulically disconnected and the deeper aquifer does not contribute to baseflow in the stream to simulate the impact of the active layer thickening on the storage discharge relationship the thickness of the shallow aquifer or active layer which is 1 m for the base case is then modified a range of constant thicknesses ranging from 0 4 to 3 m is assigned for a series of simulations doing so we assess the validity of the linear relationship between the aquifer thickness and the resulting recession slope of the outflow hydrograph assumed by brutsaert 2005 for all simulations the active layer is sub divided into 5 layers of elements having a uniform thickness the permafrost remains continuous over the catchment and only the shallow aquifer contributes to streamflow 2 2 2 scenarios b and c for scenarios b and c the base case is modified to investigate the impact of thawing permafrost on the hydrological system for the rainfall event described in section 2 1 the thawing of the permafrost is not simulated numerically but investigated indirectly by imposing different spatial configurations of permafrost for the simulations for scenario b illustrated in fig 2 the extent of permafrost is reduced in the x direction down to isolated patches of permafrost that cover less than 10 of the catchment for scenario c illustrated in fig 3 the permafrost extent is reduced in the y direction first below the river channel down to the deep aquifer then the reduction in permafrost extent is extended laterally as mentioned previously it is assumed that the thawed permafrost has the same hydraulic properties as the two aquifers scenarios b and c result in two sets of 16 scenarios with permafrost coverage ranging from 0 to 100 of the catchment area the scenarios are labelled cont100 disc95 disc90 disc85 disc80 disc70 disc65 disc60 disc50 spo45 spo40 spo30 spo25 spo20 spo15 and iso10 where letters indicate the type of permafrost extent continuous discontinuous sporadic and isolated and numbers indicate the percent of the catchment area underlain by permafrost finally to test the impact the thickness of the shallow aquifer on brutsaert conceptual model 2005 validity for permafrost extents ranging from continuous to sporadic the thickness of the shallow aquifer is modified with values ranging from 0 4 to 3 m for both scenarios b and c 2 2 3 scenarios d and e for scenarios d and e illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 the catchment hillslope is increased to up to 24 and 30 in x and y directions respectively resulting in two sets of 11 and 10 scenarios this spectrum of watershed hillslopes allows to simulate a large swath of permafrost landscapes that range from low coastal plains slope lower than 5 to mountainous peaks slope greater than 15 that are shown to influence the impact of permafrost thawing on the storage discharge relationship sergeant et al 2021 tananaev and lotsari 2022 o connor et al 2019 the two sets of scenarios are tested for every type of permafrost extent described previously for scenarios b and c to investigate the mechanisms behind the coupling effect of permafrost thawing and topography gradient on the hydrological system for scenarios b to e permafrost reduction and modifications to topography create hydraulic connections between the shallow and the deeper aquifers we assume that because of these new hydraulic connections it takes 14 h before groundwater flow reaches equilibrium therefore for those scenarios a second rainfall event of 5 56 10 6 m s is applied to the surface for one hour 14 h after the first rainfall event occurs 2 3 recession curve analysis the recession curve analysis quantifies the storage discharge relationship of a catchment the conceptual model for the recession flow analysis is based on brutsaert 2005 who developed a one dimensional long term solution based on the linearization of boussinesq equation 1 1 h t k n d x h h x where h is hydraulic head k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and nd is its drainable porosity the brutsaert 2005 conceptual model assumes that the aquifer i is unconfined and initially fully saturated ii responds to a precipitation event by generating an 1d horizontal outflow q into the adjoining river and iii has a linear reservoir behavior i e its drawdown is small relative to its saturated thickness d under these assumptions the river discharge q can be computed with linearized equation 2 and its recession constant α can be related to the average aquifer thickness d by equation 3 2 q t q 0 exp α t where q is the outflow m3 s per unit length of river m to the river directly related to the volumetric discharge of the river q m3 s and q 0 is the initial outflow at the start of the recession the decay rate α in equation 2 represents a characteristic storage delay in the catchment called recession constant 3 α π 2 k c d 4 n d b 2 where c is a constant adjusted to compensate for the linearization of boussinesq equation and d is the average aquifer thickness the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer k the drainable porosity of the aquifer nd and the extent of the drainage system b are assumed to remain homogeneous and unchanged for the recession analysis of our base case catchment we applied a methodology similar to that detailed in sergeant et al 2021 we use records of simulated discharge q m3 s at the stream outlet over 4 h with a rainfall event occurring during the first hour of simulation periods of rising streamflow and a 30 minute period following the hydrograph peak are not considered for the analysis since they are likely influenced by rainfall the 30 minute period τ is adopted in agreement with equation 4 linsley et al 1975 and the catchment dimensions 4 τ 0 827 a 0 2 where τ is the time in days before recession starts after a peak and a is the catchment area in km2 which is equal to 5 10 3 km2 in our study flow recession d q d t is defined as the difference in discharge between two successive simulated discharges with d q d t q t q t d t d t the average discharge q av over a period of 100 s was defined as q av q t q t d t 2 values of d q d t versus q av in log log space were fitted with the following linear least square regression equation using the ordinary least squares function seabold et al 2010 5 ln dq dt ln α b ln q av the value of coefficient b in equation 5 is an indication of the linearity of the reservoir drainage troch et al 2013 with a value of 1 confirming the linearity assumption brutsaert 2005 of equations 2 and 3 for scenarios where catchments having different thicknesses d of their shallow aquifer are simulated the associated recession parameter α was obtained while fitting the simulated river discharge q to equation 5 and assuming b 1 the resulting d α relationship allows to test the validity of equation 3 which assumes a linear reservoir then to test the applicability of the linear reservoir assumption the value of parameter b is not set equal to 1 but rather estimated by calculating the slope of equation 5 using an approach similar to that of hinzman et al 2020 we relate the estimated coefficient b to the permafrost extent topography gradient and the hydraulic conductivity of the catchment in order to quantify the influence of those factors on reservoir linearity for scenarios with a deeper aquifer b to e the same methodology is applied to river discharges but that time to the second rainfall event which starts at t 14 h after flow in the aquifer has reached equilibrium 3 results the main outputs of the simulations for scenarios a to e are i the values of the hydrograph recession constant α which tests the applicability of equation 3 ii the values of parameter b resulting from the recession analysis which informs on the linear behavior of the reservoir and iii the simulated subsurface darcy flux q q x q y q z which illustrates groundwater flow direction and reveals the mechanisms behind the various behaviors 3 1 validity of the base case scenario a fig 6 a shows the hydrograph associated with each active layer thickness scenario on which the recession analysis is processed the discharge peak decreases from 8x10 3 m s to 3x10 3 m s as the active layer thickness increases indicating that the subsurface storage capacity increases with the aquifer thickening the recession analysis which assumed reservoir linearity for each simulation of scenario a is shown in fig 6b for the analysis parameter b is set equal to 1 in order to calculate the recession constant α fig 7 a shows for each simulated active layer thickness d the related parameter α resulting from the recession analysis described in fig 6b to test the linearity of the d α relationship a linear least square regression and its associated coefficient of determination r2 are added to fig 7a the regression confirms the applicability of equation 3 for the simulated catchment as parameter α increases linearly with the active layer thickness d with r2 0 99 the same trend is observed for α when running scenario a with other materials such as clay or gravel results not shown here simulations from scenario a allow to confirm the applicability of the brutsaert conceptual model for a flat catchment underlain by continuous permafrost recession was analyzed again but this time without fixing a value of b equal 1 but letting it vary the range of b values in that case is shown in fig 7b the median value of b is 1 10 and its maximum is 1 36 which remains close to the linear value of 1 confirming the assumption of a linear reservoir for all active layer thickness scenarios 3 2 reduction in permafrost extent and thickness 3 2 1 scenario b scenario b reduces the permafrost extent in the x direction while increasing the static thickness of the active layer and performs recession analysis for each simulated hydrograph by increasing the static thickness of the active layer by 20 cm from one simulation to the other scenario b tends to reflect the process of active layer thickening in different contexts of permafrost extent first fig 8 a shows the evolution of the recession constant α with the active layer thickness d when the permafrost coverage of the catchment reduces in the x direction from 100 to 80 60 then 20 the recession constant α is calculated assuming b 1 in equation 5 it results that for continuous permafrost marked with circles on fig 8a the recession constant α increases linearly with d with r2 0 99 when the underlying permafrost is discontinuous marked with triangles on fig 8a or sporadic marked with crosses on fig 8a the recession constant α decreases linearly with d with r2 0 98 0 99 then parameter b from equation 5 is no longer fixed equal to 1 but calculated permafrost extent of the catchment and its related b value are plotted in fig 8b results indicate that b generally increases when permafrost coverage decreases with the highest b increase occurring between simulation disc90 and disc85 above 90 of permafrost extent b values remain below 1 45 but exceed 1 54 as soon as permafrost extent reduces to 45 these results confirm the applicability of equation 3 which linearly relates parameters α and d for continuous permafrost only if permafrost coverage gets lower than 85 parameter b exceeds 1 5 fig 8b and equation 3 is no longer valid as α decreases while d increases fig 8a the computed darcy flux q q x q y q z in the subsurface are integrated into streamtraces that illustrate subsurface flowpaths shown in fig 9 for simulations disc60 and spo20 after the rainfall event for both simulations the deeper aquifer is saturated and the direction of groundwater flow indicated by darcy flux streamtraces show vertical flow from the deeper aquifer towards the shallow aquifer for disc60 the river edge is not saturated and the deeper aquifer is connected to the surface at three different locations through corridors of high hydraulic conductivity in spo20 the river edge is fully saturated downstream with a 40 m wide corridor of tortuous fluxes between deeper and shallow aquifers at the outlet and more connections all along the length of the catchment 3 2 2 scenario c the recession analysis for scenario c which reduces permafrost extent in the y direction by expanding the unfrozen zones below the river channel is performed for each simulated hydrograph fig 10 a which assumes b equals to 1 shows the evolution of recession constant α with the active layer thickness d when the permafrost coverage of the catchment reduces from 100 to 80 60 then 20 it results that for continuous permafrost the recession constant α increases linearly with d with r2 0 99 when the underlying permafrost is discontinuous or sporadic the recession constant α decreases linearly with d with r2 0 97 0 98 fig 10b shows the evolution of parameter b calculated from equation 5 for permafrost extent lower than 100 as soon as permafrost coverage is lower than 100 b moves and stays away from its lowest value of 1 4 between simulation disc95 and disc65 b values slightly increase then from simulations disc65 to spo10 b decreases but remains greater than 1 5 these results confirm the applicability of equation 3 which linearly relates parameters α and d for continuous permafrost only if permafrost coverage gets lower than 100 parameter b exceeds 1 5 fig 10b and equation 3 is no longer valid as α decreases while d increases fig 10a on fig 11 the location of the unfrozen zone blue shape are drawn and the subsurface darcy fluxes q q x q y q z are integrated into streamtraces to show groundwater flowpaths below the riverbed for simulations disc60 and spo20 after the rainfall event the subsurface darcy fluxes q q x q y q z are illustrated in yellow for vertical cross sections of the catchments along the y z plane and at x 2 10 40 and 60 m for disc60 at x 2 m the ground is frozen below the riverbed and there are no connections between the shadow and deep aquifers groundwater flow remains horizontal at x 40 m the unfrozen zone extends from the riverbed to the top of the deeper aquifer and connections between deeper and shallow aquifers are created darcy fluxes in the deeper aquifer tend to be vertical all along the unfrozen corridor for spo20 similar trends are observed with increasing curvature of the darcy flux vectors 3 3 impact of hillslope gradient 3 3 1 scenario d fig 12 shows parameter b computed for the 11 catchments with hillslope gradients in the x direction ranging from 2 to 24 the simulations have been run for 5 different permafrost extents cont100 disc80 disc60 spo40 and spo20 when permafrost extent exceeds 60 parameter b increases with the gradient of the hillslope when permafrost is sporadic or isolated i e permafrost extent below 50 the correlation between hillslope gradient and parameter b is not as clear as parameter b rapidly reaches values above 6 3 3 2 scenario e fig 13 shows parameter b computed for 10 catchments with valley gradients in the y direction ranging from 9 to 30 simulations have been run for 5 different permafrost extents cont100 disc80 disc60 spo40 and spo20 the correlation between valley gradient and parameter b is clear for any type of permafrost the steeper the valley is the higher parameter b gets while never reaching 5 for simulation cont100 the impact of catchment steepness on b values is even more prominent compared to lower permafrost extent catchments implying that catchment valley gradient may have a stronger impact on catchment linearity than permafrost extent 4 discussion 4 1 the advantages of our model the first advantage of our model is its ability to represent three dimensional groundwater flow in the catchment this 3d representation allows 1 to simulate the geometry of thawed permafrost more realistically and 2 to visualize the simulated flowpaths to understand the hydrological mechanisms involved first we were able to distinguish impacts on the catchment s hydrological signature that are associated with permafrost decrease in thickness scenario a from impacts associated with permafrost decrease in extent scenarios b and c scenario a does not alter the linearity of the reservoir and the brutsaert conceptual model remains applicable whereas for scenarios b and c the value of b shifts away from 1 as soon as permafrost extent decreases and the reservoir is no longer linear scenarios a b and c confirm that it is possible to infer annual rates of active layer thickening from the increase in recession slope α as long as the permafrost extent remains continuous below 100 of permafrost coverage the relation between α and d described in equation 3 is not valid secondly we were able to simulate more realistically the reduction in permafrost extent in most previous model applications in 2d the permafrost extent is reduced such as done for scenario b with permafrost coverage decreasing from continuous layers to sparse patches that extend along the x direction only which is the direction of the stream with scenario c the hgs model allows us to represent the decrease in permafrost extent in all three dimensions by expanding the unfrozen zones below the riverbed this representation is closer to real world permafrost degradation which is known to preferentially degrade beneath surface water bodies due to the high heat capacity of river water that freezes only at the river surface in winter walvoord and kurylyk 2016 these unfrozen zones are called river tàliks french 2018 once subsurface water flowpaths become connected through river tàliks advection can potentially add to the transfer of heat and accelerate thaw enlarging the tàlik beneath rivers rowland et al 2011 wellman et al 2013 as shown in fig 11 as soon as the river tàlik allows for a connection between the shallow and deeper aquifers open tàlik b values jump from 1 4 to 1 6 and the non linearity of the reservoir increases gradually with the expansion of the open tàlik likewise hgs allows for more realistic simulations of hillslope gradients like scenario d previous 2d model applications used to simulate hillslope increases in the x direction only these simulations are relevant when the slope of the river catchment gets steeper yet it does not account for other increases in the landscape slope scenario e adds another dimension to hillslope simulation as it increases the slope in the direction perpendicular to the river channel this additional scenario allows the simulation of more incised valley which has been shown to activate various hydrological processes park et al 2011 an increase in valley gradient clearly leads to an increase in parameter b causing the reservoir to move away from linearity the influence of valley gradient on reservoir linearity seems to even exceed the influence of permafrost extent reduction fig 13 third 3d visualisation of darcy fluxes fig 9 and fig 11 indicates that the non linearity of the reservoir is expressed by 1 groundwater flow connections between deep and shallow aquifers through intra permafrost unfrozen zones and 2 more vertical and tortuous flow components in both sub intra and supra permafrost aquifers indeed brutsaert 2005 conceptual model does not account for these flow paths as it is a solution to the 1d boussinesq equation that assumes that groundwater flow is horizontal and occurs only in the active layer finally hgs enables to simulate surface water and river flow with more realism it is a crucial asset considering that river hydrograph is central in recession analysis first hgs allows to integrate surface with subsurface flow which avoids the need to either neglect surface flow or create an artificial boundary condition to account for its interactions with the subsurface then while most previous model applications represent the river outlet as constant head or specified pressure hgs offers larger panels of less constraining boundary condtions for the river outlet such as the critical depth boundary used here 4 2 comparison with real catchments because our 3d model provides more flexibility in the representation of a catchment geometry and its boundary conditions our simulations are deemed more representative of a real catchment than the brutsaert conceptual model 2005 it is therefore possible to compare our simulation outputs with the hydrological behaviors from the 336 catchments analysed in sergeant et al 2021 with the recession analysis method described in sergeant et al 2021 we show the evolution of both parameter b and changes in recession constant δ α over 1970 2000 with permafrost extent and catchment hillslope the catchments are partitioned into continuous discontinuous sporadic isolated based on map from brown et al 2002 and into catchments of gentle hillslope such as taiga or tundra plateau and catchments of moderate hillslope such as mountain forests or alpine tundra based on map from olson et al 2001 fig 14 a shows lower b values for continuous permafrost with a median value equal to 1 2 while the median of b for catchments with lower extent of permafrost can reach 1 5 the greatest increase of parameter b is between continuous and discontinuous permafrost extents when the permafrost extent decreases further the trend in the value of b is decreasing these results corroborate both scenario b and c where the largest increase of b occurs between continuous and discontinuous simulations fig 8b and fig 10b yet beyond discontinuous permafrost the trend of b values for real catchments is closer to scenario c than b fig 14b shows higher b values for catchments of moderate hillslope topography with a median of 1 4 this confirms the trend observed in scenario e where b values are higher for catchments with hillslope gradient above 10 sergeant et al 2021 assume that permafrost is thawing over 1970 2020 and that the thickness of the active layer d increases as a result fig 15 shows that the assumed thickening of the active layer induces increasing recession slopes δα 0 as long as the permafrost extent remains continuous for permafrost extent less than continuous the opposite trend is observed and the recession slope decreases δα 0 with the assumed thickening of the active layer for these catchments equation 3 that relates changes in α and changes in d is not valid these results are consistent with those from scenario b and c where recession constant α increases with d only if permafrost coverage is 100 the unclear pattern for α parameter for permafrost extent below discontinuous might be explained by inaccuracies in the brown et al 2002 map that is used to partition the catchment dataset 4 3 limitations this study simulates the behavior of homogeneous catchments where only two different materials each with a uniform hydraulic conductivity are considered one for permeable aquifers and one for nearly impermeable permafrost permafrost thawing is though related to thermokarst formations such as closed tàlik ice wedges pingos palsas or peat plateaux that are known to locally modify the catchment hydraulic properties the surface topography and the position of the frost table while brutsaert s conceptual model 2005 assumes homogeneous hydraulic conductivity of the catchment other models such as rupp and selker 2006 relax this assumption allowing instead the hydraulic conductivity to vary with depth as a power law and reveal the impact of heterogeneous conductivity on the drainage characteristics besides micro topography relief in the surface catchment have shown to control subsurface flows creating depressions that have to be filled before water can spill over to generate flow downslope frei and fleckenstein 2014 boico 2022 and the permafrost environment is no exception to this behavior in a similar manner the distribution of the frost table depth has shown to influence lateral subsurface flow converging to frost table depressions tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wright et al 2009 while attractive in its simplicity brutsaert s conceptual model 2005 does not account for heterogeneities that have proven to influence the drainage of permafrost catchments and thus contributes to model uncertainty refsgaard et al 2012 it would be beneficial to conduct simulations and field based experiments that would include the above mentioned features essential to permafrost catchment behavior the analytical solution presented in brutsaert 2005 reaches its limits when the permafrost extent is not continuous and when the catchment hillslope is too high for large values of hillslope topography the effect of advection overwhelms the diffusion and boussinesq equation is modified to account for the gradient hillslope for scenarios d and e analytical solutions to nonlinear boussinesq equation for sloping aquifer daly and porporato 2004 bartlett and porporato 2018 kinematic wave approximation of henderson and wooding 1964 or other sloping aquifer models see review in rupp and selker 2006 should be considered for the interpretation of our simulation results besides for catchments where the permafrost extent is not continuous and equation 2 is not valid types of reservoirs different from linear such as exponential reservoirs bogaart et al 2016 brauer et al 2013 or hyperbolic reservoirs troch et al 2013 kirchner 2009 which assume b 2 and b 2 respectively hinzman et al 2020 should be tested finally for those catchments it would be interesting to check the applicability of non linear forms of boussinesq equations such as those presented by polubarinova kochina 1962 lockington 1997 or rupp and selker 2005 on both simulated and real catchment behavior 4 4 perspectives it would be worthwhile to refine the characterisation of permafrost extent and hillslope gradient of real catchments for example by using satellite images of the ground such information would improve the comparison of simulated and observed hydrological responses and help calibrate our numerical model based on these comparisons besides the simulation of the active layer thickening could be improved with hgs s pore water freeze thaw module from schilling et al 2019 this module could be adapted to simulate long term active layer thickening resulting from permafrost thawing from the top in scenario a b and c long term active layer thickening is simulated by increasing the constant thickness of the active layer by 20 cm from one simulation to the other the integration of schilling et al 2019 module would allow better comparisons between scenarios a b c and real catchment observations from fig 15 however activating the freeze thaw module in hgs increases simulation times significantly and it would be challenging to investigate the same number of scenarios as presented here the flexibility provided by hgs adaptable modules allows to bring more realism to our model it could also be used to test other factors such vegetation or snow cover by incorporating the evaporation module accordingly besides the hydraulic mixing cell approach incorporated in hgs partington et al 2011 which informs on the origin of the discharging water could complement our understanding of the hydrological mechanisms involved as shown for example in glaser et al 2021 5 conclusion the simulations confirm conclusions from previous studies evans et al 2020 sergeant et al 2021 tananaev and lotsari 2022 hinzman et al 2022 that are based on observations of real catchment hydrographs and 2d simulations permafrost extent and catchment hillslope influence the linearity of the reservoir and limit the applicability of brutsaert 2005 conceptual model for recession analysis besides decrease in permafrost extent creates connections and vertical flowpaths between shallow and deeper aquifers which are not considered in the brutsaert 2005 analytical solution a three dimensional representation of the subsurface as well as flexible boundary conditions and surface subsurface integration that better reflect the river behavior bring more realism to the simulated catchment the complexity of the 3d model allows to visualize the mechanisms involved and compare our simulations with real catchment behavior the comparison validates conclusions made based on simulations as soon as permafrost extent shifts from continuous to discontinuous the non linearity of the reservoir increases and equation 3 is not valid this pattern is amplified for mountainous catchments however when the permafrost extent is less than discontinuous the comparison is not straight forward and improvements are pointed out to better characterize the permafrost extent and the hillslope of real catchments besides as improvements we suggest to use hgs integrable modules to either test the impact of other factors visualize the origin of the discharging water or simulate the long term thickening of the active layer again the flexibility of hgs model which can integrate evaporation hydraulic mixing cell or pore water freeze thaw modules would help simulate even more realistic behavior of permafrost dominated catchments credit authorship contribution statement f sergeant conceptualization methodology

1761,this study presents an analysis to identify precipitation based climate change hotspots and key vulnerable cities using multi model multi scenario high resolution 0 25 0 25 bias corrected precipitation dataset across india from 14 state of the art general circulation models gcms participating in coupled model intercomparison project version 6 cmip6 preliminary analysis indicates an overall wetter future across india with 290 150 mm to 530 260 mm increase in mean annual precipitation towards end of this century under various climate change scenarios apart from the mean precipitation the extremes are also found to be increasing by alarmingly higher rates however the spatio temporal variations of such increments are notably diverse over different seasons in a year and across different homogeneous precipitation zones hpzs in the country therefore a new and more inclusive index named as precipitation based hotspot index phi is developed to identify the precipitation based hotspots i e the places with most pronounced changes in precipitation characteristics the phi considers the changes in various aspects of precipitation such as mean variability and characteristics of extremes magnitude frequency and intensity based on the phi values in the far future period 2061 2100 and for the worst climate change scenario the hotspot regions are identified mostly in the northwest west central west coast and northeast parts of india further considering two important socio economic vulnerability factors population density and human development index along with phi the key vulnerable tier i cities are identified across india the analysis reveals four out of ten tier i cities will be highly vulnerable towards end of this century the findings of this analysis hotspot maps and the data products high resolution bias corrected precipitation dataset are expected to be highly beneficial for impact assessments hydrologic modelling and formulating suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies for india over future keywords climate change hotspots precipitation extremes precipitation based hotspot index phi precipitation based vulnerability index pvi homogeneous precipitation zones hpzs coupled model intercomparison project version 6 cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the observed changes in various natural systems on the earth such as atmosphere oceans land cryosphere and biosphere since the pre industrial era carries the unequivocal signature of anthropogenic climate change and its ever increasing impacts flato et al 2013 if the present rate of greenhouse gas emissions continues in the future as well it will be highly unlikely to limit global warming to the internationally agreed upon target unfccc 2015 of 2 c above the pre industrial baseline knutti et al 2016 roe et al 2019 rogelj et al 2016 however how this global scale warming will manifest at smaller spatial and temporal scales remains a key question to the scientific community for understanding the changing pattern of climate and hence for planning local or national scale adaptation and mitigation strategies therefore among this potential spatial heterogeneity in the climatic responses there exists a need to identify the climate change hotspots i e the places with the strongest and most robust aggregated response to global scale climatic forcing identification of such hotspots and their underlying mechanisms have been a topic of central interest in the earth system research since many years now stocker et al 2013 in particular depicting such hotspots in a map format with strong visual elements termed as hotspots map is highly beneficial from academic as well as policy makers point of view such hotspot mapping can communicate multiple key information in an easier and user friendly manner than a simple text document sometimes along with the climatic exposure the societal vulnerability is also included in identification of hotspots which includes socio economic status sensitivity coping capacity etc of the concerned region de sherbinin 2014 however the quantitative estimates of these measures is always questionable along with their lack of availability and reliability thus although the impacts of climate change are closely associated with societal vulnerability identification of most responsive regions under changing climate is the primary and most crucial step in risk assessment and adaptation strategies towards this we have considered the entire indian mainland as our study area india and south asia as a whole has been identified as one of the highly vulnerable regions under the changing climatic scenario owing to combination of various climatic and socio economic factors such as strong signals of climate change high population density low per capita income developing economy etc de souza et al 2015 mani et al 2018 consequently enormous challenges are expected to be imposed on the agricultural productivity water resources management infrastructure and livelihood of millions of people residing in this part of the globe including india mishra et al 2020 therefore development of hotspot maps for india as the preliminary step for adaptation and mitigation strategies will be decidedly required in near future to alleviate the detrimental effects of climate change and to help build resilience against the worst costello et al 2009 de souza et al 2015 these hotspot maps can be developed for different climatic variables or phenomena which are predominantly affected by the changing climate such as temperature precipitation sea level rise cyclonic activities etc however various recent incidents of floods and flash floods in different parts of india and their damaging impacts suggest a significant alteration in spatio temporal pattern of precipitation across the country for instance the coromandel coast flood in 2015 east and west godavari district flood in 2019 kerala flood in 2018 2019 and 2020 assam flood in 2020 2021 bihar flood in 2019 etc to name a few on the other hand studies report about 20 50 of the indian mainland to be prone to moderate to extreme droughts suman and maity 2021 by the end of this century with an increasing pattern in both intensity and areal extent mallya et al 2016 niranjan kumar et al 2013 sharma and mujumdar 2017 given such challenges the changes in the regular spatio temporal characteristics of precipitation are expected to have widespread implications on the overall availability of water resources and its management thus in turn affecting the food security of a country like india whose economy primarily depends on rain fed agriculture kishore et al 2015 hence developing a precipitation based hotspot map for india is indispensable which sets the primary objective of this study india is a developing country with the second highest population in the world at present most of its cities are very ancient ill planned and densely populated further the inadequate drainage system in most of the cities is likely to cause water stagnation and urban flooding under this future scenario of wet climate thus crores of people living in those cities will face the nuisances created by urban flooding ranging from loss of property disruption in transport and power supply to outbreak of epidemics and even deaths therefore management of urban flooding and identification of such cities vulnerable to increased precipitation is also highly required which sets another objective of this study overall such precipitation based hotspot maps as well as identification of key vulnerable cities are expected to be immensely beneficial to combat future climate change induced precipitation hazards in key locations well in advance however to develop such precipitation based hotspot map an estimate of future projected precipitation at a finer spatio temporal scale is essential which is mostly provided by general circulation models gcms the gcms are considered the most advanced tool for climate projection under different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions currently available worldwide flato et al 2013 however the spatial resolutions at which gcms run are often too coarse to get reliable projections at the regional level for the impact assessment studies barbero et al 2017 kusumastuti et al 2021 maurer et al 2010 mishra et al 2020 moreover the gcms are found to produce precipitation output having significant amount of systematic bias due to their coarse resolution or model parameterizations ashfaq et al 2017 mishra et al 2014 and thus limiting their applicability to various research domains hence bias correction is a mandatory step before using any gcm output especially precipitation data mehrotra and sharma 2021 sarkar and maity 2020a bias correction methodologies have a long history in the literature kusumastuti et al 2021 li et al 2010 maraun 2013 mehrotra and sharma 2019 2016 vrac and friederichs 2015 including techniques such as linear lenderink et al 2007 non linear leander et al 2008 leander and buishand 2007 distribution based quantile mapping mao et al 2015 pierce et al 2015 empirical quantile mapping piani et al 2010 themeßl et al 2011 etc however most of the bias correction methods suffer from one of the following two limitations a they reduce bias in a selected precipitation quantile e g either mean or extreme values and b they exclude zero values from the analysis even though their presence is significant in daily precipitation therefore a recently developed copula based bias correction technique by maity et al 2019 henceforth rmph model is used in this study which de biases the entire range of the precipitation including the mean and different levels of extremes and is particularly suitable for zero inflated precipitation climatology like india comparing it with one of the most popular bias correction methods i e quantile mapping qm method suman et al 2022 reported improved performance for both the mean and extreme precipitation values from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex hence the rmph method is used in this study to correct the bias present in the precipitation output from gcms nonetheless we further compare the performance of rmph and qm methods for the entire study area using gcm simulated precipitation data from the latest version of coupled model intercomparison project i e cmip 6 finally the future projected bias corrected precipitation dataset for india using both rmph and qm methods from multiple state of the art cmip 6 gcms following various shared socio economic pathways is made public by this study by keeping it in an open source data repository see results and discussion section for details we expect that this high resolution multi model multi scenario dataset will be highly beneficial for different impact assessment studies over india apart from just identification of hotspots understanding their underlying mechanism is also very important towards this we present a detailed and comprehensive spatio temporal analysis on likely changes in various attributes of precipitation over future climatologically the precipitation pattern across the indian mainland varies significantly over space as well as time approximately 70 of the annual precipitation is received in four monsoon months june through september in india the monsoon pattern is also different in different parts of the country and is highly influenced by the steep topography of the himalayas and the western ghats apart from the southwest monsoon there is also the northeast monsoon sometimes known as return monsoon that causes rainfall at some parts of india mostly in the southern part of the country during october to december so just an overall pan india analysis of future changes in precipitation will not capture the complete picture of changing precipitation characteristics therefore to conduct a holistic spatio temporal analysis for india we need to perform a spatio temporal division as follows a by dividing an entire year into some number of seasons and b by dividing the indian mainland into some zones of spatially coherent precipitation pattern namely homogeneous precipitation zones or hpzs see methodology section thus in brief this study attempts to develop a future precipitation based hotspot map across india based on multi model multi scenario bias corrected precipitation dataset from cmip 6 based on this map the vulnerability of all tier i cities in india with more than 1 lakh population as per census 2011 is also identified using various socio economic factors in general the future precipitation based hotspot maps as well as the list of key vulnerable cities will be highly beneficial not only for academic or research purposes but for decision making risk analysis impact assessments and planning suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies additionally this study publishes a multi scenario bias corrected precipitation dataset from 14 state of the art cmip6 gcms that may be highly useful for other studies as well 2 data used different versions of cmip as established and monitored by the world climate research programme wcrp provide a fundamental basis for a coordinated international climate research with an incredible technical contribution from several climate modelling centers eyring et al 2016 phase 6 of cmip i e cmip6 is the most recent version that offers substantial improvements over its earlier versions in multiple aspects such as finer horizontal resolution better representation of the synoptic processes and better agreement with the global energy balance supharatid et al 2022 thus more reasonable and reliable projections can be obtained from cmip6 outputs as compared to its previous versions chen et al 2021 di luca et al 2020 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021 we employ daily precipitation data from 14 state of the art cmip6 gcms under r1i1p1f1 initial condition details of these models are shown in table 1 url https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 accessed in december 2021 total 80 years 2021 2100 of future data is obtained that is further divided into two equal parts viz near future period 2021 2060 and far future period 2061 2100 to capture the temporal changes in the precipitation characteristics w r t the base period 1981 2010 two different shared socioeconomic pathways ssps viz ssp245 and ssp585 are considered for each gcm to understand two possible pathways of changes in the future for instance ssp585 is the most pessimistic scenario i e ssp 5 with a target radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 by 2100 in a world with strong economic growth abundant use of fossil fuel resources rapid technological advances but no suitable climate policy gidden et al 2019 on the other hand ssp245 depicts a middle of the road scenario i e ssp 2 with moderate population growth uneven development and income growth across countries and having a target radiative forcing of 4 5 w m2 at the end of the century thus comparison of results obtained between ssp585 and ssp245 will help us to understand the possible impact of higher anthropogenic activity and greenhouse gas emissions in the future the bias present in this gcm simulated dataset is corrected w r t a gridded observational dataset obtained from india meteorological department imd this 0 25 0 25 dataset was developed by pai et al 2014 using observed records of daily rainfall data from 6995 rain gauge stations across india this gridded precipitation dataset from imd perfectly captures the precipitation climatology over india and has been successfully used for various hydroclimatic studies in recent times dash and maity 2019 mishra et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2018 sarkar and maity 2020b 3 methodology as per the set objectives of this study the analysis is done in four stages firstly the raw gcm precipitation data from all 14 models are regrided and bias corrected in the second stage this bias corrected multi model multi scenario dataset is undergone meticulous spatio temporal analysis to understand the impact of changing climate on future precipitation next the precipitation based hotspot map is developed for the country and finally the most vulnerable tier i cities are identified across the country the following sections explain the aforesaid steps in the methodology in detail 3 1 re gridding and bias correction of future simulated rainfall data from gcms the mismatch between spatial resolutions of 14 cmip6 gcms table 1 is taken care of by a standard re gridding technique namely bilinear interpolation and all the datasets are re gridded to a common resolution of 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude same as that of imd data next the rmph method is adopted to correct the bias in gcm simulated precipitation values as explained earlier maity et al 2019 suman et al 2022 in this method the concept of bivariate copula is used to model the association between observed obs and historically simulated precipitation values hsv by developing a joint distribution function over a common historical time period here 1961 2014 then the conditional distribution function obtained from this joint distribution is modified as a mixed distribution with a discrete probability mass at zero to take care of the zero rainfall days this is done by first dividing all the pairs of obs and hsv into three groups i pairs with both obs and hsv having nonzero positive values ii pairs with obs 0 and iii pairs with hsv 0 using these categorized pairs primarily three sets of information are extracted while developing the rmph model a parameters for the best fit copula model for the first set of pairs b a suitable decay function capturing the probability for the second set i e zero obs conditioned on hsv over its entire range and c conditional probability distribution of obs values when hsv 0 i e for the third set of pairs finally by combining all this information a set of conditional probability distribution of obs values given any value of hsv is obtained these are used to obtain the bias corrected precipitation values bcv next considering the future simulated precipitation values as input in place of hsv to this set of conditional distribution function bias corrected precipitation values are obtained for future and used for subsequent analysis for further details about the rmph method and its mathematical background readers may refer to maity et al 2019 although the superiority of the rmph method over the quantile mapping qm another efficient and very popular bias correction technique is already established in detail by suman et al 2022 for cmip5 cordex simulations we further compare their performance using the state of the art cmip6 gcms for applying the qm the best fit probability distributions are identified and fitted to both obs and hsv over a common historical period the selection of the best fit marginal distribution is based on 12 candidate parametric probability distributions e g beta exponential gamma generalized pareto inverse gaussian logistic log logistic lognormal normal rayleigh rician and weibull and two statistical criteria i the fitted marginal distribution should pass the chi square test at 5 significance level and ii it should yield the lowest bayesian information criterion bic 3 2 spatio temporal analysis of future changes in precipitation in order to perform a holistic analysis on future projected changes over the diverse landscape of india we perform a temporal decomposition as well as a spatial decomposition temporally we divide the entire year into four different seasons i summer march april may ii monsoon june july august september iii post monsoon october november december and iv winter january february summer in india is mostly characterized by hot and dry weather with seldom occurrences of local scale thunderstorms followed by a four month long monsoon season with huge amount of rainfall though spatially diverse for most parts of the country due to humid south westerly monsoon wind during the post monsoon season a different monsoon cycle the northeast or retreating monsoon brings dry cool and dense air masses to large parts of india and causes heavy rainfall mostly in the southern part of the country tamilnadu and kerala finally the cold and dry winter season comes with very less amount of precipitation across the country spatially also we divide india into six different zones of spatially coherent precipitation characteristics namely homogeneous precipitation zones hpzs sarkar and maity 2022 this zoning is done by coupling two important features of precipitation i average annual precipitation p and ii seasonal variation of monthly precipitation over the base period 1981 2010 using the observational records from imd the seasonality is quantified using an information theory based metric named apportionment entropy ae further details on this zoning can be found in the supplementary information section a1 the hpz map of india and its development from the scatter plot between p and ae are shown in fig 1 the originally obtained hpz map in fig 1b is slightly modified in fig 1c with a hatched portion in the north most part of the country jammu kashmir and ladakh region this portion is not considered in subsequent analysis in this study because of questionable reliability of the imd data in this region kothawale and rajeevan 2017 detailed information on these six hpzs their selection criterion full name abbreviation etc are listed in supplementary table s1 nevertheless the hpz 1 or low precipitation high seasonality zone can be seen in the western part of india predominantly consisting of gujrat and rajasthan the hpz 2 or moderate precipitation high seasonality zone can be found in the central part of india mostly spanning eastern uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh the windward side of western ghats forms the hpz 3 or high precipitation high seasonality zone the hpz 4 or low precipitation low seasonality zone can be mainly observed in the peninsular india the hpz 5 or moderate precipitation low seasonality zone is rather dispersed at multiple places across india mostly in the eastern part of the country parts of the eastern coast in southern india parts of northern india uttarakhand and himachal pradesh and some portion in north east india as well lastly the hpz 6 or high precipitation low seasonality zone can be mostly found in northeast india and kerala now using this spatial and temporal decomposition we perform three different sets of analysis in the first set of analysis the projected changes in seasonal precipitation are explored the second set of analysis is designed to capture the changes in different levels of precipitation extremes over future and the likely changes in monthly variation of precipitation is examined in the third set of analysis in the first and second set of analysis the changes in different precipitation variables are expressed in terms of absolute changes i e the changes in magnitude and percentage changes w r t the base period 1981 2010 additionally a trend analysis is also performed to identify the places with statistically significant trend and its magnitude the mann kendall test at 5 significance level is performed to detect the significant trend and sen s slope method sen 1968 is used to evaluate the magnitude of the trend 3 3 identification of precipitation based climate changes hotspots here we use a climate response based approach to identify the precipitation based climate changes hotspots across india over future in this approach hotspot is defined as a region where climate variables here precipitation are showing particularly pronounced response under a certain scenario of global climate change characterization of such climate response based hotspots can provide key information to identify and investigate primary processes of regional scale climate change giorgi 2006 similar to diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 here we also use the concept of standard euclidean distance sed to quantify a new index named precipitation based hotspot index phi which encapsulates the total change in multi dimensional precipitation characteristics between the baseline and future periods this new index considers some additional precipitation change indictors δ compared to some other similar indices used in earlier studies such as diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 and turco et al 2015 and thus presents a more inclusive scenario of changing characteristics of precipitation comprising the changes in the mean and variability of seasonal precipitation along with the extremes their magnitude frequency and intensity mathematically it is expressed as 1 phi i 1 n δ j 1 n s δ ij max δ ij 2 where δij is the ith change indicator in the jth season at each grid point here we consider total 7 precipitation change indicators thus n δ 7 for 4 seasons separately summer monsoon post monsoon and winter so n s 4 these 7 indicators include i percentage change in mean precipitation δp ii percentage change in the inter annual coefficient of variation of the detrended precipitation δpvar iii percentage change in the 95th percentile precipitation δpex iv frequency of wetter seasons i e seasons with higher than the maximum precipitation in the base period fwet v percentage increase in average precipitation in the wetter seasons w r t the maximum in the base period δpfwet vi frequency of drier seasons i e seasons with lower than the minimum precipitation in the base period fdry vii percentage decrease in average precipitation in the drier seasons w r t the minimum precipitation in the base period δpfdry additional inclusion of three indicators viz δpex δpfwet and δpfdry makes the index phi more informative than some similar indices as stated earlier for instance δpex considers the changes in the level of extreme precipitation on the other hand fwet and fdry take care of the number of seasons with higher than maximum and lower than minimum precipitation in the future and thus consider the frequency information however the intensity perspective remains absent i e by what extent this maximum or minimum will shoot above or fall below respectively in the future hence the present study includes δpfwet δpfdry which indicates the percentage change in the average precipitation in the future exceeding subceeding the maximum minimum precipitation in the base period thus the inclusion of these three additional indicators takes care of the magnitude frequency as well as intensity aspect of extreme precipitation for further clarification about all 7 indicators readers can see the section a2 of supplementary information where one hypothetical example is illustrated overall these seven change indicators δij are designed to incorporate various attributes of precipitation such as mean variability extremes its frequency and intensity into the phi hence different change indicators will have different ranges of their values therefore the δij values need to be scaled before summing up to determine phi as depicted in eqn 1 this scaling is done by dividing each change indicator by their maximum absolute value max δij across the study area as our analysis considers two future scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 and two time periods near future and far future we rescaled each indicator of both the scenarios and time periods using the maximum value in the far future period under the highest forcing i e ssp585 across the study area thus this approach yields a relative metric of aggregated precipitation changes that can be directly compared between any regions within the study area forcing pathways and future time periods overall considering 7 precipitation change indictors for 4 different seasons gives a total of 28 dimensions at each grid point thus by limiting the values of phi between zero and 28 5 29 however it must be noted that similar to other earlier indices the phi is also a comparative index which means a small phi value does not necessarily imply a small absolute change but only a small climate response compared to other places within the study area moreover from eq 1 it is evident that this phi index is bi directional in nature i e the index cannot differentiate between a place with a strong increase in precipitation and a place with a strong decrease in precipitation and designate them as equally problematic under climate change 3 4 identification of key vulnerable cities in order to identify the key vulnerable cities we have considered all tier i cities total 493 cities within our study area i e the cities with more than 1 lakh population as per census 2011 in india https www census2011 co in city php accessed on august 2021 vulnerability is an important issue in climate change adaptation and mitigation studies as per flato et al 2013 vulnerability is defined as the propensity of a region to be adversely affected by climate hazards in other words vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to and unable to cope with the adverse effects of climate change parry et al 2007 thus vulnerability becomes a function of i climatic exposure or hotspots and ii the coping capacity or adaptability of the region the coping capacity or adaptability of a region depends on various socio economic factors such as population density per capita income educational facilities heath infrastructure technological advancement economic development etc however the availability and reliability of such socio economic data are highly questionable hence based on some earlier studies ionescu et al 2009 torres et al 2012 we considered two internationally accepted vulnerability factors vfs with reliable data sources i population density pd and ii inverse of human development index hdi socio economic vulnerability is higher for densely populated regions for various obvious reasons such as higher sewage demand more traffic more impervious area etc on the other hand socio economic vulnerability is higher for the regions with lower hdi value hdi is one of the key global indictors for development which conveniently combines three important social indicators health income and education into a single non dimensional measure between 0 and 1 low hdi implies a generally low standard of living such as a poor sanitation system inadequate health infrastructure slow economic growth and low literacy levels all these factors significantly influence the population s adaptive capacity for climate change particularly for extreme precipitation hence the inverse of hdi is used as one vf in this study therefore using these two vfs pd and hdi along with phi we define another index named precipitation based vulnerability index pvi to identify the key vulnerable cities across india pvi can be formulated as 2 pvi s p h i i 1 n sv f i n where pvi is the multiplication of standardised phi sphi and the geometric mean of the standardised vulnerability factors svf n 2 is the number of vfs including pd and inverse hdi thus eq 2 gets modified as 3 pvi s p h i spd 1 shdi where spd is the standardised population density and shdi is the standardised human development index as the theoretical ranges of phi 0 5 29 pd 0 and hdi 0 1 are completely different from each other they need to be standardised to the same scale before using in eq 3 which is done by some empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf therefore the values of pvi get limited between 0 and 1 to determine future pvi values the phi values can be obtained from the future simulated gcm output as explained earlier in section 3 3 however to get future projected values of pd are obtained from a recent publication by jones and o neill 2016 they developed a new set of global spatially explicit future population scenarios that are consistent with the new ssps and made publicly available data source https www cgd ucar edu iam modeling spatial population scenarios html accessed in august 2022 however in case of hdi no such future projections are available hence here we use the latest available data for the year 2015 for hdi from kummu et al 2018 with a reasonable assumption that its relative spatial distribution will remain more or less same over future this global sub national scale gridded hdi dataset was prepared based on various human development reports hdrs by united nations development programme undp this data is also publicly available through https doi org 10 5061 dryad dk1j0 accessed in august 2022 4 results and discussion 4 1 efficacy of rmph method for bias correction both the rmph and qm methods of bias correction are developed between daily scale imd observed precipitation data and historically simulated precipitation from each of those 14 gcms over a common time period 1961 2014 as both the bias correction methods are applied on the daily scale data it would be indeed required to judge the model performance from the statistics of the bias corrected series at aggregated time scales such as monthly or annual therefore the efficacy of these two bias correction techniques in correcting the bias in daily as well as aggregated time scale is examined by considering five precipitation derived statistics viz i annual precipitation p ii monthly precipitation mp iii 95th percentile of wet day greater than1 mm day precipitation p95 iv annual maximum daily precipitation amdp and v monthly variation of precipitation needless to mention the variables p and mp will be used to judge the effectiveness of bias correction in aggregated time scale p95 and amdp will be for two different levels of extremes and monthly variation will help to confirm the correctness of the seasonal pattern further to judge their performance in capturing the low frequency variability we considered the standard deviation sd of these five statistics along with their mean the results for the first four variables are shown in fig 2a for the mean level it can be observed that the raw simulated gcm output panel b mostly underestimates observed precipitation panel a especially in case of extremes on the other hand the bias corrected data from both techniques panels c and d shows a reasonably improved agreement with the observed data in particular the rmph method shows superiority over the qm method both in terms of mean and specifically extremes thus resulting in near zero value of residual bias panel g all over india this can be further confirmed by table 2 which shows the quantitative outcome of this comparative analysis between qm and rmph methods in terms of the all india averaged value of the multi model mean bias in both mean as well as sd from this table we can see that although the qm method is successful in reducing the existing bias in raw gcm simulations the performance of the rmph method is even better particularly in case of extremes both at mean and sd levels thus the effectiveness of rmph method of bias correction in debaising mean variability as well as extremes is established similarly fig 2b depicts a better conformity between the observed and bias corrected monthly variation of precipitation from rmph method than qm method averaged over entire indian mainland on the contrary the performance of multi model raw gcm output is quite poor in capturing the month wise variation of precipitation over india even with a very high uncertainty range this result further strengthens the efficacy of the rmph method of bias correction however in case of bias in trend although the rmph method shows comparatively better performance than the qm method it cannot capture the overall spatial distribution of trend accurately from supplementary table s2 it can be noticed that the observed all india averaged multi model mean trend in annual precipitation is 0 36 mm year the same from qm method is 1 18 mm year and from rmph method is 0 81 mm year though the result from rmph method is closer to the observations still there is a good scope of improvement in capturing overall spatial pattern of trend overall the rmph method is found as an effective bias correction tool and hence it is used in the present study to debias the raw gcm simulated future precipitation data from 14 cmip6 gcms and used for subsequent analysis however we have kept the multi model multi scenario dataset from both the bias correction techniques in an open source data repository https figshare com s 9d978fcff33e86bbf56b and expect it to be helpful for impact assessment studies hydrologic modelling etc 4 2 future projected changes in precipitation across india 4 2 1 changes in seasonal variation of precipitation in this section we present the future projections of annual precipitation as well as for four different seasons viz summer monsoon postmonsoon winter and its spatio temporal evolution across india from an aggregated analysis of 14 state of the art bias corrected rmph method cmip6 gcms the summery of this assessment for all seasons two emission scenarios ssp 245 and 585 and over two future time periods near and far future period is provided in figs 3 4 and 5 in terms of spatial distribution of changes and trend bar plots of multi model ensemble mme mean changes and future projected time series along with uncertainty respectively the quantitative outcome of this analysis i e mme mean and its 95 confidence interval averaged over entire india except the north most hilly region is provided in table 3 similar table for all six hpzs can be found in table s3 of supplementary information fig 3 first row depicts an overall increase in annual precipitation in all parts of india over future under both the scenarios except a small portion of northeast india where some minor reduction is visible in near future under ssp245 overall in terms of absolute changes panel a the central part of india western ghats and northeast india show considerable increase thus resulting in maximum amount of increase in the high precipitation zones such as hpz 3 and hpz 6 see fig 4 however in terms of percentage change panel b low precipitation zones hpz 1 or hpz 4 shows the highest amount of increase causing a substantial increase in northwest and southern part of the country as confirmed by panel b of fig 3 also we see the extent of increase both absolute and percentage gets stronger with the passage of time in far future and under higher forcing scenario i e ssp585 annual precipitation is projected to increase by 188 85 mm 147 99 mm in near future and by 530 04 mm 288 99 mm in the far future period under ssp585 ssp245 scenario over its average value of 1152 mm in the base period 1981 2010 if we observe the time series plot or probability density functions pdfs of annual precipitation fig 5 not much difference is visible between both the scenarios in near future period i e up to 2060 however the far future period the difference between ssp245 and ssp585 becomes significantly pronounced the time series becomes more or less stationary in ssp245 green line but keeps on increasing significantly under ssp585 red line probably indicating more anthropogenic activities towards end of this century eoc this observation is also reflected in the trend plots of annual precipitation panel c of fig 3 where mostly similar pattern and magnitude of trend can be seen in near future period under both the scenarios however in far future period most part of india is not showing any significant trend at 5 significance level shown by grey colour in maps under ssp245 whereas on the contrary almost entire india is having some statistically significant trend towards eoc under ssp585 in quantitative terms mme mean trend of 55 20 mm decade 51 08 mm decade in near future period across india gets strengthened weakened in the far future period with a mme mean trend of 107 77 mm decade 23 48 mm decade following ssp585 ssp245 now it will be interesting to investigate how this increase in annual precipitation gets distributed among four different seasons similar to annual precipitation summer or pre monsoon precipitation mam also shows an overall increasing pattern across india which gets more intense from near to far future period and under ssp585 second row fig 3 in terms of absolute changes maximum amount of increase is visible in the eastern and north eastern part of the country in contrast the high seasonality zones hpz 1 2 and 3 shows the maximum amount of percentage increase in summer precipitation fig 4 the average summer precipitation magnitude of 120 47 mm over the base period is projected to increase by 24 97 mm 12 67 mm in the near future and by 56 69 mm 22 94 mm in the far future period following ssp585 ssp245 unlike annual precipitation most part of india does not show statistically significant trend in summer precipitation over future with a maximum mme mean trend of 9 59 mm decade across india in the far future period under the worst emission scenario the changing pattern of monsoon precipitation jjas is quite similar third row fig 3 to that of annual precipitation because of its 70 contribution in total annual precipitation here also we observe the same portion in northeast india is showing some slight reduction in monsoon precipitation in near future under ssp245 likewise the western ghats and central part of india is showing good amount of absolute changes whereas the low precipitation zones hpz 1 and 4 are having the maximum amount of percentage changes w r t the base period fig 4 the average monsoon precipitation of 785 85 mm over the base period is expected to be increased by 408 47 mm 200 04 mm towards eoc following ssp585 ssp245 the observations of trend analysis and time series plots are again quite similar to that of annual precipitation i e a more or less similar pattern up to mid century and then gradual weakening or strengthening of trend following ssp245 and ssp585 respectively in case of post monsoon precipitation ond a very interesting observation is made unlike earlier cases higher extent of increase is witnessed under the lower forcing scenario i e ssp245 than ssp585 in case of post monsoon precipitation even in case of ssp585 some reduction is noticed in eastern part of india together with northeast india and along the himalayan foothills fourth row fig 3 as expected maximum amount of absolute changes can be seen in the southern part of the country where the influence of northeast monsoon is most however in terms of percentage changes hpz 1 i e the northwest part of india shows the highest level of increase than other hpzs fourth row fig 4 overall 38 52 mm and 66 46 mm increase over the average value of 181 10 mm is projected in near and far future period respectively under ssp245 scenario whereas the same under ssp585 is quite less only 9 05 mm and 58 55 mm in near and far future period respectively these observations can further be confirmed from the time series and pdf plots as in fig 5 fourth row which shows a clear dominance of ssp245 over ssp585 except the last decade of the century trend analysis of post monsoon precipitation reveals maximum trend in the southern part of the country whereas the northern india mostly remains statistically insignificant across india mme mean trend of 15 66 mm decade is expected in the far future period following ssp585 scenario in general india receives very less amount of precipitation 6 of annual precipitation in winter season jf however this multi model analysis projects even lesser amount of winter precipitation in future from spatial analysis a decline in winter precipitation is observed in most part of the country especially in eastern part southern part and along himalayan foothills however this extent of declination gets reduced with the passage of time and under higher forcing scenario nonetheless some amount of increase is also visible in the northwest part of the country hpz 1 especially in the far future period the fig 5 last row depicts the time series of winter precipitation having no clear trend remains mostly same as of its base period similarly the underlying pdfs in future periods do not show any shift from that of base period overall across india mme mean reduction of 3 60 mm and 0 45 mm is projected in near and far future period following ssp245 on the other hand under ssp585 mme mean reduction of 0 72 mm is projected in near future which will be evolved as 6 03 mm increase in far future period trend analysis also reveals that more than 90 of indian mainland does not show statistically significant trend in winter precipitation barring a few scattered places overall this multi model analysis gives a robust signal of wetter climate for entire india having the obvious spatial diversity and inter model uncertainty with major contribution coming from summer and monsoon season and relatively weaker or negative contribution from post monsoon and winter precipitation generally the low precipitation zones especially hpz 1 is showing consistent increase in precipitation in all seasons further the level of increase in precipitation across all hpzs are getting enhanced with time and under the highest forcing indicating the possible impacts of anthropogenic activities towards changing pattern of climate 4 2 2 changes in different levels of extreme precipitation in this section we present the multi model projected changes in different levels of extreme precipitation in future across india towards this we have considered two different levels of measures for extreme precipitation a 95th percentile of wet day precipitation p95 and b annual maximum daily precipitation amdp additionally to compare the changes in the level of extremes with that in the level of mean we have also considered the median or 50th percentile of wet day precipitation p50 the analysis is exactly same as in case of seasonal precipitation i e the absolute changes percentage changes in different levels of precipitation are evaluated along with a trend analysis under two forcing pathways the results are summarized in figs 6 7 and 8 in terms of spatial distribution bar plots and time series plots with uncertainty in projection respectively furthermore the quantitative outcomes of this analysis are presented in table 4 in terms of mme mean changes along with its uncertainty band 95 confidence interval in general a similar pattern of increase is noticed in case of 50th and 95th percentile precipitation in terms of the spatial distribution fig 6 the increase is mostly observed in the westerns ghats gujrat portion and north central part of india largely the high seasonality zones such as hpz 1 2 and 3 are projected to have the maximum amount of increase fig 7 similar to seasonal precipitation here also the amount of increase gets more intensified towards eoc and under the worst scenario ssp585 however the extent of percentage increase is higher in case of 95th percentile than 50th percentile for instance 22 66 12 84 mme mean increase is projected for 50th percentile in the far future period whereas the same for 95th percentile is 25 66 13 74 following ssp585 ssp245 the difference becomes even more pronounced in case of the higher level extreme i e amdp which is reported to be increased by 44 85 24 87 w r t the base period towards eoc following ssp585 ssp245 almost double increase than the increase in median precipitation this indicates that though both mean and extreme precipitation are increasing under the changing climate the rate of increase is much higher in case of extremes than mean which is expected to have more detrimental impacts on society including flooding crop damages health hazards erosion and water contamination problems guhathakurta et al 2011 pall et al 2011 rajeevan et al 2008 from the trend analysis panel c fig 6 we see that most southern india and some part of western india is having statistically significant trend in future whereas northern india mostly remains statistically insignificant except in far future period under ssp585 generally the high seasonality zones are showing maximum amount of trends although the hpz 6 is also showing good amount of trend in amdp towards eoc averaging the trends over entire india mme mean value of 0 35 2 33 and 7 07 mm decade is reported for p50 p95 and amdp respectively in the far future period under ssp585 the key observations from time series plots and underlying pdfs fig 8 of all three levels of precipitation for future time periods remain mostly same as that in seasonal precipitation a continuous temporal evaluation towards wetter side is observed in all three levels following both the emission pathways however till the year 2060 i e in the near future period not much difference is observed between ssp245 and ssp585 however after 2060 the time series of all three levels of precipitation mostly remains stationary under ssp245 green line whereas the plots for ssp585 red line keep on increasing thus resulting in almost two times more increment towards eoc than ssp245 furthermore the time series plots depict more pronounced increase above the baseline in case of extremes especially amdp than median precipitation similar observations can also be confirmed from the pdfs panel b fig 8 the pdfs in near future period under ssp245 and ssp585 does not have much difference however in the far future period considerable shift towards higher values is observed moreover the general nature of shift in pdfs in future periods is more noticeable in case of extremes than that in median precipitation 4 2 3 changes in monthly variation of precipitation fig 9 shows the mme mean monthly cycle of precipitation over future periods across india and its six hpzs following two scenarios a common observation from all the plots is an unequivocal increase in monthly precipitation especially for the high rainfall months however the dry months dec to march mostly remain dry or gets even drier noticeable amount of increase starts since summer months like april and may and reaches maximum in late monsoon months like august and september in general the seasonal pattern does not get disturbed rather get intensified across all six hpzs over future similar to our earlier findings here also maximum amount of increase is visible in case of low precipitation zones such as hpz 1 and 4 and least increase in high precipitation zones hpz 3 and 6 4 3 precipitation based climate changes hotspots across india over future as explained in section 3 3 seven precipitation change indicators are evaluated and rescaled for all four seasons for each 14 cmip6 gcms followed by calculation of their mme mean and finally the phi over future periods following two forcing pathways the final result is shown in fig 10 in the form of spatial distribution of phi or in other words precipitation change susceptibility maps over near and far future period under ssp245 and ssp585 the places with high low values of phi indicates high low susceptibility to precipitation changes thus the dominant changing pattern with high values of phi emerges in northwest western coast and northeast part of the country towards eoc under both scenarios western states like gujrat maharashtra rajasthan and north eastern states like assam show the maximum values of phi indicating significant level of precipitation changes in future on the other hand northern states such as punjab haryana uttarakhand uttar pradesh mostly in the gangetic plain gangetic west bengal or eastern coastal regions of andhra pradesh shows comparatively lower values of phi depicting lesser degree of changes in precipitation however all these less susceptible places also exhibit increase in phi i e increasing susceptibility with the passage of time in future interestingly in the near future period some parts of coastal odisha shows distinctly high values of phi than other obvious aforementioned places like northwest or western coastal regions of india this can be explained with the help of supplementary fig s2 or s4 which shows the actual and rescaled values of all 7 indicators for all 4 seasons in near future period following ssp245 and ssp585 from these figures we observe that the variability of precipitation especially in post monsoon season has particularly increased in that region along with that the number of drier seasons has significantly increased over most of the seasons with reduction in winter and post monsoon precipitation in that portion in near future though this indicates drying in true sense and the phi being bidirectional in nature gives a very high value compared to other places in india however in the far future period various places in northwest india western coast southern part and northeast india emerges as highly susceptible hotspot regions because of high values of various indicators such as δp δpvar δpex fwet δpfwet see supplementary fig s3 and s5 all indicating wetter future over those regions in general increase in phi values is observed across the country with the passage of time and under the worst emission scenario ssp585 very similar to our earlier observations on changes in seasonal or extreme precipitation therefore considering the phi map over far future period and ssp585 the precipitation based climate changes hotspots are identified over india at first a non parametric kernel pdf of phi is developed for all grid points across india for the aforementioned time period and scenario then the area under the pdf is split into four different parts on the basis of 25th 50th and 75th percentile of phi values and accordingly the entire india mainland is categorised into four susceptibility zones i severely susceptible zone red zone phi phi75 ii highly susceptible zone orange zone phi50 phi phi75 iii moderately susceptible zone yellow zone phi25 phi phi50 and iv less susceptible zone green zone phi phi25 out of these four zones the first two red and orange zones are recognised as precipitation based climate changes hotspots in this study the finally obtained zoned hotspot map is shown in fig 11 b further analysis on spatial distribution of these hotspots across hpzs reveals that the hpz 1 and hpz 6 have the maximum spatial extent of hotspots more than 75 area in these two zones are susceptible to high to severe changes in precipitation over future fig 11d moreover the area averaged values of phi over both these two zones are higher than phi75 1 83 hence marked as red bar in fig 11d interestingly the fundamental reason for both these zones of completely different nature of precipitation characteristics hpz 1 low precipitation high seasonality hpz 6 high precipitation low seasonality to be recognised as hotspots is different the high value of phi over hpz 1 is attributed from very high level of increase in mean and extreme precipitation but variability of precipitation has hardly changed rather some reduction is noticed over all four seasons in that zone supplementary fig s5 on the contrary the hpz 6 shows lesser extent of increase in δp or δpex but the precipitation variability has increased substantially in this zone with consequently increasing values of fwet and fdry for various seasons supplementary fig s5 thus both these zones of drastically distinct precipitation climatology gets simultaneously identified as hotspots but for different reasons apart from these two zones the hpz 3 i e the western ghats region also shows high value of area averaged phi 1 74 with approximately 70 area exposed to high to severe changes in precipitation however unlike hpz 1 and 6 here major contribution towards this 70 area of hotspot comes from orange zone not from red zone thus the average phi value 1 74 phi75 is also quite lesser than hpz 1 or 6 hence marked as orange in fig 11d on the other hand in cases of hpz 2 4 and 5 less than 50 of their area is exposed to hotspots for hpz 5 the spatial extent is least only 20 thus in turn resulting in the minimum value of area averaged phi 1 55 yellow bar in fig 11d as well overall approximately 50 of indian mainland is expected to be precipitation based climate changes hotspots towards eoc additionally we developed the hotspot map for india over the recent past 1981 2020 with reference to 1951 1980 period using the imd gridded observations supplementary fig s6 a reasonably good similarity can be noticed between the observed and future projected hotspot maps e g the north east portion western ghats southern india parts of north west india along with some expected mismatches as well e g parts of eastern coast northern and western india it is now well established fact that earth s climate has changed in past sarkar and maity 2021 trenberth et al 2003 and will continue to change in future too madakumbura et al 2019 however the spatio temporal pattern of changes might not remain same over the time thus such alteration in the hotspot pattern between the observed or historical and future hotspot is expected and does not contradict our findings 4 4 key vulnerable cities for precipitation change across india over future similar to the hotspot maps we further develop the future precipitation based vulnerability map for india using the proposed index pvi for near and far future periods following both ssp245 and ssp585 scenario to develop these maps the earlier obtained phi values are used along with future projected pd data for the year 2060 and 2100 and latest available hdi data year 2015 the final result is shown in supplementary fig s7 which shows the spatial distribution of pvi or in other words precipitation based vulnerability maps similar to hotspot map the entire indian mainland is categorised into four different zones of vulnerability supplementary fig s8 on the basis of the pvi values in far future period following ssp585 a compare between the final hotspot map fig 11b and the vulnerability map supplementary fig s8b reveals an interesting observation although the parts of western india including the thar desert rann of kutch parts of northeast india parts of kerala are identified as hotspots with high climatic exposure these are not highly vulnerable because of very less pd or high hdi for kerala on the contrary in spite of having low to moderate climatic exposure himalayan foothills including parts of uttar pradesh bihar and north bengal parts of odisha and chhattisgarh are identified as highly vulnerable regions because of very high pd or low hdi over those places finally on the basis of the vulnerability map in far future period following ssp585 we identify the key vulnerable cities with changing precipitation characteristics towards this we have considered all tier i cities total 493 cities within our study area i e the cities with more than 1 lakh population as per census 2011 in india https www census2011 co in city php accessed on august 2021 out of those 493 cities 202 cities i e 41 cities are identified as vulnerable cities red orange zone with expected high to severe changes in future precipitation that means four out of ten tier i cities will be exposed to hotspots towards eoc which is quite alarming the list of these 202 hotspot cities along with their pvi values is provided in table s3 of supplementary information however for brevity in representation we filtered out 89 cities with population more than 5 lakhs out of total 493 tier i cities and identified 41 cities approximately 46 among them to be hotspots to precipitation changes the location of these 89 cities with different coloured markers red orange yellow and green is shown in fig 12 to distinguish them under different zones of vulnerability we expect this will serve as a useful piece of information for urban planners and policy makers to plan adequately before facing the challenging future however it is worthwhile to mention that consideration of sub daily scale precipitation could have been more meaningful for identification of vulnerable cities however sub daily scale analysis is beyond the scope of the current study due to non availability of reliable data over entire india both from observation and model simulations and therefore kept as a future scope of the study although the hotspot patterns are apparently robust under different emission scenarios the results can be subjected to some sources of uncertainty for example in spite of using state of the art cmip6 gcms the number of models and realizations used may not be sufficient enough to capture the full range of uncertainty in the perspective of global climate sensitivity and regional response to global warming taylor et al 2012 thus despite considering mme mean the final results could be sensitive to the number of models and its realizations considered another source of uncertainty can arise from the temporal scale of this analysis which is multi decadal here hence the identified precipitation changes patterns could be overwhelmed by the internal climatic variability for shorter time scales such as decadal or sub decadal periods moreover the assumption of stationary bias in the data is another limitation of the approach in general most of the existing bias correction methods including rmph method inherently assume stationarity in the bias which questions the model applicability in the future particularly in the far future period notwithstanding the overall findings of this study cannot be denied for adopting better preparedness and informed policy formulation for future 5 conclusions this study proposes a new and more inclusive index named precipitation based hotspot index phi to identify the hotspots across the indian mainland considering the most expected changes in the precipitation pattern in the future future simulated precipitation data from 14 state of the art gcms participating in cmip6 under two possible climate change scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 have been utilised for this purpose the raw gcm data is properly bias corrected using a latest copula based technique i e rmph method and made available in public domain https figshare com s 9d978fcff33e86bbf56b next an analysis of this bias corrected future precipitation is carried out at various temporal as well as spatial scales to understand the underlying mechanisms of these hotspot regions finally all the cities a total of 493 across the country with more than 1 lakh population are considered to identify the most vulnerable cities in india overall the key observations of this study are listed below 1 in general a wetter climate is projected across indian mainland with approximately 290 150 mm to 530 260 mm increase in annual precipitation towards the end of this century under various models and scenarios the increase is persistent over the future years and gets more intense with time particularly under the higher emission scenario indicating a potential impact of increased anthropogenic activities on the extreme precipitation 2 this increase in annual precipitation has considerable spatio temporal variations considering different seasons and hpzs season wise the summer and monsoon precipitation contributes the most towards the total increase in annual precipitation whereas the post monsoon shows a relatively weaker level of increase and winter precipitation shows an overall decline thus the wet months are projected to be wetter and dry months will remain mostly the same or even may get drier spatially the low precipitation zones hpz 1 and hpz 4 show the maximum increase in percentage whereas the high precipitation zones like hpz 6 shows the least increase 3 the increase is projected in both the levels of precipitation mean and extremes however the increase in percentage is more in case extremes than the mean level for instance the increase in amdp 45 towards the end of the century is almost two fold than the increase in precipitation median 23 following ssp585 as expected such an alarming level of increase in extreme precipitation is likely to have detrimental impacts on various socio economic sectors of the country 4 based on these future projected changes in various aspects of precipitation such as mean variability and extremes magnitude frequency and intensity the phi is evaluated and accordingly entire indian mainland is categorised into four susceptibility zones red orange yellow and green out of these four color coded regions the red and orange colored zones together are identified as hotspot regions which are projected to have high to severe changes in precipitation towards the end of century under ssp585 scenario these hotspot regions mostly spans in northwest west central west coast northeast and some sub himalayan regions in india 5 zone wise analysis reveals that hpz 1 and hpz 6 are most extensively occupied by the hotspot region as compared to other hpzs almost three fourth of the areal extent of hpz 1 and hpz 6 are exposed to high to severe changes in precipitation on the other hand moderate precipitation zones e g hpz 2 and hpz 5 are projected to face the lowest areal extent exhibiting changes in precipitation 6 finally considering two important socio economic factors viz population density pd and human development index hdi along with the phi another index named precipitation based vulnerability index pvi is defined based on that the key vulnerable tier i cities are identified across india the analysis with 493 indian cities with more than 1 lakh population reveals four out of ten tier i cities will be exposed to high vulnerability towards the end of this century overall the findings of this study on future projected changes in precipitation over india is expected to be beneficial for management of water resources considering in future change such an extent of rise of various levels of precipitation will pose multi dimensional challenges hence suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies are required to be formulated in advance to build resilience against the worst case climate change scenario the precipitation based hotspot map along with identified vulnerable cities within various susceptibility zones may be

precipitation the extremes are also found to be increasing by alarmingly higher rates however the spatio temporal variations of such increments are notably diverse over different seasons in a year and across different homogeneous precipitation zones hpzs in the country therefore a new and more inclusive index named as precipitation based hotspot index phi is developed to identify the precipitation based hotspots i e the places with most pronounced changes in precipitation characteristics the phi considers the changes in various aspects of precipitation such as mean variability and characteristics of extremes magnitude frequency and intensity based on the phi values in the far future period 2061 2100 and for the worst climate change scenario the hotspot regions are identified mostly in the northwest west central west coast and northeast parts of india further considering two important socio economic vulnerability factors population density and human development index along with phi the key vulnerable tier i cities are identified across india the analysis reveals four out of ten tier i cities will be highly vulnerable towards end of this century the findings of this analysis hotspot maps and the data products high resolution bias corrected precipitation dataset are expected to be highly beneficial for impact assessments hydrologic modelling and formulating suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies for india over future keywords climate change hotspots precipitation extremes precipitation based hotspot index phi precipitation based vulnerability index pvi homogeneous precipitation zones hpzs coupled model intercomparison project version 6 cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the observed changes in various natural systems on the earth such as atmosphere oceans land cryosphere and biosphere since the pre industrial era carries the unequivocal signature of anthropogenic climate change and its ever increasing impacts flato et al 2013 if the present rate of greenhouse gas emissions continues in the future as well it will be highly unlikely to limit global warming to the internationally agreed upon target unfccc 2015 of 2 c above the pre industrial baseline knutti et al 2016 roe et al 2019 rogelj et al 2016 however how this global scale warming will manifest at smaller spatial and temporal scales remains a key question to the scientific community for understanding the changing pattern of climate and hence for planning local or national scale adaptation and mitigation strategies therefore among this potential spatial heterogeneity in the climatic responses there exists a need to identify the climate change hotspots i e the places with the strongest and most robust aggregated response to global scale climatic forcing identification of such hotspots and their underlying mechanisms have been a topic of central interest in the earth system research since many years now stocker et al 2013 in particular depicting such hotspots in a map format with strong visual elements termed as hotspots map is highly beneficial from academic as well as policy makers point of view such hotspot mapping can communicate multiple key information in an easier and user friendly manner than a simple text document sometimes along with the climatic exposure the societal vulnerability is also included in identification of hotspots which includes socio economic status sensitivity coping capacity etc of the concerned region de sherbinin 2014 however the quantitative estimates of these measures is always questionable along with their lack of availability and reliability thus although the impacts of climate change are closely associated with societal vulnerability identification of most responsive regions under changing climate is the primary and most crucial step in risk assessment and adaptation strategies towards this we have considered the entire indian mainland as our study area india and south asia as a whole has been identified as one of the highly vulnerable regions under the changing climatic scenario owing to combination of various climatic and socio economic factors such as strong signals of climate change high population density low per capita income developing economy etc de souza et al 2015 mani et al 2018 consequently enormous challenges are expected to be imposed on the agricultural productivity water resources management infrastructure and livelihood of millions of people residing in this part of the globe including india mishra et al 2020 therefore development of hotspot maps for india as the preliminary step for adaptation and mitigation strategies will be decidedly required in near future to alleviate the detrimental effects of climate change and to help build resilience against the worst costello et al 2009 de souza et al 2015 these hotspot maps can be developed for different climatic variables or phenomena which are predominantly affected by the changing climate such as temperature precipitation sea level rise cyclonic activities etc however various recent incidents of floods and flash floods in different parts of india and their damaging impacts suggest a significant alteration in spatio temporal pattern of precipitation across the country for instance the coromandel coast flood in 2015 east and west godavari district flood in 2019 kerala flood in 2018 2019 and 2020 assam flood in 2020 2021 bihar flood in 2019 etc to name a few on the other hand studies report about 20 50 of the indian mainland to be prone to moderate to extreme droughts suman and maity 2021 by the end of this century with an increasing pattern in both intensity and areal extent mallya et al 2016 niranjan kumar et al 2013 sharma and mujumdar 2017 given such challenges the changes in the regular spatio temporal characteristics of precipitation are expected to have widespread implications on the overall availability of water resources and its management thus in turn affecting the food security of a country like india whose economy primarily depends on rain fed agriculture kishore et al 2015 hence developing a precipitation based hotspot map for india is indispensable which sets the primary objective of this study india is a developing country with the second highest population in the world at present most of its cities are very ancient ill planned and densely populated further the inadequate drainage system in most of the cities is likely to cause water stagnation and urban flooding under this future scenario of wet climate thus crores of people living in those cities will face the nuisances created by urban flooding ranging from loss of property disruption in transport and power supply to outbreak of epidemics and even deaths therefore management of urban flooding and identification of such cities vulnerable to increased precipitation is also highly required which sets another objective of this study overall such precipitation based hotspot maps as well as identification of key vulnerable cities are expected to be immensely beneficial to combat future climate change induced precipitation hazards in key locations well in advance however to develop such precipitation based hotspot map an estimate of future projected precipitation at a finer spatio temporal scale is essential which is mostly provided by general circulation models gcms the gcms are considered the most advanced tool for climate projection under different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions currently available worldwide flato et al 2013 however the spatial resolutions at which gcms run are often too coarse to get reliable projections at the regional level for the impact assessment studies barbero et al 2017 kusumastuti et al 2021 maurer et al 2010 mishra et al 2020 moreover the gcms are found to produce precipitation output having significant amount of systematic bias due to their coarse resolution or model parameterizations ashfaq et al 2017 mishra et al 2014 and thus limiting their applicability to various research domains hence bias correction is a mandatory step before using any gcm output especially precipitation data mehrotra and sharma 2021 sarkar and maity 2020a bias correction methodologies have a long history in the literature kusumastuti et al 2021 li et al 2010 maraun 2013 mehrotra and sharma 2019 2016 vrac and friederichs 2015 including techniques such as linear lenderink et al 2007 non linear leander et al 2008 leander and buishand 2007 distribution based quantile mapping mao et al 2015 pierce et al 2015 empirical quantile mapping piani et al 2010 themeßl et al 2011 etc however most of the bias correction methods suffer from one of the following two limitations a they reduce bias in a selected precipitation quantile e g either mean or extreme values and b they exclude zero values from the analysis even though their presence is significant in daily precipitation therefore a recently developed copula based bias correction technique by maity et al 2019 henceforth rmph model is used in this study which de biases the entire range of the precipitation including the mean and different levels of extremes and is particularly suitable for zero inflated precipitation climatology like india comparing it with one of the most popular bias correction methods i e quantile mapping qm method suman et al 2022 reported improved performance for both the mean and extreme precipitation values from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex hence the rmph method is used in this study to correct the bias present in the precipitation output from gcms nonetheless we further compare the performance of rmph and qm methods for the entire study area using gcm simulated precipitation data from the latest version of coupled model intercomparison project i e cmip 6 finally the future projected bias corrected precipitation dataset for india using both rmph and qm methods from multiple state of the art cmip 6 gcms following various shared socio economic pathways is made public by this study by keeping it in an open source data repository see results and discussion section for details we expect that this high resolution multi model multi scenario dataset will be highly beneficial for different impact assessment studies over india apart from just identification of hotspots understanding their underlying mechanism is also very important towards this we present a detailed and comprehensive spatio temporal analysis on likely changes in various attributes of precipitation over future climatologically the precipitation pattern across the indian mainland varies significantly over space as well as time approximately 70 of the annual precipitation is received in four monsoon months june through september in india the monsoon pattern is also different in different parts of the country and is highly influenced by the steep topography of the himalayas and the western ghats apart from the southwest monsoon there is also the northeast monsoon sometimes known as return monsoon that causes rainfall at some parts of india mostly in the southern part of the country during october to december so just an overall pan india analysis of future changes in precipitation will not capture the complete picture of changing precipitation characteristics therefore to conduct a holistic spatio temporal analysis for india we need to perform a spatio temporal division as follows a by dividing an entire year into some number of seasons and b by dividing the indian mainland into some zones of spatially coherent precipitation pattern namely homogeneous precipitation zones or hpzs see methodology section thus in brief this study attempts to develop a future precipitation based hotspot map across india based on multi model multi scenario bias corrected precipitation dataset from cmip 6 based on this map the vulnerability of all tier i cities in india with more than 1 lakh population as per census 2011 is also identified using various socio economic factors in general the future precipitation based hotspot maps as well as the list of key vulnerable cities will be highly beneficial not only for academic or research purposes but for decision making risk analysis impact assessments and planning suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies additionally this study publishes a multi scenario bias corrected precipitation dataset from 14 state of the art cmip6 gcms that may be highly useful for other studies as well 2 data used different versions of cmip as established and monitored by the world climate research programme wcrp provide a fundamental basis for a coordinated international climate research with an incredible technical contribution from several climate modelling centers eyring et al 2016 phase 6 of cmip i e cmip6 is the most recent version that offers substantial improvements over its earlier versions in multiple aspects such as finer horizontal resolution better representation of the synoptic processes and better agreement with the global energy balance supharatid et al 2022 thus more reasonable and reliable projections can be obtained from cmip6 outputs as compared to its previous versions chen et al 2021 di luca et al 2020 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021 we employ daily precipitation data from 14 state of the art cmip6 gcms under r1i1p1f1 initial condition details of these models are shown in table 1 url https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 accessed in december 2021 total 80 years 2021 2100 of future data is obtained that is further divided into two equal parts viz near future period 2021 2060 and far future period 2061 2100 to capture the temporal changes in the precipitation characteristics w r t the base period 1981 2010 two different shared socioeconomic pathways ssps viz ssp245 and ssp585 are considered for each gcm to understand two possible pathways of changes in the future for instance ssp585 is the most pessimistic scenario i e ssp 5 with a target radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 by 2100 in a world with strong economic growth abundant use of fossil fuel resources rapid technological advances but no suitable climate policy gidden et al 2019 on the other hand ssp245 depicts a middle of the road scenario i e ssp 2 with moderate population growth uneven development and income growth across countries and having a target radiative forcing of 4 5 w m2 at the end of the century thus comparison of results obtained between ssp585 and ssp245 will help us to understand the possible impact of higher anthropogenic activity and greenhouse gas emissions in the future the bias present in this gcm simulated dataset is corrected w r t a gridded observational dataset obtained from india meteorological department imd this 0 25 0 25 dataset was developed by pai et al 2014 using observed records of daily rainfall data from 6995 rain gauge stations across india this gridded precipitation dataset from imd perfectly captures the precipitation climatology over india and has been successfully used for various hydroclimatic studies in recent times dash and maity 2019 mishra et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2018 sarkar and maity 2020b 3 methodology as per the set objectives of this study the analysis is done in four stages firstly the raw gcm precipitation data from all 14 models are regrided and bias corrected in the second stage this bias corrected multi model multi scenario dataset is undergone meticulous spatio temporal analysis to understand the impact of changing climate on future precipitation next the precipitation based hotspot map is developed for the country and finally the most vulnerable tier i cities are identified across the country the following sections explain the aforesaid steps in the methodology in detail 3 1 re gridding and bias correction of future simulated rainfall data from gcms the mismatch between spatial resolutions of 14 cmip6 gcms table 1 is taken care of by a standard re gridding technique namely bilinear interpolation and all the datasets are re gridded to a common resolution of 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude same as that of imd data next the rmph method is adopted to correct the bias in gcm simulated precipitation values as explained earlier maity et al 2019 suman et al 2022 in this method the concept of bivariate copula is used to model the association between observed obs and historically simulated precipitation values hsv by developing a joint distribution function over a common historical time period here 1961 2014 then the conditional distribution function obtained from this joint distribution is modified as a mixed distribution with a discrete probability mass at zero to take care of the zero rainfall days this is done by first dividing all the pairs of obs and hsv into three groups i pairs with both obs and hsv having nonzero positive values ii pairs with obs 0 and iii pairs with hsv 0 using these categorized pairs primarily three sets of information are extracted while developing the rmph model a parameters for the best fit copula model for the first set of pairs b a suitable decay function capturing the probability for the second set i e zero obs conditioned on hsv over its entire range and c conditional probability distribution of obs values when hsv 0 i e for the third set of pairs finally by combining all this information a set of conditional probability distribution of obs values given any value of hsv is obtained these are used to obtain the bias corrected precipitation values bcv next considering the future simulated precipitation values as input in place of hsv to this set of conditional distribution function bias corrected precipitation values are obtained for future and used for subsequent analysis for further details about the rmph method and its mathematical background readers may refer to maity et al 2019 although the superiority of the rmph method over the quantile mapping qm another efficient and very popular bias correction technique is already established in detail by suman et al 2022 for cmip5 cordex simulations we further compare their performance using the state of the art cmip6 gcms for applying the qm the best fit probability distributions are identified and fitted to both obs and hsv over a common historical period the selection of the best fit marginal distribution is based on 12 candidate parametric probability distributions e g beta exponential gamma generalized pareto inverse gaussian logistic log logistic lognormal normal rayleigh rician and weibull and two statistical criteria i the fitted marginal distribution should pass the chi square test at 5 significance level and ii it should yield the lowest bayesian information criterion bic 3 2 spatio temporal analysis of future changes in precipitation in order to perform a holistic analysis on future projected changes over the diverse landscape of india we perform a temporal decomposition as well as a spatial decomposition temporally we divide the entire year into four different seasons i summer march april may ii monsoon june july august september iii post monsoon october november december and iv winter january february summer in india is mostly characterized by hot and dry weather with seldom occurrences of local scale thunderstorms followed by a four month long monsoon season with huge amount of rainfall though spatially diverse for most parts of the country due to humid south westerly monsoon wind during the post monsoon season a different monsoon cycle the northeast or retreating monsoon brings dry cool and dense air masses to large parts of india and causes heavy rainfall mostly in the southern part of the country tamilnadu and kerala finally the cold and dry winter season comes with very less amount of precipitation across the country spatially also we divide india into six different zones of spatially coherent precipitation characteristics namely homogeneous precipitation zones hpzs sarkar and maity 2022 this zoning is done by coupling two important features of precipitation i average annual precipitation p and ii seasonal variation of monthly precipitation over the base period 1981 2010 using the observational records from imd the seasonality is quantified using an information theory based metric named apportionment entropy ae further details on this zoning can be found in the supplementary information section a1 the hpz map of india and its development from the scatter plot between p and ae are shown in fig 1 the originally obtained hpz map in fig 1b is slightly modified in fig 1c with a hatched portion in the north most part of the country jammu kashmir and ladakh region this portion is not considered in subsequent analysis in this study because of questionable reliability of the imd data in this region kothawale and rajeevan 2017 detailed information on these six hpzs their selection criterion full name abbreviation etc are listed in supplementary table s1 nevertheless the hpz 1 or low precipitation high seasonality zone can be seen in the western part of india predominantly consisting of gujrat and rajasthan the hpz 2 or moderate precipitation high seasonality zone can be found in the central part of india mostly spanning eastern uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh the windward side of western ghats forms the hpz 3 or high precipitation high seasonality zone the hpz 4 or low precipitation low seasonality zone can be mainly observed in the peninsular india the hpz 5 or moderate precipitation low seasonality zone is rather dispersed at multiple places across india mostly in the eastern part of the country parts of the eastern coast in southern india parts of northern india uttarakhand and himachal pradesh and some portion in north east india as well lastly the hpz 6 or high precipitation low seasonality zone can be mostly found in northeast india and kerala now using this spatial and temporal decomposition we perform three different sets of analysis in the first set of analysis the projected changes in seasonal precipitation are explored the second set of analysis is designed to capture the changes in different levels of precipitation extremes over future and the likely changes in monthly variation of precipitation is examined in the third set of analysis in the first and second set of analysis the changes in different precipitation variables are expressed in terms of absolute changes i e the changes in magnitude and percentage changes w r t the base period 1981 2010 additionally a trend analysis is also performed to identify the places with statistically significant trend and its magnitude the mann kendall test at 5 significance level is performed to detect the significant trend and sen s slope method sen 1968 is used to evaluate the magnitude of the trend 3 3 identification of precipitation based climate changes hotspots here we use a climate response based approach to identify the precipitation based climate changes hotspots across india over future in this approach hotspot is defined as a region where climate variables here precipitation are showing particularly pronounced response under a certain scenario of global climate change characterization of such climate response based hotspots can provide key information to identify and investigate primary processes of regional scale climate change giorgi 2006 similar to diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 here we also use the concept of standard euclidean distance sed to quantify a new index named precipitation based hotspot index phi which encapsulates the total change in multi dimensional precipitation characteristics between the baseline and future periods this new index considers some additional precipitation change indictors δ compared to some other similar indices used in earlier studies such as diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 and turco et al 2015 and thus presents a more inclusive scenario of changing characteristics of precipitation comprising the changes in the mean and variability of seasonal precipitation along with the extremes their magnitude frequency and intensity mathematically it is expressed as 1 phi i 1 n δ j 1 n s δ ij max δ ij 2 where δij is the ith change indicator in the jth season at each grid point here we consider total 7 precipitation change indicators thus n δ 7 for 4 seasons separately summer monsoon post monsoon and winter so n s 4 these 7 indicators include i percentage change in mean precipitation δp ii percentage change in the inter annual coefficient of variation of the detrended precipitation δpvar iii percentage change in the 95th percentile precipitation δpex iv frequency of wetter seasons i e seasons with higher than the maximum precipitation in the base period fwet v percentage increase in average precipitation in the wetter seasons w r t the maximum in the base period δpfwet vi frequency of drier seasons i e seasons with lower than the minimum precipitation in the base period fdry vii percentage decrease in average precipitation in the drier seasons w r t the minimum precipitation in the base period δpfdry additional inclusion of three indicators viz δpex δpfwet and δpfdry makes the index phi more informative than some similar indices as stated earlier for instance δpex considers the changes in the level of extreme precipitation on the other hand fwet and fdry take care of the number of seasons with higher than maximum and lower than minimum precipitation in the future and thus consider the frequency information however the intensity perspective remains absent i e by what extent this maximum or minimum will shoot above or fall below respectively in the future hence the present study includes δpfwet δpfdry which indicates the percentage change in the average precipitation in the future exceeding subceeding the maximum minimum precipitation in the base period thus the inclusion of these three additional indicators takes care of the magnitude frequency as well as intensity aspect of extreme precipitation for further clarification about all 7 indicators readers can see the section a2 of supplementary information where one hypothetical example is illustrated overall these seven change indicators δij are designed to incorporate various attributes of precipitation such as mean variability extremes its frequency and intensity into the phi hence different change indicators will have different ranges of their values therefore the δij values need to be scaled before summing up to determine phi as depicted in eqn 1 this scaling is done by dividing each change indicator by their maximum absolute value max δij across the study area as our analysis considers two future scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 and two time periods near future and far future we rescaled each indicator of both the scenarios and time periods using the maximum value in the far future period under the highest forcing i e ssp585 across the study area thus this approach yields a relative metric of aggregated precipitation changes that can be directly compared between any regions within the study area forcing pathways and future time periods overall considering 7 precipitation change indictors for 4 different seasons gives a total of 28 dimensions at each grid point thus by limiting the values of phi between zero and 28 5 29 however it must be noted that similar to other earlier indices the phi is also a comparative index which means a small phi value does not necessarily imply a small absolute change but only a small climate response compared to other places within the study area moreover from eq 1 it is evident that this phi index is bi directional in nature i e the index cannot differentiate between a place with a strong increase in precipitation and a place with a strong decrease in precipitation and designate them as equally problematic under climate change 3 4 identification of key vulnerable cities in order to identify the key vulnerable cities we have considered all tier i cities total 493 cities within our study area i e the cities with more than 1 lakh population as per census 2011 in india https www census2011 co in city php accessed on august 2021 vulnerability is an important issue in climate change adaptation and mitigation studies as per flato et al 2013 vulnerability is defined as the propensity of a region to be adversely affected by climate hazards in other words vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to and unable to cope with the adverse effects of climate change parry et al 2007 thus vulnerability becomes a function of i climatic exposure or hotspots and ii the coping capacity or adaptability of the region the coping capacity or adaptability of a region depends on various socio economic factors such as population density per capita income educational facilities heath infrastructure technological advancement economic development etc however the availability and reliability of such socio economic data are highly questionable hence based on some earlier studies ionescu et al 2009 torres et al 2012 we considered two internationally accepted vulnerability factors vfs with reliable data sources i population density pd and ii inverse of human development index hdi socio economic vulnerability is higher for densely populated regions for various obvious reasons such as higher sewage demand more traffic more impervious area etc on the other hand socio economic vulnerability is higher for the regions with lower hdi value hdi is one of the key global indictors for development which conveniently combines three important social indicators health income and education into a single non dimensional measure between 0 and 1 low hdi implies a generally low standard of living such as a poor sanitation system inadequate health infrastructure slow economic growth and low literacy levels all these factors significantly influence the population s adaptive capacity for climate change particularly for extreme precipitation hence the inverse of hdi is used as one vf in this study therefore using these two vfs pd and hdi along with phi we define another index named precipitation based vulnerability index pvi to identify the key vulnerable cities across india pvi can be formulated as 2 pvi s p h i i 1 n sv f i n where pvi is the multiplication of standardised phi sphi and the geometric mean of the standardised vulnerability factors svf n 2 is the number of vfs including pd and inverse hdi thus eq 2 gets modified as 3 pvi s p h i spd 1 shdi where spd is the standardised population density and shdi is the standardised human development index as the theoretical ranges of phi 0 5 29 pd 0 and hdi 0 1 are completely different from each other they need to be standardised to the same scale before using in eq 3 which is done by some empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf therefore the values of pvi get limited between 0 and 1 to determine future pvi values the phi values can be obtained from the future simulated gcm output as explained earlier in section 3 3 however to get future projected values of pd are obtained from a recent publication by jones and o neill 2016 they developed a new set of global spatially explicit future population scenarios that are consistent with the new ssps and made publicly available data source https www cgd ucar edu iam modeling spatial population scenarios html accessed in august 2022 however in case of hdi no such future projections are available hence here we use the latest available data for the year 2015 for hdi from kummu et al 2018 with a reasonable assumption that its relative spatial distribution will remain more or less same over future this global sub national scale gridded hdi dataset was prepared based on various human development reports hdrs by united nations development programme undp this data is also publicly available through https doi org 10 5061 dryad dk1j0 accessed in august 2022 4 results and discussion 4 1 efficacy of rmph method for bias correction both the rmph and qm methods of bias correction are developed between daily scale imd observed precipitation data and historically simulated precipitation from each of those 14 gcms over a common time period 1961 2014 as both the bias correction methods are applied on the daily scale data it would be indeed required to judge the model performance from the statistics of the bias corrected series at aggregated time scales such as monthly or annual therefore the efficacy of these two bias correction techniques in correcting the bias in daily as well as aggregated time scale is examined by considering five precipitation derived statistics viz i annual precipitation p ii monthly precipitation mp iii 95th percentile of wet day greater than1 mm day precipitation p95 iv annual maximum daily precipitation amdp and v monthly variation of precipitation needless to mention the variables p and mp will be used to judge the effectiveness of bias correction in aggregated time scale p95 and amdp will be for two different levels of extremes and monthly variation will help to confirm the correctness of the seasonal pattern further to judge their performance in capturing the low frequency variability we considered the standard deviation sd of these five statistics along with their mean the results for the first four variables are shown in fig 2a for the mean level it can be observed that the raw simulated gcm output panel b mostly underestimates observed precipitation panel a especially in case of extremes on the other hand the bias corrected data from both techniques panels c and d shows a reasonably improved agreement with the observed data in particular the rmph method shows superiority over the qm method both in terms of mean and specifically extremes thus resulting in near zero value of residual bias panel g all over india this can be further confirmed by table 2 which shows the quantitative outcome of this comparative analysis between qm and rmph methods in terms of the all india averaged value of the multi model mean bias in both mean as well as sd from this table we can see that although the qm method is successful in reducing the existing bias in raw gcm simulations the performance of the rmph method is even better particularly in case of extremes both at mean and sd levels thus the effectiveness of rmph method of bias correction in debaising mean variability as well as extremes is established similarly fig 2b depicts a better conformity between the observed and bias corrected monthly variation of precipitation from rmph method than qm method averaged over entire indian mainland on the contrary the performance of multi model raw gcm output is quite poor in capturing the month wise variation of precipitation over india even with a very high uncertainty range this result further strengthens the efficacy of the rmph method of bias correction however in case of bias in trend although the rmph method shows comparatively better performance than the qm method it cannot capture the overall spatial distribution of trend accurately from supplementary table s2 it can be noticed that the observed all india averaged multi model mean trend in annual precipitation is 0 36 mm year the same from qm method is 1 18 mm year and from rmph method is 0 81 mm year though the result from rmph method is closer to the observations still there is a good scope of improvement in capturing overall spatial pattern of trend overall the rmph method is found as an effective bias correction tool and hence it is used in the present study to debias the raw gcm simulated future precipitation data from 14 cmip6 gcms and used for subsequent analysis however we have kept the multi model multi scenario dataset from both the bias correction techniques in an open source data repository https figshare com s 9d978fcff33e86bbf56b and expect it to be helpful for impact assessment studies hydrologic modelling etc 4 2 future projected changes in precipitation across india 4 2 1 changes in seasonal variation of precipitation in this section we present the future projections of annual precipitation as well as for four different seasons viz summer monsoon postmonsoon winter and its spatio temporal evolution across india from an aggregated analysis of 14 state of the art bias corrected rmph method cmip6 gcms the summery of this assessment for all seasons two emission scenarios ssp 245 and 585 and over two future time periods near and far future period is provided in figs 3 4 and 5 in terms of spatial distribution of changes and trend bar plots of multi model ensemble mme mean changes and future projected time series along with uncertainty respectively the quantitative outcome of this analysis i e mme mean and its 95 confidence interval averaged over entire india except the north most hilly region is provided in table 3 similar table for all six hpzs can be found in table s3 of supplementary information fig 3 first row depicts an overall increase in annual precipitation in all parts of india over future under both the scenarios except a small portion of northeast india where some minor reduction is visible in near future under ssp245 overall in terms of absolute changes panel a the central part of india western ghats and northeast india show considerable increase thus resulting in maximum amount of increase in the high precipitation zones such as hpz 3 and hpz 6 see fig 4 however in terms of percentage change panel b low precipitation zones hpz 1 or hpz 4 shows the highest amount of increase causing a substantial increase in northwest and southern part of the country as confirmed by panel b of fig 3 also we see the extent of increase both absolute and percentage gets stronger with the passage of time in far future and under higher forcing scenario i e ssp585 annual precipitation is projected to increase by 188 85 mm 147 99 mm in near future and by 530 04 mm 288 99 mm in the far future period under ssp585 ssp245 scenario over its average value of 1152 mm in the base period 1981 2010 if we observe the time series plot or probability density functions pdfs of annual precipitation fig 5 not much difference is visible between both the scenarios in near future period i e up to 2060 however the far future period the difference between ssp245 and ssp585 becomes significantly pronounced the time series becomes more or less stationary in ssp245 green line but keeps on increasing significantly under ssp585 red line probably indicating more anthropogenic activities towards end of this century eoc this observation is also reflected in the trend plots of annual precipitation panel c of fig 3 where mostly similar pattern and magnitude of trend can be seen in near future period under both the scenarios however in far future period most part of india is not showing any significant trend at 5 significance level shown by grey colour in maps under ssp245 whereas on the contrary almost entire india is having some statistically significant trend towards eoc under ssp585 in quantitative terms mme mean trend of 55 20 mm decade 51 08 mm decade in near future period across india gets strengthened weakened in the far future period with a mme mean trend of 107 77 mm decade 23 48 mm decade following ssp585 ssp245 now it will be interesting to investigate how this increase in annual precipitation gets distributed among four different seasons similar to annual precipitation summer or pre monsoon precipitation mam also shows an overall increasing pattern across india which gets more intense from near to far future period and under ssp585 second row fig 3 in terms of absolute changes maximum amount of increase is visible in the eastern and north eastern part of the country in contrast the high seasonality zones hpz 1 2 and 3 shows the maximum amount of percentage increase in summer precipitation fig 4 the average summer precipitation magnitude of 120 47 mm over the base period is projected to increase by 24 97 mm 12 67 mm in the near future and by 56 69 mm 22 94 mm in the far future period following ssp585 ssp245 unlike annual precipitation most part of india does not show statistically significant trend in summer precipitation over future with a maximum mme mean trend of 9 59 mm decade across india in the far future period under the worst emission scenario the changing pattern of monsoon precipitation jjas is quite similar third row fig 3 to that of annual precipitation because of its 70 contribution in total annual precipitation here also we observe the same portion in northeast india is showing some slight reduction in monsoon precipitation in near future under ssp245 likewise the western ghats and central part of india is showing good amount of absolute changes whereas the low precipitation zones hpz 1 and 4 are having the maximum amount of percentage changes w r t the base period fig 4 the average monsoon precipitation of 785 85 mm over the base period is expected to be increased by 408 47 mm 200 04 mm towards eoc following ssp585 ssp245 the observations of trend analysis and time series plots are again quite similar to that of annual precipitation i e a more or less similar pattern up to mid century and then gradual weakening or strengthening of trend following ssp245 and ssp585 respectively in case of post monsoon precipitation ond a very interesting observation is made unlike earlier cases higher extent of increase is witnessed under the lower forcing scenario i e ssp245 than ssp585 in case of post monsoon precipitation even in case of ssp585 some reduction is noticed in eastern part of india together with northeast india and along the himalayan foothills fourth row fig 3 as expected maximum amount of absolute changes can be seen in the southern part of the country where the influence of northeast monsoon is most however in terms of percentage changes hpz 1 i e the northwest part of india shows the highest level of increase than other hpzs fourth row fig 4 overall 38 52 mm and 66 46 mm increase over the average value of 181 10 mm is projected in near and far future period respectively under ssp245 scenario whereas the same under ssp585 is quite less only 9 05 mm and 58 55 mm in near and far future period respectively these observations can further be confirmed from the time series and pdf plots as in fig 5 fourth row which shows a clear dominance of ssp245 over ssp585 except the last decade of the century trend analysis of post monsoon precipitation reveals maximum trend in the southern part of the country whereas the northern india mostly remains statistically insignificant across india mme mean trend of 15 66 mm decade is expected in the far future period following ssp585 scenario in general india receives very less amount of precipitation 6 of annual precipitation in winter season jf however this multi model analysis projects even lesser amount of winter precipitation in future from spatial analysis a decline in winter precipitation is observed in most part of the country especially in eastern part southern part and along himalayan foothills however this extent of declination gets reduced with the passage of time and under higher forcing scenario nonetheless some amount of increase is also visible in the northwest part of the country hpz 1 especially in the far future period the fig 5 last row depicts the time series of winter precipitation having no clear trend remains mostly same as of its base period similarly the underlying pdfs in future periods do not show any shift from that of base period overall across india mme mean reduction of 3 60 mm and 0 45 mm is projected in near and far future period following ssp245 on the other hand under ssp585 mme mean reduction of 0 72 mm is projected in near future which will be evolved as 6 03 mm increase in far future period trend analysis also reveals that more than 90 of indian mainland does not show statistically significant trend in winter precipitation barring a few scattered places overall this multi model analysis gives a robust signal of wetter climate for entire india having the obvious spatial diversity and inter model uncertainty with major contribution coming from summer and monsoon season and relatively weaker or negative contribution from post monsoon and winter precipitation generally the low precipitation zones especially hpz 1 is showing consistent increase in precipitation in all seasons further the level of increase in precipitation across all hpzs are getting enhanced with time and under the highest forcing indicating the possible impacts of anthropogenic activities towards changing pattern of climate 4 2 2 changes in different levels of extreme precipitation in this section we present the multi model projected changes in different levels of extreme precipitation in future across india towards this we have considered two different levels of measures for extreme precipitation a 95th percentile of wet day precipitation p95 and b annual maximum daily precipitation amdp additionally to compare the changes in the level of extremes with that in the level of mean we have also considered the median or 50th percentile of wet day precipitation p50 the analysis is exactly same as in case of seasonal precipitation i e the absolute changes percentage changes in different levels of precipitation are evaluated along with a trend analysis under two forcing pathways the results are summarized in figs 6 7 and 8 in terms of spatial distribution bar plots and time series plots with uncertainty in projection respectively furthermore the quantitative outcomes of this analysis are presented in table 4 in terms of mme mean changes along with its uncertainty band 95 confidence interval in general a similar pattern of increase is noticed in case of 50th and 95th percentile precipitation in terms of the spatial distribution fig 6 the increase is mostly observed in the westerns ghats gujrat portion and north central part of india largely the high seasonality zones such as hpz 1 2 and 3 are projected to have the maximum amount of increase fig 7 similar to seasonal precipitation here also the amount of increase gets more intensified towards eoc and under the worst scenario ssp585 however the extent of percentage increase is higher in case of 95th percentile than 50th percentile for instance 22 66 12 84 mme mean increase is projected for 50th percentile in the far future period whereas the same for 95th percentile is 25 66 13 74 following ssp585 ssp245 the difference becomes even more pronounced in case of the higher level extreme i e amdp which is reported to be increased by 44 85 24 87 w r t the base period towards eoc following ssp585 ssp245 almost double increase than the increase in median precipitation this indicates that though both mean and extreme precipitation are increasing under the changing climate the rate of increase is much higher in case of extremes than mean which is expected to have more detrimental impacts on society including flooding crop damages health hazards erosion and water contamination problems guhathakurta et al 2011 pall et al 2011 rajeevan et al 2008 from the trend analysis panel c fig 6 we see that most southern india and some part of western india is having statistically significant trend in future whereas northern india mostly remains statistically insignificant except in far future period under ssp585 generally the high seasonality zones are showing maximum amount of trends although the hpz 6 is also showing good amount of trend in amdp towards eoc averaging the trends over entire india mme mean value of 0 35 2 33 and 7 07 mm decade is reported for p50 p95 and amdp respectively in the far future period under ssp585 the key observations from time series plots and underlying pdfs fig 8 of all three levels of precipitation for future time periods remain mostly same as that in seasonal precipitation a continuous temporal evaluation towards wetter side is observed in all three levels following both the emission pathways however till the year 2060 i e in the near future period not much difference is observed between ssp245 and ssp585 however after 2060 the time series of all three levels of precipitation mostly remains stationary under ssp245 green line whereas the plots for ssp585 red line keep on increasing thus resulting in almost two times more increment towards eoc than ssp245 furthermore the time series plots depict more pronounced increase above the baseline in case of extremes especially amdp than median precipitation similar observations can also be confirmed from the pdfs panel b fig 8 the pdfs in near future period under ssp245 and ssp585 does not have much difference however in the far future period considerable shift towards higher values is observed moreover the general nature of shift in pdfs in future periods is more noticeable in case of extremes than that in median precipitation 4 2 3 changes in monthly variation of precipitation fig 9 shows the mme mean monthly cycle of precipitation over future periods across india and its six hpzs following two scenarios a common observation from all the plots is an unequivocal increase in monthly precipitation especially for the high rainfall months however the dry months dec to march mostly remain dry or gets even drier noticeable amount of increase starts since summer months like april and may and reaches maximum in late monsoon months like august and september in general the seasonal pattern does not get disturbed rather get intensified across all six hpzs over future similar to our earlier findings here also maximum amount of increase is visible in case of low precipitation zones such as hpz 1 and 4 and least increase in high precipitation zones hpz 3 and 6 4 3 precipitation based climate changes hotspots across india over future as explained in section 3 3 seven precipitation change indicators are evaluated and rescaled for all four seasons for each 14 cmip6 gcms followed by calculation of their mme mean and finally the phi over future periods following two forcing pathways the final result is shown in fig 10 in the form of spatial distribution of phi or in other words precipitation change susceptibility maps over near and far future period under ssp245 and ssp585 the places with high low values of phi indicates high low susceptibility to precipitation changes thus the dominant changing pattern with high values of phi emerges in northwest western coast and northeast part of the country towards eoc under both scenarios western states like gujrat maharashtra rajasthan and north eastern states like assam show the maximum values of phi indicating significant level of precipitation changes in future on the other hand northern states such as punjab haryana uttarakhand uttar pradesh mostly in the gangetic plain gangetic west bengal or eastern coastal regions of andhra pradesh shows comparatively lower values of phi depicting lesser degree of changes in precipitation however all these less susceptible places also exhibit increase in phi i e increasing susceptibility with the passage of time in future interestingly in the near future period some parts of coastal odisha shows distinctly high values of phi than other obvious aforementioned places like northwest or western coastal regions of india this can be explained with the help of supplementary fig s2 or s4 which shows the actual and rescaled values of all 7 indicators for all 4 seasons in near future period following ssp245 and ssp585 from these figures we observe that the variability of precipitation especially in post monsoon season has particularly increased in that region along with that the number of drier seasons has significantly increased over most of the seasons with reduction in winter and post monsoon precipitation in that portion in near future though this indicates drying in true sense and the phi being bidirectional in nature gives a very high value compared to other places in india however in the far future period various places in northwest india western coast southern part and northeast india emerges as highly susceptible hotspot regions because of high values of various indicators such as δp δpvar δpex fwet δpfwet see supplementary fig s3 and s5 all indicating wetter future over those regions in general increase in phi values is observed across the country with the passage of time and under the worst emission scenario ssp585 very similar to our earlier observations on changes in seasonal or extreme precipitation therefore considering the phi map over far future period and ssp585 the precipitation based climate changes hotspots are identified over india at first a non parametric kernel pdf of phi is developed for all grid points across india for the aforementioned time period and scenario then the area under the pdf is split into four different parts on the basis of 25th 50th and 75th percentile of phi values and accordingly the entire india mainland is categorised into four susceptibility zones i severely susceptible zone red zone phi phi75 ii highly susceptible zone orange zone phi50 phi phi75 iii moderately susceptible zone yellow zone phi25 phi phi50 and iv less susceptible zone green zone phi phi25 out of these four zones the first two red and orange zones are recognised as precipitation based climate changes hotspots in this study the finally obtained zoned hotspot map is shown in fig 11 b further analysis on spatial distribution of these hotspots across hpzs reveals that the hpz 1 and hpz 6 have the maximum spatial extent of hotspots more than 75 area in these two zones are susceptible to high to severe changes in precipitation over future fig 11d moreover the area averaged values of phi over both these two zones are higher than phi75 1 83 hence marked as red bar in fig 11d interestingly the fundamental reason for both these zones of completely different nature of precipitation characteristics hpz 1 low precipitation high seasonality hpz 6 high precipitation low seasonality to be recognised as hotspots is different the high value of phi over hpz 1 is attributed from very high level of increase in mean and extreme precipitation but variability of precipitation has hardly changed rather some reduction is noticed over all four seasons in that zone supplementary fig s5 on the contrary the hpz 6 shows lesser extent of increase in δp or δpex but the precipitation variability has increased substantially in this zone with consequently increasing values of fwet and fdry for various seasons supplementary fig s5 thus both these zones of drastically distinct precipitation climatology gets simultaneously identified as hotspots but for different reasons apart from these two zones the hpz 3 i e the western ghats region also shows high value of area averaged phi 1 74 with approximately 70 area exposed to high to severe changes in precipitation however unlike hpz 1 and 6 here major contribution towards this 70 area of hotspot comes from orange zone not from red zone thus the average phi value 1 74 phi75 is also quite lesser than hpz 1 or 6 hence marked as orange in fig 11d on the other hand in cases of hpz 2 4 and 5 less than 50 of their area is exposed to hotspots for hpz 5 the spatial extent is least only 20 thus in turn resulting in the minimum value of area averaged phi 1 55 yellow bar in fig 11d as well overall approximately 50 of indian mainland is expected to be precipitation based climate changes hotspots towards eoc additionally we developed the hotspot map for india over the recent past 1981 2020 with reference to 1951 1980 period using the imd gridded observations supplementary fig s6 a reasonably good similarity can be noticed between the observed and future projected hotspot maps e g the north east portion western ghats southern india parts of north west india along with some expected mismatches as well e g parts of eastern coast northern and western india it is now well established fact that earth s climate has changed in past sarkar and maity 2021 trenberth et al 2003 and will continue to change in future too madakumbura et al 2019 however the spatio temporal pattern of changes might not remain same over the time thus such alteration in the hotspot pattern between the observed or historical and future hotspot is expected and does not contradict our findings 4 4 key vulnerable cities for precipitation change across india over future similar to the hotspot maps we further develop the future precipitation based vulnerability map for india using the proposed index pvi for near and far future periods following both ssp245 and ssp585 scenario to develop these maps the earlier obtained phi values are used along with future projected pd data for the year 2060 and 2100 and latest available hdi data year 2015 the final result is shown in supplementary fig s7 which shows the spatial distribution of pvi or in other words precipitation based vulnerability maps similar to hotspot map the entire indian mainland is categorised into four different zones of vulnerability supplementary fig s8 on the basis of the pvi values in far future period following ssp585 a compare between the final hotspot map fig 11b and the vulnerability map supplementary fig s8b reveals an interesting observation although the parts of western india including the thar desert rann of kutch parts of northeast india parts of kerala are identified as hotspots with high climatic exposure these are not highly vulnerable because of very less pd or high hdi for kerala on the contrary in spite of having low to moderate climatic exposure himalayan foothills including parts of uttar pradesh bihar and north bengal parts of odisha and chhattisgarh are identified as highly vulnerable regions because of very high pd or low hdi over those places finally on the basis of the vulnerability map in far future period following ssp585 we identify the key vulnerable cities with changing precipitation characteristics towards this we have considered all tier i cities total 493 cities within our study area i e the cities with more than 1 lakh population as per census 2011 in india https www census2011 co in city php accessed on august 2021 out of those 493 cities 202 cities i e 41 cities are identified as vulnerable cities red orange zone with expected high to severe changes in future precipitation that means four out of ten tier i cities will be exposed to hotspots towards eoc which is quite alarming the list of these 202 hotspot cities along with their pvi values is provided in table s3 of supplementary information however for brevity in representation we filtered out 89 cities with population more than 5 lakhs out of total 493 tier i cities and identified 41 cities approximately 46 among them to be hotspots to precipitation changes the location of these 89 cities with different coloured markers red orange yellow and green is shown in fig 12 to distinguish them under different zones of vulnerability we expect this will serve as a useful piece of information for urban planners and policy makers to plan adequately before facing the challenging future however it is worthwhile to mention that consideration of sub daily scale precipitation could have been more meaningful for identification of vulnerable cities however sub daily scale analysis is beyond the scope of the current study due to non availability of reliable data over entire india both from observation and model simulations and therefore kept as a future scope of the study although the hotspot patterns are apparently robust under different emission scenarios the results can be subjected to some sources of uncertainty for example in spite of using state of the art cmip6 gcms the number of models and realizations used may not be sufficient enough to capture the full range of uncertainty in the perspective of global climate sensitivity and regional response to global warming taylor et al 2012 thus despite considering mme mean the final results could be sensitive to the number of models and its realizations considered another source of uncertainty can arise from the temporal scale of this analysis which is multi decadal here hence the identified precipitation changes patterns could be overwhelmed by the internal climatic variability for shorter time scales such as decadal or sub decadal periods moreover the assumption of stationary bias in the data is another limitation of the approach in general most of the existing bias correction methods including rmph method inherently assume stationarity in the bias which questions the model applicability in the future particularly in the far future period notwithstanding the overall findings of this study cannot be denied for adopting better preparedness and informed policy formulation for future 5 conclusions this study proposes a new and more inclusive index named precipitation based hotspot index phi to identify the hotspots across the indian mainland considering the most expected changes in the precipitation pattern in the future future simulated precipitation data from 14 state of the art gcms participating in cmip6 under two possible climate change scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 have been utilised for this purpose the raw gcm data is properly bias corrected using a latest copula based technique i e rmph method and made available in public domain https figshare com s 9d978fcff33e86bbf56b next an analysis of this bias corrected future precipitation is carried out at various temporal as well as spatial scales to understand the underlying mechanisms of these hotspot regions finally all the cities a total of 493 across the country with more than 1 lakh population are considered to identify the most vulnerable cities in india overall the key observations of this study are listed below 1 in general a wetter climate is projected across indian mainland with approximately 290 150 mm to 530 260 mm increase in annual precipitation towards the end of this century under various models and scenarios the increase is persistent over the future years and gets more intense with time particularly under the higher emission scenario indicating a potential impact of increased anthropogenic activities on the extreme precipitation 2 this increase in annual precipitation has considerable spatio temporal variations considering different seasons and hpzs season wise the summer and monsoon precipitation contributes the most towards the total increase in annual precipitation whereas the post monsoon shows a relatively weaker level of increase and winter precipitation shows an overall decline thus the wet months are projected to be wetter and dry months will remain mostly the same or even may get drier spatially the low precipitation zones hpz 1 and hpz 4 show the maximum increase in percentage whereas the high precipitation zones like hpz 6 shows the least increase 3 the increase is projected in both the levels of precipitation mean and extremes however the increase in percentage is more in case extremes than the mean level for instance the increase in amdp 45 towards the end of the century is almost two fold than the increase in precipitation median 23 following ssp585 as expected such an alarming level of increase in extreme precipitation is likely to have detrimental impacts on various socio economic sectors of the country 4 based on these future projected changes in various aspects of precipitation such as mean variability and extremes magnitude frequency and intensity the phi is evaluated and accordingly entire indian mainland is categorised into four susceptibility zones red orange yellow and green out of these four color coded regions the red and orange colored zones together are identified as hotspot regions which are projected to have high to severe changes in precipitation towards the end of century under ssp585 scenario these hotspot regions mostly spans in northwest west central west coast northeast and some sub himalayan regions in india 5 zone wise analysis reveals that hpz 1 and hpz 6 are most extensively occupied by the hotspot region as compared to other hpzs almost three fourth of the areal extent of hpz 1 and hpz 6 are exposed to high to severe changes in precipitation on the other hand moderate precipitation zones e g hpz 2 and hpz 5 are projected to face the lowest areal extent exhibiting changes in precipitation 6 finally considering two important socio economic factors viz population density pd and human development index hdi along with the phi another index named precipitation based vulnerability index pvi is defined based on that the key vulnerable tier i cities are identified across india the analysis with 493 indian cities with more than 1 lakh population reveals four out of ten tier i cities will be exposed to high vulnerability towards the end of this century overall the findings of this study on future projected changes in precipitation over india is expected to be beneficial for management of water resources considering in future change such an extent of rise of various levels of precipitation will pose multi dimensional challenges hence suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies are required to be formulated in advance to build resilience against the worst case climate change scenario the precipitation based hotspot map along with identified vulnerable cities within various susceptibility zones may be

1762,meadow patches are caused by the fragmentation and disappearance of mattic epipedons and can serve as evidence of degradation this is a gradual decline in meadow patch coverage which can result in soil and surface water loss due to increased bare soil surface however little is known about how the loss of mattic epipedons alters soil erosion processes in alpine regions this study sheds light on this topic by conducting simulated rainfall experiments with different rainfall intensities to assess runoff and sediment generation we selected representative degraded alpine meadows on the eastern qinghai tibetan plateau in china the observed temporal variations of runoff and soil loss rates were explained by the presence of two stages of meadow patch coverage decline an increasing and a relatively stable stage compared to 30 and 60 meadow patch coverage 90 meadow patch coverage displayed an extended increasing stage with delayed entrance into the stable stage during the rainfall period the runoff coefficients were significantly higher in 90 and 30 meadow patch coverage than in 60 the sediment concentrations were significantly lower in 90 and 60 meadow patch coverage than in 30 it is worth stressing that 90 meadow patch coverage could prompt more rainfall flowing as runoff and reduce sediment under different rainfall intensities the complex mosaic pattern formed by meadow and bald patches changed the hydrological response of the soil decreasing runoff coefficient in 60 meadow patch coverage the destruction reduction or even disappearance of some mattic epipedons led to a higher sediment concentration in 30 meadow patch coverage the meadow patch coverage exerted a greater influence on sediment yield than on runoff volume although it was generally affected by rainfall intensity our findings highlight the importance of maintaining runoff and reducing sediment through the presence of mattic epipedons mattic epipedons appear as an effective soil erosion control feature and this study offers a theoretical guidance for planning adaptive management strategies for degraded alpine meadows on the qinghai tibetan plateau keywords alpine meadow meadow patch coverage rainfall intensity runoff and soil loss degraded grassland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction alpine meadows are a crucial component of alpine grassland ensuring ecological security and water conservation on the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp miehe et al 2019 sun et al 2021 however many alpine meadows are under threat due to anthropogenic pressures such as non planned land use changes unregulated grazing activities and artificial excavations harris 2010 chen et al 2013 qiu 2014 cheng et al 2021 these issues have resulted in a widespread loss of soil and water in sloping alpine meadows niu et al 2021 liu et al 2022a b sun et al 2022 additionally harsh climate conditions such as extreme rainfall events concentrated during short periods strong winds and freeze thaw cycles exacerbate soil erosion seddon et al 2016 there is also concern that the recent global warming and wetting have intensified the risk of soil water erosion in degraded alpine meadows due to the increase in precipitation and meltwater zhang et al 2022 over the past few decades more than half of the alpine meadows on the qtp have undergone increasing levels of degradation bardgett et al 2021 however there is still a great deal of debate regarding the inducement of meadow degradation by human activities and climate change harris 2010 dong et al 2022 moreover while the formation and expansion of bare soil patches caused by the fragmentation and loss of mattic epipedons is a clear indication of meadow degradation there is no consistent consensus on the consequences of such degradation shang et al 2018 the hydrothermal hole effect induced by the formation and expansion of bare soil patches can lead to abnormal flow of water and heat flux through the bare surface exacerbating meadow degradation shang et al 2018 dong et al 2020 cui et al 2022 previous studies have shown that bare patches become progressively drier resulting in the gradual death and peeling off of mattic epipedon and the expanding of bare patches liang et al 2010 dong et al 2020 moreover depressed bare areas can significantly affect surface runoff soil erosion and sediment transport processes in alpine meadow hillslopes xiao et al 2019 niu et al 2021 recent studies by liu et al 2020 and niu et al 2021 have observed that high values of alpine meadow patches coverage mpc with poor permeable layers tend to produce large amounts of surface runoff while reducing soil loss the dense root soil mixed layer of mattic epipedon can reduce soil particle detachment caused by raindrop splash and prevent soil particles from being stripped and washed away by runoff jiang et al 2021 therefore studying the influence of alpine meadow patch coverage on runoff and sediment generation processes is crucial for maintaining the ecological and hydrologic functions of the alpine meadows the extremely high elevation mean altitude of 4500 m a s l and special atmospheric circulation thermodynamics of these landscapes cause the unique rainfall characteristics such as rain drop size distribution intensity and duration over the qtp gao et al 2018 convective storms in the summer can generate up to 60 90 of the total annual rainfall which has been well demonstrated through observations maussion et al 2014 several studies showed that summer rainfall events are more frequent and can generate higher intensities 4 mm h 1 in shorter durations 1 3 h in the qtp than that in other pasture regions porcù et al 2014 ji et al 2017 the special rainfall characteristics will inevitably affect the runoff and sediment generation processes on alpine meadow hillslopes both observations and model simulations have shown that higher erosion rates are activated during high intensity rainfall events and are predicted to increase under possible climate change patterns puntenney desmond et al 2020 singh et al 2023 meadow patches can influence runoff generation and water infiltration through surface depressions under any rainfall scenarios zhao et al 2021 liu et al 2022a however the response features of runoff and sediment are different depending on the rainfall regime scenarios ayele et al 2021 bajirao et al 2021 kumar et al 2022 for example niu et al 2021 found that sediment concentration in low mpc 30 under a heavy rainfall scenario was about 4 34 6 51 times higher than that under a light one higher mpc contributes to higher runoff coefficients and lower sediment concentrations which is more pronounced under heavy rainfall scenarios liu et al 2020 niu et al 2021 compared to bare areas the lower infiltration rates observed in mattic epipedons convert rainfall into runoff quickly under heavy rainfall events liu et al 2022b when the runoff exceeds the soil water storage capacity a large accumulation of water in depressions can cause soil erosion however the available results about this topic are contradictory among some studies for example slightly degraded grassland with higher mpc can produce more runoff than heavily degraded grassland with lower mpc liu et al 2019b niu et al 2021 while other studies have found that more seriously degraded grasslands produce more runoff and sediment jeffery et al 2014 yang and lu 2018 valente et al 2021 we hypothesize that the contradiction may be largely attributed to the relationship between the mpc and the rainfall intensity in the alpine meadows alpine meadow degradation causes the fragmentation destruction and even disappearance of mattic epipedons which will inevitably lead to soil erosion sun et al 2020 the previous study made by niu et al 2021 well determined the regulation of meadow patches on runoff and sediment under natural rainfall however under natural conditions may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the soil erosion processes in degraded alpine meadows as it is impossible to collect all the possible ranges of rainfall intensities during long term monitoring periods to better understand the process of runoff and sediment generation under different rainfall intensities this study conducted rainfall simulation experiments with varying intensities and short durations the objectives were a to quantify the runoff and sediment rates under different rainfall intensities in different mpc and b to determine how both mpc and rainfall intensity influence runoff and sediment production in degraded alpine meadows by revealing how the loss of mattic epipedons alters soil erosion processes this study provides a basis for soil erosion estimation on the qinghai tibet plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the zhique village 33 40 01 n and 99 43 06 e dari county located in the southern part of golog tibetan autonomous prefecture qinghai province fig 1 a the average altitude of the area is above 4200 m and the climate is classified as subhumid alpine with an average annual temperature of 4 the minimum and maximum monthly temperatures are 12 9 in january and 9 1 in july respectively the area experiences no distinct four seasons and it can only be distinguished as either warm or cold the cold season is usually dry and lasts 7 8 months while the warm season is short and lasts 4 5 months the average annual rainfall ranges from 474 to 541 mm with most rainfall concentrated between may and september under these conditions the grass growing season lasts about 156 days https www nmic gov cn the soil in the study area is classified as alpine meadow soil according to the chinese soil classification system zhang et al 2020 the main vegetation types include alpine meadows kobresia pygmaea kobresia humilis and kobresia capillifoli as the dominant species alpine shrubs potentilla fruticose and salix cupularis as the dominant species and swamp meadows poa annua carex parva and carex atrofusca as the dominant species 2 2 plot characteristics and performances three representative meadows with a slope gradient of 20 and similar soil properties were selected to perform the experiments replicating similar environmental conditions at each slope the meadows were classified as slightly degraded meadow with 90 mpc moderately degraded meadow with 60 mpc and severely degraded meadow with 30 mpc niu et al 2021 fig 1b nine closed 2 m2 runoff plots 2 0 1 0 m2 were constructed using sheet steel borders 30 cm high and 2 mm thick on each degraded meadow a triangular flow collector was installed in the soil at the outflow section of each runoff plot to collect runoff and sediment 2 3 rainfall simulation experiments representative rainfall events were simulated using a portable rainfall simulator with a height of 3 0 m above the center of the runoff plot fig 1c the rainfall intensity was controlled by a water pressure valve which was calibrated prior to the experiment six rain gauges were placed at the edge of the plot to monitor the rainfall intensity and uniformity of the simulated rainfall according to the rainfall frequency and characteristics of the historical hydrological data for the study area the rainfall intensities were set to 30 60 and 90 mm h 1 corresponding to high and very high erosivity rainfall runoff events liu et al 2022a the simulated rainfall duration for each rainfall intensity was 60 min similar to the duration of flash rainfall events samples of runoff and soil loss were collected in plastic buckets at 1 min intervals within the first 10 min after runoff generation then at 2 min intervals within the subsequent 10 20 min and finally at 5 min intervals until the end of the simulated rainfall all collected samples were settled for 24 h and then the supernatant was discarded after this the sediment samples were filtered and oven dried at 105 for 72 h 2 4 statistical

relatively stable stage fig 2 a b c compared to 30 and 60 mpc 90 mpc displayed an extended increasing stage with delayed entrance into the stable stage during the rainfall period the highest and the lowest runoff rates were observed at 90 mpc and 60 mpc respectively under all tested rainfall intensities under rainfall intensities of 30 60 and 90 mm h 1 the stable stage of runoff generation appeared in 90 mpc at around 0 48 1 10 and 1 75 l min 1 and in 60 mpc at around 0 06 0 43 and 0 90 l min 1 respectively the sequence of runoff rates and cumulative runoff volume during the different rainfall events followed this pattern 90 30 60 mpc the sediment rates in all mpc plots reached the maximum value within the first 10 min after the onset of the simulated rainfall and the peak of sediment yield of 90 mpc appeared significantly later than the peaks of 30 and 60 mpc fig 3 a b c the sediment rates and cumulative sediment yield during the different rainfall events followed the

sediment yield and cumulative runoff volume under different rainfall intensities showed diverse power functions fig 4 90 mpc tended to register a large runoff volume and 30 mpc tended to have a large sediment yield the linear regression equations derived from the relationship between runoff sediment yield and rainfall intensity in the different mpc plots were presented in fig 5 showing a positive correlation between runoff sediment yield and rainfall intensity with increasing rainfall intensity the differences between the runoff and sediment yields of the distinct mpc increased and were more marked the regression slopes β obtained from the relationship between runoff volume and rainfall intensity showed that the maximum value β 1 415 belonged to 90 mpc and the minimum value β 0 846 belonged to 60 mpc fig 5a linear regression analysis of rainfall intensity and sediment yield indicated that the highest slope β 0 374 and the lowest one β 0 024 belonged to 30 mpc and 90 mpc fig 5b 3 3 meadow patch and rainfall intensity determine runoff and sediment yields the two way anova was used to assess the effect of mpc and rainfall intensity on runoff volume sediment yield runoff coefficient and sediment concentration the effects of both mpc and rainfall intensity on the designated variables were all significant at a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 table 1 runoff coefficients of all mpc plots increased with rising rainfall intensity but the difference in mpc caused the variability among the treatments runoff coefficients of 30 and 90 mpc were significantly higher than that of 60 mpc p 0 05 and followed this trend 90 30 60 mpc considering all tested rainfall intensities fig 6 as the mpc and rainfall intensity increased the sediment concentration decreased sediment concentration of 90 mpc was significantly lower than that of 30 and 60 mpc and followed the order 30 60 90 mpc fig 7 therefore mpc caused significant changes in sediment concentration under all rainfall intensities 4 discussion alpine meadows are a critical component of the alpine ecosystem however extensive degradation has led to large bare surfaces which have become a key factor for the severe soil erosion on the qtp sun et al 2021 the fragmentation and disappearance of mattic epipedons favor the appearance of meadow patches dong et al 2020 and the process of alpine meadow degradation can be evaluated by quantifying the gradual decrease of mpc moreover the loss of mpc has further induced water and heat loss and accelerated soil erosion shang et al 2018 cui et al 2022

intensity played a significant role in the activation of runoff and sediment yield as well as runoff coefficients and sediment concentration values table 1 previous studies have shown that rainfall intensity determines the runoff and sediment processes with higher rainfall intensity resulting in more runoff and sediment yield liu et al 2019a dunkerley 2020 morán ordóñez et al 2020 as the rainfall intensity rises the size of raindrops and the amount of rainfall per unit time increase mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 therefore in heavy rainfall scenarios higher runoff yields are often accompanied by a greater transport capacity of sediments shi et al 2012 compared to the monotonic positive correlation of rainfall intensity with erosion process mpc has more significant and complex effects on runoff and sediment during the erosion processes runoff and sediment rates in different degraded meadows are associated with the mpc under the same rainfall intensity as reported in both natural and simulated rainfall studies niu et al 2021 cui et al 2022 among all treatments 90 mpc showed the highest runoff rate and the lowest sediment rate figs 2 3 the highly entwined and crisscrossed roots at the mattic epipedon reduce the water permeability and increase the corrosion resistance jiang et al 2021 the lower infiltration rate of mpc enables the rapid conversion of rainfall into surface runoff cui et al 2022 our results are in agreement with liu et al 2019a liu et al 2020 who found that grassland can maintain more runoff reduce sediment and optimize the trade off between catchment water yield and soil conservation regardless of rainfall intensity our study found that the lowest runoff rate occurs in 60 mpc fig 2 this result may be explained by the possible overlap and interaction between various processes firstly the complex mosaic pattern formed in moderately degraded grassland by meadow patches and bald patches creates many depressions and cracks among patches increasing surface roughness and facilitate rainfall infiltration and interception lopez bellido et al 2016 niu et al 2019 liu et al 2022c secondly the interactions and spatial organization of different meadow patches with different connectivity and hydrological behaviors have important implications for runoff generation fiener et al 2011 jiang et al 2021 complex patch mosaics indicate longer runoff pathways and result in run on infiltration and lateral flow increasing detention storage slowing down runoff and peak discharge van dijk et al 2005 assouline and mualem 2006 wu et al 2016a cui et al 2022 thirdly moderately degraded grassland has a high diversity of plant species and complex community structure dickson and foster 2008 plant species diversity significantly impacts soil hydraulic properties and potentially influences soil erosion fischer et al 2015 species diversity also influences soil water infiltration capacity and higher biodiversity improves soil water storage aggregates soil structure porosity and distribution of roots liu et al 2019a our study found that under all rainfall intensities the highest sediment rate occurs in 30 mpc fig 3 as the mpc decreases the destruction reduction or even disappearance of some mattic epipedons lead to the increase of bare land and then trigger soil erosion the exposed soil surface results in high soil bulk density low porosity and low soil organic carbon content which are positively correlated with runoff and sediment yield jiang et al 2021 therefore lower mpc results in more runoff and sediment yang and lu 2018 niu et al 2021 these results show that as mpc increases the runoff coefficient increases but the sediment concentration decreases in recent decades the degradation of alpine meadow has become a focus of attention due to the importance and uniqueness of the qtp ecohydrology and the complicated interrelationships of soil hydrodynamic properties and its associated internal factors niu et al 2019 2021 dong et al 2022 liu et al 2022a 2022b alpine meadow degradation and soil erosion are dynamic and interrelated processes that involve grazing utilization alternate freezing and thawing and wildlife effects harris 2010 shang et al 2018 sun et al 2021 despite considerable progress the current investigations are still in a preliminary stage the underlying mechanisms of meadow patches and associated soil erosion such as patch evolution process connectivity of patches mosaic pattern and water thermal cycle process require more systematic exploration with scientific and accurate methods in the future more research should be conducted considering different types and animals grazing in the qtp and conducting measurements before and after they pass or considering areas with different degree of rock fragment cover slope gradient or soil texture 5 conclusions the present study was conducted to assess the activation of runoff and soil loss of different mpc under 30 60 and 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the results have demonstrated that meadow patches have a positive effect on the runoff and sediment response and this effect was consistent across the different rainfall intensities in 90 mpc the presence of the mattic epipedon reduced soil water permeability and increased soil erosion resistance resulting in increased runoff coefficients increased and decreased sediment yield and sediment concentration the complex mosaic pattern formed by the meadow and bald patches and by the areas with high plant species diversity resulted in a change in the runoff and sediment behavior explaining the lower runoff coefficients in 60 mpc in 30 mpc the destruction reduction or even disappearance of some mattic epipedons led to an increase of bare land contributing to increased sediment concentration these findings emphasize the importance of maintaining runoff and reducing sediment through meadow patches in addition understanding the hydrological behaviors of degraded meadows can aid managers in adopting appropriate ecological restoration technologies however further studies at different scales are required to meticulously evaluate all the components of the hydrological cycle and the evolution processes of meadow patches facilitating adaptive management of degraded meadow restoration as well as improving soil and water conservation in

1762,meadow patches are caused by the fragmentation and disappearance of mattic epipedons and can serve as evidence of degradation this is a gradual decline in meadow patch coverage which can result in soil and surface water loss due to increased bare soil surface however little is known about how the loss of mattic epipedons alters soil erosion processes in alpine regions this study sheds light on this topic by conducting simulated rainfall experiments with different rainfall intensities to assess runoff and sediment generation we selected representative degraded alpine meadows on the eastern qinghai tibetan plateau in china the observed temporal variations of runoff and soil loss rates were explained by the presence of two stages of meadow patch coverage decline an increasing and a relatively stable stage compared to 30 and 60 meadow patch coverage 90 meadow patch coverage displayed an extended increasing stage with delayed entrance into the stable stage during the rainfall period the runoff coefficients were significantly higher in 90 and 30 meadow patch coverage than in 60 the sediment concentrations were significantly lower in 90 and 60 meadow patch coverage than in 30 it is worth stressing that 90 meadow patch coverage could prompt more rainfall flowing as runoff and reduce sediment under different rainfall intensities the complex mosaic pattern formed by meadow and bald patches changed the hydrological response of the soil decreasing runoff coefficient in 60 meadow patch coverage the destruction reduction or even disappearance of some mattic epipedons led to a higher sediment concentration in 30 meadow patch coverage the meadow patch coverage exerted a greater influence on sediment yield than on runoff volume although it was generally affected by rainfall intensity our findings highlight the importance of maintaining runoff and reducing sediment through the presence of mattic epipedons mattic epipedons appear as an effective soil erosion control feature and this study offers a theoretical guidance for planning adaptive management strategies for degraded alpine meadows on the qinghai tibetan plateau keywords alpine meadow meadow patch coverage rainfall intensity runoff and soil loss degraded grassland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction alpine meadows are a crucial component of alpine grassland ensuring ecological security and water conservation on the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp miehe et al 2019 sun et al 2021 however many alpine meadows are under threat due to anthropogenic pressures such as non planned land use changes unregulated grazing activities and artificial excavations harris 2010 chen et al 2013 qiu 2014 cheng et al 2021 these issues have resulted in a widespread loss of soil and water in sloping alpine meadows niu et al 2021 liu et al 2022a b sun et al 2022 additionally harsh climate conditions such as extreme rainfall events concentrated during short periods strong winds and freeze thaw cycles exacerbate soil erosion seddon et al 2016 there is also concern that the recent global warming and wetting have intensified the risk of soil water erosion in degraded alpine meadows due to the increase in precipitation and meltwater zhang et al 2022 over the past few decades more than half of the alpine meadows on the qtp have undergone increasing levels of degradation bardgett et al 2021 however there is still a great deal of debate regarding the inducement of meadow degradation by human activities and climate change harris 2010 dong et al 2022 moreover while the formation and expansion of bare soil patches caused by the fragmentation and loss of mattic epipedons is a clear indication of meadow degradation there is no consistent consensus on the consequences of such degradation shang et al 2018 the hydrothermal hole effect induced by the formation and expansion of bare soil patches can lead to abnormal flow of water and heat flux through the bare surface exacerbating meadow degradation shang et al 2018 dong et al 2020 cui et al 2022 previous studies have shown that bare patches become progressively drier resulting in the gradual death and peeling off of mattic epipedon and the expanding of bare patches liang et al 2010 dong et al 2020 moreover depressed bare areas can significantly affect surface runoff soil erosion and sediment transport processes in alpine meadow hillslopes xiao et al 2019 niu et al 2021 recent studies by liu et al 2020 and niu et al 2021 have observed that high values of alpine meadow patches coverage mpc with poor permeable layers tend to produce large amounts of surface runoff while reducing soil loss the dense root soil mixed layer of mattic epipedon can reduce soil particle detachment caused by raindrop splash and prevent soil particles from being stripped and washed away by runoff jiang et al 2021 therefore studying the influence of alpine meadow patch coverage on runoff and sediment generation processes is crucial for maintaining the ecological and hydrologic functions of the alpine meadows the extremely high elevation mean altitude of 4500 m a s l and special atmospheric circulation thermodynamics of these landscapes cause the unique rainfall characteristics such as rain drop size distribution intensity and duration over the qtp gao et al 2018 convective storms in the summer can generate up to 60 90 of the total annual rainfall which has been well demonstrated through observations maussion et al 2014 several studies showed that summer rainfall events are more frequent and can generate higher intensities 4 mm h 1 in shorter durations 1 3 h in the qtp than that in other pasture regions porcù et al 2014 ji et al 2017 the special rainfall characteristics will inevitably affect the runoff and sediment generation processes on alpine meadow hillslopes both observations and model simulations have shown that higher erosion rates are activated during high intensity rainfall events and are predicted to increase under possible climate change patterns puntenney desmond et al 2020 singh et al 2023 meadow patches can influence runoff generation and water infiltration through surface depressions under any rainfall scenarios zhao et al 2021 liu et al 2022a however the response features of runoff and sediment are different depending on the rainfall regime scenarios ayele et al 2021 bajirao et al 2021 kumar et al 2022 for example niu et al 2021 found that sediment concentration in low mpc 30 under a heavy rainfall scenario was about 4 34 6 51 times higher than that under a light one higher mpc contributes to higher runoff coefficients and lower sediment concentrations which is more pronounced under heavy rainfall scenarios liu et al 2020 niu et al 2021 compared to bare areas the lower infiltration rates observed in mattic epipedons convert rainfall into runoff quickly under heavy rainfall events liu et al 2022b when the runoff exceeds the soil water storage capacity a large accumulation of water in depressions can cause soil erosion however the available results about this topic are contradictory among some studies for example slightly degraded grassland with higher mpc can produce more runoff than heavily degraded grassland with lower mpc liu et al 2019b niu et al 2021 while other studies have found that more seriously degraded grasslands produce more runoff and sediment jeffery et al 2014 yang and lu 2018 valente et al 2021 we hypothesize that the contradiction may be largely attributed to the relationship between the mpc and the rainfall intensity in the alpine meadows alpine meadow degradation causes the fragmentation destruction and even disappearance of mattic epipedons which will inevitably lead to soil erosion sun et al 2020 the previous study made by niu et al 2021 well determined the regulation of meadow patches on runoff and sediment under natural rainfall however under natural conditions may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the soil erosion processes in degraded alpine meadows as it is impossible to collect all the possible ranges of rainfall intensities during long term monitoring periods to better understand the process of runoff and sediment generation under different rainfall intensities this study conducted rainfall simulation experiments with varying intensities and short durations the objectives were a to quantify the runoff and sediment rates under different rainfall intensities in different mpc and b to determine how both mpc and rainfall intensity influence runoff and sediment production in degraded alpine meadows by revealing how the loss of mattic epipedons alters soil erosion processes this study provides a basis for soil erosion estimation on the qinghai tibet plateau 2

similar soil properties were selected to perform the experiments replicating similar environmental conditions at each slope the meadows were classified as slightly degraded meadow with 90 mpc moderately degraded meadow with 60 mpc and severely degraded meadow with 30 mpc niu et al 2021 fig 1b nine closed 2 m2 runoff plots 2 0 1 0 m2 were constructed using sheet steel borders 30 cm high and 2 mm thick on each degraded meadow a triangular flow collector was installed in the soil at the outflow section of each runoff plot to collect runoff and sediment 2 3 rainfall simulation experiments representative rainfall events were simulated using a portable rainfall simulator with a height of 3 0 m above the center of the runoff plot fig 1c the rainfall intensity was controlled by a water pressure valve which was calibrated prior to the experiment six rain gauges were placed at the edge of the plot to monitor the rainfall intensity and uniformity of the simulated rainfall according to the rainfall frequency and characteristics of the historical hydrological data for the study area the rainfall intensities were set to 30 60 and 90 mm h 1 corresponding to high and very high erosivity rainfall runoff events liu et al 2022a the simulated rainfall duration for each rainfall intensity was 60 min similar to the duration of flash rainfall events samples of runoff and soil loss were collected in plastic buckets at 1 min intervals within the first 10 min after runoff generation then at 2 min intervals within the subsequent 10 20 min and finally at 5 min intervals until the end of the simulated rainfall all collected samples were settled for 24 h and then the supernatant was discarded after this the sediment samples were filtered and oven dried at 105 for 72 h 2 4 statistical

runoff and sediment behavior explaining the lower runoff coefficients in 60 mpc in 30 mpc the destruction reduction or even disappearance of some mattic epipedons led to an increase of bare land contributing to increased sediment concentration these findings emphasize the importance of maintaining runoff and reducing sediment through meadow patches in addition understanding the hydrological behaviors of degraded meadows can aid managers in adopting appropriate ecological restoration technologies however further studies at different scales are required to meticulously evaluate all the components of the hydrological cycle and the evolution processes of meadow patches facilitating adaptive management of degraded meadow restoration as well as improving soil and water conservation in

1763,understanding spatial variability of nutrient loading and transport in large lakes and its effect on the eutrophication status are often lacking and hinder effective and sustainable management of lakes yet knowledge on the extent of spatial variability of eutrophication in large shallow tropical lakes hinders sustainable management understanding how eutrophication varies across lakes helps spatially targeted nutrient load mitigation strategies this modelling study assesses how spatial heterogeneity in nutrient loads may drive spatial variability in in lake eutrophication effects for lake tana a large tropical lake we applied a novel method of coupling a 2d application of the flow model duflow with the ecosystem model pclake a zero dimensional food web model we defined different impact zones of major tributaries with a tracer model and simulated ecological processes and food web relations for each impact zone furthermore we defined critical nitrogen and phosphorus loads for each impact zone and the whole lake subsequently we analysed the spatial variability of phytoplankton and aquatic vegetation dynamics among the impact zones as well as the differences in critical loadings the model results indicate different ecological conditions in the impact zones and the importance of spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication reflected in different critical loading the model shows that the north impact zone and northwest impact zone are mainly vegetation dominated and southeast impact zone and southwest impact zone are phytoplankton dominated simulated chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 0 to 59 µg l 1 and the coverage of the vegetation ranged from 1 to 127 g d w m 2 aligning with the range of observed values in the lake we demonstrate that this model approach can help to identify spatial heterogeneity in hydrology and eutrophication as such lakes cannot be regarded as completely mixed systems our new approach demonstrates how spatially variable nutrient loading correspond to variability in eutrophication effects in a large shallow tropical lake and will aid in setting more spatially targeted lake management strategies keywords spatial heterogeneity bifurcation analysis 2d tracer model critical load alternative stable states tropical lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication is one of the most widespread environmental problems of inland water bodies it has undesired effects on ecosystem state and services public health and socioeconomic activities some of these environmental effects in lakes include risk of algal blooms leading to a decrease of water clarity hypoxia and fish kills altering biogeochemical processes and disrupting the aquatic food web scheffer 1998 eutrophication in lakes is caused by excessive loads of nutrients delivered by rivers kane et al 2014 lürling and van oosterhout 2013 the extent of eutrophication could increase as a result of increased nutrient inputs from the intensification of agriculture and the increase of the human population the management and restoration of lakes are often based on reducing the nutrient input to below a critical level critical loads represent an ecological threshold at which there can be an abrupt change in an ecosystem state property or phenomenon or where small changes in an environmental driver produce large responses in the ecosystem scheffer and carpenter 2003 groffman et al 2006 xu et al 2015 it is documented that in shallow lakes eutrophication can lead to an abrupt shift of conditions with alternative stable states either with submerged vegetation or phytoplankton dominated scheffer 1998 janssen et al 2014 however field data of lakes that actually experience alternative stable states are scarce capon et al 2015 this might be due to lakes being in transition for long periods or they switch back and forth easily van geest et al 2007 arani et al 2021 still some empirical evidence for regime shifts in lakes is found ibelings et al 2007 kosten et al 2012 the concept of regime shifts and critical loads in lakes is valuable in defining lake restoration plans and setting nutrient loading targets scheffer and carpenter 2003 janssen et al 2014 critical nutrient inputs can be derived from aquatic ecosystem models several lake models were reviewed by janssen et al 2019a they conclude that to study state transitions in lakes a mechanistic dynamic model is required that include the aquatic food web in this way non linear processes and the relevant feedback are accounted for pclake meets the above criteria janse et al 2010 and is widely used to explore the transition between alternative stable states and to estimate critical nutrient loads many aquatic models often assume lakes are completely mixed systems natural lakes especially large lakes have clear spatial differences both for hydrology and chemistry this is due to factors like complex morphology the different depth and spatially distributed inflow of water and nutrients in shallow lakes these are mainly horizontal differences in deep lakes vertical gradients also exist due to stratification lake characteristics and internal and external connectivity can drive spatial variability janssen et al 2017 liu and qiu 2007 rahm and danielsson 2007 yu et al 2008 fragoso et al 2008 consequently we hypothesize that there are different zones in large shallow lakes based on lake hydrology and distributed inflows of rivers impact zones these impact zones have their own characteristics with different critical nutrient loads which can differ from the critical load when we assume complete mixing the spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication has implications for lake management the effective and sustainable management of eutrophication and lake restoration benefits from a clear understanding of spatial heterogeneity in nutrient loading and hydrology janssen et al 2019a in this way the effort of reducing nutrient loads in specific subbasins can be focused on the parts of the lake that are most vulnerable the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the different biological components of an aquatic ecosystem include seasonal succession of phytoplankton macrophyte growth invasive alien species and lake turbidity ding et al 2015 pringle 1990 rychtecký and znachor 2011 soares et al 2012 xu et al 2020 moreover different residence times influences spatial heterogeneity which is important for a deeper understanding of ecological processes in freshwater lakes it is also a mechanism for maintaining the species diversity of phytoplankton communities most applications of ecological models regard lakes as one complete mixed system this approach disregards spatial differences e g rivers that discharge on the lake will only affect the lake part near the river mouth littoral zones are more shallow than the pelagic zones resulting in different conditions for vegetation growth in this paper we modelled spatial differences in lake tana a large tropical lake to estimate the spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication in a large tropical lake which might facilitate the design of more regional or locally targeted measures the main research questions of this study are 1 what are the different impact zones of the major tributary rivers of lake tana 2 is there spatial variability of eutrophication among the impact zones expressed in nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations 3 what are the critical n and p loads for each impact zone to address these questions we use a novel modelling approach first we define different impact zones of major tributaries in lake tana by using a two dimensional application of the flow and quality model duflow clemmens et al 1993 secondly we determine critical nutrient loads for these impact zones and lake tana separately with the ecosystem model pclake janssen et al 2019 2 methodology 2 1 study area lake tana is a shallow maximum 14 m average 8 m deep occasionally stratifying and large tropical lake found at an altitude of 1800 m a s l it is the largest lake in ethiopia accounting for 50 of the surface water volume of the freshwater resource of the country it has a surface area of ca 3111 km2 28 4 km3 volume and has a maximum length of 90 km and width of 65 km the tana basin has a total drainage area of 16 500 km2 fig 1 more than six medium to large sized tributary rivers and 40 ephemeral streams drain into lake tana among the rivers the gilgel abay dirma gumara gelda rib and megech rivers contribute 90 of the inflow sirak 2008 lake tana is the source of the blue nile which is the only natural surface outflow of the lake in addition there is substantial abstraction of water from the lake for hydropower generation the tana beles hydropower plant rainfall is maximum during july and august at 250 330 mm per month mean annual rainfall is nearly 1280 mm abebe and minale 2017 the rainy season july september receives about two thirds of the annual rainfall while the dry season receives 2 the pre rainy season april june receives 25 and the post rainy season 8 of annual rainfall the average seasonal air temperature reaches its maximum of 21 1 c in the pre rainy season and its minimum 18 4 c in the rainy season with a large diurnal but small seasonal change the population of the basin was projected to be 4 5 million in 2015 csa 2007 with a population density of 228 persons per km2 in 2007 anteneh 2017 and 70 of the basin is agricultural land abebe and minale 2017 in this study we mainly focused on the largest sub basins gilgel abay dirma megech gumara gelda rib arno and garno fig 1 lake tana is an example of a large tropical lake that cannot be considered completely mixed because of multiple inflowing rivers with different discharges and nutrient concentrations spatial variations are observed in phytoplankton nutrient concentrations and vegetation conditions that can affect spatial patterning of critical nutrient loads in lake tana the measured and secondary data about the current trophic conditions of lake tana show spatial variability among the shore open water and river mouths of the lake most of the river mouths and a significantly smaller portion of the lakeshore area show eutrophic conditions and the majority of the lake exhibited more oligotrophic conditions goraw goshu unpublished 2 2 research approach we developed a method to facilitate the analysis of spatial variability of eutrophication in a heterogenous lake summarized in fig 2 we combined two modelling approaches with modifications for our study area based on the models duflow clemmens et al 1993 and pclake janse et al 2010 janssen et al 2019 we used a two dimensional application of the flow and water quality model duflow to perform unsteady flow computations and to simulate tracer distribution in the lake to define so called impact zones using real tracers in field studies is practically impossible in such large systems like lake tana with multiple inflowing rivers thereafter we ran the pclake model for each impact zone separately and for lake tana as one mixed system to simulate ecosystem conditions e g nutrient concentrations phytoplankton vegetation and to give indications of critical nutrient loads for ecosystem transitions janse et al 2010 since pclake has been applied in comparable lakes and is based on fundamental ecological and chemical concepts we apply the model in this observational data limited lake to assess eutrophication effects likely vary across space this analysis provides an example of how to identify the relative contribution of variable nutrient loadings in data limited shallow tropical lakes to prioritize areas for management action but determining specific target levels will require collection of more thorough observational data 2 3 modelling lake tana with a tracer model in duflow 2 3 1 network schematization duflow is designed as a 1d unsteady flow and quality model for this study we set up a 2d application by constructing a dense network of sections in multiple directions to be able to simulate water flow and solute transport in the lake duflow solves the transport equation advection dispersion and the user can add specific physical and bio chemical processes we defined a simple tracer model with only transport and no processes as a first step in the configuration of the duflow model we classified the lake into four depth zones 0 2 m 2 6 m 6 10 m and 10 14 m the 0 2 m deep zone is defined as shore 4 2 6 is littoral 12 6 10 is sublittoral 21 and 10 14 m is classified as a pelagic zone 62 we built the network on a geographical background by adding the bathymetric map of lake tana wale et al 2008 the length of the vertical and horizontal cross sections internode distance ranges from 0 5 km mostly in the shore area to 5 km in off shore zones we defined the width and length of the sections in such a way that the sum of the section areas corresponded with the total lake area 2 3 2 flow model after network schematization we defined initial and boundary conditions for the hydrology and configured the calculation we defined the boundary conditions i e inflow of a tributary river at the edge of the lake system based on discharge monitoring data that were aggregated to monthly discharges furthermore we defined water abstraction to the hydropower plant tana beles and the blue nile outlet as negative discharge and the precipitation surplus total rainfall evaporation on the lake area as negative or positive depending on the net value we configured the model with a calculation time step of one hour and a one day output step once the flow calculation was verified we added the quality model to explore the spatial distribution of solutes coming from separate inflows we defined a multiple tracer quality model the model definition was without chemical processes to simulate the transport of a conservative substance we simulated four different tracers with a starting concentration of 100 mg l 1 in the main inflowing rivers these are the gauged rivers no tracer concentration was defined at other tributary rivers depending on the hydraulic conditions the model will show that the tracers are spread over the lake and possibly transported to the blue nile outlet and tana beles abstraction 2 3 3 delineation of the impact zones of major incoming rivers with the 2d tracer model the impact zone is the area of the lake that is under the specific influence of the feeding tributary river we focused on the major tributary rivers and we grouped the major tributary rivers into four zones south west gilgel abay south east gelda gumara rib north east arno garno and north dirma megech grouping of tributaries was done as some rivers are close to each other and difficult to separate to delineate impact zones of the rivers in the lake we used two indicators from the tracer model the concentration of the four tracers in all sections of the lake and the fraction of one tracer from the sum of all tracer concentrations eq 1 1 f r a c t i 100 t r a c e r i t r a c e r 1 t r a c e r 2 t r a c e r 3 t r a c e r 4 where fracti is the fraction of tracer 1 2 3 or 4 and traceri is the concentration of tracer 1 2 3 or 4 for delineation of the impact zones we used the criteria that fracti 90 and traceri 10 mg l 1 2 4 pclake model configuration for the lake tana impact zones the modelling of n and p critical loads to lake tana with pclake encompassed the hydraulic and nutrient loads from major tributaries to the lake only the major tributary rivers which are gauged were accounted for pclake is a zero dimensional ecosystem model that disregards spatial heterogeneity it is a complex ecological model used to assess the nutritional status of stratified and non stratified freshwater lakes janssen et al 2019b the model includes biological components phytoplankton submerged vegetation zooplankton planktivorous fish and piscivorous fish in a simplified food web and non biological components transparency oxygen inorganic carbon and nutrients janse et al 2010 the model is built in a sequence from primary producers to top predators n and p cycles in the water column and sediments combine with higher levels in the food web janse et al 2010 the marsh area is a pclake module involving a simplified growth model of phragmites australis an emergent species of macrophytes combined with vegetative processes in the sediment and the water column of the marsh area sollie and verhoeven 2008 this area with emergent plants is connected to the open water by a flow of water between them janssen et al 2019b there are four types of lake specific settings to parameterize pclake specific lake characteristics nutrients input lake hydrology and sediment type the specific impact zone characteristics mean depth impact zone area the main wind direction were computed in this study we used arc gis to calculate the fetch and length of the impact zone in the main wind direction the mean depth of each impact zone was estimated in arcgis using a weighted average technique from the bathymetric map of lake tana marsh area a fraction of the lake area was retrieved by taking into account all wetland areas within the catchment of lake tana aynalem et al 2017 the mean fetch of each impact zone was calculated by the square root of the surface area sediment characteristics are parameterized using the data from previous studies the lake tana sediment composition and texture class is predominately clay 67 sand 17 and silt 16 the average organic matter content of the sediment is 16 g kg 1 and the sediment available phosphorus was 19 mg kg 1 kebedew et al 2020 we set up the models for the year 2017 we quantified the monthly n and p loads from the six major sub basins of lake tana from discharge and nutrient data the dynamic simulation of the aquatic ecosystem condition in each impact zone consisted of two parts first the current condition was simulated for which the model was initialized and run for 50 years to reach equilibrium janssen et al 2019a the results in the last 2 years of the simulation were taken as the final output and chlorophyll a concentrations were compared with the measurements of 2016 and 2017 secondly a bifurcation analysis was done for each impact zone separately and for lake tana as one mixed system for this pclake is run sequentially with increasing and decreasing nutrient inputs to find the critical nutrient loads for a shift from phytoplankton dominance to macrophyte dominance and vice versa each run for the bifurcation analysis was done for 30 years and the average of the may september period in the last 2 years of the simulation was taken as the result in this study the ratio between the external n and p loads was measured in 2017 we took this as a reference for the bifurcation analysis with a constant n p ratio the critical nutrient loads were used to identify the required reductions of external nutrient loading to restore the foreseen clear stable state in the lake or in case the clear state is present it is used to identify the maximum loads before it possibly switches to the turbid state janse et al 2008 2 5 hydrology and water quality 2 5 1 water balance of lake tana the water balance is needed to calculate the hydraulic load of the impact zones and the whole lake as input for pclake the water balance was validated with literature data before implementing it the water balance was calculated for the year 2017 as it is the most complete year for the discharge data to and from the lake and nutrient concentrations needed for calculating nutrient fluxes the monthly water balance of lake tana was calculated using equation 2 2 δ s δ t p q g a u g e d q u n g a u g e d e 0 q hp q dam where δ s δ t storage change closure term l3 t 1 p precipitation over lake tana l3 t 1 qgauged surface water discharge from gauge reading near lake inlet l3 t 1 qungauged surface water discharge from ungauged towards lake tana l3 t 1 e0 penman open water evaporation l3 t 1 qhp surface water discharge towards hydropower plant belles l3 t 1 qdam surface water discharge towards blue nile river l3 t 1 the surface water flow to lake tana includes six major sub basins table 1 which are gauged and 14 sub basins that are not gauged groundwater flow within the lake tana basin takes place in a heterogeneous aquifer system with the groundwater flow converging to lake tana however groundwater flow also takes place from the lake tana basin towards the adjacent beles river basin mamo et al 2016 nigate et al 2017 furthermore as concluded by mamo et al 2016 estimated groundwater input to the lake was found to be of minor importance and therefore groundwater flow was excluded from the water balance for this research the detailed computation of the water balance components is described in the supplementary materials 2 5 2 hydraulic loadings the hydraulic loadings of tributary rivers in each impact zone and the lake tana were computed by dividing the sum of the discharges of the tributary rivers in the impact zone by the area of the impact zone estimated based on the tracer model study eq 3 water discharge data of a tributary for each month in 2017 were obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water electric and irrigation 3 h l r i 1 m q i a where hlr is the hydraulic loading rate m s 1 qi is the discharge at the gauging stations at a site i m3 s 1 a is the area of the impact zone m2 m is the number of discharge measurements 2 5 3 nutrient loadings the water sampling and analysis of the different nitrogen and phosphorus species are described in detail in goshu et al 2020 the din or dip load to the impact zone and lake tana g s 1 is a product of din or dip concentration g m 3 and discharge m3 s 1 see eq 4 based on our data set and because daily discharge and monthly nutrient concentrations were available for the year 2017 the average load to the impact zone was calculated by multiplying the average discharge and the average concentration de vries and klavers 1994 providing 4 l i 1 m q i m j 1 n c j n where l is a load of din or dip g s 1 qi is the discharge at the gauging stations at the time i m3 s 1 cj is the concentration at different times j g m 3 m is the number of discharge measurements n is the number of concentration measurements chlorophyll a was measured as an indicator for the phytoplankton concentration during three periods august 2016 december 2016 and march 2017 water samples for chlorophyll a analysis were taken at 143 locations at lake tana in a spatial grid of 5 km by 5 km and chlorophyll a samples were also collected from the rivers monthly for 2017 the chlorophyll a concentration was determined using the acetone extraction procedure wetzel and likens 1991 from the analysis a map of the chlorophyll a over the lake was constructed using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique in arcgis 3 results 3 1 current ecological condition of the lake based on measurements 3 1 1 current status of eutrophication the effect of eutrophication in lake tana clearly showed spatial variability among the shore littoral pelagic and river mouth stations of the lake most of the river mouths and a small part of the lakeshore and littoral areas showed relatively high nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations especially after the rainy season jun sep the majority of the lake exhibited oligotrophic conditions based on chlorophyll a concentration see fig 3 3 1 2 chlorophyll a in littoral pelagic and river mouths of lake tana the chlorophyll a concentration in lake tana shows high spatial and temporal variability and ranged from 0 5 to 191 µg l 1 fig 3 generally the chlorophyll a concentrations were highest in the river mouths average 87 µg l 1 and lowest in the pelagic zone average 14 µg l 1 except for some inshore and littoral areas where temporally low chlorophyll a concentrations were found this might be caused by the presence of water hyacinth infestation and its ecological effect of depleting nutrients and shading gezie et al 2018 the three sampling periods august 2016 december 2017 and march 2017 show clear seasonal variability in chlorophyll a concentrations during the rainy season august 85 of lake tana had chlorophyll a concentrations below 4 µg l 1 in december 2016 post rainy season the chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 0 5 µg l 1 to 148 µg l 1 and more than half of the lake 56 had chlorophyll a concentration between 4 and 27 µg l 1 finally in march 2017 dry season the chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 0 5 µg l 1 to 191 µg l 1 with 59 of the lake having concentrations above 20 µg l 1 spatial and temporal variations of chlorophyll a concentrations were observed also in the river mouths of dirma gilgel abay gelda gumara and rib table 2 the chlorophyll a concentrations in the river mouths were generally higher than in the lake 22 8 351 5 µg l 1 probably because of low flow velocities and high nutrient concentrations in these areas spatially the minimum chlorophyll a concentration was noted in the gilgel abay river mouth and the maximum was measured in the rib river mouth nevertheless there were no significant spatial and temporal differences in chlorophyll a concentrations among the river mouths p 0 05 repeated measures anova n 60 based on the monthly measurements in 2017 the minimum chlorophyll a was noted in the rainy season and the maximum was noted in post rainy and pre rainy seasons for most of the river mouths 3 2 delineation of the impact zones of major incoming rivers the contours of the impact zones were defined by the tracer study for may september and december of the year 2017 fig 4 we observed a direct relationship between the river basin area and the impact zone area the larger the river basin area and the subsequent river discharge the larger the impact zone the southwest impact zone has the largest area in all months study except december the northeast impact zone has the smallest area in all months of the model study generally the impact zones have the smallest area in the dry season may and the largest in the post rainy season december surprisingly the impact zones are mainly confined in the shore and littoral parts of the lake and do not cover the pelagic part fig 4 based on the impact zones delineation we computed the different characteristics of the separate zones needed for the pclake modelling these include the fetch marsh area and mean depth table 3 and the monthly n and p load table 5 3 3 hydrology and water balance the water balance study of lake tana shows that the water level drops during dry and pre rainy seasons and increases in the rainy season fig 5 table 4 this water level change is well considered in the duflow modelling fig 5 displays the seasonal variation in water balance of lake tana for 2017 table 4 gives the calculated annual water balance terms of lake tana the main inflow of water to lake tana is coming from the gauged sub basins furthermore evaporation exceeds precipitation on an annual basis table 4 the lake exhibits water storage from may until september with the largest positive storage for july and august despite the outflow flowing into the hydropower plant tana beles and the monitored part of the blue nile there is a large cumulative closure term in the water balance of lake tana at the end of the year which should be compensated by an additional loss term from the lake this large closure term might be because the largest part of the outflow towards the blue nile river is not monitored 3 4 simulation of ecological indicators and critical nutrient loads of the four impact zones and lake tana the simulation of phytoplankton showed chlorophyll a dominance in the southeast and southwest zones maximum chlorophyll a 40 and 70 µg l 1 compared with the north and northeast zones maximum chlorophyll a 3 5 and 1 6 µg l 1 see fig 6 a in contrast vegetation was more dominant in the north and northeast impact zones maximum vegetation 135 and 245 g d w m 2 than the southeast and southwest impact zones maximum vegetation 0 2 and 0 2 g d w m 2 fig 6b the simulation results of tn tp and secchi depth are shown in annex 2 the bifurcation analyses of the four impact zones and lake tana as one mixed system are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 this bifurcation run was done with a changing p load throughout the year coupled to the n load with an tn tp ratio based on the incoming nutrient fluxes this approach reflects the effect of a combined reduction of n and p loads to the impact zones the average tn tp ratio was 4 9 however with a substantial variation among the different the impact zones 2 2 to 8 8 table 5 all impact zones show a clear deviation from the redfield n p ratio of 16 tett et al 1985 indication relative high p loads the bifurcation analysis clearly indicates critical loadings except for northeast zone where a linear increase of chlorophyll with increasing p load is found the north and southwest impact zones display hysteresis 2 critical loadings with alternative stable states furthermore figs 7 and 8 show that for the two impact zones that are in the turbid state high chlorophyll a the external nutrient loading should be reduced considerably to around 10 of the current load to switch back to the clear vegetation state in contrast the current nutrient loads for the two impact zones that exhibit vegetation dominance clear state are predicted to be below the critical values 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity with the approach presented here we show the importance of spatial variability in analysing the ecological condition and determining critical loads in a large lake variability in lake conditions is strongly related to the locations and magnitude of the in flowing rivers the results for the separate impact zones show clear differences among each other and also when compared with modelling the lake as one mixed system the simulated chlorophyll a concentrations deviate to some extent from the observed chlorophyll a concentrations fig 3 and fig 6a although in line with the observations especially if we consider the average chlorophyll a concentrations in the impact zones we found that the order of the impact zones for chlorophyll a concentrations is the same for the model and the observations with highest average concentrations in the southwest and lowest in the northeast table 6 the temporal variation of higher concentrations in march 2017 compared with august 2016 is clear and reflects the actual observations according to the model there are vegetation dominance and low chlorophyll a concentrations in impact zones north and northeast and the other way around in southeast and southwest impact zones this finding is consistent with previous studies in lake tana dersseh et al 2019 wondie et al 2012 in these studies the spatial potential of aquatic vegetation infestation was estimated based on a multivariate analysis with total phosphorus total nitrogen temperature ph salinity and depth as main parameters the researchers concluded that the north and northeast regions have the highest potential for vegetation dominance which was later confirmed with satellite image observations dersseh et al 2020 our finding of spatial variability of eutrophication in lake tana is also reported in other tropical and sub tropical large lakes of the world lake taihu southeast china is a good example of a large shallow lake with high spatial variation macrophytes are established at the shores and in the bays whereas they are absent in the lake s centre due to strong wind janssen et al 2014 xu et al 2015b zhao et al 2013 the study by soares et al 2012 reported that the tropical funil reservoir brazil demonstrated spatial heterogeneity that could affect the occurrence and distribution of algal blooms along the reservoir the fluvial intermediate and lentic compartments this supports the conclusion that high spatial heterogeneity in macrophytes and phytoplankton abundance suggests variation in the responses to eutrophication within the lake differences in lake morphology can already result in spatial variation with water depth being an important morphological factor regulating macrophyte abundance in lake tana most of the studied littoral zones have comparable depths but still differ in macrophyte cover which can be attributed to different nutrient inputs this variation results in spatial patterning of critical nutrient loads in lake tana 4 2 critical loads and bifurcation analysis the critical nutrient loads for the impact zones and the lake as a whole are summarized in table 7 these are derived from the average current loads table 5 and the reduction factors multipliers from figs 7 and 8 the presented reduction factors are an annual average and given the variability of the current monthly loads these can only be used indicatively however the critical loads estimated here enable a comparison with other studies in lakes where critical loads were estimated from table 7 it is evident that current nutrient loads to southeast and southwest impact zones are higher than the estimated critical loads to these impact zones on the other hand we found a different ecological condition in the north and northeast impact zone where the phytoplankton is less dominating lake tana is a large tropical lake with a mean depth of 8 m but the impact zones are generally only 2 m deep this is comparable to shallow dutch and chinese lakes where pclake was applied in janse et al 2008 critical p loadings were determined that can be considered representative of dutch shallow lakes it was observed that for a default lake see exact settings in janse et al 2008 critical bifurcation points of the lake turning from a turbid to clear and clear to the turbid state were 0 9 mg p m 2 d 1 and 3 mg p m 2 d 1 respectively the general numbers for lake tana are similar table 6 but the range is larger 0 1 to 28 5 mg m 2 d 1 possibly due to the spatial heterogeneity of the impact zones with different characteristics studies with pclake for deeper lakes such as described in li et al 2019 for lake dianchi with an average depth of 4 9 m showed critical loadings of 0 34 mg m 2 d 1 and 0 38 mg m 2 d 1 furthermore lakes with larger depths will have lower critical p loadings because less submerged macrophytes will be present due to less favourable light conditions in deeper lakes janse 2005 janse et al 2008 this causes more nutrients available for the growth of phytoplankton causing more turbid conditions at lower nutrient loadings 4 3 model uncertainties though pclake was originally parameterized for shallow temperate lakes janse et al 2010 the ecological and chemical concepts can be applied to lake tana to provide a comparative first cut assessment of relative spatial variability this is supported by studies where the model in its present form has been applied successfully in several tropical and subtropical lakes janssen et al 2017 li et al 2019 kong et al 2017 fragoso et al 2008 a multi lake study showed that the original pclake model was able to predict reasonably well the dominance of macrophytes or phytoplankton in approximately 80 large lakes from around the world janssen et al 2014 still the model results should be considered with care and the focus should be on patterns rather than on absolute values of the output we acknowledge that the derived critical loads for lake tana contain uncertainties but comparison with critical loads in other regions shows that the values for lake tana can be plausible lake tana is one of the first attempts of applying pclake to african lakes future monitoring and modelling in tropical lakes can contribute to reducing the uncertainties specifically frequent observations of n and p concentrations phytoplankton transparency and vegetation cover and densities in addition although the processes and feedbacks in the model are generic process parameters and environmental conditions have to be determined on a local scale 4 4 implications studies conducted in china and brazil have shown the importance of spatial heterogeneity of shallow lakes janssen et al 2017 fragoso et al 2008 for ecological modelling as well as defining nutrient management options large tropical lakes like lake tana are traditionally treated as completely mixed systems because of this the traditional approach of nutrient management has only limited success our research in this lake has clearly shown that importance of spatial heterogeneity in terms of eutrophication effects and critical nutrient loads our spatial modelling provides new insights into exploring the effects of eutrophication in a large shallow tropical lake we demonstrate that lake tana is a heterogeneous lake and the conditions that drive this are likely to be existing also in other lakes the modelled impact zones clearly show spatial differences in n and p critical loadings implying that each zone has a different nutrient reduction target therefore in impact zones like the southeast and southwest parts of lake tana priority should be given to nutrient reduction measures lake managers could aim to reduce the present nutrient load to below the lowest critical nutrient load in these impact zones the major n and p sources of lake tana are animal manure synthetic fertilizers and human waste goshu et al 2020 therefore nutrient reduction measures from the above sources should be practiced in sub basins of prioritized impact zones of lake tana measures should be within the social and economic possibilities of the regions 5 conclusions this study showed that there are clear distinct impact zones in lake tana related to the main tributaries with different characteristics both the measurements and the modelling with pclake show that the current ecological status has spatial variability over the lake and among the impact zones critical nutrient loadings vary among the impact zones implying that each zone has a different reduction target for lake tana it is clear that in north impact zone and northeast impact zone the current level of p load is below the critical loading in the other two zones the current loading is above the critical loading so in the southeast and southwest parts of the lake the river loading should be decreased substantially the critical loadings of n and p are quite different when we take lake tana as one mixed system our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication to determine sub catchment critical nutrient loads in a relatively large lake we acknowledge that the derived critical loads for lake tana contain uncertainties comparison with critical loads in other regions has limited value but it shows that the values for lake tana can be plausible future monitoring and modelling in tropical lakes can contribute to reducing the uncertainties nevertheless we believe that the general conclusion of importance of spatial heterogeneity in large shallow lakes is justified here credit authorship contribution statement goraw goshu conceptualization methodology validation writing original draft funding acquisition

1763,understanding spatial variability of nutrient loading and transport in large lakes and its effect on the eutrophication status are often lacking and hinder effective and sustainable management of lakes yet knowledge on the extent of spatial variability of eutrophication in large shallow tropical lakes hinders sustainable management understanding how eutrophication varies across lakes helps spatially targeted nutrient load mitigation strategies this modelling study assesses how spatial heterogeneity in nutrient loads may drive spatial variability in in lake eutrophication effects for lake tana a large tropical lake we applied a novel method of coupling a 2d application of the flow model duflow with the ecosystem model pclake a zero dimensional food web model we defined different impact zones of major tributaries with a tracer model and simulated ecological processes and food web relations for each impact zone furthermore we defined critical nitrogen and phosphorus loads for each impact zone and the whole lake subsequently we analysed the spatial variability of phytoplankton and aquatic vegetation dynamics among the impact zones as well as the differences in critical loadings the model results indicate different ecological conditions in the impact zones and the importance of spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication reflected in different critical loading the model shows that the north impact zone and northwest impact zone are mainly vegetation dominated and southeast impact zone and southwest impact zone are phytoplankton dominated simulated chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 0 to 59 µg l 1 and the coverage of the vegetation ranged from 1 to 127 g d w m 2 aligning with the range of observed values in the lake we demonstrate that this model approach can help to identify spatial heterogeneity in hydrology and eutrophication as such lakes cannot be regarded as completely mixed systems our new approach demonstrates how spatially variable nutrient loading correspond to variability in eutrophication effects in a large shallow tropical lake and will aid in setting more spatially targeted lake management strategies keywords spatial heterogeneity bifurcation analysis 2d tracer model critical load alternative stable states tropical lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication is one of the most widespread environmental problems of inland water bodies it has undesired effects on ecosystem state and services public health and socioeconomic activities some of these environmental effects in lakes include risk of algal blooms leading to a decrease of water clarity hypoxia and fish kills altering biogeochemical processes and disrupting the aquatic food web scheffer 1998 eutrophication in lakes is caused by excessive loads of nutrients delivered by rivers kane et al 2014 lürling and van oosterhout 2013 the extent of eutrophication could increase as a result of increased nutrient inputs from the intensification of agriculture and the increase of the human population the management and restoration of lakes are often based on reducing the nutrient input to below a critical level critical loads represent an ecological threshold at which there can be an abrupt change in an ecosystem state property or phenomenon or where small changes in an environmental driver produce large responses in the ecosystem scheffer and carpenter 2003 groffman et al 2006 xu et al 2015 it is documented that in shallow lakes eutrophication can lead to an abrupt shift of conditions with alternative stable states either with submerged vegetation or phytoplankton dominated scheffer 1998 janssen et al 2014 however field data of lakes that actually experience alternative stable states are scarce capon et al 2015 this might be due to lakes being in transition for long periods or they switch back and forth easily van geest et al 2007 arani et al 2021 still some empirical evidence for regime shifts in lakes is found ibelings et al 2007 kosten et al 2012 the concept of regime shifts and critical loads in lakes is valuable in defining lake restoration plans and setting nutrient loading targets scheffer and carpenter 2003 janssen et al 2014 critical nutrient inputs can be derived from aquatic ecosystem models several lake models were reviewed by janssen et al 2019a they conclude that to study state transitions in lakes a mechanistic dynamic model is required that include the aquatic food web in this way non linear processes and the relevant feedback are accounted for pclake meets the above criteria janse et al 2010 and is widely used to explore the transition between alternative stable states and to estimate critical nutrient loads many aquatic models often assume lakes are completely mixed systems natural lakes especially large lakes have clear spatial differences both for hydrology and chemistry this is due to factors like complex morphology the different depth and spatially distributed inflow of water and nutrients in shallow lakes these are mainly horizontal differences in deep lakes vertical gradients also exist due to stratification lake characteristics and internal and external connectivity can drive spatial variability janssen et al 2017 liu and qiu 2007 rahm and danielsson 2007 yu et al 2008 fragoso et al 2008 consequently we hypothesize that there are different zones in large shallow lakes based on lake hydrology and distributed inflows of rivers impact zones these impact zones have their own characteristics with different critical nutrient loads which can differ from the critical load when we assume complete mixing the spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication has implications for lake management the effective and sustainable management of eutrophication and lake restoration benefits from a clear understanding of spatial heterogeneity in nutrient loading and hydrology janssen et al 2019a in this way the effort of reducing nutrient loads in specific subbasins can be focused on the parts of the lake that are most vulnerable the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the different biological components of an aquatic ecosystem include seasonal succession of phytoplankton macrophyte growth invasive alien species and lake turbidity ding et al 2015 pringle 1990 rychtecký and znachor 2011 soares et al 2012 xu et al 2020 moreover different residence times influences spatial heterogeneity which is important for a deeper understanding of ecological processes in freshwater lakes it is also a mechanism for maintaining the species diversity of phytoplankton communities most applications of ecological models regard lakes as one complete mixed system this approach disregards spatial differences e g rivers that discharge on the lake will only affect the lake part near the river mouth littoral zones are more shallow than the pelagic zones resulting in different conditions for vegetation growth in this paper we modelled spatial differences in lake tana a large tropical lake to estimate the spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication in a large tropical lake which might facilitate the design of more regional or locally targeted measures the main research questions of this study are 1 what are the different impact zones of the major tributary rivers of lake tana 2 is there spatial variability of eutrophication among the impact zones expressed in nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations 3 what are the critical n and p loads for each impact zone to address these questions we use a novel modelling approach first we define different impact zones of major tributaries in lake tana by using a two dimensional application of the flow and quality model duflow clemmens et al 1993 secondly we determine critical nutrient loads for these impact zones and lake tana separately with the ecosystem model pclake janssen et al 2019 2 methodology 2 1 study area lake tana is a shallow maximum 14 m average 8 m deep occasionally stratifying and large tropical lake found at an altitude of 1800 m a s l it is the largest lake in ethiopia accounting for 50 of the surface water volume of the freshwater resource of the country it has a surface area of ca 3111 km2 28 4 km3 volume and has a maximum length of 90 km and width of 65 km the tana basin has a total drainage area of 16 500 km2 fig 1 more than six medium to large sized tributary rivers and 40 ephemeral streams drain into lake tana among the rivers the gilgel abay dirma gumara gelda rib and megech rivers contribute 90 of the inflow sirak 2008 lake tana is the source of the blue nile which is the only natural surface outflow of the lake in addition there is substantial abstraction of water from the lake for hydropower generation the tana beles hydropower plant rainfall is maximum during july and august at 250 330 mm per month mean annual rainfall is nearly 1280 mm abebe and minale 2017 the rainy season july september receives about two thirds of the annual rainfall while the dry season receives 2 the pre rainy season april june receives 25 and the post rainy season 8 of annual rainfall the average seasonal air temperature reaches its maximum of 21 1 c in the pre rainy season and its minimum 18 4 c in the rainy season with a large diurnal but small seasonal change the population of the basin was projected to be 4 5 million in 2015 csa 2007 with a population density of 228 persons per km2 in 2007 anteneh 2017 and 70 of the basin is agricultural land abebe and minale 2017 in this study we mainly focused on the largest sub basins gilgel abay dirma megech gumara gelda rib arno and garno fig 1 lake tana is an example of a large tropical lake that cannot be considered completely mixed because of multiple inflowing rivers with different discharges and nutrient concentrations spatial variations are observed in phytoplankton nutrient concentrations and vegetation conditions that can affect spatial patterning of critical nutrient loads in lake tana the measured and secondary data about the current trophic conditions of lake tana show spatial variability among the shore open water and river mouths of the lake most of the river mouths and a significantly smaller portion of the lakeshore area show eutrophic conditions and the majority of the lake exhibited more oligotrophic conditions goraw goshu unpublished 2 2 research approach we developed a method to facilitate the analysis of spatial variability of eutrophication in a heterogenous lake summarized in fig 2 we combined two modelling approaches with modifications for our study area based on the models duflow clemmens et al 1993 and pclake janse et al 2010 janssen et al 2019 we used a two dimensional application of the flow and water quality model duflow to perform unsteady flow computations and to simulate tracer distribution in the lake to define so called impact zones using real tracers in field studies is practically impossible in such large systems like lake tana with multiple inflowing rivers thereafter we ran the pclake model for each impact zone separately and for lake tana as one mixed system to simulate ecosystem conditions e g nutrient concentrations phytoplankton vegetation and to give indications of critical nutrient loads for ecosystem transitions janse et al 2010 since pclake has been applied in comparable lakes and is based on fundamental ecological and chemical concepts we apply the model in this observational data limited lake to assess eutrophication effects likely vary across space this analysis provides an example of how to identify the relative contribution of variable nutrient loadings in data limited shallow tropical lakes to prioritize areas for management action but determining specific target levels will require collection of more thorough observational data 2 3 modelling lake tana with a tracer model in duflow 2 3 1 network schematization duflow is designed as a 1d unsteady flow and quality model for this study we set up a 2d application by constructing a dense network of sections in multiple directions to be able to simulate water flow and solute transport in the lake duflow solves the transport equation advection dispersion and the user can add specific physical and bio chemical processes we defined a simple tracer model with only transport and no processes as a first step in the configuration of the duflow model we classified the lake into four depth zones 0 2 m 2 6 m 6 10 m and 10 14 m the 0 2 m deep zone is defined as shore 4 2 6 is littoral 12 6 10 is sublittoral 21 and 10 14 m is classified as a pelagic zone 62 we built the network on a geographical background by adding the bathymetric map of lake tana wale et al 2008 the length of the vertical and horizontal cross sections internode distance ranges from 0 5 km mostly in the shore area to 5 km in off shore zones we defined the width and length of the sections in such a way that the sum of the section areas corresponded with the total lake area 2 3 2 flow model after network schematization we defined initial and boundary conditions for the hydrology and configured the calculation we defined the boundary conditions i e inflow of a tributary river at the edge of the lake system based on discharge monitoring data that were aggregated to monthly discharges furthermore we defined water abstraction to the hydropower plant tana beles and the blue nile outlet as negative discharge and the precipitation surplus total rainfall evaporation on the lake area as negative or positive depending on the net value we configured the model with a calculation time step of one hour and a one day output step once the flow calculation was verified we added the quality model to explore the spatial distribution of solutes coming from separate inflows we defined a multiple tracer quality model the model definition was without chemical processes to simulate the transport of a conservative substance we simulated four different tracers with a starting concentration of 100 mg l 1 in the main inflowing rivers these are the gauged rivers no tracer concentration was defined at other tributary rivers depending on the hydraulic conditions the model will show that the tracers are spread over the lake and possibly transported to the blue nile outlet and tana beles abstraction 2 3 3 delineation of the impact zones of major incoming rivers with the 2d tracer model the impact zone is the area of the lake that is under the specific influence of the feeding tributary river we focused on the major tributary rivers and we grouped the major tributary rivers into four zones south west gilgel abay south east gelda gumara rib north east arno garno and north dirma megech grouping of tributaries was done as some rivers are close to each other and difficult to separate to delineate impact zones of the rivers in the lake we used two indicators from the tracer model the concentration of the four tracers in all sections of the lake and the fraction of one tracer from the sum of all tracer concentrations eq 1 1 f r a c t i 100 t r a c e r i t r a c e r 1 t r a c e r 2 t r a c e r 3 t r a c e r 4 where fracti is the fraction of tracer 1 2 3 or 4 and traceri is the concentration of tracer 1 2 3 or 4 for delineation of the impact zones we used the criteria that fracti 90 and traceri 10 mg l 1 2 4 pclake model configuration for the lake tana impact zones the modelling of n and p critical loads to lake tana with pclake encompassed the hydraulic and nutrient loads from major tributaries to the lake only the major tributary rivers which are gauged were accounted for pclake is a zero dimensional ecosystem model that disregards spatial heterogeneity it is a complex ecological model used to assess the nutritional status of stratified and non stratified freshwater lakes janssen et al 2019b the model includes biological components phytoplankton submerged vegetation zooplankton planktivorous fish and piscivorous fish in a simplified food web and non biological components transparency oxygen inorganic carbon and nutrients janse et al 2010 the model is built in a sequence from primary producers to top predators n and p cycles in the water column and sediments combine with higher levels in the food web janse et al 2010 the marsh area is a pclake module involving a simplified growth model of phragmites australis an emergent species of macrophytes combined with vegetative processes in the sediment and the water column of the marsh area sollie and verhoeven 2008 this area with emergent plants is connected to the open water by a flow of water between them janssen et al 2019b there are four types of lake specific settings to parameterize pclake specific lake characteristics nutrients input lake hydrology and sediment type the specific impact zone characteristics mean depth impact zone area the main wind direction were computed in this study we used arc gis to calculate the fetch and length of the impact zone in the main wind direction the mean depth of each impact zone was estimated in arcgis using a weighted average technique from the bathymetric map of lake tana marsh area a fraction of the lake area was retrieved by taking into account all wetland areas within the catchment of lake tana aynalem et al 2017 the mean fetch of each impact zone was calculated by the square root of the surface area sediment characteristics are parameterized using the data from previous studies the lake tana sediment composition and texture class is predominately clay 67 sand 17 and silt 16 the average organic matter content of the sediment is 16 g kg 1 and the sediment available phosphorus was 19 mg kg 1 kebedew et al 2020 we set up the models for the year 2017 we quantified the monthly n and p loads from the six major sub basins of lake tana from discharge and nutrient data the dynamic simulation of the aquatic ecosystem condition in each impact zone consisted of two parts first the current condition was simulated for which the model was initialized and run for 50 years to reach equilibrium janssen et al 2019a the results in the last 2 years of the simulation were taken as the final output and chlorophyll a concentrations were compared with the measurements of 2016 and 2017 secondly a bifurcation analysis was done for each impact zone separately and for lake tana as one mixed system for this pclake is run sequentially with increasing and decreasing nutrient inputs to find the critical nutrient loads for a shift from phytoplankton dominance to macrophyte dominance and vice versa each run for the bifurcation analysis was done for 30 years and the average of the may september period in the last 2 years of the simulation was taken as the result in this study the ratio between the external n and p loads was measured in 2017 we took this as a reference for the bifurcation analysis with a constant n p ratio the critical nutrient loads were used to identify the required reductions of external nutrient loading to restore the foreseen clear stable state in the lake or in case the clear state is present it is used to identify the maximum loads before it possibly switches to the turbid state janse et al 2008 2 5 hydrology and water quality 2 5 1 water balance of lake tana the water balance is needed to calculate the hydraulic load of the impact zones and the whole lake as input for pclake the water balance was validated with literature data before implementing it the water balance was calculated for the year 2017 as it is the most complete year for the discharge data to and from the lake and nutrient concentrations needed for calculating nutrient fluxes the monthly water balance of lake tana was calculated using equation 2 2 δ s δ t p q g a u g e d q u n g a u g e d e 0 q hp q dam where δ s δ t storage change closure term l3 t 1 p precipitation over lake

qhp surface water discharge towards hydropower plant belles l3 t 1 qdam surface water discharge towards blue nile river l3 t 1 the surface water flow to lake tana includes six major sub basins table 1 which are gauged and 14 sub basins that are not gauged groundwater flow within the lake tana basin takes place in a heterogeneous aquifer system with the groundwater flow converging to lake tana however groundwater flow also takes place from the lake tana basin towards the adjacent beles river basin mamo et al 2016 nigate et al 2017 furthermore as concluded by mamo et al 2016 estimated groundwater input to the lake was found to be of minor importance and therefore groundwater flow was excluded from the water balance for this research the detailed computation of the water balance components is described in the supplementary materials 2 5 2 hydraulic loadings the hydraulic loadings of tributary rivers in each impact zone and the lake tana were computed by dividing the sum of the discharges of the tributary rivers in the impact zone by the area of the impact zone estimated based on the tracer model study eq 3 water discharge data of a tributary for each month in 2017 were obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water electric and irrigation 3 h l r i 1 m q i a where hlr is the hydraulic loading rate m s 1 qi is the discharge at the gauging stations at a site i m3 s 1 a

detail in goshu et al 2020 the din or dip load to the impact zone and lake tana g s 1 is a product of din or dip concentration g m 3 and discharge m3 s 1 see eq 4 based on our data set and because daily discharge and monthly nutrient concentrations were available for the year 2017 the average load to the impact zone was calculated by multiplying the average discharge and the average concentration de vries and klavers 1994 providing 4 l i 1 m q i m j 1 n c j n where l is a load of din or dip g s 1 qi is the discharge at the gauging stations at the time i m3 s 1 cj is the

concentration during three periods august 2016 december 2016 and march 2017 water samples for chlorophyll a analysis were taken at 143 locations at lake tana in a spatial grid of 5 km by 5 km and chlorophyll a samples were also collected from the rivers monthly for 2017 the chlorophyll a concentration was determined using the acetone extraction procedure wetzel and likens 1991 from the analysis a map of the chlorophyll a over the lake was constructed using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique in arcgis 3 results 3 1 current ecological condition of the lake based on measurements 3 1 1 current status of eutrophication the effect of eutrophication in lake tana clearly showed spatial variability among the shore littoral pelagic and river mouth stations of the lake most of the river mouths and a small part of the lakeshore and littoral areas showed relatively high nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations especially after the rainy season jun sep the majority of the lake exhibited oligotrophic conditions based on chlorophyll a concentration see fig 3 3 1 2 chlorophyll a in littoral pelagic and river mouths of lake tana the chlorophyll a concentration in lake tana shows high spatial and temporal variability and ranged from 0 5 to 191 µg l 1 fig 3 generally the chlorophyll a concentrations were highest in the river mouths average 87 µg l 1 and lowest in the pelagic zone average 14 µg l 1 except for some inshore and littoral areas where temporally low chlorophyll a concentrations were found this might be caused by the presence of water hyacinth infestation and its ecological effect of depleting nutrients and shading gezie et al 2018 the three sampling periods august 2016 december 2017 and march 2017 show clear seasonal variability in chlorophyll a concentrations during the rainy season august 85 of lake tana had chlorophyll a concentrations below 4 µg l 1 in december 2016 post rainy season the chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 0 5 µg l 1 to 148 µg l 1 and more than half of the lake 56 had chlorophyll a concentration between 4 and 27 µg l 1 finally in march 2017 dry season the chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 0 5 µg l 1 to 191 µg l 1 with 59 of the lake having concentrations above 20 µg l 1 spatial and temporal variations of chlorophyll a concentrations were observed also in the river mouths of dirma gilgel abay gelda gumara and rib table 2 the chlorophyll a concentrations in the river mouths were generally higher than in the lake 22 8 351 5 µg l 1 probably because of low flow velocities and high nutrient concentrations in these areas spatially the minimum chlorophyll a concentration was noted in the gilgel abay river mouth and the maximum was measured in the rib river mouth nevertheless there were no significant spatial and temporal differences in chlorophyll a concentrations among the river mouths p 0 05 repeated measures anova n 60 based on the monthly measurements in 2017 the minimum chlorophyll a was noted in the rainy season and the maximum was noted in post rainy and pre rainy seasons for most of the river mouths 3 2 delineation of the impact zones of major incoming rivers the contours of the impact zones were defined by the tracer study for may september and december of the year 2017 fig 4 we observed a direct relationship between the river basin area and the impact zone area the larger the river basin area and the subsequent river discharge the larger the impact zone the southwest impact zone has the largest area in all months study except december the northeast impact zone has the smallest area in all months of the model study generally the impact zones have the smallest area in the dry season may and the largest in the post rainy season december surprisingly the impact zones are mainly confined in the shore and littoral parts of the lake and do not cover the pelagic part fig 4 based on the impact zones delineation we computed the different characteristics of the separate zones needed for the pclake modelling these include the fetch marsh area and mean depth table 3 and the monthly n and p load table 5 3 3 hydrology and water balance the water balance study of lake tana shows that the water level drops during dry and pre rainy seasons and increases in the rainy season fig 5 table 4 this water level change is well considered in the duflow modelling fig 5 displays the seasonal variation in water balance of lake tana for 2017 table 4 gives the calculated annual water balance terms of lake tana the main inflow of water to lake tana is coming from the gauged sub basins furthermore evaporation exceeds precipitation on an annual basis table 4 the lake exhibits water storage from may until september with the largest positive storage for july and august despite the outflow flowing into the hydropower plant tana beles and the monitored part of the blue nile there is a large cumulative closure term in the water balance of lake tana at the end of the year which should be compensated by an additional loss term from the lake this large closure term might be because the largest part of the outflow towards the blue nile river is not monitored 3 4 simulation of ecological indicators and critical nutrient loads of the four impact zones and lake tana the simulation of phytoplankton showed chlorophyll a dominance in the southeast and southwest zones maximum chlorophyll a 40 and 70 µg l 1 compared with the north and northeast zones maximum chlorophyll a 3 5 and 1 6 µg l 1 see fig 6 a in contrast vegetation was more dominant in the north and northeast impact zones maximum vegetation 135 and 245 g d w m 2 than the southeast and southwest impact zones maximum vegetation 0 2 and 0 2 g d w m 2 fig 6b the simulation results of tn tp and secchi depth are shown in annex 2 the bifurcation analyses of the four impact zones and lake tana as one mixed system are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 this bifurcation run was done with a changing p load throughout the year coupled to the n load with an tn tp ratio based on the incoming nutrient fluxes this approach reflects the effect of a combined reduction of n and p loads to the impact zones the average tn tp ratio was 4 9 however with a substantial variation among the different the impact zones 2 2 to 8 8 table 5 all impact zones show a clear deviation from the redfield n p ratio of 16 tett et al 1985 indication relative high p loads the bifurcation analysis clearly indicates critical loadings except for northeast zone where a linear increase of chlorophyll with increasing p load is found the north and southwest impact zones display hysteresis 2 critical loadings with alternative stable states furthermore figs 7 and 8 show that for the two impact zones that are in the turbid state high chlorophyll a the external nutrient loading should be reduced considerably to around 10 of the current load to switch back to the clear vegetation state in contrast the current nutrient loads for the two impact zones that exhibit vegetation dominance clear state are predicted to be below the critical values 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity with the approach presented here we show the importance of spatial variability in analysing the ecological condition and determining critical loads in a large lake variability in lake conditions is strongly related to the locations and magnitude of the in flowing rivers the results for the separate impact zones show clear differences among each other and also when compared with modelling the lake as one mixed system the simulated chlorophyll a concentrations deviate to some extent from the observed chlorophyll a concentrations fig 3 and fig 6a although in line with the observations especially if we consider the average chlorophyll a concentrations in the impact zones we found that the order of the impact zones for chlorophyll a concentrations is the same for the model and the observations with highest average concentrations in the southwest and lowest in the northeast table 6 the temporal variation of higher concentrations in march 2017 compared with august 2016 is clear and reflects the actual observations according to the model there are vegetation dominance and low chlorophyll a concentrations in impact zones north and northeast and the other way around in southeast and southwest impact zones this finding is consistent with previous studies in lake tana dersseh et al 2019 wondie et al 2012 in these studies the spatial potential of aquatic vegetation infestation was estimated based on a multivariate analysis with total phosphorus total nitrogen temperature ph salinity and depth as main parameters the researchers concluded that the north and northeast regions have the highest potential for vegetation dominance which was later confirmed with satellite image observations dersseh et al 2020 our finding of spatial variability of eutrophication in lake tana is also reported in other tropical and sub tropical large lakes of the world lake taihu southeast china is a good example of a large shallow lake with high spatial variation macrophytes are established at the shores and in the bays whereas they are absent in the lake s centre due to strong wind janssen et al 2014 xu et al 2015b zhao et al 2013 the study by soares et al 2012 reported that the tropical funil reservoir brazil demonstrated spatial heterogeneity that could affect the occurrence and distribution of algal blooms along the reservoir the fluvial intermediate and lentic compartments this supports the conclusion that high spatial heterogeneity in macrophytes and phytoplankton abundance suggests variation in the responses to eutrophication within the lake differences in lake morphology can already result in spatial variation with water depth being an important morphological factor regulating macrophyte abundance in lake tana most of the studied littoral zones have comparable depths but still differ in macrophyte cover which can be attributed to different nutrient inputs this variation results in spatial patterning of critical nutrient loads in lake tana 4 2 critical loads and bifurcation analysis the critical nutrient loads for the impact zones and the lake as a whole are summarized in table 7 these are derived from the average current loads table 5 and the reduction factors multipliers from figs 7 and 8 the presented reduction factors are an annual average and given the variability of the current monthly loads these can only be used indicatively however the critical loads estimated here enable a comparison with other studies in lakes where critical loads were estimated from table 7 it is evident that current nutrient loads to southeast and southwest impact zones are higher than the estimated critical loads to these impact zones on the other hand we found a different ecological condition in the north and northeast impact zone where the phytoplankton is less dominating lake tana is a large tropical lake with a mean depth of 8 m but the impact zones are generally only 2 m deep this is comparable to shallow dutch and chinese lakes where pclake was applied in janse et al 2008 critical p loadings were determined that can be considered representative of dutch shallow lakes it was observed that for a default lake see exact settings in janse et al 2008 critical bifurcation points of the lake turning from a turbid to clear and clear to the turbid state were 0 9 mg p m 2 d 1 and 3 mg p m 2 d 1 respectively the general numbers for lake tana are similar table 6 but the range is larger 0 1 to 28 5 mg m 2 d 1 possibly due to the spatial heterogeneity of the impact zones with different characteristics studies with pclake for deeper lakes such as described in li et al 2019 for lake dianchi with an average depth of 4 9 m showed critical loadings of 0 34 mg m 2 d 1 and 0 38 mg m 2 d 1 furthermore lakes with larger depths will have lower critical p loadings because less submerged macrophytes will be present due to less favourable light conditions in deeper lakes janse 2005 janse et al 2008 this causes more nutrients available for the growth of phytoplankton causing more turbid conditions at lower nutrient loadings 4 3 model uncertainties though pclake was originally parameterized for shallow temperate lakes janse et al 2010 the ecological and chemical concepts can be applied to lake tana to provide a comparative first cut assessment of relative spatial variability this is supported by studies where the model in its present form has been applied successfully in several tropical and subtropical lakes janssen et al 2017 li et al 2019 kong et al 2017 fragoso et al 2008 a multi lake study showed that the original pclake model was able to predict reasonably well the dominance of macrophytes or phytoplankton in approximately 80 large lakes from around the world janssen et al 2014 still the model results should be considered with care and the focus should be on patterns rather than on absolute values of the output we acknowledge that the derived critical loads for lake tana contain uncertainties but comparison with critical loads in other regions shows that the values for lake tana can be plausible lake tana is one of the first attempts of applying pclake to african lakes future monitoring and modelling in tropical lakes can contribute to reducing the uncertainties specifically frequent observations of n and p concentrations phytoplankton transparency and vegetation cover and densities in addition although the processes and feedbacks in the model are generic process parameters and environmental conditions have to be determined on a local scale 4 4 implications studies conducted in china and brazil have shown the importance of spatial heterogeneity of shallow lakes janssen et al 2017 fragoso et al 2008 for ecological modelling as well as defining nutrient management options large tropical lakes like lake tana are traditionally treated as completely mixed systems because of this the traditional approach of nutrient management has only limited success our research in this lake has clearly shown that importance of spatial heterogeneity in terms of eutrophication effects and critical nutrient loads our spatial modelling provides new insights into exploring the effects of eutrophication in a large shallow tropical lake we demonstrate that lake tana is a heterogeneous lake and the conditions that drive this are likely to be existing also in other lakes the modelled impact zones clearly show spatial differences in n and p critical loadings implying that each zone has a different nutrient reduction target therefore in impact zones like the southeast and southwest parts of lake tana priority should be given to nutrient reduction measures lake managers could aim to reduce the present nutrient load to below the lowest critical nutrient load in these impact zones the major n and p sources of lake tana are animal manure synthetic fertilizers and human waste goshu et al 2020 therefore nutrient reduction measures from the above sources should be practiced in sub basins of prioritized impact zones of lake tana measures should be within the social and economic possibilities of the regions 5 conclusions this study showed that there are clear distinct impact zones in lake tana related to the main tributaries with different characteristics both the measurements and the modelling with pclake show that the current ecological status has spatial variability over the lake and among the impact zones critical nutrient loadings vary among the impact zones implying that each zone has a different reduction target for lake tana it is clear that in north impact zone and northeast impact zone the current level of p load is below the critical loading in the other two zones the current loading is above the critical loading so in the southeast and southwest parts of the lake the river loading should be decreased substantially the critical loadings of n and p are quite different when we take lake tana as one mixed system our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication to determine sub catchment critical nutrient loads in a relatively large lake we acknowledge that the derived critical loads for lake tana contain uncertainties comparison with critical loads in other regions has limited value but it shows that the values for lake tana can be plausible future monitoring and modelling in tropical lakes can contribute to reducing the uncertainties nevertheless we believe that the general conclusion of importance of spatial heterogeneity in large shallow lakes is justified here credit authorship contribution statement goraw goshu conceptualization methodology validation writing original draft funding acquisition

1764,the increasing number of dams and reservoirs affects the delivery of fluvial particulate organic carbon poc to the sea due to their trapping effect here we study the poc characteristics of the changjiang river over three periods to explore the impact of reservoirs on poc sources and flux we found that the three gorges reservoir tgr significantly raised the proportion of riverine primary productivity rpp derived poc downstream while cascade reservoirs improved the rpp upstream since the beginning of tgr impoundment poc flux into the sea has decreased whereas the proportion of rpp derived poc into the sea has gradually increased our results demonstrate that the tgr and cascade reservoirs changed organic carbon sources and improved the labile composition in the changjiang river which may adversely impact carbon storage these findings could be applicable to other rivers affected by dams worldwide keywords changjiang river reservoir particulate organic carbon riverine primary productivity flux data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important link between the terrestrial and marine ecosystem carbon pools the organic carbon oc transport behavior of rivers plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle and transports approximately 200 mt of terrestrial particulate organic carbon poc to marginal seas every year galy et al 2008 blair and aller 2012 galy et al 2015 poc is a critical form of riverine carbon that participates in various biogeochemical processes and affects organic and inorganic carbon cycles bauer et al 2013 boyd et al 2019 repasch et al 2021 previous studies have suggested that riverine poc were mainly derived from modern organisms terrestrial and aquatic primary producers aged soil and fossil blair and aller 2012 as a product of mixed sources the transport process and sources of riverine poc are susceptible to various factors marwick et al 2015 bianchi et al 2018 repasch et al 2022 given that sediment is the major carrier of poc in the river factors like precipitation and erosion have a significant impact on the amount of sediment which can then affect the poc flux and source wu et al 2018 sun et al 2021 the redox environment hydrodynamic conditions and residence times are also important factors that impact the carbon cycling process in the water column bianchi et al 2018 additionally human activities such as dam construction soil and water conservation land use change nutrient inputs and sand mining are affecting the riverine system among which the impact of dam construction is increasingly dominant tessler et al 2015 best 2019 the continuous growth in the number of dams and reservoirs has led to rivers facing the pressure of fragmentation and gradually losing their connectivity which affects water physicochemical conditions best 2019 grill et al 2019 li et al 2020a syvitski et al 2022 dams and reservoirs increase hydraulic residence time and intercept sediment oc and nutrients which significantly affect the biogeochemical cycling in the river system battin et al 2023 they can impede the flow of carbon phosphorus nitrogen and silicon enhancing nutrient transformation and elimination maavara et al 2020 the variation in water conditions can alter the riverine primary productivity rpp thereby changing the sources and compositions of poc as a labile and highly degradable component rpp derived poc is the key point of carbon storage dudgeon et al 2006 prats et al 2011 li et al 2017 maavara et al 2020 in general previous studies mainly focused on the reservoir interception effect on oc flux or budget regnier et al 2013 2022 battin et al 2023 whereas research on riverine ecology is still at an initial stage particularly from the view of the coupling of rpp shifts given that poc from different sources has different turnover times and degradation rates schädel et al 2014 cotrufo et al 2015 repasch et al 2021 the change in poc sources can have an impact on the net balance of source to sink carbon processes consequently it is essential to study the impact of dams and reservoirs on riverine poc for a clearer analysis of the global carbon cycle and a more accurate assessment of the global carbon budget as a prominent example of dam and reservoir construction impact the changjiang river is an important pathway and channel for the transport of terrestrial organic matter from east asia to the east china sea through which a large amount of terrestrial poc 1 16 mt yr is transported to estuarine and coastal areas every year under the control of the asian monsoon climate yao et al 2015 liu et al 2019a 2019b its poc transport process is important to the biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem of the east china sea inner shelf milliman and farnsworth 2013 in addition the three gorges reservoir tgr the largest hydropower project in the world at present impoundment began in 2003 and 11 giant cascade reservoirs upstream impoundment occurring in succession since 2010 significantly reduced the poc flux into the sea li et al 2015 liu et al 2019a 2019b recently several studies conducted on the impact of reservoirs in the changjiang river indicated that the tgr and cascade reservoirs raised poc contents by several folds which was related to the increased contribution of autochthonous poc wu et al 2020 liu et al 2022a wang et al 2022 nevertheless the extent to which the response of rpp to aquatic condition changes resulting from reservoirs remains poorly understood therefore using the changjiang river catchment to study the impact of reservoirs on poc source and flux can enable a deeper understanding of the process and mechanism of land to sea oc transport and gaining insights from this river can contribute to a broader understanding of the global carbon cycle in this study we focused on the impact of cascade reservoirs on the variation of rpp derived poc within the changjiang river catchment in different stages based on sampling data from july august 2018 and july 2021 in the changjiang river and annual sampling data from the lower reaches in 2021 this study used elemental values combined with data from previous studies in different periods to analyze the changes in poc characteristics at different stages pre tgr impoundment initial tgr impoundment and post cascade reservoirs impoundment thus we can reveal the impact of cascade reservoirs on the source and flux of poc within the changjiang river catchment 2 study area the changjiang river which is located in central china fig 1 a 90 33 122 25 e 24 30 35 45 n is the third longest river in the world 6300 km and its catchment covers an area of 1 80 106 km2 it is geographically divided into upper middle and lower reaches the upper reaches from the qinghai tibetan plateau to yichang have a high relief at 3000 5000 m and are characterized by mountainous topography the middle lower reaches have a gentle bed slope and mainly consist of fluvial plains where two large lake systems i e dongting and poyang lakes and the hanjiang river interact closely with the mainstem no large tributaries join the mainstream in the lower reaches the river downstream of datong is influenced by oceanic tides and the region seaward of xuliujing is defined as a delta zone guo et al 2019 geologically the changjiang river catchment is characterized by complex types of source rocks the upstream catchment is mainly distributed with paleozoic carbonate rocks mesozoic sedimentary and igneous rocks while the middle lower catchment is overlain by the paleozoic marine mesozoic sedimentary rocks and quaternary loose sediments of fluvial and lacustrine facies liu et al 2022b controlled by a subtropical monsoon climate the rainfall in the changjiang river catchment ranges from 400 mm yr in the source region to 1600 mm yr in the lower reaches it supplies over 65 and 86 of the annual water discharge 900 billion m3 yr and sediment load 350 mt yr to the estuary during the wet season from may to october respectively cwrc 1950s 2021 the vegetation within the catchment is dominated by c3 vascular plants wu et al 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection two expeditions were conducted in the wet season along the mainstem and tributaries of the changjiang river fig 1b in july august 2018 the mainstem comprised 12 sampling stations and the tributaries comprised 9 sampling stations from where samples were collected during extreme flood season upstream in july and downstream in august in contrast in july 2021 the mainstem comprised 14 sampling stations and the tributaries comprised 5 sampling stations since the water discharge and sediment loads in the wet season account for over 65 and 79 of annual quantity in 2018 and 2021 table s2 our samples in the wet season are representative of the whole year in addition water samples were collected at least once a month in the lower reaches near the city of nanjing nj sampling station which is about 270 km upstream from the estuary fig 1b from january december 2021 covering one complete hydrological year 19 samples in total owing to the fast water flow in the wet season wang et al 2012 and the similar poc content at different depths surface middle and bottom of the whole water column in the changjiang river liu et al 2019a 2019b we assumed that the water was well mixed and used sub surface water samples to represent the whole water column six water samples 0 5 m underwater 150 l total were collected from a cross section in the main channel using acid washed 25 l polyethylene samplers and were subsequently filtered immediately through pre combusted 450 c for 3 h glass fiber filters nominal pore size 0 7 μm whatman gf f to obtain suspended particulate matter spm all the filtered spm samples were stored at 20 c for further analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis the freeze dried and homogenized samples were acid treated with hcl 1 m to completely remove inorganic c prior to the analysis wu et al 2007 labile organic carbon was determined following a two step acid hydrolysis procedure with h2so4 as the extractant the method was previously described by rovira and vallejo 2002 and belay tedla et al 2009 briefly 500 mg of the decarbonated sample was hydrolyzed with 20 ml of 2 5 m h2so4 at 105 c for 30 min the hydrolysate was recovered by centrifugation and decantation the residue was washed with 20 ml of pure water and the washing supernatant was added to the hydrolysate this hydrolysate was regarded as labile pool i the remaining residue was hydrolyzed with 2 ml of 13 m h2so4 overnight at room temperature under continuous shaking the acid concentration was then brought down to 1 m by dilution with pure water and the sample was hydrolyzed at 105 c for 3 h with occasional shaking the second hydrolysate was regarded as labile pool ii labile pools i and ii were summed together to obtain the total labile pool the poc and particulate nitrogen pn contents were determined using an elemental analyzer flash 2000ht thermo fisher scientific and the precision of the determination is better than 0 02 wt and 0 002 wt respectively xing et al 2011 variability in repeated measurements n 57 of the suspended particulate matter was estimated to be 0 4 for poc and 1 7 for pn the stable isotopic composition was determined using a mass spectrometer mat253 thermo fisher scientific and the values of δ13c and δ15n were reported in units per million as follows 1 δ 13 c r sample r standard 1 1000 2 δ 15 n r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the ratios of 13c 12c 15n 14n for the sample and standard respectively the δ13c and δ15n values were reported using standard notation relative to the vpdb vienna pee dee belemnite standard and atmospheric nitrogen respectively the analytical precision was better than 0 1 based on replicate measurements 3 3 statistical analyses statistical analysis was carried out using the spss v 24 spss institute usa statistical differences in poc properties were evaluated with the one way analysis of variance anova at a confidence level of 0 05 a three endmember mixing model based on δ13c and n c values of poc was used to estimate the plant soil and rpp derived proportions in the study area the simulation was performed in matlab v r2020b math works usa using the markov chain monte carlo driven bayesian approach andersson et al 2015 the approach was run with 2 105 iterations using a burn in of 10 000 steps and a data thinning of 100 the model was written as follows 3 f soil δ 13 c soil f plant δ 13 c plant f r pp δ 13 c r pp δ 13 c poc 4 f soil n c soil f plant n c plant f r pp n c r pp n c poc 5 f soil f plant f r pp 1 where fsoil fplant and frpp represent the fractional proportion from plant soil and rpp respectively elemental values of spm and poc fluxes into the sea in 1997 and 2007 2008 were collected from previous literature table s3 wu et al 2007 mao et al 2011 where poc flux in 1997 was calculated by integrating bimonthly poc fluxes and poc flux in 2007 was calculated by integrating that of wet and dry seasons in addition since no large tributaries join the mainstem from nanjing to the estuary fig 1 we considered the annual poc flux in the nj station 270 km upstream of the estuary as the poc flux into the sea which was calculated by integrating monthly poc fluxes multiplying poc content by sediment loads the method is as follows 6 f i 1 n x i y i 7 f soil p l a n t r pp i 1 n x i y i f soil p l a n t r pp where f is the annual poc flux xi and yi are poc content and sediment load respectively fsoil plant rpp represents soil or plant or rpp derived poc flux and fsoil plant rpp represents soil or plant or rpp derived poc proportion here we use sediment loads at datong gauge the last gauge in the mainstem of the changjiang river 200 km upstream of nj station and 470 km upstream of the estuary as that into the sea which are 299 mt yr 138 mt yr and 102 mt yr in 1997 2007 and 2021 respectively the ssc suspended sediment concentration median grain size water discharge and sediment load data used in this study were obtained from bulletins of the changjiang water resources commission cwrc 1990 2021 available at https www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb the ssc was obtained by dividing annual discharge into sediment loads and is the average value of the year the grain size of suspended sediment was obtained by combining particle size meter pipette extinction meter and laser methods water discharge and sediment loads since 1990 were provided in fig s1 ssc and median grain size were provided in table 1 4 results 4 1 elemental and isotopic values of spm in the changjiang river the elemental and isotopic values of spm at different stations during the two surveys along the changjiang river showed spatial differences summarized in fig 2 a f and table 1 poc and pn contents exhibited similar trend characteristics in the mainstem and tributaries with the ranges of 0 95 2 70 1 46 0 39 mean standard deviation and 0 12 0 41 0 19 0 07 respectively in 2018 whereas the poc and pn contents ranged from 1 00 to 2 50 1 38 0 38 and 0 12 to 0 45 0 19 0 08 respectively in 2021 the δ13c values varied from 32 0 to 24 7 26 1 1 6 in 2018 and 29 7 to 24 3 25 7 1 1 in 2021 the δ15n values showed an increasing trend from the upper to middle lower reaches in both 2018 and 2021 with ranges of 1 2 5 8 3 8 1 2 and 2 3 7 1 4 8 1 4 respectively the poc pn ratios displayed a declining trend in the mainstem in 2018 with low values in the middle lower reaches contrary to that of δ15n values however stations js pzh and yb upstream showed lower poc pn ratios in 2021 6 01 6 94 and 7 55 respectively than that in 2018 13 38 10 96 and 8 49 respectively to further study the poc source from phytoplankton the composition of labile poc lpoc was determined based on samples in 2021 without extreme flooding during the sampling period the lpoc content ranged from 0 19 to 0 82 with higher values in the upper and middle reaches fig 2g the lpoc proportions in poc varied from 19 to 39 exhibiting a similar trend to lpoc content fig 2h and the labile poc pn ratios had a lower range of 3 90 5 70 fig 2i the annual elemental and isotopic values of spm from lower reaches were summarized in fig 2j l and table s5 the mean poc content value of spm at the nj station was 1 25 0 15 n 19 0 95 1 60 the mean δ13c values and poc pn ratios were 25 9 0 5 26 9 to 25 3 and 7 67 0 81 6 44 9 74 respectively 4 2 sources of poc in the changjiang river oc n ratios and δ13c values are widely used to determine the provenance of organic matter lamb et al 2006 goni et al 2008 schwestermann et al 2021 the oc n ratio of terrestrial organic matter e g plants is 20 and phytoplankton has significantly lower oc n ratios 4 8 than terrestrial organic matter hedges et al 1986 meyers 1994 the δ13c values of the c3 plants ranged between 25 and 28 while those for c4 ecosystems were significantly less negative hedges et al 1997 consequently the poc provenance in 2018 and 2021 was qualitatively identified using ranges of poc pn ratios and δ13c values in different sources based on previous studies fig 3 to further constrain the compositions of poc and study the poc derived from aquatic primary producers we calculated the relative contributions of poc derived from plants soil and rpp using the markov chain monte carlo driven bayesian approach based on n c ratio and δ13c value endmembers which is widely used to determine oc sources andersson et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 wu et al 2018 herein pn poc rather than poc pn was used because pn poc is more sensitive as an endmember of poc sources yu et al 2010 wei et al 2020 the endmember source assignments of δ13c and n oc values were based on data from previous studies as summarized in table 2 the model analysis results are shown in the fig 4 and tables s4 s5 in 2018 and 2021 the contribution from plants was the lowest 16 10 and 14 10 on average while that from soil was the highest 51 17 and 50 17 with a decreasing trend along the mainstem f 21 313 and 12 482 p 0 005 the rpp proportion was at an intermediate level 32 14 and 37 15 and became comparable with the soil proportion in the middle lower reaches 5 discussion 5 1 characterization of poc within the changjiang river catchment in both 2018 and 2021 poc exhibited different characteristics between upper and middle lower reaches in poc compositions figs 3 and 4 the proportion of algae sources increased significantly downstream of the tgr contrary to that of soil demonstrating the underlying spatial effect of tgr on poc compositions within the changjiang river dividing the river into two different source sink systems previous studies also revealed that the construction of the tgr altered the transport patterns of poc and sediment gao et al 2019 wang et al 2022 similarly the cascade reservoirs could change the connectivity of the changjiang river for their increased quantities and higher interception efficiency in this study station js downstream of the gyy dam was affected by the gyy dam exhibiting higher poc content and proportion of algae derived poc than other stations in 2021 as a component of poc the lpoc in the river is likely derived from modern organisms including terrestrial plants and aquatic algae and is easier to degrade the lower ratios 3 90 5 70 of labile poc pn revealed its algae source because plants usually have high values 10 lamb et al 2006 in addition the rpp proportions showed a positive correlation with the lpoc poc ratios r2 0 58 in 2021 further confirming the correlation between lpoc and algae as well as demonstrating the degradable characteristic of rpp derived poc both the qualitative provenance and quantitative results from the bayesian model fig 4a and b indicated that there is a similar trend and no significant difference for the three sources in the middle lower reaches between 2018 and 2021 f 0 363 0 708 and 1 149 p 0 05 whereas rpp derived poc upstream exhibited a different trend f 5 008 p 0 05 which was affected by flood events fig s2 the mean ssc of july was 94 4 mg l at the panzhihua gauge in 2018 which was over 4 5 times higher than that in 2021 20 3 mg l cwrc 2018 and 2021 during the extreme flood season in july 2018 the poc sources upstream displayed different characteristics with those in 2021 poc pn ratios exhibited higher values at stations js pzh and yb 13 38 10 96 and 8 49 respectively suggesting the dominance of soil in the poc source fig 3a and the soil proportions at the above stations were also higher in 2018 fig 4b the frequent heavy rainfall and flooding in 2018 severely eroded the soil along the river increasing the proportion of soil derived poc 5 2 reservoirs affecting the sources of poc in the changjiang river in this study based on samples collected in 2018 and 2021 and data of poc in the changjiang river from previous studies samples collected in april may 1997 and august 2007 wu et al 2007 mao et al 2011 we analyzed the characteristics of poc within the changjiang river catchment over three periods before 2003 the pre tgr impoundment stage 2003 2009 the initial tgr impoundment stage after 2010 the post cascade reservoirs impoundment stage 5 2 1 the tgr changed the sources of poc in the middle lower reaches the changes in poc sources in the middle lower reaches of the three periods are reflected gradually under the influence of the tgr fig 3b during the pre tgr impoundment stage 1997 most of the poc was terrestrial soil and plant during the initial tgr impoundment stage 2007 the poc pn ratios downstream decreased f 23 276 p 0 05 mean poc pn ratio 8 79 0 96 and the source of poc shifted to soil organic matter and freshwater algae during the post cascade reservoirs impoundment stage 2018 and 2021 the poc pn ratios downstream decreased further f 7 301 and 10 992 p 0 05 mean poc pn ratios 7 22 0 53 and 7 79 0 68 indicating the increased contribution of algae to the poc source based on the results of the bayesian model fig 4 soil derived poc was the dominant fraction in 1997 followed by plant and rpp derived poc in 2007 the proportion of rpp derived poc exceeded that of plant derived poc particularly from the tgr to the lower reaches mean value of 27 8 7 7 for rpp derived poc proportion however soil still maintained the highest proportion in 2018 and 2021 the rpp proportion continued to rise 42 12 and 39 4 9 respectively and the poc sources from the tgr to the lower reaches changed from being soil dominated pre tgr impoundment to soil and rpp dominated post tgr impoundment as a result of the influence of the tgr the poc sources downstream have clearly changed and the rpp contribution to poc has increased gradually during the three periods f 22 335 p 0 05 resulting in the transformation from terrestrial to aquatic sources this is also confirmed by chl a poc changes since tgr impoundment showing an increased trend of chl a poc ratios in the mid lower reaches wang et al 2022 the tgr impoundment altered the aquatic condition in the changjiang river and the sediment grain size and loads have been directly changed during the three periods fig 5 the average grain size was 0 008 0 001 mm in 1990 2003 and 0 004 0 001 mm in 2004 2010 at gauge yichang 44 km downstream of the tgr indicating a decrease in grain size after reservoir impoundment fine grained sediment has a stronger adsorption capacity for oc mayer et al 2004 burdige 2007 which can lead to a higher poc content however the suspended sediment grain size increased in 2011 2021 at gauges yichang and datong because of the continuous channel erosion moreover the tgr led to a sharp decline in the ssc of downstream reservoirs fig 5 lower water turbidity is conducive for phytoplankton in the river to utilize the sunlight thus promoting the phytoplankton growth anderson et al 1997 reynolds 2006 in addition to slowing river flow increasing water retention time and facilitating eutrophication these changes in aquatic conditions could significantly promote riverine primary productivity and change the poc sources within the catchment dynesius and nilsson 1994 vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 kronvang et al 2004 prats et al 2011 li et al 2017 simultaneously the tgr impoundment greatly affected the hydrological regime of the dongting and poyang lakes gao et al 2014 feng et al 2016 li et al 2020b and algal biomass has increased yang et al 2016 our study suggested that the poc in the dongting and poyang lakes displayed exceedingly more algae sources than that in the mainstem with high content and labile proportion low poc pn ratios and depleted δ13c table 1 indicating a higher proportion of algae sources in addition the tgr impoundment has changed these two lakes from sediment sinks before 2003 to sources after 2003 gao et al 2019 transporting 15 3 4 1 mt yr of sediment mean value of the last five years to the mainstem and accounting for approximately 21 of the sediment in the mainstem which also plays an important role in improving the rpp downstream 5 2 2 cascade reservoirs upstream changed local poc sources similarly the cascade reservoir impoundment changed the upstream aquatic condition and poc sources the average grain size was 0 015 0 001 mm in 2002 2011 and 0 009 0 003 mm in 2012 2021 at gauge xiangjiaba 2 km downstream of the xiangjiaba dam and the ssc displayed a sharp declining trend fig 5b poc content at stations js pzh 40 km downstream of the guanyinyan dam and yb 35 km downstream of the xiangjiaba dam was higher in 2021 2 10 1 73 and 1 55 respectively than that i at other downstream stations in the same year 1 23 0 18 on average and ii at the local areas before the cascade reservoir impoundment 0 73 0 09 on average 2007 indicating the significant impact of cascade reservoirs impoundment on poc content which was attributed to the promoted rpp li et al 2017 mao et al 2019 in addition upstream poc pn ratios showed lower values in 2021 than that before the cascade reservoirs impoundment 1997 and 2007 fig 3a and rpp proportions at stations js pzh and yb in 2021 49 15 40 15 and 37 15 were significantly higher than that at the neighboring stations in 2007 ranging from 10 10 to 23 13 thereby proving the positive impact of cascade reservoirs on the increase of rpp changes in poc characteristics in the cascade reservoirs tgr and lower reaches were shown in fig s6 5 3 response of poc flux to the reservoirs 5 3 1 current poc flux from the changjiang river into the sea the cascade reservoirs and tgr exhibited a high trapping effect on suspended particulate matter resulting in a sharp decline in sediment transport fig 6 c and d as the carrier of oc the interception of sediment by reservoirs directly led to a significant reduction in oc flux into the sea li et al 2015 wang et al 2022 according to previously observed data the poc flux into the sea showed a positive correction with sediment loads fig 6e with the decline of sediment loads since the 1980 s particularly in 2003 the poc flux sharply decreased as well moreover the variation in poc compositions especially in the labile poc component due to the interception effect can make a huger difference to carbon storage affecting the carbon cycle herein based on the sediment loads in the inflow cuntan and wulong gauges and outflow gauging stations yichang gauge of the tgr as well as the proportion of the three poc sources calculated above we selected the poc content of stations fl located at the head of the fluctuating backwater zone of the tgr and yc exit of the tgr to represent the content of inflow and outflow fig 7 a we then calculated the inflow and outflow poc flux of the tgr in 2018 and 2021 as well as the trapping efficiency of tgr to poc fig 7b in the wet season the tgr exerted a significantly high trapping effect on poc 73 in 2018 and 79 in 2021 and the poc quantity trapped by the tgr in 2018 1 31 mt was more than twice that in 2021 0 60 mt due to flood events throughout 2021 a total of 1 2 mt poc was transported from the changjiang river to the sea based on our calculation by integrating monthly poc fluxes our study indicates that the reservoirs trapped a significant amount of poc making up at least 50 of the poc flux into the sea owing to the evidently promoted rpp and the labile nature of poc in the reservoirs it is necessary to re evaluate the carbon burial and decomposition processes in these reservoirs with caution 5 3 2 changes in poc flux from different sources the significant trapping effect of the tgr and the different trapping efficiencies of poc from the three sources influence poc flux into the sea therefore we estimated the poc flux into the sea corresponding to the three stages fig 7c as expected the poc flux decreased during the three periods 2 2 mt 1 5 mt and 1 2 mt respectively and the poc fluxes from the three sources also changed the terrestrial i e plant derived and soil derived poc flux decreased significantly however the proportion of rpp derived poc gradually increased by more than one time 18 26 37 there are two main reasons for this firstly the cascade reservoirs and tgr have retained a lot of upstream terrestrial poc leading to a decrease in total and terrestrial poc flux secondly the reservoir construction extremely enhanced the rpp resulting in a higher proportion of poc derived from rpp moreover a significant amount of poc in the middle lower reaches was from channel erosion due to the tgr impoundment 0 39mt yr from yichang to datong which was characterized by old ages and accounted for 33 of the flux into the sea even though such a huge portion of aged poc was input into fluvial poc the proportion of rpp derived poc still rose indicating a significant improvement in rpp given that rpp derived poc has a shorter turnover time and faster decomposition rate than plant and soil derived poc schädel et al 2014 cotrufo et al 2015 repasch et al 2021 the changes in poc source proportions likely have a significant influence on poc storage efficiency in the estuary and coast 5 4 uncertainties of poc compositions and fluxes in this study uncertainties of poc compositions are largely subject to uncertainties of δ13c values and pn poc ratios there are contingencies for field sampling because of unpredictable weather conditions which may affect fluvial poc sources during the campaign in 2021 we tried not to encounter rainy weather to avoid the impact of accidental events the similar poc compositions of 2018 and 2021 in the middle lower reaches indicate the reliability of the results the endmember is also an important factor of uncertainties when calculating the source contribution we used the mean endmember values in the entire catchment which ignored the local variation of δ13c and pn poc poc fluxes were calculated based on monthly poc contents and sediment loads we collected samples monthly from january to may and twice a month from june to december in the lower reaches using one or two single poc observations to represent the monthly mean this sampling frequency might ignore variability of the poc content between two observations especially in flood season during which there was always frequent precipitation in addition the poc fluxes were estimated using poc content in nanjing station which is 200 km downstream of datong gauge station there might be a small amount of channel erosion in this section however our data in 2021 demonstrated that the poc at the datong and nanjing sampling stations displayed similar contents 1 06 at the datong and 1 11 at the nanjing in addition our annual poc content at nanjing mean value 1 25 is also probably consistent with that at datong in previous study 0 98 in dry season and 1 41 in flood season mao et al 2011 therefore our results can represent the poc flux from the changjiang river to the sea 5 5 global implications the changjiang river is expected to remain a hotspot for continuous dam construction and reservoir oc burial and mineralization the reservoirs retain a significant amount of poc every year and the trapping effect in the changjiang river has reduced the deposition flux of oc in the east china sea by 48 since 2006 and heavily affected the sink of oc wang et al 2020 a recent study shows that reservoirs emit more carbon than they bury globally which suggests that reservoirs are more inclined to be carbon sources keller et al 2021 thus the large poc quantity trapped in the reservoirs and labile characteristics of rpp derived poc are more likely to make reservoirs become huge carbon sources with continuous dam construction worldwide the degree of river fragmentation is being intensified rpp may be further improved which will have an adverse impact on carbon storage globally humankind has implemented a large number of hydropower projects in the past two decades zarfl et al 2015 gross 2016 and the impact of dams on sediment and oc is also found in other large rivers including the yellow nile amazon mississippi ganges bangladesh irrawaddy and mekong rivers galy et al 2008 wang et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 sadaoui et al 2018 hecht et al 2019 for instance the yellow river which used to be the most sediment laden river in the world with high sediment 1080 mt yr milliman and syvitski 1992 and poc fluxes 4 5 mt yr cauwet and mackenzie 1993 has also experienced extensive dam construction and a sharp reduction 90 in sediment and poc fluxes since the 1950s the interception of aged poc by reservoirs in the yellow river in combination with promoted primary production led to younger poc ages than that of upstream reservoirs lu et al 2022 in the upper mississippi river reservoir impoundment shifted heterotrophic headwaters toward autotrophic conditions with associated effects on the isotopic composition of poc voss et al 2017 similar variations in oc sources have occurred in middle small scale rivers as well such as the godavari india south saskatchewan canada saar germany klamath america and geum rivers south korea where dam impoundment promoted primary productivity and enhanced the fraction of labile organic carbon from algae pradhan et al 2014 huisman et al 2018 engel et al 2019 kang et al 2019 imtiazy et al 2023 our research sheds light on how reservoirs affect rpp and the labile composition of poc providing a quantitative perspective despite the global significance of reservoir influence on poc flux from land to ocean in influencing carbon cycling within the large river catchment the impact on riverine autochthonous poc hasn t obtained significant concern the poc derived from algae is highly labile and can be easily oxidized and decomposed changes in the composition of poc can have severe consequences for local carbon storage as well as estuarine coastal and global carbon cycles therefore further continuous observations and studies are required to assess the effects of intense anthropogenic perturbations on riverine oc compositions on a global scale 6 conclusion our study provides clear evidence that the impoundment of reservoirs has promoted rpp and significantly altered the sources and compositions of poc in the changjiang river owing to the influence of the tgr the poc sources in the middle lower reaches changed gradually from being soil dominated before the tgr impoundment to soil and rpp dominated after the tgr impoundment simultaneously the cascade reservoirs upstream raised the local proportion of rpp derived poc in addition under the impact of reservoirs terrestrial poc flux into the sea decreased significantly whereas the rpp derived poc flux increased gradually the improvement of the labile oc proportion in rivers worldwide may affect poc burial efficiency in the estuarine and coastal areas and influence the global carbon cycle 7 formatting of

1764,the increasing number of dams and reservoirs affects the delivery of fluvial particulate organic carbon poc to the sea due to their trapping effect here we study the poc characteristics of the changjiang river over three periods to explore the impact of reservoirs on poc sources and flux we found that the three gorges reservoir tgr significantly raised the proportion of riverine primary productivity rpp derived poc downstream while cascade reservoirs improved the rpp upstream since the beginning of tgr impoundment poc flux into the sea has decreased whereas the proportion of rpp derived poc into the sea has gradually increased our results demonstrate that the tgr and cascade reservoirs changed organic carbon sources and improved the labile composition in the changjiang river which may adversely impact carbon storage these findings could be applicable to other rivers affected by dams worldwide keywords changjiang river reservoir particulate organic carbon riverine primary productivity flux data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important link between the terrestrial and marine ecosystem carbon pools the organic carbon oc transport behavior of rivers plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle and transports approximately 200 mt of terrestrial particulate organic carbon poc to marginal seas every year galy et al 2008 blair and aller 2012 galy et al 2015 poc is a critical form of riverine carbon that participates in various biogeochemical processes and affects organic and inorganic carbon cycles bauer et al 2013 boyd et al 2019 repasch et al 2021 previous studies have suggested that riverine poc were mainly derived from modern organisms terrestrial and aquatic primary producers aged soil and fossil blair and aller 2012 as a product of mixed sources the transport process and sources of riverine poc are susceptible to various factors marwick et al 2015 bianchi et al 2018 repasch et al 2022 given that sediment is the major carrier of poc in the river factors like precipitation and erosion have a significant impact on the amount of sediment which can then affect the poc flux and source wu et al 2018 sun et al 2021 the redox environment hydrodynamic conditions and residence times are also important factors that impact the carbon cycling process in the water column bianchi et al 2018 additionally human activities such as dam construction soil and water conservation land use change nutrient inputs and sand mining are affecting the riverine system among which the impact of dam construction is increasingly dominant tessler et al 2015 best 2019 the continuous growth in the number of dams and reservoirs has led to rivers facing the pressure of fragmentation and gradually losing their connectivity which affects water physicochemical conditions best 2019 grill et al 2019 li et al 2020a syvitski et al 2022 dams and reservoirs increase hydraulic residence time and intercept sediment oc and nutrients which significantly affect the biogeochemical cycling in the river system battin et al 2023 they can impede the flow of carbon phosphorus nitrogen and silicon enhancing nutrient transformation and elimination maavara et al 2020 the variation in water conditions can alter the riverine primary productivity rpp thereby changing the sources and compositions of poc as a labile and highly degradable component rpp derived poc is the key point of carbon storage dudgeon et al 2006 prats et al 2011 li et al 2017 maavara et al 2020 in general previous studies mainly focused on the reservoir interception effect on oc flux or budget regnier et al 2013 2022 battin et al 2023 whereas research on riverine ecology is still at an initial stage particularly from the view of the coupling of rpp shifts given that poc from different sources has different turnover times and degradation rates schädel et al 2014 cotrufo et al 2015 repasch et al 2021 the change in poc sources can have an impact on the net balance of source to sink carbon processes consequently it is essential to study the impact of dams and reservoirs on riverine poc for a clearer analysis of the global carbon cycle and a more accurate assessment of the global carbon budget as a prominent example of dam and reservoir construction impact the changjiang river is an important pathway and channel for the transport of terrestrial organic matter from east asia to the east china sea through which a large amount of terrestrial poc 1 16 mt yr is transported to estuarine and coastal areas every year under the control of the asian monsoon climate yao et al 2015 liu et al 2019a 2019b its poc transport process is important to the biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem of the east china sea inner shelf milliman and farnsworth 2013 in addition the three gorges reservoir tgr the largest hydropower project in the world at present impoundment began in 2003 and 11 giant cascade reservoirs upstream impoundment occurring in succession since 2010 significantly reduced the poc flux into the sea li et al 2015 liu et al 2019a 2019b recently several studies conducted on the impact of reservoirs in the changjiang river indicated that the tgr and cascade reservoirs raised poc contents by several folds which was related to the increased contribution of autochthonous poc wu et al 2020 liu et al 2022a wang et al 2022 nevertheless the extent to which the response of rpp to aquatic condition changes resulting from reservoirs remains poorly understood therefore using the changjiang river catchment to study the impact of reservoirs on poc source and flux can enable a deeper understanding of the process and mechanism of land to sea oc transport and gaining insights from this river can contribute to a broader understanding of the global carbon cycle in this study we focused on the impact of cascade reservoirs on the variation of rpp derived poc within the changjiang river catchment in different stages based on sampling data from july august 2018 and july 2021 in the changjiang river and annual sampling data from the lower reaches in 2021 this study used elemental values combined with data from previous studies in different periods to analyze the changes in poc characteristics at different stages pre tgr impoundment initial tgr impoundment and post cascade reservoirs impoundment thus we can reveal the impact of cascade reservoirs on the source and flux of poc within the changjiang river catchment 2 study area the changjiang river which is located in central china fig 1 a 90 33 122 25 e 24 30 35 45 n is the third longest river in the world 6300 km and its catchment covers an area of 1 80 106 km2 it is geographically divided into upper middle and lower reaches the upper reaches from the qinghai tibetan plateau to yichang have a high relief at 3000 5000 m and are characterized by mountainous topography the middle lower reaches have a gentle bed slope and mainly consist of fluvial plains where two large lake systems i e dongting and poyang lakes and the hanjiang river interact closely with the mainstem no large tributaries join the mainstream in the lower reaches the river downstream of datong is influenced by oceanic tides and the region seaward of xuliujing is defined as a delta zone guo et al 2019 geologically the changjiang river catchment is characterized by complex types of source rocks the upstream catchment is mainly distributed with paleozoic carbonate rocks mesozoic sedimentary and igneous rocks while the middle lower catchment is overlain by the paleozoic marine mesozoic sedimentary rocks and quaternary loose sediments of fluvial and lacustrine facies liu et al 2022b controlled by a subtropical monsoon climate the rainfall in the changjiang river catchment ranges from 400 mm yr in the source region to 1600 mm yr in the lower reaches it supplies over 65 and 86 of the annual water discharge 900 billion m3 yr and sediment load 350 mt yr to the estuary during the wet season from may to october respectively cwrc 1950s 2021 the vegetation within the catchment is dominated by c3 vascular plants wu et al 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection two expeditions were conducted in the wet season along the mainstem and tributaries of the changjiang river fig 1b in july august 2018 the mainstem comprised 12 sampling stations and the tributaries comprised 9 sampling stations from where samples were collected during extreme flood season upstream in july and downstream in august in contrast in july 2021 the mainstem comprised 14 sampling stations and the tributaries comprised 5 sampling stations since the water discharge and sediment loads in the wet season account for over 65 and 79 of annual quantity in 2018 and 2021 table s2 our samples in the wet season are representative of the whole year in addition water samples were collected at least once a month in the lower reaches near the city of nanjing nj sampling station which is about 270 km upstream from the estuary fig 1b from january december 2021 covering one complete hydrological year 19 samples in total owing to the fast water flow in the wet season wang et al 2012 and the similar poc content at different depths surface middle and bottom of the whole water column in the changjiang river liu et al 2019a 2019b we assumed that the water was well mixed and used sub surface water samples to represent the whole water column six water samples 0 5 m underwater 150 l total were collected from a cross section in the main channel using acid washed 25 l polyethylene samplers and were subsequently filtered immediately through pre combusted 450 c for 3 h glass fiber filters nominal pore size 0 7 μm whatman gf f to obtain suspended particulate matter spm all the filtered spm samples were stored at 20 c for further analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis the freeze dried and homogenized samples were acid treated with hcl 1 m to completely remove inorganic c prior to the analysis wu et al 2007 labile organic carbon was determined following a two step acid hydrolysis procedure with h2so4 as the extractant the method was previously described by rovira and vallejo 2002 and belay tedla et al 2009 briefly 500 mg of the decarbonated sample was hydrolyzed with 20 ml of 2 5 m h2so4 at 105 c for 30 min the hydrolysate was recovered by centrifugation and decantation the residue was washed with 20 ml of pure water and the washing supernatant was added to the hydrolysate this hydrolysate was regarded as labile pool i the remaining residue was hydrolyzed with 2 ml of 13 m h2so4 overnight at room temperature under continuous shaking the acid concentration was then brought down to 1 m by dilution with pure water and the sample was hydrolyzed at 105 c for 3 h with occasional shaking the second hydrolysate was regarded as labile pool ii labile pools i and ii were summed together to obtain the total labile pool the poc and particulate nitrogen pn contents were determined using an elemental analyzer flash 2000ht thermo fisher scientific and the precision of the determination is better than 0 02 wt and 0 002 wt respectively xing et al 2011 variability in repeated measurements n 57 of the suspended particulate matter was estimated to be 0 4 for poc and 1 7 for pn the stable isotopic composition was determined using a mass spectrometer mat253 thermo fisher scientific and the values of δ13c and δ15n were reported in units per million as follows 1 δ 13 c r sample r standard 1 1000 2 δ 15 n r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the ratios of 13c 12c 15n 14n for the sample and standard respectively the δ13c and δ15n values were reported using standard notation relative to the vpdb vienna pee dee belemnite standard and atmospheric nitrogen respectively the analytical precision was better than 0 1 based on replicate measurements 3 3 statistical analyses statistical analysis was carried out using the spss v 24 spss institute usa statistical differences in poc properties were evaluated with the one way analysis of variance anova at a confidence level of 0 05 a three endmember mixing model based on δ13c and n c values of poc was used to estimate the plant soil and rpp derived proportions in the study area the simulation was performed in matlab v r2020b math works usa using the markov chain monte carlo driven bayesian approach andersson et al 2015 the approach was run with 2 105 iterations using a burn in of 10 000 steps and a data thinning of 100 the model was written as follows 3 f soil δ 13 c soil f plant δ 13 c plant f r pp δ 13 c r pp δ 13 c poc 4 f soil n c soil f plant n c plant f r pp n c r pp n c poc 5 f soil f plant f r pp 1 where fsoil fplant and frpp represent the fractional proportion from plant soil and rpp respectively elemental values of spm and poc fluxes into the sea in 1997 and 2007 2008 were collected from previous literature table s3 wu et al 2007 mao et al 2011 where poc flux in 1997 was calculated by integrating bimonthly poc fluxes and poc flux in 2007 was calculated by integrating that of wet and dry seasons in addition since no large tributaries join the mainstem from nanjing to the estuary fig 1 we considered the annual poc flux in the nj station 270 km upstream of the estuary as the poc flux into the sea which was calculated by integrating monthly poc fluxes multiplying poc content by sediment loads the method is as follows 6 f i 1 n x i y i 7 f soil p l a n t r pp i 1 n x i y i f soil p l a n t r pp where f is the annual poc flux xi and yi are poc content and sediment load respectively fsoil plant rpp represents soil or plant or rpp derived poc flux and fsoil plant rpp represents soil or plant or rpp derived poc proportion here we use sediment loads at datong gauge the last gauge in the mainstem of the changjiang river 200 km upstream of nj station and 470 km upstream of the estuary as that into the sea which are 299 mt yr 138 mt yr and 102 mt yr in 1997 2007 and 2021 respectively the ssc suspended sediment concentration median grain size water discharge and sediment load data used in this study were obtained from bulletins of the changjiang water resources commission cwrc 1990 2021 available at https www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb the ssc was obtained by dividing annual discharge into sediment loads and is the average value of the year the grain size of suspended sediment was obtained by combining particle size meter pipette extinction meter and laser methods water discharge and sediment loads since 1990 were provided in fig s1 ssc and median grain size were provided in table 1 4 results 4 1 elemental and isotopic values of spm in the changjiang river the elemental and isotopic values of spm at different stations during the two surveys along the changjiang river showed spatial differences summarized in fig 2 a f and table 1 poc and pn contents exhibited similar trend characteristics in the mainstem and tributaries with the ranges of 0 95 2 70 1 46 0 39 mean standard deviation and 0 12 0 41 0 19 0 07 respectively in 2018 whereas the poc and pn contents ranged from 1 00 to 2 50 1 38 0 38 and 0 12 to 0 45 0 19 0 08 respectively in 2021 the δ13c values varied from 32 0 to 24 7 26 1 1 6 in 2018 and 29 7 to 24 3 25 7 1 1 in 2021 the δ15n values showed an increasing trend from the upper to middle lower reaches in both 2018 and 2021 with ranges of 1 2 5 8 3 8 1 2 and 2 3 7 1 4 8 1 4 respectively the poc pn ratios displayed a declining trend in the mainstem in 2018 with low values in the middle lower reaches contrary to that of δ15n values however stations js pzh and yb upstream showed lower poc pn ratios in 2021 6 01 6 94 and 7 55 respectively than that in 2018 13 38 10 96 and 8 49 respectively to further study the poc source from phytoplankton the composition of labile poc lpoc was determined based on samples in 2021 without extreme flooding during the sampling period the lpoc content ranged from 0 19 to 0 82 with higher values in the upper and middle reaches fig 2g the lpoc proportions in poc varied from 19 to 39 exhibiting a similar trend to lpoc content fig 2h and the labile poc pn ratios had a lower range of 3 90 5 70 fig 2i the annual elemental and isotopic values of spm from lower reaches were summarized in fig 2j l and table s5 the mean poc content value of spm at the nj station was 1 25 0 15 n 19 0 95 1 60 the mean δ13c values and poc pn ratios were 25 9 0 5 26 9 to 25 3 and 7 67 0 81 6 44 9 74 respectively 4 2 sources of poc in the changjiang river oc n ratios and δ13c values are widely used to determine the provenance of organic matter lamb et al 2006 goni et al 2008 schwestermann et al 2021 the oc n ratio of terrestrial organic matter e g plants is 20 and phytoplankton has significantly lower oc n ratios 4 8 than terrestrial organic matter hedges et al 1986 meyers 1994 the δ13c values of the c3 plants ranged between 25 and 28 while those for c4 ecosystems were significantly less negative hedges et al 1997 consequently the poc provenance in 2018 and 2021 was qualitatively identified using ranges of poc pn ratios and δ13c values in different sources based on previous studies fig 3 to further constrain the compositions of poc and study the poc derived from aquatic primary producers we calculated the relative contributions of poc derived from plants soil and rpp using the markov chain monte carlo driven bayesian approach based on n c ratio and δ13c value endmembers which is widely used to determine oc sources andersson et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 wu et al 2018 herein pn poc rather than poc pn was used because pn poc is more sensitive as an endmember of poc sources yu et al 2010 wei et al 2020 the endmember source assignments of δ13c and n oc values were based on data from previous studies as summarized in table 2 the model analysis results are shown in the fig 4 and tables s4 s5 in 2018 and 2021 the contribution from plants was the lowest 16 10 and 14 10 on average while that from soil was the highest 51 17 and 50 17 with a decreasing trend along the mainstem f 21 313 and 12 482 p 0 005 the rpp proportion was at an intermediate level 32 14 and 37 15 and became comparable with the soil proportion in the middle lower reaches 5 discussion 5 1 characterization of poc within the changjiang river catchment in both 2018 and 2021 poc exhibited different characteristics between upper and middle lower reaches in poc compositions figs 3 and 4 the proportion of algae sources increased significantly downstream of the tgr contrary to that of soil demonstrating the underlying spatial effect of tgr on poc compositions within the changjiang river dividing the river into two different source sink systems previous studies also revealed that the construction of the tgr altered the transport patterns of poc and sediment gao et al 2019 wang et al 2022 similarly the cascade reservoirs could change the connectivity of the changjiang river for their increased quantities and higher interception efficiency in this study station js downstream of the gyy dam was affected by the gyy dam exhibiting higher poc content and proportion of algae derived poc than other stations in 2021 as a component of poc the lpoc in the river is likely derived from modern organisms including terrestrial plants and aquatic algae and is easier to degrade the lower ratios 3 90 5 70 of labile poc pn revealed its algae source because plants usually have high values 10 lamb et al 2006 in addition the rpp proportions showed a positive correlation with the lpoc poc ratios r2 0 58 in 2021 further confirming the correlation between lpoc and algae as well as demonstrating the degradable characteristic of rpp derived poc both the qualitative provenance and quantitative results from the bayesian model fig 4a and b indicated that there is a similar trend and no significant difference for the three sources in the middle lower reaches between 2018 and 2021 f 0 363 0 708 and 1 149 p 0 05 whereas rpp derived poc upstream exhibited a different trend f 5 008 p 0 05 which was affected by flood events fig s2 the mean ssc of july was 94 4 mg l at the panzhihua gauge in 2018 which was over 4 5 times higher than that in 2021 20 3 mg l cwrc 2018 and 2021 during the extreme flood season in july 2018 the poc sources upstream displayed different characteristics with those in 2021 poc pn ratios exhibited higher values at stations js pzh and yb 13 38 10 96 and 8 49 respectively suggesting the dominance of soil in the poc source fig 3a and the soil proportions at the above stations were also higher in 2018 fig 4b the frequent heavy rainfall and flooding in 2018 severely eroded the soil along the river increasing the proportion of soil derived poc 5 2 reservoirs affecting the sources of poc in the changjiang river in this study based on samples collected in 2018 and 2021 and data of poc in the changjiang river from previous studies samples collected in april may 1997 and august 2007 wu et al 2007 mao et al 2011 we analyzed the characteristics of poc within the changjiang river catchment over three periods before 2003 the pre tgr impoundment stage 2003 2009 the initial tgr impoundment stage after 2010 the post cascade reservoirs impoundment stage 5 2 1 the tgr changed the sources of poc in the middle lower reaches the changes in poc sources in the middle lower reaches of the three periods are reflected gradually under the influence of the tgr fig 3b during the pre tgr impoundment stage 1997 most of the poc was terrestrial soil and plant during the initial tgr impoundment stage 2007 the poc pn ratios downstream decreased f 23 276 p 0 05 mean poc pn ratio 8 79 0 96 and the source of poc shifted to soil organic matter and freshwater algae during the post cascade reservoirs impoundment stage 2018 and 2021 the poc pn ratios downstream decreased further f 7 301 and 10 992 p 0 05 mean poc pn ratios 7 22 0 53 and 7 79 0 68 indicating the increased contribution of algae to the poc source based on the results of the bayesian model fig 4 soil derived poc was the dominant fraction in 1997 followed by plant and rpp derived poc in 2007 the proportion of rpp derived poc exceeded that of plant derived poc particularly from the tgr to the lower reaches mean value of 27 8 7 7 for rpp derived poc proportion however soil still maintained the highest proportion in 2018 and 2021 the rpp proportion continued to rise 42 12 and 39 4 9 respectively and the poc sources from the tgr to the lower reaches changed from being soil dominated pre tgr impoundment to soil and rpp dominated post tgr impoundment as a result of the influence of the tgr the poc sources downstream have clearly changed and the rpp contribution to poc has increased gradually during the three periods f 22 335 p 0 05 resulting in the transformation from terrestrial to aquatic sources this is also confirmed by chl a poc changes since tgr impoundment showing an increased trend of chl a poc ratios in the mid lower reaches wang et al 2022 the tgr impoundment altered the aquatic condition in the changjiang river and the sediment grain size and loads have been directly changed during the three periods fig 5 the average grain size was 0 008 0 001 mm in 1990 2003 and 0 004 0 001 mm in 2004 2010 at gauge yichang 44 km downstream of the tgr indicating a decrease in grain size after reservoir impoundment fine grained sediment has a stronger adsorption capacity for oc mayer et al 2004 burdige 2007 which can lead to a higher poc content however the suspended sediment grain size increased in 2011 2021 at gauges yichang and datong because of the continuous channel erosion moreover the tgr led to a sharp decline in the ssc of downstream reservoirs fig 5 lower water turbidity is conducive for phytoplankton in the river to utilize the sunlight thus promoting the phytoplankton growth anderson et al 1997 reynolds 2006 in addition to slowing river flow increasing water retention time and facilitating eutrophication these changes in aquatic conditions could significantly promote riverine primary productivity and change the poc sources within the catchment dynesius and nilsson 1994 vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 kronvang et al 2004 prats et al 2011 li et al 2017 simultaneously the tgr impoundment greatly affected the hydrological regime of the dongting and poyang lakes gao et al 2014 feng et al 2016 li et al 2020b and algal biomass has increased yang et al 2016 our study suggested that the poc in the dongting and poyang lakes displayed exceedingly more algae sources than that in the mainstem with high content and labile proportion low poc pn ratios and depleted δ13c table 1 indicating a higher proportion of algae sources in addition the tgr impoundment has changed these two lakes from sediment sinks before 2003 to sources after 2003 gao et al 2019 transporting 15 3 4 1 mt yr of sediment mean value of the last five years to the mainstem and accounting for approximately 21 of the sediment in the mainstem which also plays an important role in improving the rpp downstream 5 2 2 cascade reservoirs upstream changed local poc sources similarly the cascade reservoir impoundment changed the upstream aquatic condition and poc sources the average grain size was 0 015 0 001 mm in 2002 2011 and 0 009 0 003 mm in 2012 2021 at gauge xiangjiaba 2 km downstream of the xiangjiaba dam and the ssc displayed a sharp declining trend fig 5b poc content at stations js pzh 40 km downstream of the guanyinyan dam and yb 35 km downstream of the xiangjiaba dam was higher in 2021 2 10 1 73 and 1 55 respectively than that i at other downstream stations in the same year 1 23 0 18 on average and ii at the local areas before the cascade reservoir impoundment 0 73 0 09 on average 2007 indicating the significant impact of cascade reservoirs impoundment on poc content which was attributed to the promoted rpp li et al 2017 mao et al 2019 in addition upstream poc pn ratios showed lower values in 2021 than that before the cascade reservoirs impoundment 1997 and 2007 fig 3a and rpp proportions at stations js pzh and yb in 2021 49 15 40 15 and 37 15 were significantly higher than that at the neighboring stations in 2007 ranging from 10 10 to 23 13 thereby proving the positive impact of cascade reservoirs on the increase of rpp changes in poc characteristics in the cascade reservoirs tgr and lower reaches were shown in fig s6 5 3 response of poc flux to the reservoirs 5 3 1 current poc flux from the changjiang river into the sea the cascade reservoirs and tgr exhibited a high trapping effect on suspended particulate matter resulting in a sharp decline in sediment transport fig 6 c and d as the carrier of oc the interception of sediment by reservoirs directly led to a significant reduction in oc flux into the sea li et al 2015 wang et al 2022 according to previously observed data the poc flux into the sea showed a positive correction with sediment loads fig 6e with the decline of sediment loads since the 1980 s particularly in 2003 the poc flux sharply decreased as well moreover the variation in poc compositions especially in the labile poc component due to the interception effect can make a huger difference to carbon storage affecting the carbon cycle herein based on the sediment loads in the inflow cuntan and wulong gauges and outflow gauging stations yichang gauge of the tgr as well as the proportion of the three poc sources calculated above we selected the poc content of stations fl located at the head of the fluctuating backwater zone of the tgr and yc exit of the tgr to represent the content of inflow and outflow fig 7 a we then calculated the inflow and outflow poc flux of the tgr in 2018 and 2021 as well as the trapping efficiency of tgr to poc fig 7b in the wet season the tgr exerted a significantly high trapping effect on poc 73 in 2018 and 79 in 2021 and the poc quantity trapped by the tgr in 2018 1 31 mt was more than twice that in 2021 0 60 mt due to flood events throughout 2021 a total of 1 2 mt poc was transported from the changjiang river to the sea based on our calculation by integrating monthly poc fluxes our study indicates that the reservoirs trapped a significant amount of poc making up at least 50 of the poc flux into the sea owing to the evidently promoted rpp and the labile nature of poc in the reservoirs it is necessary to re evaluate the carbon burial and decomposition processes in these reservoirs with caution 5 3 2 changes in poc flux from different sources the significant trapping effect of the tgr and the different trapping efficiencies of poc from the three sources influence poc flux into the sea therefore we estimated the poc flux into the sea corresponding to the three stages fig 7c as expected the poc flux decreased during the three periods 2 2 mt 1 5 mt and 1 2 mt respectively and the poc fluxes from the three sources also changed the terrestrial i e plant derived and soil derived poc flux decreased significantly however the proportion of rpp derived poc gradually increased by more than one time 18 26 37 there are two main reasons for this firstly the cascade reservoirs and tgr have retained a lot of upstream terrestrial poc leading to a decrease in total and terrestrial poc flux secondly the reservoir construction extremely enhanced the rpp resulting in a higher proportion of poc derived from rpp moreover a significant amount of poc in the middle lower reaches was from channel erosion due to the tgr impoundment 0 39mt yr from yichang to datong which was characterized by old ages and accounted for 33 of the flux into the sea even though such a huge portion of aged poc was input into fluvial poc the proportion of rpp derived poc still rose indicating a significant improvement in rpp given that rpp derived poc has a shorter turnover time and faster decomposition rate than plant and soil derived poc schädel et al 2014 cotrufo et al 2015 repasch et al 2021 the changes in poc source proportions likely have a significant influence on poc storage efficiency in the estuary and coast 5 4 uncertainties of poc compositions and fluxes in this study uncertainties of poc compositions are largely subject to uncertainties of δ13c values and pn poc ratios there are contingencies for field sampling because of unpredictable weather conditions which may affect fluvial poc sources during the campaign in 2021 we tried not to encounter rainy weather to avoid the impact of accidental events the similar poc compositions of 2018 and 2021 in the middle lower reaches indicate the reliability of the results the endmember is also an important factor of uncertainties when calculating the source contribution we used the mean endmember values in the entire catchment which ignored the local variation of δ13c and pn poc poc fluxes were calculated based on monthly poc contents and sediment loads we collected samples monthly from january to may and twice a month from june to december in the lower reaches using one or two single poc observations to represent the monthly mean this sampling frequency might ignore variability of the poc content between two observations especially in flood season during which there was always frequent precipitation in addition the poc fluxes were estimated using poc content in nanjing station which is 200 km downstream of datong gauge station there might be a small amount of channel erosion in this section however our data in 2021 demonstrated that the poc at the datong and nanjing sampling stations displayed similar contents 1 06 at the datong and 1 11 at the nanjing in addition our annual poc content at nanjing mean value 1 25 is also probably consistent with that at datong in previous study 0 98 in dry season and 1 41 in flood season mao et al 2011 therefore our results can represent the poc flux from the changjiang river to the sea 5 5 global implications the changjiang river is expected to remain a hotspot for continuous dam construction and reservoir oc burial and mineralization the reservoirs retain a significant amount of poc every year and the trapping effect in the changjiang river has reduced the deposition flux of oc in the east china sea by 48 since 2006 and heavily affected the sink of oc wang et al 2020 a recent study shows that reservoirs emit more carbon than they bury globally which suggests that reservoirs are more inclined to be carbon sources keller et al 2021 thus the large poc quantity trapped in the reservoirs and labile characteristics of rpp derived poc are more likely to make reservoirs become huge carbon sources with continuous dam construction worldwide the degree of river fragmentation is being intensified rpp may be further improved which will have an adverse impact on carbon storage globally humankind has implemented a large number of hydropower projects in the past two decades zarfl et al 2015 gross 2016 and the impact of dams on sediment and oc is also found in other large rivers including the yellow nile amazon mississippi ganges bangladesh irrawaddy and mekong rivers galy et al 2008 wang et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 sadaoui et al 2018 hecht et al 2019 for instance the yellow river which used to be the most sediment laden river in the world with high sediment 1080 mt yr milliman and syvitski 1992 and poc fluxes 4 5 mt yr cauwet and mackenzie 1993 has also experienced extensive dam construction and a sharp reduction 90 in sediment and poc fluxes since the 1950s the interception of aged poc by reservoirs in the yellow river in combination with promoted primary production led to younger poc ages than that of upstream reservoirs lu et al 2022 in the upper mississippi river reservoir impoundment shifted heterotrophic headwaters toward autotrophic conditions with associated effects on the isotopic composition of poc voss et al 2017 similar variations in oc sources have occurred in middle small scale rivers as well such as the godavari india south saskatchewan canada saar germany klamath america and geum rivers south korea where dam impoundment promoted primary productivity and enhanced the fraction of labile organic carbon from algae pradhan et al 2014 huisman et al 2018 engel et al 2019 kang et al 2019 imtiazy et al 2023 our research sheds light on how reservoirs affect rpp and the labile composition of poc providing a quantitative perspective despite the global significance of reservoir influence on poc flux from land to ocean in influencing carbon cycling within the large river catchment the impact on riverine autochthonous poc hasn t obtained significant concern the poc derived from algae is highly labile and can be easily oxidized and decomposed changes in the composition of poc can have severe consequences for local carbon storage as well as estuarine coastal and global carbon cycles therefore further continuous observations and studies are required to assess the effects of intense anthropogenic perturbations on riverine oc compositions on a global scale 6 conclusion our study provides clear evidence that the impoundment of reservoirs has promoted rpp and significantly altered the sources and compositions of poc in the changjiang river owing to the influence of the tgr the poc sources in the middle lower reaches changed gradually from being soil dominated before the tgr impoundment to soil and rpp dominated after the tgr impoundment simultaneously the cascade reservoirs upstream raised the local proportion of rpp derived poc in addition under the impact of reservoirs terrestrial poc flux into the sea decreased significantly whereas the rpp derived poc flux increased gradually the improvement of the labile oc proportion in rivers worldwide may affect poc burial efficiency in the estuarine and coastal areas and influence the global carbon cycle 7 formatting of
