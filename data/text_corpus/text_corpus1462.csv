7310,fractured crystalline aquifers of mountain watersheds may host a significant portion of the world s freshwater supply to effectively utilize water resources in these environments it is important to understand the hydraulic properties groundwater storage and flow processes in crystalline aquifers and field derived insights are critically needed based on borehole hydraulic characterization and monitoring data this study inferred hydraulic properties and groundwater flow of a crystalline fractured aquifer in laramie range wyoming at three open holes completed in a fractured granite aquifer both slug tests and flute liner profiling were performed to obtain estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh televiewer i e optical and acoustic and flowmeter logs were then jointly interpreted to identify the number of flowing fractures and fracture zones based on these data hydraulic apertures were obtained for each borehole average groundwater velocity was then computed using kh aperture and water level monitoring data finally based on all available data including cores borehole logs lidar topography and a seismic p wave velocity model a three dimensional geological model of the site was built in this fractured aquifer 1 borehole kh varies over 4 orders of magnitude 10 8 10 5 m s kh is consistently higher near the top of the bedrock that is interpreted as the weathering front using a cutoff kh of 10 10 m s the hydraulically significant zone extends to 40 53 m depth 2 flute estimated hydraulic apertures of fractures vary over 1 order of magnitude and at each borehole the average hydraulic aperture by flute is very close to that obtained from slug tests thus slug test can be used to provide a reliable estimate of the average fracture hydraulic aperture 3 estimated average effective fracture porosity is 4 0 10 4 therefore this fractured aquifer can host significant quantity of water 4 natural groundwater velocity is estimated to range from 0 4 to 81 0 m day implying rapid pathways of fracture flow 5 the average ambient water table position follows the boundary between saprolite and fractured bedrock groundwater flow at the site appears topography driven keywords fractured aquifer slug test flute profiling borehole logging hydraulic aperture groundwater velocity and topographically driven flow 1 introduction a significant portion of the world s population relies on rivers that are sourced from fractured aquifers in mountain regions in the western usa alpine watersheds supply both surface water and groundwater to meet the water demands of over 60 million people barnett et al 2005 bales et al 2006 in many parts of the world especially in semi arid to arid regions such as in india and africa groundwater in crystalline aquifers is the only source of drinking water gustafson and krásný 1994 guihéneuf et al 2014 to appropriately manage such resources particularly in view of the projected warming in mountain environments compared to low lying regions pepin et al 2015 new hydrological knowledge about groundwater in mountain crystalline aquifers is required however groundwater storage and flow in most mountain environments are poorly known tague and grant 2009 kurylyk and hayashi 2017 mountain watersheds which often consist of granitic or metamorphic rocks are characterized with rough terrains that are difficult to access mountains are often sparsely populated thus few groundwater monitoring wells exist from which long term water level or characterization data can be obtained surficial soil or vegetation covers in these environments are often thin or absent giving rise to the perception that mountains are impervious to flow and thus have minimum storage for groundwater hood and hayashi 2015 however groundwater flow and storage in alpine watersheds can constitute a significant portion of the annual water budget as demonstrated by hood and hayashi 2015 as water demands increase in the future mountain environments similar to the downstream regions may become increasingly vulnerable to contamination this research aims to characterize a fractured crystalline aquifer in a headwater mountain watershed in wyoming to understand both groundwater storage and groundwater flow results of this study will provide parameters for developing hydrological models to capture the properties and processes in the future to quantify both groundwater storage and flow in a crystalline fractured aquifer hydraulic aperture of fractures is a critical parameter to determine on the one hand the aperture provides information on fracture porosity and groundwater storage on the other hand the aperture can be used to calculate an average linear velocity that indicates the speed of groundwater flow through fractures in order to obtain an estimate of the aperture two parameters of the aquifer are often characterized transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and the number of hydraulically active fractures many hydraulic testing methods exist that can be used to obtain transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity of a fractured aquifer pumping tests which are the most common method used in the field to interrogate large scale aquifer properties can give an average horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh estimates over the entire producing zones of an aquifer several tens of meters slug tests by modeling water level response in a well due to rapid submergence and subsequently removal of a solid slug can provide kh estimate in the vicinity of the test well liquid slugs i e addition removal of fluid can also be used to provide kh estimates most commonly used analytical solutions for slug tests are 1 hvorslev 1951 semi log plot method for partial or fully penetrating wells in homogeneous confined or unconfined aquifers with negligible aquifer storativity 2 cooper et al 1967 curve fitting method for fully penetrating wells in homogeneous confined aquifers and 3 bouwer and rice 1976 method for completely or partially penetrating wells in homogeneous unconfined aquifers screened below the water table all these methods are originally developed for homogeneous porous media shapiro and hsieh 1998 compared the results of slug tests in fractured rock interpreted with a homogeneous i e cooper et al 1967 solution and a heterogeneous model they found that the transmissivity estimated from both models are within one order of magnitude thus equivalent transmissivity can be obtained from slug test results for strongly heterogeneous media however slug tests results can be skewed by non ideal conditions in and adjacent to the wellbore if a low permeability positive skin exists in a wellbore both the hvorslev 1951 and bouwer and rice 1976 methods are more likely to yield hydraulic conductivity estimates of the well skin rather than that of the actual aquifer hyder et al 1994 hyder and butler 1995 as pointed out by butler et al 1996 the existence and nature of skin effects should be evaluated during the interpretation of slug tests both the pumping and standard slug test without packer system methods though commonly employed in the field cannot resolve aquifer heterogeneity in the vertical direction when vertical resolution of aquifer heterogeneity is required high resolution hydraulic testing methods are needed for example inflatable packers can be used to isolate one or more sections of a borehole for water injection or withdrawal during a well test e g cook 2003 quinn et al 2012 multilevel slug test is implemented by making use of a double packer system to determine a series of kh estimates for discrete depths in a well e g zlotnik and mcguire 1998 zlotnik and zurbuchen 2003 zemansky and mcelwee 2005 while a dipole flow test is conducted by using a triple packer system with a pump submerged in between two lower packers e g zlotnik et al 2001 other commonly used high resolution borehole hydraulic methods include borehole flowmeter logging e g molz et al 1989 paillet 1998 paradis et al 2011 direct push permeameter e g butler et al 2007 and flute liner profiling e g keller et al 2014 all the hydraulic testing methods with the exception of the flowmeter logging calls for the introduction or removal of a volume of water from the aquifer which can pose issues at contaminated sites where contaminant mobilization and waste water disposal need to be minimized to determine the number of hydraulically active i e flowing fractures in a crystalline aquifer borehole image logs and core logs can be used however large errors can arise in the interpretation of such logs for example micro cracks are difficult to identify from borehole images and core logs can contain drilling induced fractures that can be misidentified as formation fractures quinn et al 2011a b moreover not all fractures identified are necessarily hydraulically active for a fractured dolostone aquifer quinn et al 2011a b proposed a method for identifying flowing fractures that naturally exist in the formations they used constant head step tests with increasing injection rates to determine a set of critical flow rates and critical reynolds rec numbers when non darcian flow started to develop their method employs an iterative procedure by changing the assumed number of flowing fractures in each test interval until a high correlation coefficient between rec and calculated aperture was reached however their method was effective only under high flow rates that induce non darcian flow while for darcian flow regimes the method is not applicable for a crystalline fractured aquifer in a headwater mountain watershed in wyoming this study aims to estimate both kh and the number of hydraulically active fractures in order to obtain fracture aperture data we conducted a detailed aquifer characterization study using borehole televiewer logs flowmeter logs and borehole hydraulic tests specifically slug tests and flute blank liner profiling on three boreholes that tap into this aquifer our research took place at the blair wallis fractured rock hydrology research well field which lies in the laramie range in southeastern wyoming where nine bedrock wells have been drilled and completed at various depths the three boreholes investigated cover a range of depth and fracture intensity at the site and were thus selected for a focused hydraulic characterization study by jointly interpreting results from all borehole tests both transmissibility t and horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh were obtained at different vertical resolutions the number of flowing fractures for the same tested intervals were determined by jointly interpreting borehole televiewer i e optical and acoustic and impeller flowmeter logging under ambient flow conditions finally hydraulic apertures at various vertical scales were determined based on which fracture porosity and groundwater velocity under ambient flow condition were also estimated the implications of our results at the well field are discussed at the watershed scale to infer the importance of bedrock groundwater in the mountain environment 2 study site most crystalline aquifers consist of three zones an upper weathered zone a middle fractured zone and a lower and often less fractured zone krásný and sharp 2003 the blair wallis fractured granite hydrology research well field lies within the crow creek watershed of the laramie range which lies within us forest service land about 21 km southeast of laramie wyoming fig 1 a and b local climate data from the crow creek snotel station of the last 10 years show that the blair wallis well field has a mean annual temperature of 5 4 c and receives 620 mm of annual precipitation of which 90 falls as snow national resources conservation service 2015 during the summer season june to september average temperature is around 15 c while in the winter months december to march average temperature is around 5 c the geology of the well field consists of fractured granite bedrock overlain by 10 18 m of weathered granite saprolite based on jointly interpretation of both borehole televiewer logs and flowmeter logs at the site bedrock flowing fracture intensity diminishes with depth based on water level monitoring data collected from the well field the fractured bedrock is saturated with groundwater while the saprolite is either unsaturated or partially saturated by examining groundwater level data against snow water equivalent data from a snotel station that lies northeast 6 km from the well field groundwater in the fractured bedrock aquifer is recharged primarily from snowmelt infiltration in the laramie range which occurs in late spring fig 1 c note that only water level data from bw 1 2 5 6 and 7 are shown which captures the range of water level variability in the well field at the blair wallis well field nine bedrock wells have been completed that are cased to the bottom of the saprolite but remain open boreholes in the fractured granite a well schematic is shown in fig 2 this research focuses hydraulic characterization of three of these bedrock wells i e bw5 bw6 and bw7 which lie within the so called a type sherman granite which are generated 1 43 ga ago consisting of microcline plagioclase quartz hornblende biotite and ilmenite frost et al 1999 the configuration of these three wells are summarized in table 1 based on the completion data of each well and the monitored water level responses these three wells lie in an unconfined aquifer furthermore from flute liner profiling of the three wells presented later borehole transmissivity becomes negligible below approximately 40 53 m bgs which corresponds to observed lower frequency of flowing fractures beneath this depth thus each borehole is considered fully penetrating in the slug test interpretation 3 methods 3 1 slug test a standard slug test involves a rapid submergence and subsequently removal of a solid slug from a well casing or a borehole the water level responses were recorded and modeled by fitting them to the solution of a radial groundwater flow equation to obtain a horizontal hydraulic conductivity estimate for confined and unconfined aquifers both steady state and transient slug test solutions exist for example besides kh storativity of the aquifer can be additionally determined using the transient solution besides water level responses however other factors can lead to inaccurate parameter estimates e g well skin and non darcian flow can lead to a significantly underestimated kh e g quinn et al 2013 for different aquifers and well completions butler et al 1996 reported a series of guidelines to improve the quality of parameter estimates obtained from slug tests these guidelines were followed in the slug tests we carried out at the blair wallis well field in order to obtain representative near wellbore kh estimates and ensure that non ideal behaviors can be identified and properly interpreted this article reports the results of slug tests at bw5 bw6 bw7 which were carried out in late may and early june of 2017 for a given slug test given the diameter of the open borehole two sizes of solid slugs were used to generate two different initial water level displacement h0 at each well for bw5 the larger slug is 162 6 cm long and 6 cm diameter and the small slug is 120 cm long and 5 cm diameter for bw6 and bw7 the same set of slugs were used with dimensions of 184 2 cm long and 9 4 cm diameter large and 162 6 cm long and 6 cm diameter small at bw5 and bw7 the sequence of slugs used was large small large to evaluate borehole effects such as dynamic skin butler 1998 1 the large slug was first used to perform a set of slug in falling head or fh and slug out rising head or rh tests the same set of slug in and slug out tests were repeated 2 the small slug was used to perform a new set of slug in and slug out tests which were also repeated 3 step 1 is repeated using the large slug at bw6 due to the extremely slow water level recovery rate step 3 was carried out using the large slug only once thus six rising head tests and six falling head tests were performed at bw5 and bw7 and five rising head tests and five falling head tests were performed at bw6 for each well two different h0 were generated with a maximum h0 around 0 6 m table 1 given the moderate level of h0 during both fh and rh tests for each well water level was always within the casing thus the borehole was not de saturated during the rh test the water level data from the slug tests were analyzed using the bouwer rice method for a fully penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer bouwer and rice 1976 1 k h r c 2 ln r e r w 2 l 1 t ln h 0 h t where kh is near wellbore average horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the open hole interval rc is casing radius l is the length of open hole re is an influence radius in the formation at which there is assumed to be no change in hydraulic head rw is the radius of the open hole t is elapsed time from start of a slug test h0 is initial displacement at t 0 and ht is the displacement at time t the transmissivity of each open hole can then be determined by t kh l moreover at the blair wallis well field the magnitude of hydraulic gradient of 0 04 was averaged from september 2015 september 2016 during the dry winter season september march the magnitude was between 0 03 and 0 04 during the snowmelt season in spring the magnitude was between 0 04 and 0 05 in may and june the magnitude sometimes reached 0 05 thus for year 2015 2016 the magnitude of the head gradient was quite stable ranging from 0 03 to 0 05 in this study an average horizontal hydraulic gradient of 0 04 will be used to calculate the groundwater velocity according to the long term water level data we can assume that the gradient direction is roughly from east to west and thus groundwater flow direction is roughly west to east if horizontal isotropy can be assumed moreover based on our analysis of water level trends over time direction of the overall head gradient vector does not change significantly over time classic slug test solutions developed for a confined aquifer i e cooper et al 1967 was also applied to interpreting the same slug tests done in this unconfined aquifer this solution is also a transient flow solution which can lead to the estimation of the specific storage coefficient ss which reflects the elastic storage of the aquifer during a slug test if the induced groundwater velocity is high non darcian flow can occur whereas head gradient is not linearly related to the flow rate into and out of the formation hydraulic head responses under non darcian flow when interpreted using the standard slug test solutions derived for laminar flow can lead to underestimated kh and consequently underestimated hydraulic aperture b e g quinn et al 2011a b to test for non darcian flow in granular deposits butler et al 1996 pointed out the need to carry out a series of slug tests with different h0 non darcian flow can be identified by fitting to the classic solutions such as hvorslev semi log plots and cooper curve fitting for both porous and fractured rocks a strong dependence of the estimated kh on h0 is considered evidence of non darcian flow butler et al 1996 quinn et al 2013 ji and koh 2015 such dependence is exhibited as an increasingly lower value of estimated kh with increasing slug size to determine if non darcian flow has occurred during slug tests in a formation with a single fracture a reynold number re can be defined ji et al 2008 ji and koh 2015 2 re ρ w vb μ ρ q w μ where ρw m l3 is density of groundwater v l t is flow velocity in the fracture b l is fracture aperture μ m lt is fluid viscosity q l3 t is flow rate in the fracture and w l is the fracture width perpendicular to flow laboratory experiments with single fracture models indicate that non darcian flow can be significant when re is greater than 1 10 e g zimmerman et al 2004 ranjith and darlington 2007 ji et al 2008 given that hydraulic conductivity of granite matrix is on the order of 10 13 m s e g mohnke and yaramanci 2008 we assume that during the slug tests groundwater flowed into out of the wellbore only through flowing fractures therefore a mean flow rate can be calculated as 3 q mean i 1 n q i n where qi l3 t is the flow rate at the i th fracture and n is the number of flowing fractures in the tested zone because during both rh and fh tests at bw 5 6 and 7 the water level in the borehole is always within the casing the total flow rate can be given as 4 i 1 n q i π r c 2 δ h δ t where rc l is radius of the casing and δh l is change of hydraulic head in the tested interval during time δt t in this study for each flowing fracture water level change in the borehole per second was used to calculate an average re note that the re computed using eqs 2 4 is a mean value over all the flowing fractures in a borehole and it is likely that re of individual fractures vary from the mean for a granitic aquifer with several fractures ji and koh 2015 found that non darcian flow can be generated when an average re reached 3 this suggests that for media with multiple fractures non darcian flow is possible when re is relatively small 3 2 flute liner profiling flute profiling is a high resolution hydraulic testing method for estimating t or kh along an open borehole see keller et al 2014 for details compared to the standard packers tests flute profiling can yield t estimates cost effectively and is considered suitable for delineating flow zones in strongly heterogeneous porous and fractured rocks a suite of flute blank liner and one time hydraulic head profiling were performed below the casings of bw5 bw6 and bw7 to identify permeable fractures along the open holes their transmissivity profiles as well as the formation head distribution at the time of the profiling at the beginning of the liner profiling method a flexible fabric cylinder open at the top and closed at the bottom was installed at the top of casing water was filled into the liner to create a hydraulic head differential between the inside and outside of the liner which pulls the liner downward while the liner travels down the borehole it pushes water beneath the liner from the open hole into the formation through transmissive fractures at each depth the descent rate of the liner is positively correlated with the transmissivity of the remaining length of the open hole beneath the liner as the liner goes down its descent rate decreases because the transmissive features of the open hole are gradually sealed off the liner velocity was measured using two encoders that are placed on a meter roller which recorded the position of the liner over every 0 5 s during profiling this technique also allows the measurement of a large velocity range or liner descent rate keller et al 2014 a volumetric flow rate can be determined from the descent rate while head gradients can be calculated from transducers placed above and beneath the liner a transmissivity can then be estimated using the thiem equation assuming steady state radial flow from borehole into the formation 5 t δ q 2 π δ h ln r e r w where δq l3t is the flow rate t l2 t is the transmissivity of a measured interval δh l is the applied head difference re l is an influence radius in the formation at which there is assumed to be no change in hydraulic head and rw l is the radius of the open hole however detection limit of flute liner profiling is a function of the descent velocity and small velocity changes can be difficult to detect if the descent velocity is high thus t estimates obtained from flute profiling may be less accurate and precise than the short interval straddle packer tests quinn et al 2015 however compared to packer tests flute profiling is less time consuming and can often circumvent the leakage issues due to the existence of preferential flow paths between packers keller et al 2014 such preferential flow paths often characterize strong heterogeneous media such as the fractured granite that we investigate in this work 3 3 borehole televiewer and flowmeter logging at each well ql40 abi 2g borehole televiewer i e optical and acoustic and ql40 sfm spinner flowmeter mt sopris instrument denver co logging were jointly interpreted to identify flowing fractures along the open hole borehole televiewer logs either optical and acoustic can be used to identify apparent fractures along the borehole wall but micro cracks cannot always be identified from borehole televiewer also the identified fractures from such logs are not always hydraulically active under ambient flow flowmeter logging can be used to detect variation of vertical flow rates along an open hole and significant flow rate differences between adjacent positions can indicate the approximate location of an flowing fracture or fractured zone additionally flowmeter logging can be used to detect flowing micro cracks which provide conduits for groundwater but cannot be identified by the borehole televiewer at bw5 6 and 7 impeller flowmeter logs were obtained which yield a flow rate profile that can be used to filter out flowing fractures from fractures identified from borehole televiewer logs also the equivalent flowing micro cracks which cannot be seen from borehole televiewer logs by a combined interpretation of borehole televiewer and flowmeter logging the number of equivalent flowing fractures can be obtained for a given borehole here we emphasize that cores were only used as reference for identifying flowing fractures this is because 1 at the blair wallis field site only five of nine bedrock wells were cored i e bw1 bw2 bw3 bw4 and bw5 and bw6 bw7 bw8 and bw9 were not cored 2 there are a number of drilling induced fractures in the cores which do not represent the actual borehole condition for bw5 where we have both core and logging data we can examine fractures jointly fig 3 some of the observed fractures in cores with weathered surfaces suggest that they are natural fractures these are also identified by examining the logging data at the same depth interval which suggests the reliability of the logging data there are also a few drilling induced fractures in cores these do not exist along the wellbore and can therefore not be identified from the borehole logging data for bw6 and bw7 we only have logging data with which flowing fractures were identified 3 4 hydraulic aperture determination by solving the one dimensional navier stokes equations for laminar flow in a single parallel smooth walled planar fracture romm 1966 obtains the cubic law 6 q x ρ w gb 3 w 12 μ h x where ρw is the water density m l3 g is gravity acceleration l t2 b is the hydraulic aperture of the fracture l w is the width of the fracture normal to flow l μ is the dynamic viscosity of water m lt and h x is the hydraulic gradient in the direction of flow for a set of parallel uniform fractures snow 1965 further derived an equation relating the equivalent transmissivity and an average hydraulic aperture 7 t ρ w gnb 3 12 μ where n is the number of hydraulically active fractures in the test interval however eq 7 assumes that all fractures are identical if it is applied to non uniformly distributed fractures with variable apertures the single estimated b thus reflects an average hydraulic aperture quinn et al 2011a b based on eq 1 substituting the calculated t values and the number of flowing fractures n into eq 7 an average hydraulic aperture can be written as 8 b 12 μ t ρ w gn 3 in this research different hydraulic tests can lead to an estimated kh or t for different support volumes thus the aperture calculated using eq 8 can yield b at various resolutions 4 results and discussion 4 1 slug test results and analysis 4 1 1 qualitative analysis of well skin effect theories have pointed out that when there is no well skin effect the duration of a slug test would be independent of the normalized head i e h t h0 e g butler et al 1996 this suggests that when the normalized head is plotted against time for a series of slug tests with different h0 the curves of the normalized head would coincide figs 4 6 plot the slug test results for bw5 bw6 and bw7 respectively under two different h0 as shown in fig 4 and fig 6 because all the curves almost completely coincide especially during the rising head tests skin effect for bw5 and bw7 is considered negligible in bw6 fig 5 however the normalized water level responses do not coincide exactly especially when the h0 is relatively large may suggest a skin effect both airlift and step tests carried out in bw6 in october 2016 have produced sediments consisting of clay and granite minerals the sediment production suggests that fractures near the borehole contain infills that can be mobilized during the slug test in comparison no or very limited sediments were produced during the same airlift tests of bw5 and bw7 for the three wells a set of horizontal hydraulic conductivity were estimated using both the cooper et al 1967 curve fitting solution and the bouwer rice model bouwer and rice 1976 results are summarized in table 2 which presents the set of kh estimated for each well under both fh and rh conditions and for the repeat tests as well based on these kh estimates a mean and a standard deviation were obtained for each well the standard deviations generally are on the order of 10 7 or smaller suggesting that the estimated kh are reliable with low uncertainty furthermore for each well the ratio between the highest estimated kh and the lowest estimated kh is less than 1 5 which suggests that any skin effect exhibited during the slug test i e bw6 is hydraulically insignificant and may not need to be accounted for in the slug test interpretation using the classic solutions for bw5 and bw7 kh estimates using the cooper et al 1967 solution are more than twice as large as those estimated using the bouwer rice model to explain this deviation butler et al 1996 pointed out that the cooper et al model can lead to a significantly overestimated kh of the formation when a dimensionless storage parameter α of the formation is moderate to low 9 α r s 2 s s l r c 2 where rs is the effective radius of the screen or open borehole l ss is specific storage 1 l l is the length of the open borehole l and rc is radius of casing l using the cooper et al 1967 model which yields ss α obtained for bw5 6 and 7 ranges from 10 7 to 10 10 which suggests that this deviation is expected and results obtained using cooper et al model are less reliable in the rest of this paper all kh were obtained using the bouwer rice model 4 1 2 non darcian flow for moderately permeable fractured dolostone and sandstone with kh ranging from 10 4 10 5 m s quinn et al 2013 conducted a series of slug tests as well as constant head step tests using straddle packers their results suggest that non darcian flow can be generated under small h0 0 2 m for a fractured granite with kh ranging from 10 7 10 8 m s however ji and koh 2015 found that nonlinear flow arose only when h0 was over 1 0 m a threshold h0 above which groundwater flow regime transforms to non darcian flow thus appears to depend on kh of the formation in the vicinity of the well at bw5 6 and 7 most kh range from 10 6 10 7 m s which lie in between those of the above reported sites thus non darcian flow is evaluated by examining the slug test results for bw 5 6 and 7 we examine whether the estimated kh depends on the initial slug size only bw6 showed that the mean of the estimated kh slightly decreased with increasing h0 fig 7 although the sample size is small and the lowest estimate 7 54 10 7 has strongly influenced this mean we conclude that non darcian flow may have occurred in bw6 while bw5 and bw7 are interpreted to have had only linear flow during slug tests to examine potential non darcian flow during the slug tests at bw6 a set of reynolds number re were calculated following ji and koh 2015 using the monitored hydraulic heads and the estimated number of flowing fractures total fracture densities were initially estimated at 0 25 m intervals from the optical obi and acoustic abi logs the subset of flowing fractures were then identified by a joint analysis of borehole televiewer and constant rate impeller flowmeter data the constant rate data were collected when the flowmeter was run both up and down the borehole at the slowest speed possible 1 5 m min in our case after correction for the speed and conversion to flow rate based on previous calibration of the tool in boreholes with known diameters the upgoing and downgoing flowmeter data were differenced this results in an impeller flowmeter curve that can be used to highlight zones of inflow and outflow for the depth interval of 41 55 m bgs in bw7 the obi and abi televiewer logs are shown along with the impeller flowmeter log fig 8 the black and red zones displayed in the filtered flowmeter log represent inflow and outflow respectively for this fracture zone only the depth intervals that correspond to inflow black and outflow red zones are then considered as flowing fracture zones for all three wells the number of fractures identified from borehole televiewer logs is plotted along with the number of flowing fractures as additionally filtered by borehole flowmeter fig 9 the total number of flowing fractures determined at bw5 bw6 and bw7 at 1 0 m intervals are 143 113 and 174 respectively for bw6 fig 10 shows the calculated re for every second of a slug test this re was also compared among the slug tests with different h0 at this well the maximum re calculated from a set of tests i e five fh tests and five rh tests are always under 8 and most of the re are under 3 re computed for the two different h0 also do not differ significantly in addition there are no trends indicating that the larger h0 results in a larger early time re nor that a larger early time re corresponds to smaller estimated kh fig 11 in summary for all three wells groundwater flow during the slug tests using the small h0 i e 0 23 m are always in linear flow regime for the slug tests carried out using the larger h0 non darcian flow is nonexistent or negligible 4 2 flute profiling results and analysis for the three wells borehole kh determined using flute blank profiling is shown in fig 12 for all wells the kh profiles i e a discrete kh value determined over 30 cm borehole interval exhibit a decreasing trend with depth which corresponds to the observed decrease in the frequency of flowing fractures with depth as obtained from flowmeter logging see fig 9 at each well the kh profile exhibits variation over 4 orders of magnitude with maximum kh reaching up to 10 5 m s despite the variability kh values are consistently higher near the top of the open borehole clearly significant vertical heterogeneity exists in this aquifer whereas kh is the highest at the top of the bedrock this region lies beneath the saprolite zone which receives snow water infiltration from the land surface the top of the fractured bedrock thus lies at the so called weathering front flinchum 2017 however the formulation used to determine the flute kh profile is deterministic in the field transducer measurement errors were considered relatively insignificant further analysis may be required to determine the uncertainty in the estimation although for all wells the flute determined kh profiles yield an equivalent open hole transmissivity that is similar in magnitude and often much better within a factor of 2 with those determined by the slug tests table 3 it is noteworthy that the flute values for bw5 and 6 are just above the upper end of the slug test ranges but that for bw7 is below the slug test range kh estimated at the upper portion of the borehole can be less reliable because the transmissivity over the remaining borehole interval is relatively high which gives rise to a faster liner descent velocity quinn et al 2015 since the detection limit of flute liner profiling is a function of the descent velocity and small velocity changes can be difficult to detect if the descent velocity is high the flute method may underestimate the high kh intervals during the early profiling period i e two notable peak values in the bw7 flute interval moreover flute profiling was done months before the slug tests and near bore fractures may have changed over this time due to fines migration and settling all these factors can influence the estimated kh between slug tests and flute profiling without further testing it is difficult to determine why the flute values for bw5 and 6 are just above the upper end of the slug test ranges but that for bw7 is below the slug test range overall flute determined kh profiles yield an equivalent open hole transmissivity similar to those determined by the slug tests 4 3 determination of hydraulic aperture and groundwater velocity using the number of flowing fractures as determined from borehole televiewer and flowmeter logs and the transmissivity values obtained from slug tests and flute an average hydraulic aperture for a given tested interval i e vertical resolution in flute profiles or the entire open borehole tested by a slug test can be obtained using eq 8 for all three wells the distribution of b based on flute profiling is shown along with its univariate statistics fig 13 in the same figure b determined based on the mean kh value obtained from the slug tests is also shown because the slug test derived kh varies over a narrow range the standard deviation is generally less than 10 7 m s with fewer measurements a distribution of slug test derived b is not presented results suggest that for all three wells 1 the flute derived b varies greatly at each well indicating substantial vertical variability in the distribution of fracture aperture 2 there is lateral variability in the mean hydraulic aperture obtained from both the flute and slug tests b for bw5 bw6 and bw7 is 90 92 μm 88 86 μm and 103 105 μm respectively table 4 and fig 13 3 a high degree of correspondence exists between the average b derived from flute profiling and the b value determined from slug tests which confirms a similar scaling relation observed between slug tests derived transmissivity and those of multilevel injection tests for a fractured granite aquifer in mirror lake new hampshire shapiro and hsieh 1998 therefore at this site slug test can be used to estimate an accurate average hydraulic aperture over the open hole if the distribution of hydraulic aperture is required high resolution t data along the open hole is needed there are two conceptual approaches for determining groundwater velocity one is the equivalent porous media epm model freeze and cherry 1979 and the other is the discrete fracture parallel plate model novakowski 2000 both models emphasize laminar flow upon which the darcy law is established in the epm model the formation is analyzed by treating it as an equivalent homogeneous porous medium in the discrete fracture model all flow is assumed to occur in the interconnected fractures and rock matrix is considered impermeable under the assumption that all the flowing fractures are identical with the same local t values both methods will result in the same computed average linear groundwater velocity v below we assume that for each interval analyzed by the slug test or flute profiling it contains an identical set of horizontal flowing fractures thus assuming an epm v is computed using a field scale darcy flux l t and an effective fracture porosity ϕf 10 v q h ϕ f q h k h dh dx where ϕf is determined using the estimated hydraulic aperture s for the fracture s divided by the length of open hole and dh dx is the lateral hydraulic gradient along the direction of the flow which was computed based on long term water level observations an average hydraulic gradient of 0 04 was used to calculate darcy flux for both slug tests and flute liner profile based on data collected at all three wells an estimated effective or bulk ϕf is on the order of 10 4 which is within the range for fractured rock 10 2 10 5 as reported by freeze and cherry 1979 with a standard deviation on the order of 10 6 table 5 a set of computed groundwater velocities obtained based on slug test results are also listed the average groundwater velocity calculated based on slug tests is 17 0 m day bw5 15 1 m day bw6 and 22 2 m day bw7 respectively in addition for the same wells an average v for each interval of the flute profile can be obtained using eq 10 assuming a homogeneous equivalent porous medium fig 14 similar to the estimated hydraulic aperture along the open hole groundwater velocity exhibits 2 orders of magnitude variation at each well with a minimum of 0 4 m day and a maximum value of 81 0 m day this corresponds to the heterogeneity of the flute derived kh the calculated groundwater velocity is similar to the results reported by quinn et al 2011a b for a fractured dolostone aquifer it should also be pointed out that from eqs 8 and 10 one can deduce that for each flute test interval 11 v t bn dh dx this indicates that groundwater velocity distribution is related to three distributions b n and t thus the v histogram does not have a linear correlation with the b histogram 4 4 geological model of blair wallis based on all available site data including cores borehole logs lidar topography and a seismic p wave velocity model three zones can be identified at the well field upper saprolite middle fractured bedrock and underlying protolith less fractured bedrock the saprolite and fractured bedrock boundary was first determined at the borehole location at approximately the bottom of the surface casing flinchum 2017 identified a 1 2 km s seismic p wave velocity associated with that depth and created this boundary by extracting the 1 2 km s velocity contour map from a three dimensional 3d volume of the inverted p wave velocities according to flinchum 2017 the boundary between fractured granite and protolith is estimated by extracting the 4 0 km s velocity contour map from the same 3d volume because this velocity was estimated by conducting a survey over an intact granite outcrop near the well field for the upper two zones a 3d geological model of the field site was built fig 15 where the fractured bedrock is observed to be 4 the thickness of the saprolite along an east west cross section of the model fig 15 f which parallels the average hydraulic head gradient long term average water levels from four wells are projected despite the limited data water levels appear to be following the boundary between the saprolite and fractured bedrock the water levels were thus interpolated between the wells following the same boundary despite local variations water table dips to the east and suggests topographically driven flow 5 conclusions in this study hydraulic parameters of an unconfined fractured granite aquifer were characterized using borehole data from three wells in the blair wallis fractured rock hydrology research well field in laramie range wyoming the borehole data include those from hydraulic tests i e slug tests and flute profiling and borehole logging i e flowmeter under ambient flow condition optical and acoustic televiewer by analyzing a set of repeat slug tests with different initial displacements and calculating an average re for either individual or equivalent fracture we concluded that both skin effect and non darcian flow which may lead to an underestimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh are negligible during the slug tests flute profiling a high resolution kh profiling method at the research site it has 0 3 m vertical resolution was used as an alternative way of estimating discrete kh by jointly interpreting borehole televiewer logs with flowmeter logs the number of flowing fractures along the open borehole can be determined for each well based on kh estimates from slug tests and flute an average hydraulic aperture is estimated for the entire open hole and for the discrete flute test intervals given the aperture data and the site scale horizontal hydraulic gradient an effective fracture porosity and groundwater velocity were estimated finally based on all available data including cores borehole logs lidar topography and a seismic p wave velocity model a three dimensional geological model of the site was built results of this characterization study are summarized as 1 a hydraulically significant zone at the well field extends to 40 53 m depth based on flute profiling kh of the three wells varies over 4 orders of magnitude 10 8 10 5 m s with a maximum value reaching 10 5 m s despite this variability kh is found to be consistently higher near the top of the open holes compared to kh of the deeper intervals this high k zone corresponds to observed high fracture density in the bedrock which is interrelated by us to be the weathering front 2 the flute estimated hydraulic apertures for all wells vary over one order of magnitude 14 μm 200 μm indicating vertical heterogeneity in fractures based on slug test derived kh average hydraulic apertures calculated are 92 μm bw5 86 μm bw6 and 105 μm bw7 moreover at each well an average aperture obtained from its flute profile is very close to that obtained from slug test suggesting that slug test can be used to provide a reliable average aperture estimate 3 based on the estimated hydraulic apertures an effective fracture porosity is estimated to be 4 0 10 4 with a standard deviation of 8 4 10 6 thus fractured crystalline rock in this headwater watershed can host significant quantity of groundwater 4 given water level monitoring data which suggest an average hydraulic gradient of 0 04 under ambient flow condition groundwater velocity is estimated to range from 0 4 to 81 0 m day implying rapid pathways for groundwater flow however these values are considered a rough approximation because only a single gradient value in space time is used under other flow conditions especially following spring snowmelt which occurred before the well test season groundwater velocity is likely different with more significant flow 5 the average ambient water table position follows the interface between saprolite and fractured bedrock and dips to the east the groundwater system at the site appears to be topography driven because groundwater flow in crystalline rocks not only depends on fracture aperture and porosity but also depends on the connectivity of the fractures future work will aim to characterize the orientation extent and connectivity of the fracture network at the well field by employing cross hole hydraulic tests in combination with surface and borehole geophysical measurements depending on the specific geophysical and hydraulic testing methods however increased volumes of the fractured aquifer will likely be interrogated e g laterally such volume can range from the near wellbore scale to inter well or larger scales and vertically parameters can be obtained at either logging resolution or for an entire borehole interval in fractured rocks scale effects is a well known phenomenon e g hsieh 1998

7310,fractured crystalline aquifers of mountain watersheds may host a significant portion of the world s freshwater supply to effectively utilize water resources in these environments it is important to understand the hydraulic properties groundwater storage and flow processes in crystalline aquifers and field derived insights are critically needed based on borehole hydraulic characterization and monitoring data this study inferred hydraulic properties and groundwater flow of a crystalline fractured aquifer in laramie range wyoming at three open holes completed in a fractured granite aquifer both slug tests and flute liner profiling were performed to obtain estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh televiewer i e optical and acoustic and flowmeter logs were then jointly interpreted to identify the number of flowing fractures and fracture zones based on these data hydraulic apertures were obtained for each borehole average groundwater velocity was then computed using kh aperture and water level monitoring data finally based on all available data including cores borehole logs lidar topography and a seismic p wave velocity model a three dimensional geological model of the site was built in this fractured aquifer 1 borehole kh varies over 4 orders of magnitude 10 8 10 5 m s kh is consistently higher near the top of the bedrock that is interpreted as the weathering front using a cutoff kh of 10 10 m s the hydraulically significant zone extends to 40 53 m depth 2 flute estimated hydraulic apertures of fractures vary over 1 order of magnitude and at each borehole the average hydraulic aperture by flute is very close to that obtained from slug tests thus slug test can be used to provide a reliable estimate of the average fracture hydraulic aperture 3 estimated average effective fracture porosity is 4 0 10 4 therefore this fractured aquifer can host significant quantity of water 4 natural groundwater velocity is estimated to range from 0 4 to 81 0 m day implying rapid pathways of fracture flow 5 the average ambient water table position follows the boundary between saprolite and fractured bedrock groundwater flow at the site appears topography driven keywords fractured aquifer slug test flute profiling borehole logging hydraulic aperture groundwater velocity and topographically driven flow 1 introduction a significant portion of the world s population relies on rivers that are sourced from fractured aquifers in mountain regions in the western usa alpine watersheds supply both surface water and groundwater to meet the water demands of over 60 million people barnett et al 2005 bales et al 2006 in many parts of the world especially in semi arid to arid regions such as in india and africa groundwater in crystalline aquifers is the only source of drinking water gustafson and krásný 1994 guihéneuf et al 2014 to appropriately manage such resources particularly in view of the projected warming in mountain environments compared to low lying regions pepin et al 2015 new hydrological knowledge about groundwater in mountain crystalline aquifers is required however groundwater storage and flow in most mountain environments are poorly known tague and grant 2009 kurylyk and hayashi 2017 mountain watersheds which often consist of granitic or metamorphic rocks are characterized with rough terrains that are difficult to access mountains are often sparsely populated thus few groundwater monitoring wells exist from which long term water level or characterization data can be obtained surficial soil or vegetation covers in these environments are often thin or absent giving rise to the perception that mountains are impervious to flow and thus have minimum storage for groundwater hood and hayashi 2015 however groundwater flow and storage in alpine watersheds can constitute a significant portion of the annual water budget as demonstrated by hood and hayashi 2015 as water demands increase in the future mountain environments similar to the downstream regions may become increasingly vulnerable to contamination this research aims to characterize a fractured crystalline aquifer in a headwater mountain watershed in wyoming to understand both groundwater storage and groundwater flow results of this study will provide parameters for developing hydrological models to capture the properties and processes in the future to quantify both groundwater storage and flow in a crystalline fractured aquifer hydraulic aperture of fractures is a critical parameter to determine on the one hand the aperture provides information on fracture porosity and groundwater storage on the other hand the aperture can be used to calculate an average linear velocity that indicates the speed of groundwater flow through fractures in order to obtain an estimate of the aperture two parameters of the aquifer are often characterized transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and the number of hydraulically active fractures many hydraulic testing methods exist that can be used to obtain transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity of a fractured aquifer pumping tests which are the most common method used in the field to interrogate large scale aquifer properties can give an average horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh estimates over the entire producing zones of an aquifer several tens of meters slug tests by modeling water level response in a well due to rapid submergence and subsequently removal of a solid slug can provide kh estimate in the vicinity of the test well liquid slugs i e addition removal of fluid can also be used to provide kh estimates most commonly used analytical solutions for slug tests are 1 hvorslev 1951 semi log plot method for partial or fully penetrating wells in homogeneous confined or unconfined aquifers with negligible aquifer storativity 2 cooper et al 1967 curve fitting method for fully penetrating wells in homogeneous confined aquifers and 3 bouwer and rice 1976 method for completely or partially penetrating wells in homogeneous unconfined aquifers screened below the water table all these methods are originally developed for homogeneous porous media shapiro and hsieh 1998 compared the results of slug tests in fractured rock interpreted with a homogeneous i e cooper et al 1967 solution and a heterogeneous model they found that the transmissivity estimated from both models are within one order of magnitude thus equivalent transmissivity can be obtained from slug test results for strongly heterogeneous media however slug tests results can be skewed by non ideal conditions in and adjacent to the wellbore if a low permeability positive skin exists in a wellbore both the hvorslev 1951 and bouwer and rice 1976 methods are more likely to yield hydraulic conductivity estimates of the well skin rather than that of the actual aquifer hyder et al 1994 hyder and butler 1995 as pointed out by butler et al 1996 the existence and nature of skin effects should be evaluated during the interpretation of slug tests both the pumping and standard slug test without packer system methods though commonly employed in the field cannot resolve aquifer heterogeneity in the vertical direction when vertical resolution of aquifer heterogeneity is required high resolution hydraulic testing methods are needed for example inflatable packers can be used to isolate one or more sections of a borehole for water injection or withdrawal during a well test e g cook 2003 quinn et al 2012 multilevel slug test is implemented by making use of a double packer system to determine a series of kh estimates for discrete depths in a well e g zlotnik and mcguire 1998 zlotnik and zurbuchen 2003 zemansky and mcelwee 2005 while a dipole flow test is conducted by using a triple packer system with a pump submerged in between two lower packers e g zlotnik et al 2001 other commonly used high resolution borehole hydraulic methods include borehole flowmeter logging e g molz et al 1989 paillet 1998 paradis et al 2011 direct push permeameter e g butler et al 2007 and flute liner profiling e g keller et al 2014 all the hydraulic testing methods with the exception of the flowmeter logging calls for the introduction or removal of a volume of water from the aquifer which can pose issues at contaminated sites where contaminant mobilization and waste water disposal need to be minimized to determine the number of hydraulically active i e flowing fractures in a crystalline aquifer borehole image logs and core logs can be used however large errors can arise in the interpretation of such logs for example micro cracks are difficult to identify from borehole images and core logs can contain drilling induced fractures that can be misidentified as formation fractures quinn et al 2011a b moreover not all fractures identified are necessarily hydraulically active for a fractured dolostone aquifer quinn et al 2011a b proposed a method for identifying flowing fractures that naturally exist in the formations they used constant head step tests with increasing injection rates to determine a set of critical flow rates and critical reynolds rec numbers when non darcian flow started to develop their method employs an iterative procedure by changing the assumed number of flowing fractures in each test interval until a high correlation coefficient between rec and calculated aperture was reached however their method was effective only under high flow rates that induce non darcian flow while for darcian flow regimes the method is not applicable for a crystalline fractured aquifer in a headwater mountain watershed in wyoming this study aims to estimate both kh and the number of hydraulically active fractures in order to obtain fracture aperture data we conducted a detailed aquifer characterization study using borehole televiewer logs flowmeter logs and borehole hydraulic tests specifically slug tests and flute blank liner profiling on three boreholes that tap into this aquifer our research took place at the blair wallis fractured rock hydrology research well field which lies in the laramie range in southeastern wyoming where nine bedrock wells have been drilled and completed at various depths the three boreholes investigated cover a range of depth and fracture intensity at the site and were thus selected for a focused hydraulic characterization study by jointly interpreting results from all borehole tests both transmissibility t and horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh were obtained at different vertical resolutions the number of flowing fractures for the same tested intervals were determined by jointly interpreting borehole televiewer i e optical and acoustic and impeller flowmeter logging under ambient flow conditions finally hydraulic apertures at various vertical scales were determined based on which fracture porosity and groundwater velocity under ambient flow condition were also estimated the implications of our results at the well field are discussed at the watershed scale to infer the importance of bedrock groundwater in the mountain environment 2 study site most crystalline aquifers consist of three zones an upper weathered zone a middle fractured zone and a lower and often less fractured zone krásný and sharp 2003 the blair wallis fractured granite hydrology research well field lies within the crow creek watershed of the laramie range which lies within us forest service land about 21 km southeast of laramie wyoming fig 1 a and b local climate data from the crow creek snotel station of the last 10 years show that the blair wallis well field has a mean annual temperature of 5 4 c and receives 620 mm of annual precipitation of which 90 falls as snow national resources conservation service 2015 during the summer season june to september average temperature is around 15 c while in the winter months december to march average temperature is around 5 c the geology of the well field consists of fractured granite bedrock overlain by 10 18 m of weathered granite saprolite based on jointly interpretation of both borehole televiewer logs and flowmeter logs at the site bedrock flowing fracture intensity diminishes with depth based on water level monitoring data collected from the well field the fractured bedrock is saturated with groundwater while the saprolite is either unsaturated or partially saturated by examining groundwater level data against snow water equivalent data from a snotel station that lies northeast 6 km from the well field groundwater in the fractured bedrock aquifer is recharged primarily from snowmelt infiltration in the laramie range which occurs in late spring fig 1 c note that only water level data from bw 1 2 5 6 and 7 are shown which captures the range of water level variability in the well field at the blair wallis well field nine bedrock wells have been completed that are cased to the bottom of the saprolite but remain open boreholes in the fractured granite a well schematic is shown in fig 2 this research focuses hydraulic characterization of three of these bedrock wells i e bw5 bw6 and bw7 which lie within the so called a type sherman granite which are generated 1 43 ga ago consisting of microcline plagioclase quartz hornblende biotite and ilmenite frost et al 1999 the configuration of these three wells are summarized in table 1 based on the completion data of each well and the monitored water level responses these three wells lie in an unconfined aquifer furthermore from flute liner profiling of the three wells presented later borehole transmissivity becomes negligible below approximately 40 53 m bgs which corresponds to observed lower frequency of flowing fractures beneath this depth thus each borehole is considered fully penetrating in the slug test interpretation 3 methods 3 1 slug test a standard slug test involves a rapid submergence and subsequently removal of a solid slug from a well casing or a borehole the water level responses were recorded and modeled by fitting them to the solution of a radial groundwater flow equation to obtain a horizontal hydraulic conductivity estimate for confined and unconfined aquifers both steady state and transient slug test solutions exist for example besides kh storativity of the aquifer can be additionally determined using the transient solution besides water level responses however other factors can lead to inaccurate parameter estimates e g well skin and non darcian flow can lead to a significantly underestimated kh e g quinn et al 2013 for different aquifers and well completions butler et al 1996 reported a series of guidelines to improve the quality of parameter estimates obtained from slug tests these guidelines were followed in the slug tests we carried out at the blair wallis well field in order to obtain representative near wellbore kh estimates and ensure that non ideal behaviors can be identified and properly interpreted this article reports the results of slug tests at bw5 bw6 bw7 which were carried out in late may and early june of 2017 for a given slug test given the diameter of the open borehole two sizes of solid slugs were used to generate two different initial water level displacement h0 at each well for bw5 the larger slug is 162 6 cm long and 6 cm diameter and the small slug is 120 cm long and 5 cm diameter for bw6 and bw7 the same set of slugs were used with dimensions of 184 2 cm long and 9 4 cm diameter large and 162 6 cm long and 6 cm diameter small at bw5 and bw7 the sequence of slugs used was large small large to evaluate borehole effects such as dynamic skin butler 1998 1 the large slug was first used to perform a set of slug in falling head or fh and slug out rising head or rh tests the same set of slug in and slug out tests were repeated 2 the small slug was used to perform a new set of slug in and slug out tests which were also repeated 3 step 1 is repeated using the large slug at bw6 due to the extremely slow water level recovery rate step 3 was carried out using the large slug only once thus six rising head tests and six falling head tests were performed at bw5 and bw7 and five rising head tests and five falling head tests were performed at bw6 for each well two different h0 were generated with a maximum h0 around 0 6 m table 1 given the moderate level of h0 during both fh and rh tests for each well water level was always within the casing thus the borehole was not de saturated during the rh test the water level data from the slug tests were analyzed using the bouwer rice method for a fully penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer bouwer and rice 1976 1 k h r c 2 ln r e r w 2 l 1 t ln h 0 h t where kh is near wellbore average horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the open hole interval rc is casing radius l is the length of open hole re is an influence radius in the formation at which there is assumed to be no change in hydraulic head rw is the radius of the open hole t is elapsed time from start of a slug test h0 is initial displacement at t 0 and ht is the displacement at time t the transmissivity of each open hole can then be determined by t kh l moreover at the blair wallis well field the magnitude of hydraulic gradient of 0 04 was averaged from september 2015 september 2016 during the dry winter season september march the magnitude was between 0 03 and 0 04 during the snowmelt season in spring the magnitude was between 0 04 and 0 05 in may and june the magnitude sometimes reached 0 05 thus for year 2015 2016 the magnitude of the head gradient was quite stable ranging from 0 03 to 0 05 in this study an average horizontal hydraulic gradient of 0 04 will be used to calculate the groundwater velocity according to the long term water level data we can assume that the gradient direction is roughly from east to west and thus groundwater flow direction is roughly west to east if horizontal isotropy can be assumed moreover based on our analysis of water level trends over time direction of the overall head gradient vector does not change significantly over time classic slug test solutions developed for a confined aquifer i e cooper et al 1967 was also applied to interpreting the same slug tests done in this unconfined aquifer this solution is also a transient flow solution which can lead to the estimation of the specific storage coefficient ss which reflects the elastic storage of the aquifer during a slug test if the induced groundwater velocity is high non darcian flow can occur whereas head gradient is not linearly related to the flow rate into and out of the formation hydraulic head responses under non darcian flow when interpreted using the standard slug test solutions derived for laminar flow can lead to underestimated kh and consequently underestimated hydraulic aperture b e g quinn et al 2011a b to test for non darcian flow in granular deposits butler et al 1996 pointed out the need to carry out a series of slug tests with different h0 non darcian flow can be identified by fitting to the classic solutions such as hvorslev semi log plots and cooper curve fitting for both porous and fractured rocks a strong dependence of the estimated kh on h0 is considered evidence of non darcian flow butler et al 1996 quinn et al 2013 ji and koh 2015 such dependence is exhibited as an increasingly lower value of estimated kh with increasing slug size to determine if non darcian flow has occurred during slug tests in a formation with a single fracture a reynold number re can be defined ji et al 2008 ji and koh 2015 2 re ρ w vb μ ρ q w μ where ρw m l3 is density of groundwater v l t is flow velocity in the fracture b l is fracture aperture μ m lt is fluid viscosity q l3 t is flow rate in the fracture and w l is the fracture width perpendicular to flow laboratory experiments with single fracture models indicate that non darcian flow can be significant when re is greater than 1 10 e g zimmerman et al 2004 ranjith and darlington 2007 ji et al 2008 given that hydraulic conductivity of granite matrix is on the order of 10 13 m s e g mohnke and yaramanci 2008 we assume that during the slug tests groundwater flowed into out of the wellbore only through flowing fractures therefore a mean flow rate can be calculated as 3 q mean i 1 n q i n where qi l3 t is the flow rate at the i th fracture and n is the number of flowing fractures in the tested zone because during both rh and fh tests at bw 5 6 and 7 the water level in the borehole is always within the casing the total flow rate can be given as 4 i 1 n q i π r c 2 δ h δ t where rc l is radius of the casing and δh l is change of hydraulic head in the tested interval during time δt t in this study for each flowing fracture water level change in the borehole per second was used to calculate an average re note that the re computed using eqs 2 4 is a mean value over all the flowing fractures in a borehole and it is likely that re of individual fractures vary from the mean for a granitic aquifer with several fractures ji and koh 2015 found that non darcian flow can be generated when an average re reached 3 this suggests that for media with multiple fractures non darcian flow is possible when re is relatively small 3 2 flute liner profiling flute profiling is a high resolution hydraulic testing method for estimating t or kh along an open borehole see keller et al 2014 for details compared to the standard packers tests flute profiling can yield t estimates cost effectively and is considered suitable for delineating flow zones in strongly heterogeneous porous and fractured rocks a suite of flute blank liner and one time hydraulic head profiling were performed below the casings of bw5 bw6 and bw7 to identify permeable fractures along the open holes their transmissivity profiles as well as the formation head distribution at the time of the profiling at the beginning of the liner profiling method a flexible fabric cylinder open at the top and closed at the bottom was installed at the top of casing water was filled into the liner to create a hydraulic head differential between the inside and outside of the liner which pulls the liner downward while the liner travels down the borehole it pushes water beneath the liner from the open hole into the formation through transmissive fractures at each depth the descent rate of the liner is positively correlated with the transmissivity of the remaining length of the open hole beneath the liner as the liner goes down its descent rate decreases because the transmissive features of the open hole are gradually sealed off the liner velocity was measured using two encoders that are placed on a meter roller which recorded the position of the liner over every 0 5 s during profiling this technique also allows the measurement of a large velocity range or liner descent rate keller et al 2014 a volumetric flow rate can be determined from the descent rate while head gradients can be calculated from transducers placed above and beneath the liner a transmissivity can then be estimated using the thiem equation assuming steady state radial flow from borehole into the formation 5 t δ q 2 π δ h ln r e r w where δq l3t is the flow rate t l2 t is the transmissivity of a measured interval δh l is the applied head difference re l is an influence radius in the formation at which there is assumed to be no change in hydraulic head and rw l is the radius of the open hole however detection limit of flute liner profiling is a function of the descent velocity and small velocity changes can be difficult to detect if the descent velocity is high thus t estimates obtained from flute profiling may be less accurate and precise than the short interval straddle packer tests quinn et al 2015 however compared to packer tests flute profiling is less time consuming and can often circumvent the leakage issues due to the existence of preferential flow paths between packers keller et al 2014 such preferential flow paths often characterize strong heterogeneous media such as the fractured granite that we investigate in this work 3 3 borehole televiewer and flowmeter logging at each well ql40 abi 2g borehole televiewer i e optical and acoustic and ql40 sfm spinner flowmeter mt sopris instrument denver co logging were jointly interpreted to identify flowing fractures along the open hole borehole televiewer logs either optical and acoustic can be used to identify apparent fractures along the borehole wall but micro cracks cannot always be identified from borehole televiewer also the identified fractures from such logs are not always hydraulically active under ambient flow flowmeter logging can be used to detect variation of vertical flow rates along an open hole and significant flow rate differences between adjacent positions can indicate the approximate location of an flowing fracture or fractured zone additionally flowmeter logging can be used to detect flowing micro cracks which provide conduits for groundwater but cannot be identified by the borehole televiewer at bw5 6 and 7 impeller flowmeter logs were obtained which yield a flow rate profile that can be used to filter out flowing fractures from fractures identified from borehole televiewer logs also the equivalent flowing micro cracks which cannot be seen from borehole televiewer logs by a combined interpretation of borehole televiewer and flowmeter logging the number of equivalent flowing fractures can be obtained for a given borehole here we emphasize that cores were only used as reference for identifying flowing fractures this is because 1 at the blair wallis field site only five of nine bedrock wells were cored i e bw1 bw2 bw3 bw4 and bw5 and bw6 bw7 bw8 and bw9 were not cored 2 there are a number of drilling induced fractures in the cores which do not represent the actual borehole condition for bw5 where we have both core and logging data we can examine fractures jointly fig 3 some of the observed fractures in cores with weathered surfaces suggest that they are natural fractures these are also identified by examining the logging data at the same depth interval which suggests the reliability of the logging data there are also a few drilling induced fractures in cores these do not exist along the wellbore and can therefore not be identified from the borehole logging data for bw6 and bw7 we only have logging data with which flowing fractures were identified 3 4 hydraulic aperture determination by solving the one dimensional navier stokes equations for laminar flow in a single parallel smooth walled planar fracture romm 1966 obtains the cubic law 6 q x ρ w gb 3 w 12 μ h x where ρw is the water density m l3 g is gravity acceleration l t2 b is the hydraulic aperture of the fracture l w is the width of the fracture normal to flow l μ is the dynamic viscosity of water m lt and h x is the hydraulic gradient in the direction of flow for a set of parallel uniform fractures snow 1965 further derived an equation relating the equivalent transmissivity and an average hydraulic aperture 7 t ρ w gnb 3 12 μ where n is the number of hydraulically active fractures in the test interval however eq 7 assumes that all fractures are identical if it is applied to non uniformly distributed fractures with variable apertures the single estimated b thus reflects an average hydraulic aperture quinn et al 2011a b based on eq 1 substituting the calculated t values and the number of flowing fractures n into eq 7 an average hydraulic aperture can be written as 8 b 12 μ t ρ w gn 3 in this research different hydraulic tests can lead to an estimated kh or t for different support volumes thus the aperture calculated using eq 8 can yield b at various resolutions 4 results and discussion 4 1 slug test results and analysis 4 1 1 qualitative analysis of well skin effect theories have pointed out that when there is no well skin effect the duration of a slug test would be independent of the normalized head i e h t h0 e g butler et al 1996 this suggests that when the normalized head is plotted against time for a series of slug tests with different h0 the curves of the normalized head would coincide figs 4 6 plot the slug test results for bw5 bw6 and bw7 respectively under two different h0 as shown in fig 4 and fig 6 because all the curves almost completely coincide especially during the rising head tests skin effect for bw5 and bw7 is considered negligible in bw6 fig 5 however the normalized water level responses do not coincide exactly especially when the h0 is relatively large may suggest a skin effect both airlift and step tests carried out in bw6 in october 2016 have produced sediments consisting of clay and granite minerals the sediment production suggests that fractures near the borehole contain infills that can be mobilized during the slug test in comparison no or very limited sediments were produced during the same airlift tests of bw5 and bw7 for the three wells a set of horizontal hydraulic conductivity were estimated using both the cooper et al 1967 curve fitting solution and the bouwer rice model bouwer and rice 1976 results are summarized in table 2 which presents the set of kh estimated for each well under both fh and rh conditions and for the repeat tests as well based on these kh estimates a mean and a standard deviation were obtained for each well the standard deviations generally are on the order of 10 7 or smaller suggesting that the estimated kh are reliable with low uncertainty furthermore for each well the ratio between the highest estimated kh and the lowest estimated kh is less than 1 5 which suggests that any skin effect exhibited during the slug test i e bw6 is hydraulically insignificant and may not need to be accounted for in the slug test interpretation using the classic solutions for bw5 and bw7 kh estimates using the cooper et al 1967 solution are more than twice as large as those estimated using the bouwer rice model to explain this deviation butler et al 1996 pointed out that the cooper et al model can lead to a significantly overestimated kh of the formation when a dimensionless storage parameter α of the formation is moderate to low 9 α r s 2 s s l r c 2 where rs is the effective radius of the screen or open borehole l ss is specific storage 1 l l is the length of the open borehole l and rc is radius of casing l using the cooper et al 1967 model which yields ss α obtained for bw5 6 and 7 ranges from 10 7 to 10 10 which suggests that this deviation is expected and results obtained using cooper et al model are less reliable in the rest of this paper all kh were obtained using the bouwer rice model 4 1 2 non darcian flow for moderately permeable fractured dolostone and sandstone with kh ranging from 10 4 10 5 m s quinn et al 2013 conducted a series of slug tests as well as constant head step tests using straddle packers their results suggest that non darcian flow can be generated under small h0 0 2 m for a fractured granite with kh ranging from 10 7 10 8 m s however ji and koh 2015 found that nonlinear flow arose only when h0 was over 1 0 m a threshold h0 above which groundwater flow regime transforms to non darcian flow thus appears to depend on kh of the formation in the vicinity of the well at bw5 6 and 7 most kh range from 10 6 10 7 m s which lie in between those of the above reported sites thus non darcian flow is evaluated by examining the slug test results for bw 5 6 and 7 we examine whether the estimated kh depends on the initial slug size only bw6 showed that the mean of the estimated kh slightly decreased with increasing h0 fig 7 although the sample size is small and the lowest estimate 7 54 10 7 has strongly influenced this mean we conclude that non darcian flow may have occurred in bw6 while bw5 and bw7 are interpreted to have had only linear flow during slug tests to examine potential non darcian flow during the slug tests at bw6 a set of reynolds number re were calculated following ji and koh 2015 using the monitored hydraulic heads and the estimated number of flowing fractures total fracture densities were initially estimated at 0 25 m intervals from the optical obi and acoustic abi logs the subset of flowing fractures were then identified by a joint analysis of borehole televiewer and constant rate impeller flowmeter data the constant rate data were collected when the flowmeter was run both up and down the borehole at the slowest speed possible 1 5 m min in our case after correction for the speed and conversion to flow rate based on previous calibration of the tool in boreholes with known diameters the upgoing and downgoing flowmeter data were differenced this results in an impeller flowmeter curve that can be used to highlight zones of inflow and outflow for the depth interval of 41 55 m bgs in bw7 the obi and abi televiewer logs are shown along with the impeller flowmeter log fig 8 the black and red zones displayed in the filtered flowmeter log represent inflow and outflow respectively for this fracture zone only the depth intervals that correspond to inflow black and outflow red zones are then considered as flowing fracture zones for all three wells the number of fractures identified from borehole televiewer logs is plotted along with the number of flowing fractures as additionally filtered by borehole flowmeter fig 9 the total number of flowing fractures determined at bw5 bw6 and bw7 at 1 0 m intervals are 143 113 and 174 respectively for bw6 fig 10 shows the calculated re for every second of a slug test this re was also compared among the slug tests with different h0 at this well the maximum re calculated from a set of tests i e five fh tests and five rh tests are always under 8 and most of the re are under 3 re computed for the two different h0 also do not differ significantly in addition there are no trends indicating that the larger h0 results in a larger early time re nor that a larger early time re corresponds to smaller estimated kh fig 11 in summary for all three wells groundwater flow during the slug tests using the small h0 i e 0 23 m are always in linear flow regime for the slug tests carried out using the larger h0 non darcian flow is nonexistent or negligible 4 2 flute profiling results and analysis for the three wells borehole kh determined using flute blank profiling is shown in fig 12 for all wells the kh profiles i e a discrete kh value determined over 30 cm borehole interval exhibit a decreasing trend with depth which corresponds to the observed decrease in the frequency of flowing fractures with depth as obtained from flowmeter logging see fig 9 at each well the kh profile exhibits variation over 4 orders of magnitude with maximum kh reaching up to 10 5 m s despite the variability kh values are consistently higher near the top of the open borehole clearly significant vertical heterogeneity exists in this aquifer whereas kh is the highest at the top of the bedrock this region lies beneath the saprolite zone which receives snow water infiltration from the land surface the top of the fractured bedrock thus lies at the so called weathering front flinchum 2017 however the formulation used to determine the flute kh profile is deterministic in the field transducer measurement errors were considered relatively insignificant further analysis may be required to determine the uncertainty in the estimation although for all wells the flute determined kh profiles yield an equivalent open hole transmissivity that is similar in magnitude and often much better within a factor of 2 with those determined by the slug tests table 3 it is noteworthy that the flute values for bw5 and 6 are just above the upper end of the slug test ranges but that for bw7 is below the slug test range kh estimated at the upper portion of the borehole can be less reliable because the transmissivity over the remaining borehole interval is relatively high which gives rise to a faster liner descent velocity quinn et al 2015 since the detection limit of flute liner profiling is a function of the descent velocity and small velocity changes can be difficult to detect if the descent velocity is high the flute method may underestimate the high kh intervals during the early profiling period i e two notable peak values in the bw7 flute interval moreover flute profiling was done months before the slug tests and near bore fractures may have changed over this time due to fines migration and settling all these factors can influence the estimated kh between slug tests and flute profiling without further testing it is difficult to determine why the flute values for bw5 and 6 are just above the upper end of the slug test ranges but that for bw7 is below the slug test range overall flute determined kh profiles yield an equivalent open hole transmissivity similar to those determined by the slug tests 4 3 determination of hydraulic aperture and groundwater velocity using the number of flowing fractures as determined from borehole televiewer and flowmeter logs and the transmissivity values obtained from slug tests and flute an average hydraulic aperture for a given tested interval i e vertical resolution in flute profiles or the entire open borehole tested by a slug test can be obtained using eq 8 for all three wells the distribution of b based on flute profiling is shown along with its univariate statistics fig 13 in the same figure b determined based on the mean kh value obtained from the slug tests is also shown because the slug test derived kh varies over a narrow range the standard deviation is generally less than 10 7 m s with fewer measurements a distribution of slug test derived b is not presented results suggest that for all three wells 1 the flute derived b varies greatly at each well indicating substantial vertical variability in the distribution of fracture aperture 2 there is lateral variability in the mean hydraulic aperture obtained from both the flute and slug tests b for bw5 bw6 and bw7 is 90 92 μm 88 86 μm and 103 105 μm respectively table 4 and fig 13 3 a high degree of correspondence exists between the average b derived from flute profiling and the b value determined from slug tests which confirms a similar scaling relation observed between slug tests derived transmissivity and those of multilevel injection tests for a fractured granite aquifer in mirror lake new hampshire shapiro and hsieh 1998 therefore at this site slug test can be used to estimate an accurate average hydraulic aperture over the open hole if the distribution of hydraulic aperture is required high resolution t data along the open hole is needed there are two conceptual approaches for determining groundwater velocity one is the equivalent porous media epm model freeze and cherry 1979 and the other is the discrete fracture parallel plate model novakowski 2000 both models emphasize laminar flow upon which the darcy law is established in the epm model the formation is analyzed by treating it as an equivalent homogeneous porous medium in the discrete fracture model all flow is assumed to occur in the interconnected fractures and rock matrix is considered impermeable under the assumption that all the flowing fractures are identical with the same local t values both methods will result in the same computed average linear groundwater velocity v below we assume that for each interval analyzed by the slug test or flute profiling it contains an identical set of horizontal flowing fractures thus assuming an epm v is computed using a field scale darcy flux l t and an effective fracture porosity ϕf 10 v q h ϕ f q h k h dh dx where ϕf is determined using the estimated hydraulic aperture s for the fracture s divided by the length of open hole and dh dx is the lateral hydraulic gradient along the direction of the flow which was computed based on long term water level observations an average hydraulic gradient of 0 04 was used to calculate darcy flux for both slug tests and flute liner profile based on data collected at all three wells an estimated effective or bulk ϕf is on the order of 10 4 which is within the range for fractured rock 10 2 10 5 as reported by freeze and cherry 1979 with a standard deviation on the order of 10 6 table 5 a set of computed groundwater velocities obtained based on slug test results are also listed the average groundwater velocity calculated based on slug tests is 17 0 m day bw5 15 1 m day bw6 and 22 2 m day bw7 respectively in addition for the same wells an average v for each interval of the flute profile can be obtained using eq 10 assuming a homogeneous equivalent porous medium fig 14 similar to the estimated hydraulic aperture along the open hole groundwater velocity exhibits 2 orders of magnitude variation at each well with a minimum of 0 4 m day and a maximum value of 81 0 m day this corresponds to the heterogeneity of the flute derived kh the calculated groundwater velocity is similar to the results reported by quinn et al 2011a b for a fractured dolostone aquifer it should also be pointed out that from eqs 8 and 10 one can deduce that for each flute test interval 11 v t bn dh dx this indicates that groundwater velocity distribution is related to three distributions b n and t thus the v histogram does not have a linear correlation with the b histogram 4 4 geological model of blair wallis based on all available site data including cores borehole logs lidar topography and a seismic p wave velocity model three zones can be identified at the well field upper saprolite middle fractured bedrock and underlying protolith less fractured bedrock the saprolite and fractured bedrock boundary was first determined at the borehole location at approximately the bottom of the surface casing flinchum 2017 identified a 1 2 km s seismic p wave velocity associated with that depth and created this boundary by extracting the 1 2 km s velocity contour map from a three dimensional 3d volume of the inverted p wave velocities according to flinchum 2017 the boundary between fractured granite and protolith is estimated by extracting the 4 0 km s velocity contour map from the same 3d volume because this velocity was estimated by conducting a survey over an intact granite outcrop near the well field for the upper two zones a 3d geological model of the field site was built fig 15 where the fractured bedrock is observed to be 4 the thickness of the saprolite along an east west cross section of the model fig 15 f which parallels the average hydraulic head gradient long term average water levels from four wells are projected despite the limited data water levels appear to be following the boundary between the saprolite and fractured bedrock the water levels were thus interpolated between the wells following the same boundary despite local variations water table dips to the east and suggests topographically driven flow 5 conclusions in this study hydraulic parameters of an unconfined fractured granite aquifer were characterized using borehole data from three wells in the blair wallis fractured rock hydrology research well field in laramie range wyoming the borehole data include those from hydraulic tests i e slug tests and flute profiling and borehole logging i e flowmeter under ambient flow condition optical and acoustic televiewer by analyzing a set of repeat slug tests with different initial displacements and calculating an average re for either individual or equivalent fracture we concluded that both skin effect and non darcian flow which may lead to an underestimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh are negligible during the slug tests flute profiling a high resolution kh profiling method at the research site it has 0 3 m vertical resolution was used as an alternative way of estimating discrete kh by jointly interpreting borehole televiewer logs with flowmeter logs the number of flowing fractures along the open borehole can be determined for each well based on kh estimates from slug tests and flute an average hydraulic aperture is estimated for the entire open hole and for the discrete flute test intervals given the aperture data and the site scale horizontal hydraulic gradient an effective fracture porosity and groundwater velocity were estimated finally based on all available data including cores borehole logs lidar topography and a seismic p wave velocity model a three dimensional geological model of the site was built results of this characterization study are summarized as 1 a hydraulically significant zone at the well field extends to 40 53 m depth based on flute profiling kh of the three wells varies over 4 orders of magnitude 10 8 10 5 m s with a maximum value reaching 10 5 m s despite this variability kh is found to be consistently higher near the top of the open holes compared to kh of the deeper intervals this high k zone corresponds to observed high fracture density in the bedrock which is interrelated by us to be the weathering front 2 the flute estimated hydraulic apertures for all wells vary over one order of magnitude 14 μm 200 μm indicating vertical heterogeneity in fractures based on slug test derived kh average hydraulic apertures calculated are 92 μm bw5 86 μm bw6 and 105 μm bw7 moreover at each well an average aperture obtained from its flute profile is very close to that obtained from slug test suggesting that slug test can be used to provide a reliable average aperture estimate 3 based on the estimated hydraulic apertures an effective fracture porosity is estimated to be 4 0 10 4 with a standard deviation of 8 4 10 6 thus fractured crystalline rock in this headwater watershed can host significant quantity of groundwater 4 given water level monitoring data which suggest an average hydraulic gradient of 0 04 under ambient flow condition groundwater velocity is estimated to range from 0 4 to 81 0 m day implying rapid pathways for groundwater flow however these values are considered a rough approximation because only a single gradient value in space time is used under other flow conditions especially following spring snowmelt which occurred before the well test season groundwater velocity is likely different with more significant flow 5 the average ambient water table position follows the interface between saprolite and fractured bedrock and dips to the east the groundwater system at the site appears to be topography driven because groundwater flow in crystalline rocks not only depends on fracture aperture and porosity but also depends on the connectivity of the fractures future work will aim to characterize the orientation extent and connectivity of the fracture network at the well field by employing cross hole hydraulic tests in combination with surface and borehole geophysical measurements depending on the specific geophysical and hydraulic testing methods however increased volumes of the fractured aquifer will likely be interrogated e g laterally such volume can range from the near wellbore scale to inter well or larger scales and vertically parameters can be obtained at either logging resolution or for an entire borehole interval in fractured rocks scale effects is a well known phenomenon e g hsieh 1998

7311,climate change will affect precipitation and flood regimes it is anticipated that the probable maximum precipitation pmp and probable maximum flood pmf will be modified in a changing climate this paper aims to quantify and analyze climate change influences on pmp and pmf in three watersheds with different climatic conditions across the province of québec canada output data from the canadian regional climate model crcm was used to estimate pmp and probable maximum snow accumulation pmsa in future climate projections which was then used to force the swat hydrological model to estimate pmf pmp and pmf values were estimated for two time horizons each spanning 30 years 1961 1990 recent past and 2041 2070 future pmp and pmf were separately analyzed for two seasons summer fall and spring results show that pmf in the watershed located in southern québec would remain unchanged in the future horizon but the trend for the watersheds located in the northeastern and northern areas of the province is an increase of up to 11 keywords probable maximum flood climate change canadian regional climate model uncertainty analysis 1 introduction there is agreement among scientists that the global temperature in the future will increase as a result of anthropogenic activities dewalle and rango 2008 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc atmospheric temperature has already increased over the last decades in many parts of the world bates et al 2008 bernstein et al 2007 as atmospheric temperature rises the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water vapor increases according to the clausius clapeyron equation jakob et al 2008 under such circumstances it is likely that precipitation regimes will change river runoff regimes are expected to change as well bates et al 2008 although the direction of the change is difficult to predict as additional factors other than precipitation changes such as the evaporation rate and soil moisture can also influence flood magnitude for instance increasing precipitation and runoff have been predicted for future climate conditions in northern and central england arnell 1998 by contrast runoff in the maude watershed in western europe is expected to decrease in future decades as a result of climate change menzel and bürger 2002 in the province of québec canada a study suggested that mean annual runoff is expected to increase by 9 15 at the 2050 horizon in the northern part of the province while modest increases ranging from 1 to 5 are expected in the southern region desrochers et al 2008 this is in accordance with recent results of the hydroclimatic atlas of québec where future spring floods in higher latitudes of québec are likely to increase while in the south the trend would be reversed cehq 2015 in terms of mean annual temperature it was found that the increasing trend in southern québec is more significant than in central eastern and western regions yagouti et al 2008 this site dependency of climate change was found for the annual maximum precipitation as well for instance daily annual maximum precipitation with a 20 year return period showed large increases in future climate conditions in southern québec but modest increases would occur in atlantic canada mailhot et al 2012 therefore the evolution of hydrological regimes under climate change conditions should be studied at the regional scale changes in river floods and design floods due to climate change have been investigated in numerous studies beauchamp et al 2013 milly et al 2002 stewart et al 2005 tofiq and güven 2015 in northern countries where snow plays a dominant role in the hydrologic regimes of watersheds the direction of changes in flooding regimes is less clearly defined as increased temperatures will trigger midwinter thaws and affect the maximum snow water equivalent swe depending on the magnitude of the projected changes in precipitation this could result in either increased or decreased risks of spring floods for example in a recent study in southern québec cehq 2015 the daily spring peak flood with a 20 year period is expected to decrease in the southernmost part of the region 45 latitude at the 2050 horizon while an increase is projected in its northern part 50 latitude this paper focuses on estimating extreme flooding events under future climate conditions and more specifically the probable maximum flood pmf this is a pressing issue as many hydraulic structures such as dams dikes and spillways have been designed and are operated under the assumption of stationary hydrological conditions which depend upon a stationary climate such conditions will no longer be valid ipcc 2012 as there is much evidence that in many parts of the world climatic and hydrological regimes are changing aghakouchak et al 2012 and extreme hydrological events are occurring more frequently for example in the usa the 1st percentile daily rainfall rate increased in the 1958 2011 time horizon groisman et al 2013 in canada over the last 50 years annual temperatures in québec have increased by 1 2 c vescovi et al 2009 this province has also witnessed major floods over the last few decades such as the southern quebec and richelieu river spring floods and the saguenay summer flood which occurred respectively in 2017 2011 and in 1996 the southern quebec flood affected 261 municipalities forced the evacuation of 4000 people flooded 5000 homes and damaged 400 roads the richelieu flood was a historical maximum international joint commission 2015 and it forced some 2000 people to leave their residences environment and climate change canada 2013 the saguenay summer flood killed 10 people forced 12 000 people to flee their homes and caused damage exceeding 800 million canadian dollars this flood was estimated as 8 times larger than a 100 year return period flood lapointe et al 1998 milbrandt and yau 2001 it was after this major flood that the government of québec produced the dam safety act and its attendant regulation which came into effect in 2002 according to this act every large capacity dam must be able to withstand the pmf if the consequences of dam failure in flood conditions are classified as severe i e when the affected area is occupied permanently by a population of 10 000 inhabitants or more gouvernement du québec 2015b with the potential risk of pmf estimates changing under climate change conditions it is necessary for dam owners to ensure that structures are safe for future climate conditions therefore investigating the effects of climate change on pmf is critical in countries where laws are enforced based on this criterion for properly managing their hydraulic structures this paper is organized as follows first literature on pmf and climate change is presented and discussed this is followed by a description of the methodology used to estimate the pmf for three watersheds in québec characterized by different climatic regimes and affected differently by climate change the methodology is based on computing the probable maximum precipitation pmp traditionally pmf is estimated by inserting pmp after a large storm when soil is nearly saturated cehq and snc lavalin 2003 prasad et al 2011 schreiner and riedel 1978 or by several random insertion of pmp in different days to take into account different soil moisture conditions beauchamp et al 2013 in this study pmp is estimated according to a novel approach by rouhani and leconte 2016 this approach is amenable to climate change impact studies pmp is then used for summer fall pmf estimation with taking into account different soil moisture conditions and spring pmf estimation with taking into account different snow and temperature conditions results and a discussion are then presented followed by the conclusion 2 pmf and climate change pmf is the largest flood that can reasonably occur ely and peters 1984 this extreme flood is a result of critical meteorological conditions occurring simultaneously with favorable hydrological conditions beauchamp et al 2013 critical meteorological conditions are those that result in extreme precipitation favorable hydrological conditions are those that make the soil saturated in regions with significant annual snowfall such as the province of québec there is also a risk of a severe flood when a significant amount of snow melts therefore two types of flood scenarios can be defined in these regions 1 summer fall floods are the result of extreme rainfall on saturated soil and 2 spring floods are the result of extreme rainfall on a very large amount of snow on the ground during an unusually warm period that produces the snowmelt the extreme precipitation event that is usually used to estimate pmf is called the probable maximum precipitation pmp which is defined as the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration meteorologically possible for a design watershed or a given storm area at a particular location at a particular time of year with no allowance made for long term climatic trends wmo 2009 to study the impact of climate change on pmf scenarios covering the summer fall and spring seasons should be analyzed in recent years an increasing number of researchers have investigated the influence of climate change conditions on extreme rainfall and floods condon et al 2015 groisman et al 2005 qian et al 2010 yagouti et al 2008 one of the pioneering researchers was robert a clark who studied key variables for pmp estimates namely maximum moisture maximum inflow winds and precipitation efficiency clark 1987 clark also reported that the maximum moisture would increase as atmospheric temperature increases and would thus result in an increase in pmp values by at least 10 due to climate change clark 1987 it was also predicted that extreme rainfall events over europe would be more frequent under climate change conditions frei et al 1998 another study using data from the canadian regional climate model crcm caya and laprise 1999 established that extreme short duration rainfall events would be more intense in southern québec mailhot et al 2007 on the other hand it was reported that short duration extreme rainfall events would be less intense in alabama usa mirhosseini et al 2013 potentially significant changes in runoff volumes and peak flows were also reported under future climate scenarios in southern québec roy et al 2001 and elsewhere arnell 1998 lagos zúñiga and vargas m 2014 since the study by clark few studies have been devoted to the impacts of climate change on pmp and pmf a report by the world meteorological organization wmo briefly discusses potential changes in pmp under climate change conditions emphasizing that atmospheric moisture availability storm efficiency depth area curves and storm types should be analyzed in such investigations wmo 2009 it was reported that pmp is likely to increase under climate change conditions almost everywhere in the world kunkel et al 2013 this study examined the effect of climate change on extreme rainfall events maximum water vapor horizontal wind and vertical air motion using projections of general circulation models gcms towards 2071 2100 the researchers concluded that the probable causes of projected increases of pmp are changes in water vapor availability and the increase in extreme rainfall events due to the increasing trend of maximum precipitable water these results were also asserted in an additional study lagos zúñiga and vargas m 2014 using gcms which reported that pmp is likely to increase in the andean basins of chile leading to an increase in pmf of up to 175 by the years 2045 2065 an investigation on pmp values in southern québec using regional climate models rcms confirmed that summer fall pmp is likely to increase under climate change conditions in the 2041 2080 time horizon rousseau et al 2014 similar results for the 2071 2100 time horizon were obtained for a watershed located in central québec although no clear trend for future pmf was found beauchamp et al 2013 similarly in the 2071 2100 time horizon summer pmf values were reported not to show any clear trend for a watershed in norway however fall pmf exhibited an increasing trend up to 15 chernet et al 2013 also numerical weather models were used to investigate changes in pmp due to local to regional climate change caused by land use land cover change for example the influence of reservoir size and irrigation on pmp of two watersheds in western usa was analyzed stratz and hossain 2014 in that study the influence of water cycle changes on regional climate through simulation of the dew point temperature using regional atmospheric modeling rams was studied the dew point temperature was later used to estimate pmp results indicated that irrigation and reservoir size can notably affect pmp in another recent study numerical weather models were used to analyze climate change impacts on pmp using background temperature increases and also parameterizations such as cloud microphysics rastogi et al 2017 a 20 increase of pmp estimate was found for southwestern usa given the rather small number of studies dealing specifically with the effects of climate change on pmf it is difficult to draw firm conclusions as to the direction of the projected changes this is due to compounding factors such as soil moisture and the maximum swe which are also affected by climate change and are decisive factors in establishing pmf values the present paper proposes a methodology to estimate pmf under climate change conditions based on estimating pmp according to an approach specifically adapted to climate change impact studies and taking into consideration seasonal factors i e soil moisture and snowpack conditions the methodology is applied to three watersheds in québec that are characterized by different physiographic and climatic features which demonstrates its applicability to a variety of watersheds with snow dominated hydrologic regimes 3 methodology the basic approach to estimate the pmf under current and future climate conditions is to force a hydrological model with precipitation and air temperature projections derived from a regional climate model the next sections detail the approach beginning with a short description of the watersheds under study the datasets and hydrological model used and the methods to calculate pmp and pmf 3 1 watersheds three watersheds were analyzed to investigate the influence of different climate conditions on pmp and pmf as depicted in fig 1 the watersheds are in the province of québec canada although these three watersheds undergo long freezing seasons and mainly receive solid precipitation during winter they have been selected to represent different climatic conditions in terms of precipitation and atmospheric temperature regimes as shown in table 1 overall temperature and total precipitation decrease with increasing latitude all three watersheds have hydrologic regimes dominated by snowmelt runoff although summer storms can sometimes produce floods of a magnitude comparable to spring peak flows the physiographic characteristics of the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds are presented in table 1 the chaudière watershed is located in southern québec and has 180 000 inhabitants comité de bassin de la rivière chaudiére 2015 approximately 60 of the watershed is covered by forest 30 is covered by agricultural land and the remaining area is devoted to industrial and residential activities the chaudière river which flows north and into the st lawrence river experiences the largest discharges in april and sometimes comparable discharges occur in september the mean annual flow in the outlet of the chaudière watershed is 114 m3 s the moisie watershed is located in the center of québec its main watercourse is the moisie river which flows south and discharges into the gulf of st lawrence around 4000 people live in this watershed gouvernement du québec 2015a the area has very limited industrial agricultural development and is mainly covered by forest the moisie river usually experiences the largest discharges in may the mean annual flow in the outlet of the moisie watershed is 410 m3 s the great whale watershed is located in northern québec its main watercourse is the great whale river the great whale watershed is mainly covered by forest the great whale river which flows westward and empties into hudson bay usually experiences the largest discharges in june and sometimes another comparable peak occurs in the fall the mean annual flow in the outlet of the great whale watershed is 514 m3 s fig 2 shows the average daily runoff hydrographs for the 1960 2005 period for these watersheds the watersheds exhibit different hydrological regimes as a result of different physiographic and climatic characteristics the chaudière watershed has the smallest peak value and is also the smallest of the three watersheds the peak flow in the chaudière watershed usually occurs in april while the peak flow usually occurs in may and june for the moisie and great whale watersheds respectively the moisie watershed has the largest peak value among the three watersheds although its surface area is half that of the great whale this is because of the annual snow received by the moisie which exceeds that of the great whale with respective values of 400 mm and 240 mm also the average temperature in the moisie watershed during the melting season is 6 5 c which exceeds the value of 3 5 c in the great whale watershed the spring melt is therefore more intense on average over the moisie watershed as compared to the great whale 3 2 data observed flow and meteorological data required for calibrating the hydrological model described below come from the centre d expertise hydrique du québec cehq now direction de l expertise hydrique and from the national land and water information service nlwis database respectively the nlwis database provides grids of daily precipitation and the maximum and minimum surface temperature of canada south of 60 latitude with a resolution of 10 km covering the years 1961 2003 these grids were interpolated daily from environment canada station observations using a thin plate smoothing spline surface fitting method hutchinson et al 2009 using interpolated values was necessary as very few weather stations with long and continuous precipitation and temperature data are currently available for the moisie and great whale watersheds although there are several meteorological stations in the chaudière watershed and its vicinity nlwis interpolated data were also used to maintain coherency a daily precipitation comparison between nlwis and a ground station st prosper in chaudière watershed between 1970 and 2000 indicated mean values are only 2 different physiographic data sets topography soil type vegetation cover etc required by the model were obtained from two datasets namely geogratis natural resources canada 2015 and webarchive international institue for applied systems analysis 2015 geogratis was used for land use data residential industrial forest agriculture etc and webarchive was used for different soil types i e different soil characteristics in the watersheds of interest this study aims to estimate pmp and pmf under current and future climate conditions as such climate projections are required to that end climate models can simulate an array of equivalent meteorological stations along with vertical profiles of atmospheric variables and can generate long historical and future data series in addition output climate variables from these models are internally coherent since they are generated in the same system of solving mass and energy equations it follows that the current and future climate projections are also coherent enabling a study of the evolution of pmp and pmf as climate conditions shift by directly comparing simulated current and future values although global climate models gcms can simulate large rainfall events durman et al 2001 regional climate models rcms are better suited to simulate such events at the watershed scale and therefore are preferred for hydrological studies for example general consistency between observations and the canadian regional climate model crcm paquin 2010 confirmed the ability of the crcm to generate extreme storm events crcm output has been compared with observational data in a number of studies for instance intensity duration frequency idf curves in southern québec were retrieved from crcm output and compared favorably with idf curves derived from observations mailhot et al 2007 its capacity to reproduce extreme observed events outside of canada was also positively tested goyette et al 2001 moreover it was reported that crcm simulations of precipitable water are promising in terms of similarity with observations although some underestimates were noticed in warmer seasons rousseau et al 2014 it was therefore decided to use crcm outputs as the prime data set to carry out this work due to the richness and completeness of such a database since the capacity of reproducing rainfall events is model dependent langousis et al 2016 it was decided to include several climate simulations thus allowing uncertainty analyses mailhot et al 2012 to this end data used in this study were retrieved from crcm version 4 2 3 paquin 2010 driven by the following gcms i cgcm 3 1v2 4th member de elía and côté 2010 music and caya 2007 ii cnrm cm3 salas mélia et al 2005 and iii echam 5 roeckner et al 2003 the greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios used to run gcms are either sres a2 or a1b nakicenovic et al 2000 details of these different climate simulations can be found in table 2 a total of seven climate simulations were used in this study this selection of climate models enables investigating the influence of gcm structure three models and climate variability five different initial conditions of a gcm here the cgcm3 the effect of different ghg emission scenarios can also be studied as there are two emission scenarios specific humidity in different atmospheric pressure levels either 18 or 23 depending on the model surface atmospheric temperature convective available potential energy cape swe daily maximum and minimum temperature and total precipitation in daily time steps were obtained at a spatial resolution of 45 km by 45 km for two 30 year long time horizons 1961 1990 recent past or reference and 2041 2070 future climate models are known to be biased i e the models systematically underestimate or overestimate some climatic variables hempel et al 2013 schmidli et al 2006 therefore bias removing is a common practice in studies involving climate models bias removal techniques try to lessen the difference between statistical moments such as the monthly average of observational data and climate model outputs and are supposed to preserve climatic trends in this study no bias removal modification was applied as it was deemed to damage the internal coherency of outputs this is because bias removing requires observational data which is scarce for variables such as swe precipitable water and cape therefore applying bias removal techniques to some selected variables such as precipitation and temperature and using the others as is such as precipitable water and cape harms the credibility of crcm as an ensemble of climate data one may argue that correcting biases for temperature and precipitation would result in a better timing and magnitude of the simulated flood this is not an issue here as the concern is more on simulating changes in pmf magnitude consecutive to climate change rather than providing absolute magnitude and timing this is later discussed in the paper on the other hand crcm outputs of precipitable water were confirmed by a comparison against observational data that were available for the moisie watershed to lend reliability for using crcm output in this study details of this comparison can be found in rouhani and leconte 2016 3 3 hydrological modeling the swat hydrological model neitsch et al 2002 was used to compute pmf swat is a semi distributed hydrological model processes simulated by swat include infiltration evapotranspiration runoff groundwater and snow accumulation and melt haguma 2013 sub watersheds and the hydrographic network are automatically delineated by using a digital elevation model dem swat further sub divides the watershed into hydrological response units hru hrus are land portions with unique topographic land use and cover and soil characteristics arnold et al 2012 hydrological processes are calculated at the hru level followed by an aggregation at the sub watershed level the resulting runoff is routed through the computed hydrographic network until reaching the main watershed outlet inputs to swat also include pesticide nutrient fertilizer database and septic system data these analyses were not done in the present study the calculations are carried out at a daily time step interval crcm tiles were assumed as virtual meteorological stations for modeling current and future pmf a calibration on daily time step based on observational data of precipitation and runoff in a period of 11 years was used for the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds the corresponding validation period was 4 10 and 10 years the nash sutcliffe ns criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 applied to daily runoff values was used as the objective function to calibrate swat with the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1992 calibration and validation results are presented in table 3 another calibration scheme was also tried in this study by comparing observed versus simulated runoff from swat when directly forced by crcm precipitation and temperature this scenario did not produce promising results as dynamics of crcm data are different than those of observational data and crcm runoff still suffers from inconsistencies overall swat was able to adequately simulate the hydrological regime of the three watersheds the calibrated model was driven with current and future climate projections generated by the crcm model and pmp calculated from crcm data to generate corresponding pmf values 3 4 pmp in this study a deterministic approach to calculate 24 h pmp was applied based on simulated climate data from the crcm the method is based on the moisture maximization approach recommended by the wmo wmo 1973 wmo 1986 wmo 2009 1 pmp p obs w max w storm p obs r in eq 1 r is the maximization ratio pobs is the maximum observed precipitation depth wmax is the maximum precipitable water at the same time of year and same location as pobs and wstorm is the actual precipitable water of the observed storm pobs wmo 1973 wmo 1986 wmo 2009 to obtain precipitable water the most accurate approach is to take humidity measurements at different atmospheric levels and sum them up for example by using data collected by radiosondes schreiner and riedel 1978 in this study precipitable water was instead calculated using simulated specific humidity from the crcm database 2 w 1 g p 1 p 2 q p dp where w is the atmospheric moisture precipitable water g is the gravitational acceleration q is specific humidity and p represents pressure wstorm was calculated as the maximum precipitable water that occurred in a two day period prior to and during the storm beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 wmax can be estimated by different methods if the observation record is long enough at least 50 years the maximum in the record can be used as wmax however this is rarely the case in this study w100 the 100 year return period precipitable water was taken as a representative value for wmax according to beauchamp et al 2013 and rousseau et al 2014 the statistical distribution used to calculate w100 is the general extreme value gev distribution this distribution has been recommended for annual maximum rainfall koutsoyiannis 1999 and precipitable water distributions chow and jones 1994a thus the maximization ratio corresponds to 3 r w 100 w storm to estimate w100 a time series of the annual maximum of precipitable water values was established in the traditional method each element of this time series is the maximum recorded precipitable water at the same location as pobs for the same period of each year wmo 2009 it is suggested to limit the maximization ratio by an upper bound to avoid overestimation different values for the upper limit have been suggested but there is a lack of a sound physical basis therefore the validity of these values under climate change conditions can be questioned instead of imposing an upper limit on the maximization ratio a different approach was adopted to build the time series of maximum precipitable water from which w100 is retrieved briefly each element of this time series is the maximum among precipitable water values in each year for which selected climate variables resemble those of pobs climate variables of pobs are estimated based on the data before and during the storm climate variables used in this study include atmospheric temperature at the surface and cape which are considered indicative of conditions leading to significant storm events details of the approach can be found in rouhani and leconte 2016 as this approach is not constrained by setting an upper limit on the maximization ratio and because it attempts to preserve the original storm dynamics in calculating w100 we postulate that it is better suited to calculate pmp under climate change conditions as opposed to the traditional method rouhani 2016 the pmp approach was applied to estimate the summer fall and spring pmp for current and future climates at each crcm tile of the region encompassing each of the three watersheds under study the area covering each watershed was established in a manner to maximize the number of crcm virtual meteorological stations that are subject to a direct pmp transfer to the watershed under study the largest value for the pmp obtained in each watershed and surrounding area in case of transferability was considered as the representative pmp value for the corresponding watershed the seasons initial and final dates were established based on the geographical location of watersheds see table 1 that also indicates different precipitation patterns where summer fall extreme rainfalls are typically larger than spring events cehq and snc lavalin 2003 the summer fall season starts on may 16th in the chaudière and june 16th in the moisie and great whale watersheds and ends on november 30th it is also possible to define seasons based upon snow on the ground foulon et al 2017 klein et al 2016 rousseau et al 2014 however in this study calendar dates were used to enable comparison between two same length seasons 3 5 pmf pmf is obtained by combining critical meteorological and hydrological conditions one approach for estimating summer fall pmf is to force a hydrological model with a large precipitation event to produce saturated soil conditions followed by a pmp cehq and snc lavalin 2004 rousseau et al 2012 recently statistical approaches have been developed to better reflect the influence of different soil moisture levels on pmf beauchamp et al 2013 paquet et al 2013 in such methods a distribution of pmf values is obtained as opposed to a unique value these methods do not require establishing initial conditions prior to the pmp in this study a method inspired by beauchamp et al 2013 was used to calculate a distribution of summer fall pmf for the current and future climates basically the pmp computed for each watershed was inserted in each day of a precipitation temperature time series and the resulting runoff was simulated and counted as a potential watershed pmf the precipitation and temperature time series were obtained from the crcm simulations under current and future climate conditions although quantification of soil moisture was not possible in this study this approach allowed covering the entire range of possible soil moisture conditions that actually happened in the watersheds during the time horizons under study the resulting pmf values were ranked and a representative value in this case the 90th percentile value was selected as the watershed pmf there are different thresholds for identifying extreme values such as the 99th percentile for temperature e g mishra et al 2015 in this study the 90th percentile was inspired by a definition of extreme climate conditions an event which is higher lower than the tenth percentile karl et al 1996 however using other values based on pmf percentiles is possible according to the judgment of engineers managers or decision makers the temporal evolution of pmf distributions according to future climate scenarios will indicate how climate change influences pmf values for spring pmf an alternative methodology was used spring pmf results from the melting of a deep snowpack during an unusually warm period along with extreme rainfall therefore three hydrometeorological variables events come into play for establishing the pmf here a single critical combination of the three factors has been adopted leading to the production of a single pmf value rather than a distribution the occurrence of three maximized events snowpack temperature and rainfall simultaneously is unrealistic and may cause overestimates debs et al 1999 hydro québec and snc shawinigan 1992 instead two possible scenarios were defined i a pmp was estimated and was combined with a 100 year swe s100 and ii 100 year rainfall p100 was combined with the probable maximum snowpack accumulation pmsa it is worth mentioning that non stationarity of time series can be explicitly taken into account for estimating 100 year return period events e g rousseau et al 2014 and klein et al 2016 for more details in the current study in 30 year time horizons were assumed to be stationary however the probability density functions obtained for the different time horizons selected in our study did not have the same parameter values hence reflecting non stationarity between the horizons using crcm pmsa has recently been shown to be subject to variations as climate changes klein et al 2016 this justifies the application of a second scenario in this study for the first scenario annual maximum swe values were retrieved from crcm output from which s100 was estimated the air temperature time series should be established in a way that reflects an extreme yet realistic warm period the method selected followed that of debs et al 1999 it typically begins with a warm temperature period which ripens the snowpack followed by a second warm period which produces the snowmelt eventually the scenario ends with a colder temperature series that includes a rainfall event debs et al 1999 a two week melting period is recommended to be sufficient in the province of québec however it can be shortened or extended when it is necessary to do so debs et al 1999 the temperature values during the melting period were estimated through statistical analyses of observed air temperature to obtain a 100 year air temperature time series t100 according to chow and jones 1994a for the second scenario pmsa was calculated for current and future climate conditions and inserted along with p100 to calculate corresponding pmf one approach to calculate pmsa is to sum up maximized and non maximized storms that would occur in a winter season that experienced large snow accumulations storm maximization is based on moisture maximization similar to estimating pmp only storms with maximum precipitation efficiency are maximized this estimation procedure should be repeated on several severe winters and the largest snow depth after maximization among these winters is the pmsa klein et al 2016 cehq and snc lavalin 2004 chow and jones 1994b debs et al 1999 however a modified version of this approach was adopted for the following reasons first precipitation efficiency is a difficult and complex quantity for definition and estimation gao and li 2008 and therefore poses a challenge to properly identify maximizable storms to circumvent this difficulty debs et al 1999 selected as storms to be maximized those events which produced more than 5 cm of snow accumulation this criterion does not guarantee that selected storms are efficient the second reason is that we believe this approach is prone to overestimate pmsa as it is highly unlikely that several maximized storms occur in the same season especially if storms to maximize are selected based on low snow accumulations instead the following approach was used to construct the pmsa first the five largest winters in terms of snow accumulation are selected in each time horizon for each winter selected the three largest storms are identified and maximized from which the largest maximized storm is kept regardless of the time of occurrence in the season this maximized storm is then added to the snowpack before the thaw begins the winter with the largest maximized snowpack produces the pmsa as mentioned above swat is a semi distributed hydrological model therefore unlike lumped models precipitation needs to be spatially distributed at the watershed scale in this study the elliptical pattern approach for rainfall events proposed by the wmo wmo 2009 was used to spatially distribute pmps which are calculated at the crcm tile scale in the elliptical method the direction of the ellipses was found by trial and error to obtain the direction that yields the most severe flood the eye of the storm which is also the center of the ellipses was positioned at the centroid of the watershed yielding the largest areal precipitation mean and thus the most severe flood finally the pmp value set at the centroid of each watershed to compute pmf was the maximum value among the pmps estimated over all crcm tiles covering the watershed and its surroundings in other words it was assumed that the computed pmp could be directly transposed to the watershed centroid more details can be found in rouhani 2016 4 results results are presented for summer fall and spring seasons the largest pmf value obtained is defined as the all year pmf 4 1 climate change scenarios since pmp and watershed hydrology are closely linked to seasons data analysis was performed on a seasonal basis projected daily precipitation and temperature plots are presented in fig 3 for the three watersheds and two future time slices reference and future in this figure for each time horizon median values of seven climate simulations described in table 2 are displayed fig 3 shows that for each watershed the crcm projections produce a temperature increase this increase can be up to 7 c depending on the season and watershed considered the temperature increase is larger in colder months than in warmer ones for precipitation a 5 decrease was obtained in the summer fall season for the future time horizon in the chaudière while for the moisie and great whale watersheds an increase up to 14 was obtained modest increases are noted in the winter in the moisie and great whale watersheds while a larger augmentation is observed in the chaudière watershed in general the increase in temperature and precipitation is more pronounced at high latitudes this is in accordance with various studies bernstein et al 2007 karl et al 2008 solomon et al 2007 4 2 summer fall floods in fig 4 summer fall pmp values in three watersheds for two time horizons are displayed the box plots correspond to pmp variability due to climate related uncertainties as represented by the different climate scenarios as can be seen in this figure pmp tends to increase in the future for all three watersheds also pmp values decrease at higher latitudes this is because the atmosphere holds less water vapor in higher latitudes according to the clausius clapeyron equation therefore less severe storms occur in higher latitudes as confirmed by 100 year rainfall values for the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds see table 1 in addition pmp values from different climate models tend to converge for both current and future climates at higher latitudes as denoted by a narrower range of the corresponding box plots the summer fall pmf was estimated first by inserting a pmp in all simulation days of the corresponding time horizon this produced a distribution of large flood events from which a pmf value was extracted in this study the value corresponding to the 90th percentile of the cumulative distribution was considered as representative of summer pmf cumulative distribution functions cdf of extreme flood events including pmf for the three watersheds and two time horizons can be found in fig 5 each cdf displays variability resulting from different soil moisture conditions which naturally evolve and vary along the summer fall season considering seven climate simulations an array of cdf curves of extreme flood events for each watershed and time horizon is obtained reflecting uncertainty due to gcm structure climate variability and the ghg emission scenario as can be seen in this figure for all three watersheds the range of possible pmfs widens and shifts rightward in the future in other words summer fall pmf is most likely to increase in the future moreover moving toward higher latitudes renders a narrow range of possible pmf values and this can be interpreted as decreasing climate related uncertainties model natural variability and ghg emission scenarios in higher latitudes in accordance with decreasing pmp variability see fig 4 increasing pmf uncertainty from the current to future climate is observed for all three watersheds which is in accordance with fig 3 where t and p uncertainty increases in the future fig 5 allows distinguishing the influence of climate related uncertainty due to climate model structure natural climate variability and the ghg emission scenario through selected pmp values from uncertainty due to soil moisture conditions on the resulting pmf more specifically the range of pmf values for a given cdf curve displays pmf variability due to soil moisture whereas the lateral spread of all cdf curves corresponds to variability due to the climate related uncertainties note that the cdf curves for a given watershed and time horizon all tend to be parallel meaning that the effect of soil moisture on pmf tends to be similar no matter what climate scenario is used the figure also reveals that uncertainty due to soil moisture tends to outweigh uncertainty due to climate scenarios as the watershed is located at higher latitude 4 3 spring floods the spring pmf was obtained according to two scenarios the first scenario was forcing a hydrological model with the largest pmp estimate in the watershed for each climate model along with s100 as an initial condition in the model and a 100 year time series of air temperature t100 to melt the snowpack sc1 the second scenario was forcing a hydrological model with a 100 year return period rainfall p100 along with probable maximum snow accumulation pmsa and t100 sc2 the length of the temperature series was adjusted extended or shortened to capture the largest possible flood fig 6 represents the driving forces for computing spring pmf i e extreme snow water equivalent s100 and pmsa extreme rainfall pmp and p100 and critical air temperature time series t100 represented here as an average value over the melting time period for the two scenarios described above and for the current and future climate the variability displayed in the box plots is the result of climate related uncertainties model structure natural climate variability and ghg emission scenario fig 3 shows that the temperature rises in future climate conditions as well as the precipitation in winter months in lower latitudes this temperature rise will convert solid precipitation events to rainfall consequently solid precipitation is reduced by 10 in the chaudière watershed median value while it is slightly increased by 1 and 0 5 in moisie and great whale respectively this in turn reduces s100 and pmsa see fig 6 temperature is expected to rise in the future so will t100 see fig 6 these changes in rainfall swe and t100 will in turn affect future spring pmf in a way that depends on the relative contributions of the individual driving forces as seen in fig 7 which shows the range of possible spring pmf values reflecting for each individual watershed climate related uncertainties as can be seen in the figure spring pmf values remain stable for the chaudière watershed while they tend to increase under future climate conditions in higher latitudes for both investigated scenarios this is mainly the result of increasing swe both s100 and pmsa in the northernmost watersheds see fig 6 meanwhile swe tends to decrease in the future in the chaudière watershed as the comparatively smaller increase in winter precipitation see fig 3 is counterbalanced by increasing midwinter thaw events resulting from a warmer winter moreover fig 7 shows that for all studied watersheds the second scenario pmsa p100 produced larger pmf values as compared to the first scenario pmp s100 for both current and future climates this is because the difference between pmsa and s100 is much larger than the one between pmp and p100 therefore the second scenario was kept for the determination of the spring pmf this is contrary to findings by debs et al 1999 where scenario 1 pmp s100 produced the largest pmf in their study of the ste marguerite watershed located close to the moisie watershed however debs et al 1999 used a 3 day pmp that includes a 204 mm rain in a 24 h period which is more than twice the 24 h pmp used in our study 95 value of 97 mm see fig 6 which explains why their pmp s100 scenario produced the largest pmf value the ste marguerite and moisie results are discussed further in section 5 5 discussion results of this work indicate that the pmf in québec s watersheds will undergo changes as the climate shifts the overall change for both spring and summer fall pmf is computed according to the following equation 4 δ pmf 100 pmf future pmf reference pmf reference which helps to reduce the effect of inherent model climate and hydrological biases minville et al 2008 as seen in figs 5 and 7 the spring pmf will surpass the summer fall pmf for all watersheds considered and all time horizons reference and future in other words simulation results indicate that the pmf in a future climate will still be governed by a combination of rainfall and snowmelt processes furthermore the impact of climate change on pmf will differ with latitude average spring pmf of the chaudière watershed located in the southern part of the province will only be marginally affected by a changing climate 3 increase as increasing rainfall will be outweighed by a decreasing snowpack resulting from the warmer air temperature watersheds located in the northernmost areas would have an average future spring pmf increase of 8 and 11 respectively for the moisie and great whale watersheds as both the rainfall and snowpack will be increasing a different procedure was used to calculate the summer fall pmf in order to account for the impact of soil moisture on the magnitude of the design flood according to this procedure a distribution of pmf values was obtained for each climate scenario see fig 5 the 90th percentile value of the cumulative distribution reflecting a high soil moisture content was considered as representative of summer fall pmf and was used in eq 4 to calculate the shift in pmf due to climate change separately for each climate scenario see fig 8 as can be seen in this figure all summer fall pmf values follow an increasing trend except for two models in the moisie watershed the average summer fall increase in pmf is 31 13 and 17 for the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds respectively contrary to the spring pmf no trend exists with the watershed latitude this is perhaps not surprising given the significant influence of soil moisture on pmf and the complex interactions between soil moisture and temperature precipitation regimes these results were obtained through a climatic hydrological modeling process and therefore are subject to climate related uncertainties model structure natural climate variability ghg emission scenarios as well as the hydrological model s structure and calibration two interrelated questions thus arise 1 what confidence can be placed in the values of the pmf obtained and 2 what confidence can be placed in the temporal trends obtained due to climate change providing an answer to these two questions is a challenging task because the pmf is a conceptual flood in other words the theoretically largest flood resulting from a combination of the most severe meteorological and hydrologic conditions that could conceivably occur in a given area it is therefore virtually impossible to validate a pmf its value will be disproven only once it is surpassed by a real flood an additional challenge is that future climate scenarios are uncertain climate models represent the state of the art in simulating future climatic regimes however there is no method of validating the climate simulations produced by these models the goodness of climate models at simulating current and future climate regimes is the subject of controversy as some researchers consider all climate models as equally good scholze et al 2006 while others believe that verification of natural systems is impossible oreskes et al 1994 petersen 2000 some researchers claim every model is definitely false morgan et al 1992 stainforth et al 2007 consequently the best way to help answering the above questions is to carry out a full uncertainty analysis of the modeling process in a study by chen et al 2011 the largest source of uncertainty in the hydrological impacts of climate change was attributed to the structure of climate models chen et al 2011 in our study seven climate scenarios were used in an attempt to better understand uncertainties due to climate model structure natural climate variability and ghg emissions on pmf therefore a range of potential scenarios can be the best representative of future pmf values other sources of uncertainties that are known to affect the estimation of future hydrological regimes and therefore pmf estimates such as hydrological model structure and calibration only one hydrological model was used and downscaling approach only one regional model was used were not addressed in our study consequently the climate scenarios used in this study provide an incomplete portrait of the sources of uncertainty affecting spring and summer fall pmf this is perhaps best reflected in fig 7 where the box plots display an asymmetry in the distribution of spring pmf values particularly for the great whale watershed more climate scenarios are thus required to better quantify uncertainty so that the average pmf obtained from such an analysis would be more representative of the true pmf furthermore the negative summer fall pmf trends obtained with two climate models for the moisie watershed which affect the computed average trend are linked to outliers in both current and future pmp estimates see fig 4 this further points out the necessity of adding more climate scenarios for better defining future pmf a related issue is that climate models including the crcm are typically biased as mentioned above bias was not removed to preserve the coherency of data and also because of observational data scarcity therefore it is possible that pmp pmsa t100 p100 and s100 values derived from crcm output are affected by biases and uncertainties resulting from the crcm structure note that chen et al 2011 concluded that downscaling techniques i e regional climate models statistical downscaling had a significant impact on the simulated average spring peak flow this further reinforces the need to increase the number of climate scenarios to better address this source of uncertainty in evaluating spring pmf in watersheds dominated by snow processes as noted above analyzing climate change impacts as trends rather than as absolute values diminishes the effects of model biases on results another way to provide some level of confidence as to the validity of the pmf values obtained in this study is to compare them with estimates from other studies carried out in the same regions one such study is that of debs et al 1999 who calculated the pmf of the sainte marguerite watershed which is located just east of the moisie watershed these authors calculated the pmf of the watershed by combining a pmp with s100 and also pmsa and p100 as was done in this study table 4 compares the results of debs et al 1999 with our study for the two scenarios combining extreme precipitation and snowpack as shown in table 4 the moisie watershed is three times larger than the sainte marguerite watershed depending on which scenario is taken the moisie sainte marguerite pmf ratio is either smaller scenario 1 or larger scenario 2 than the watershed area ratio considering scenario 1 the moisie sainte marguerite pmf ratio is 1 70 0 53 if divided by area suggesting that the pmf in the moisie watershed may be underestimated relative to that of the sainte marguerite watershed since s100 is similar in both watersheds 354 mm vs 404 mm the main reason for the mismatch between the pmf values is the pmp estimates which are shown in table 4 however comparing the pmp from the two watersheds must be done with caution as the pmp developed by debs et al 1999 is for a three day storm while a one day pmp was developed in this study with scenario 2 the moisie sainte marguerite pmf ratio is 4 04 1 28 if divided by area this time suggesting overestimation of pmf in the moisie however the pmf ratio was calculated with an average pmf value from the climate scenarios analyzed using the 25 percentile pmf value 7000 m3 s see fig 7 a pmf ratio of 3 29 1 06 when divided by area was obtained which is close to the watershed area ratio it is therefore difficult to ascertain whether there is an overestimation of pmf in the moisie watershed and more climate scenarios are required to draw more definitive conclusions also although both studies used the wmo approach to estimate the pmp the databases used for the studies significantly differ this study used the crcm output data including a large storm over an area encompassing the moisie watershed while the debs et al 1999 study analyzed 18 major storms which were maximized and transposed both spatially and temporally moreover it is known that crcm underestimates precipitation in cold months rouhani and leconte 2016 however the fact that the s100 values in both studies are of comparable magnitude gives some confidence in using the crcm output data as snowpack observations to conclude the comparative analysis between the debs et al 1999 study and our study did not provide any evidence that the pmf estimated for the moisie watershed was either over or underestimated note in table 4 that the model averaged pmsa calculated for the moisie watershed is notably less than that obtained by debs et al 1999 as well the average pmsa of the chaudière watershed is less than that obtained by klein et al 2016 for the yamaska watershed which is located not far from the chaudière moreover the range of pmsa values spanned 385 515 mm in the chaudière which is narrower compared to the 443 724 mm range obtained by klein et al 2016 for the yamaska these differences are attributed to different estimation approaches used in the current study and in debs et al 1999 and klein et al 2016 as described above a generalized method to estimate pmp based on the wmo approach for storm maximization and transposition has been developed for the province of québec cehq and snc lavalin 2003 using storms that have occurred over eastern canada i e maritimes québec and ontario provinces the method referred to as the snc method relies on the use of diagrams tables and graphs to generate pmp estimates for a specific region table 5 compares spring and summer fall pmp estimates average values from the snc method and the approach used in this study table 5 indicates that using the crcm data may be underestimating the pmp relative to estimates of the pmp using observations of major storms again since the true value of the pmp cannot be assessed a part of the observed difference may be attributed to an overestimation of the pmp using the snc method and or to an underestimation with the crcm approach estimates of the pmf should therefore be interpreted with caution the pmp approach used here avoids the need to put an upper bound on the maximization ratios recommended in the original wmo approach since the calculation of the maximization ratios is based on using atmospheric variables closely related to storm formation the proposed approach is deemed more suitable for climate change studies figs 4 7 present the temporal evolution of the pmp and pmf from the reference period to future 2041 2070 time horizon respectively for the summer fall and spring seasons as a warmer atmosphere has an increased capacity to hold water vapor one expects the pmp to increase with climate change figs 4 and 6 confirm that the pmp increases over time for the three studied watersheds as explained above the computed pmf also changes from the control period to future time horizons and the direction of the changes is closely related to interactions between the pmp and soil moisture for summer fall pmf and s100 and t100 events for spring pmf used in the hydrological modeling process moreover trend analyses offer the advantage that uncertainties due to the model structure climate and hydrology are minimized therefore we believe that the results presented in this study provide a plausible evolution of the pmf due to climate change for instance our study showed that the average increase in the spring pmf using pmp and s100 sc1 was 8 and 11 between the 1961 1990 and the 2041 2070 time horizon respectively for the moisie and great whale watersheds clavet gaumont et al 2017 also used sc1 and obtained an 11 increase for the manic 5 watershed geographically located between the moisie and the great whale watersheds as mentioned above a decreasing trend in the summer fall pmp was obtained for two climate scenarios afx afx and agw ahb see table 2 over the moisie watershed a decrease in pmp as the atmosphere is warming appears counterintuitive and additional analyses should be conducted before reaching definitive conclusions as to the temporal trend obtained in the watersheds as it may be related to climate model structure more specifically one cause may be related to the trends in extreme precipitation and or maximization ratios produced by or derived from the crcm as the climate shifts fig 9 shows the summer fall extreme precipitation events that led to the pmp values as expected there is a general increasing trend for extreme events which was also found by others e g mailhot et al 2007 this means that the maximization ratio of eq 1 is decreasing in the future at least for those two climate models in the moisie watershed whether such trends are expected remains to be confirmed however as the atmospheric moisture holding capacity increases with increasing air temperature the trend for the maximization ratio can theoretically decrease or increase indeed the maximization ratio is composed of two variables maximum precipitable water and actual precipitable water maximum precipitable water the numerator in the maximization ratio is likely to increase in the future as air temperature rises clark 1987 kunkel et al 2013 it is limited by an upper bound for a given temperature corresponding to atmospheric saturation for example this upper bound for the gulf coast in the usa was found to be 75 mm in the past 50 years for the summer season kunkel et al 2013 an increase of the actual precipitable water is also a possibility in the future because the atmospheric capacity to hold water vapor increases with warmer temperatures however depending on the magnitude of this increase relative to a corresponding increase of the maximum precipitable water the net effect could be either a rise or a reduction of the maximization ratio it is therefore the combination of both trends extreme precipitation events and maximization ratios in eq 1 that can result in either an increasing or a decreasing trend in future pmp klein et al 2016 analyzed climate change influence on the maximization ratio for two watersheds in the province of quebec they found that the number of crcm tiles with maximization ratio exceeding 2 5 set as an upper limit decreases in the future this can be interpreted as an overall reduction of the maximization ratio this also raises a question about the validity of eq 1 for estimating pmp for example convective activities in north america are expected to increase in future climate scenarios paquin et al 2014 therefore the occurrence of convective rainfall of increased severity is more likely averaged cape for all simulations shows that cape increased by 68 51 and 52 in the future for the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds respectively yet severe convective storms can be sustained with moderate precipitable water values as they are fed by atmospheric convective activity during rainfall this process is not taken into account by the moisture maximization pmp estimation method as described by eq 1 the validity of eq 1 has been challenged with the conclusion that the linear relationship in this equation does not hold in some cases abbs 1999 to resolve this issue attempts were made to estimate pmp using numerical weather models ohara et al 2011 although not constrained by assumptions such as in eq 1 output of these models is not necessarily pmp but rather maximum precipitation mp as its calculation is deterministic and based on boundary conditions fed to the model representing extreme atmospheric conditions leading to severe storms results from this research show that there are multiple factors that influence the pmf values in watersheds dominated by snow processes the great whale watershed which is the largest in terms of surface area has a smaller spring pmf value compared to the moisie watershed this is because the spring pmp and s100 in the moisie watershed are larger by up to 24 and 31 respectively and the melt is occurring faster since the watershed is located at a lower latitude than great whale therefore the surface area alone is not necessarily the major contributor to the pmf value a similar conclusion was reported for asian watersheds bao quang and laituri 2013 finally one may argue that 48 or even 72 h pmp events should have been selected to estimate pmf in this study as larger watersheds usually demand longer pmp duration indeed in designing hydraulic structures such as dam spillways the optimal duration of pmp should be the one which produces the largest pmf which is linked to watershed area however the goal of this paper is not producing pmf values to be used for design purposes but rather to investigate how pmf is expected to change as the climate shifts therefore we believe that the choice of a 24 h pmp event to compute its corresponding pmf event is justified in this context note that in a research by beauchamp et al 2013 who used 24 to 72 h summer pmp events to calculate corresponding pmf on the manicouagan river watershed in québec which is of similar size of the larger watershed used in our study their authors actually obtained a smaller 72 h pmf as compared to the 48 h event as the larger magnitude of the storm was distributed over a longer duration reinforcing the hypothesis that an optimal pmp duration will produce the largest pmf value of a given watershed 6 conclusion in this paper the influence of climate change on pmp and pmf for three northern watersheds with different climate and physiographic characteristics was studied the watersheds are located in southern central and northern regions of the province of québec canada to simulate climate change conditions projected climate data of seven simulations using the crcm model with different gcm forcings ghg emission scenarios and initial conditions were used providing climate data that include daily precipitation temperature specific humidity cape and swe with a spatial resolution of 45 km pmp for two time horizons 1961 1990 and 2041 2070 were estimated through a deterministic approach based on the wmo and adapted to climate change impact studies by rouhani and leconte 2016 the pmp values were estimated for two different seasons summer fall and spring which produced two pmf values based on the results the spring pmf was found to be larger than the summer fall pmf for all watersheds and all time horizons therefore the all season pmf should be estimated from spring scenarios the spring pmf in the chaudière watershed located in southern québec would increase by 3 in the future time horizon while in the moisie and great whale watersheds respectively located in central and northern québec an 8 and 11 increase were obtained for these two respective watersheds scenario 1 the magnitude of the trends is closely tied to the interactions between the pmp s100 and temperature time series used to melt the snowpack the largest pmf is obtained for the moisie watershed although its surface area is much smaller than that of the great whale watershed finally these results were obtained using seven climate projections from the crcm while pmp appears to be underestimated along with an underestimation of the pmf the temporal trends are a reasonable indicator of future changes in spring pmf resulting from climate change finally this study did not consider all sources of uncertainty that may affect the results we considered uncertainties due to climate variability initial conditions and ghg scenarios however yet there are other sources of uncertainties for example only one regional climate model and one hydrological model were used including more models would help to quantify uncertainties due to downscaling many rcms and hydrological model structure parameters many hydrological models chen et al 2011 have demonstrated that downscaling techniques may introduce significant uncertainty in estimating spring peak flow and by extension pmf also the swat hydrological model uses a simplified snow melt routine based on the temperature index method and also calculates flow at a daily time step having other models with a diversity of snowmelt equations and sub daily time steps would allow investigating their effect on spring peak flows as in chen et al 2011 and therefore assessing model uncertainty on spring pmf

7311,climate change will affect precipitation and flood regimes it is anticipated that the probable maximum precipitation pmp and probable maximum flood pmf will be modified in a changing climate this paper aims to quantify and analyze climate change influences on pmp and pmf in three watersheds with different climatic conditions across the province of québec canada output data from the canadian regional climate model crcm was used to estimate pmp and probable maximum snow accumulation pmsa in future climate projections which was then used to force the swat hydrological model to estimate pmf pmp and pmf values were estimated for two time horizons each spanning 30 years 1961 1990 recent past and 2041 2070 future pmp and pmf were separately analyzed for two seasons summer fall and spring results show that pmf in the watershed located in southern québec would remain unchanged in the future horizon but the trend for the watersheds located in the northeastern and northern areas of the province is an increase of up to 11 keywords probable maximum flood climate change canadian regional climate model uncertainty analysis 1 introduction there is agreement among scientists that the global temperature in the future will increase as a result of anthropogenic activities dewalle and rango 2008 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc atmospheric temperature has already increased over the last decades in many parts of the world bates et al 2008 bernstein et al 2007 as atmospheric temperature rises the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water vapor increases according to the clausius clapeyron equation jakob et al 2008 under such circumstances it is likely that precipitation regimes will change river runoff regimes are expected to change as well bates et al 2008 although the direction of the change is difficult to predict as additional factors other than precipitation changes such as the evaporation rate and soil moisture can also influence flood magnitude for instance increasing precipitation and runoff have been predicted for future climate conditions in northern and central england arnell 1998 by contrast runoff in the maude watershed in western europe is expected to decrease in future decades as a result of climate change menzel and bürger 2002 in the province of québec canada a study suggested that mean annual runoff is expected to increase by 9 15 at the 2050 horizon in the northern part of the province while modest increases ranging from 1 to 5 are expected in the southern region desrochers et al 2008 this is in accordance with recent results of the hydroclimatic atlas of québec where future spring floods in higher latitudes of québec are likely to increase while in the south the trend would be reversed cehq 2015 in terms of mean annual temperature it was found that the increasing trend in southern québec is more significant than in central eastern and western regions yagouti et al 2008 this site dependency of climate change was found for the annual maximum precipitation as well for instance daily annual maximum precipitation with a 20 year return period showed large increases in future climate conditions in southern québec but modest increases would occur in atlantic canada mailhot et al 2012 therefore the evolution of hydrological regimes under climate change conditions should be studied at the regional scale changes in river floods and design floods due to climate change have been investigated in numerous studies beauchamp et al 2013 milly et al 2002 stewart et al 2005 tofiq and güven 2015 in northern countries where snow plays a dominant role in the hydrologic regimes of watersheds the direction of changes in flooding regimes is less clearly defined as increased temperatures will trigger midwinter thaws and affect the maximum snow water equivalent swe depending on the magnitude of the projected changes in precipitation this could result in either increased or decreased risks of spring floods for example in a recent study in southern québec cehq 2015 the daily spring peak flood with a 20 year period is expected to decrease in the southernmost part of the region 45 latitude at the 2050 horizon while an increase is projected in its northern part 50 latitude this paper focuses on estimating extreme flooding events under future climate conditions and more specifically the probable maximum flood pmf this is a pressing issue as many hydraulic structures such as dams dikes and spillways have been designed and are operated under the assumption of stationary hydrological conditions which depend upon a stationary climate such conditions will no longer be valid ipcc 2012 as there is much evidence that in many parts of the world climatic and hydrological regimes are changing aghakouchak et al 2012 and extreme hydrological events are occurring more frequently for example in the usa the 1st percentile daily rainfall rate increased in the 1958 2011 time horizon groisman et al 2013 in canada over the last 50 years annual temperatures in québec have increased by 1 2 c vescovi et al 2009 this province has also witnessed major floods over the last few decades such as the southern quebec and richelieu river spring floods and the saguenay summer flood which occurred respectively in 2017 2011 and in 1996 the southern quebec flood affected 261 municipalities forced the evacuation of 4000 people flooded 5000 homes and damaged 400 roads the richelieu flood was a historical maximum international joint commission 2015 and it forced some 2000 people to leave their residences environment and climate change canada 2013 the saguenay summer flood killed 10 people forced 12 000 people to flee their homes and caused damage exceeding 800 million canadian dollars this flood was estimated as 8 times larger than a 100 year return period flood lapointe et al 1998 milbrandt and yau 2001 it was after this major flood that the government of québec produced the dam safety act and its attendant regulation which came into effect in 2002 according to this act every large capacity dam must be able to withstand the pmf if the consequences of dam failure in flood conditions are classified as severe i e when the affected area is occupied permanently by a population of 10 000 inhabitants or more gouvernement du québec 2015b with the potential risk of pmf estimates changing under climate change conditions it is necessary for dam owners to ensure that structures are safe for future climate conditions therefore investigating the effects of climate change on pmf is critical in countries where laws are enforced based on this criterion for properly managing their hydraulic structures this paper is organized as follows first literature on pmf and climate change is presented and discussed this is followed by a description of the methodology used to estimate the pmf for three watersheds in québec characterized by different climatic regimes and affected differently by climate change the methodology is based on computing the probable maximum precipitation pmp traditionally pmf is estimated by inserting pmp after a large storm when soil is nearly saturated cehq and snc lavalin 2003 prasad et al 2011 schreiner and riedel 1978 or by several random insertion of pmp in different days to take into account different soil moisture conditions beauchamp et al 2013 in this study pmp is estimated according to a novel approach by rouhani and leconte 2016 this approach is amenable to climate change impact studies pmp is then used for summer fall pmf estimation with taking into account different soil moisture conditions and spring pmf estimation with taking into account different snow and temperature conditions results and a discussion are then presented followed by the conclusion 2 pmf and climate change pmf is the largest flood that can reasonably occur ely and peters 1984 this extreme flood is a result of critical meteorological conditions occurring simultaneously with favorable hydrological conditions beauchamp et al 2013 critical meteorological conditions are those that result in extreme precipitation favorable hydrological conditions are those that make the soil saturated in regions with significant annual snowfall such as the province of québec there is also a risk of a severe flood when a significant amount of snow melts therefore two types of flood scenarios can be defined in these regions 1 summer fall floods are the result of extreme rainfall on saturated soil and 2 spring floods are the result of extreme rainfall on a very large amount of snow on the ground during an unusually warm period that produces the snowmelt the extreme precipitation event that is usually used to estimate pmf is called the probable maximum precipitation pmp which is defined as the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration meteorologically possible for a design watershed or a given storm area at a particular location at a particular time of year with no allowance made for long term climatic trends wmo 2009 to study the impact of climate change on pmf scenarios covering the summer fall and spring seasons should be analyzed in recent years an increasing number of researchers have investigated the influence of climate change conditions on extreme rainfall and floods condon et al 2015 groisman et al 2005 qian et al 2010 yagouti et al 2008 one of the pioneering researchers was robert a clark who studied key variables for pmp estimates namely maximum moisture maximum inflow winds and precipitation efficiency clark 1987 clark also reported that the maximum moisture would increase as atmospheric temperature increases and would thus result in an increase in pmp values by at least 10 due to climate change clark 1987 it was also predicted that extreme rainfall events over europe would be more frequent under climate change conditions frei et al 1998 another study using data from the canadian regional climate model crcm caya and laprise 1999 established that extreme short duration rainfall events would be more intense in southern québec mailhot et al 2007 on the other hand it was reported that short duration extreme rainfall events would be less intense in alabama usa mirhosseini et al 2013 potentially significant changes in runoff volumes and peak flows were also reported under future climate scenarios in southern québec roy et al 2001 and elsewhere arnell 1998 lagos zúñiga and vargas m 2014 since the study by clark few studies have been devoted to the impacts of climate change on pmp and pmf a report by the world meteorological organization wmo briefly discusses potential changes in pmp under climate change conditions emphasizing that atmospheric moisture availability storm efficiency depth area curves and storm types should be analyzed in such investigations wmo 2009 it was reported that pmp is likely to increase under climate change conditions almost everywhere in the world kunkel et al 2013 this study examined the effect of climate change on extreme rainfall events maximum water vapor horizontal wind and vertical air motion using projections of general circulation models gcms towards 2071 2100 the researchers concluded that the probable causes of projected increases of pmp are changes in water vapor availability and the increase in extreme rainfall events due to the increasing trend of maximum precipitable water these results were also asserted in an additional study lagos zúñiga and vargas m 2014 using gcms which reported that pmp is likely to increase in the andean basins of chile leading to an increase in pmf of up to 175 by the years 2045 2065 an investigation on pmp values in southern québec using regional climate models rcms confirmed that summer fall pmp is likely to increase under climate change conditions in the 2041 2080 time horizon rousseau et al 2014 similar results for the 2071 2100 time horizon were obtained for a watershed located in central québec although no clear trend for future pmf was found beauchamp et al 2013 similarly in the 2071 2100 time horizon summer pmf values were reported not to show any clear trend for a watershed in norway however fall pmf exhibited an increasing trend up to 15 chernet et al 2013 also numerical weather models were used to investigate changes in pmp due to local to regional climate change caused by land use land cover change for example the influence of reservoir size and irrigation on pmp of two watersheds in western usa was analyzed stratz and hossain 2014 in that study the influence of water cycle changes on regional climate through simulation of the dew point temperature using regional atmospheric modeling rams was studied the dew point temperature was later used to estimate pmp results indicated that irrigation and reservoir size can notably affect pmp in another recent study numerical weather models were used to analyze climate change impacts on pmp using background temperature increases and also parameterizations such as cloud microphysics rastogi et al 2017 a 20 increase of pmp estimate was found for southwestern usa given the rather small number of studies dealing specifically with the effects of climate change on pmf it is difficult to draw firm conclusions as to the direction of the projected changes this is due to compounding factors such as soil moisture and the maximum swe which are also affected by climate change and are decisive factors in establishing pmf values the present paper proposes a methodology to estimate pmf under climate change conditions based on estimating pmp according to an approach specifically adapted to climate change impact studies and taking into consideration seasonal factors i e soil moisture and snowpack conditions the methodology is applied to three watersheds in québec that are characterized by different physiographic and climatic features which demonstrates its applicability to a variety of watersheds with snow dominated hydrologic regimes 3 methodology the basic approach to estimate the pmf under current and future climate conditions is to force a hydrological model with precipitation and air temperature projections derived from a regional climate model the next sections detail the approach beginning with a short description of the watersheds under study the datasets and hydrological model used and the methods to calculate pmp and pmf 3 1 watersheds three watersheds were analyzed to investigate the influence of different climate conditions on pmp and pmf as depicted in fig 1 the watersheds are in the province of québec canada although these three watersheds undergo long freezing seasons and mainly receive solid precipitation during winter they have been selected to represent different climatic conditions in terms of precipitation and atmospheric temperature regimes as shown in table 1 overall temperature and total precipitation decrease with increasing latitude all three watersheds have hydrologic regimes dominated by snowmelt runoff although summer storms can sometimes produce floods of a magnitude comparable to spring peak flows the physiographic characteristics of the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds are presented in table 1 the chaudière watershed is located in southern québec and has 180 000 inhabitants comité de bassin de la rivière chaudiére 2015 approximately 60 of the watershed is covered by forest 30 is covered by agricultural land and the remaining area is devoted to industrial and residential activities the chaudière river which flows north and into the st lawrence river experiences the largest discharges in april and sometimes comparable discharges occur in september the mean annual flow in the outlet of the chaudière watershed is 114 m3 s the moisie watershed is located in the center of québec its main watercourse is the moisie river which flows south and discharges into the gulf of st lawrence around 4000 people live in this watershed gouvernement du québec 2015a the area has very limited industrial agricultural development and is mainly covered by forest the moisie river usually experiences the largest discharges in may the mean annual flow in the outlet of the moisie watershed is 410 m3 s the great whale watershed is located in northern québec its main watercourse is the great whale river the great whale watershed is mainly covered by forest the great whale river which flows westward and empties into hudson bay usually experiences the largest discharges in june and sometimes another comparable peak occurs in the fall the mean annual flow in the outlet of the great whale watershed is 514 m3 s fig 2 shows the average daily runoff hydrographs for the 1960 2005 period for these watersheds the watersheds exhibit different hydrological regimes as a result of different physiographic and climatic characteristics the chaudière watershed has the smallest peak value and is also the smallest of the three watersheds the peak flow in the chaudière watershed usually occurs in april while the peak flow usually occurs in may and june for the moisie and great whale watersheds respectively the moisie watershed has the largest peak value among the three watersheds although its surface area is half that of the great whale this is because of the annual snow received by the moisie which exceeds that of the great whale with respective values of 400 mm and 240 mm also the average temperature in the moisie watershed during the melting season is 6 5 c which exceeds the value of 3 5 c in the great whale watershed the spring melt is therefore more intense on average over the moisie watershed as compared to the great whale 3 2 data observed flow and meteorological data required for calibrating the hydrological model described below come from the centre d expertise hydrique du québec cehq now direction de l expertise hydrique and from the national land and water information service nlwis database respectively the nlwis database provides grids of daily precipitation and the maximum and minimum surface temperature of canada south of 60 latitude with a resolution of 10 km covering the years 1961 2003 these grids were interpolated daily from environment canada station observations using a thin plate smoothing spline surface fitting method hutchinson et al 2009 using interpolated values was necessary as very few weather stations with long and continuous precipitation and temperature data are currently available for the moisie and great whale watersheds although there are several meteorological stations in the chaudière watershed and its vicinity nlwis interpolated data were also used to maintain coherency a daily precipitation comparison between nlwis and a ground station st prosper in chaudière watershed between 1970 and 2000 indicated mean values are only 2 different physiographic data sets topography soil type vegetation cover etc required by the model were obtained from two datasets namely geogratis natural resources canada 2015 and webarchive international institue for applied systems analysis 2015 geogratis was used for land use data residential industrial forest agriculture etc and webarchive was used for different soil types i e different soil characteristics in the watersheds of interest this study aims to estimate pmp and pmf under current and future climate conditions as such climate projections are required to that end climate models can simulate an array of equivalent meteorological stations along with vertical profiles of atmospheric variables and can generate long historical and future data series in addition output climate variables from these models are internally coherent since they are generated in the same system of solving mass and energy equations it follows that the current and future climate projections are also coherent enabling a study of the evolution of pmp and pmf as climate conditions shift by directly comparing simulated current and future values although global climate models gcms can simulate large rainfall events durman et al 2001 regional climate models rcms are better suited to simulate such events at the watershed scale and therefore are preferred for hydrological studies for example general consistency between observations and the canadian regional climate model crcm paquin 2010 confirmed the ability of the crcm to generate extreme storm events crcm output has been compared with observational data in a number of studies for instance intensity duration frequency idf curves in southern québec were retrieved from crcm output and compared favorably with idf curves derived from observations mailhot et al 2007 its capacity to reproduce extreme observed events outside of canada was also positively tested goyette et al 2001 moreover it was reported that crcm simulations of precipitable water are promising in terms of similarity with observations although some underestimates were noticed in warmer seasons rousseau et al 2014 it was therefore decided to use crcm outputs as the prime data set to carry out this work due to the richness and completeness of such a database since the capacity of reproducing rainfall events is model dependent langousis et al 2016 it was decided to include several climate simulations thus allowing uncertainty analyses mailhot et al 2012 to this end data used in this study were retrieved from crcm version 4 2 3 paquin 2010 driven by the following gcms i cgcm 3 1v2 4th member de elía and côté 2010 music and caya 2007 ii cnrm cm3 salas mélia et al 2005 and iii echam 5 roeckner et al 2003 the greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios used to run gcms are either sres a2 or a1b nakicenovic et al 2000 details of these different climate simulations can be found in table 2 a total of seven climate simulations were used in this study this selection of climate models enables investigating the influence of gcm structure three models and climate variability five different initial conditions of a gcm here the cgcm3 the effect of different ghg emission scenarios can also be studied as there are two emission scenarios specific humidity in different atmospheric pressure levels either 18 or 23 depending on the model surface atmospheric temperature convective available potential energy cape swe daily maximum and minimum temperature and total precipitation in daily time steps were obtained at a spatial resolution of 45 km by 45 km for two 30 year long time horizons 1961 1990 recent past or reference and 2041 2070 future climate models are known to be biased i e the models systematically underestimate or overestimate some climatic variables hempel et al 2013 schmidli et al 2006 therefore bias removing is a common practice in studies involving climate models bias removal techniques try to lessen the difference between statistical moments such as the monthly average of observational data and climate model outputs and are supposed to preserve climatic trends in this study no bias removal modification was applied as it was deemed to damage the internal coherency of outputs this is because bias removing requires observational data which is scarce for variables such as swe precipitable water and cape therefore applying bias removal techniques to some selected variables such as precipitation and temperature and using the others as is such as precipitable water and cape harms the credibility of crcm as an ensemble of climate data one may argue that correcting biases for temperature and precipitation would result in a better timing and magnitude of the simulated flood this is not an issue here as the concern is more on simulating changes in pmf magnitude consecutive to climate change rather than providing absolute magnitude and timing this is later discussed in the paper on the other hand crcm outputs of precipitable water were confirmed by a comparison against observational data that were available for the moisie watershed to lend reliability for using crcm output in this study details of this comparison can be found in rouhani and leconte 2016 3 3 hydrological modeling the swat hydrological model neitsch et al 2002 was used to compute pmf swat is a semi distributed hydrological model processes simulated by swat include infiltration evapotranspiration runoff groundwater and snow accumulation and melt haguma 2013 sub watersheds and the hydrographic network are automatically delineated by using a digital elevation model dem swat further sub divides the watershed into hydrological response units hru hrus are land portions with unique topographic land use and cover and soil characteristics arnold et al 2012 hydrological processes are calculated at the hru level followed by an aggregation at the sub watershed level the resulting runoff is routed through the computed hydrographic network until reaching the main watershed outlet inputs to swat also include pesticide nutrient fertilizer database and septic system data these analyses were not done in the present study the calculations are carried out at a daily time step interval crcm tiles were assumed as virtual meteorological stations for modeling current and future pmf a calibration on daily time step based on observational data of precipitation and runoff in a period of 11 years was used for the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds the corresponding validation period was 4 10 and 10 years the nash sutcliffe ns criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 applied to daily runoff values was used as the objective function to calibrate swat with the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1992 calibration and validation results are presented in table 3 another calibration scheme was also tried in this study by comparing observed versus simulated runoff from swat when directly forced by crcm precipitation and temperature this scenario did not produce promising results as dynamics of crcm data are different than those of observational data and crcm runoff still suffers from inconsistencies overall swat was able to adequately simulate the hydrological regime of the three watersheds the calibrated model was driven with current and future climate projections generated by the crcm model and pmp calculated from crcm data to generate corresponding pmf values 3 4 pmp in this study a deterministic approach to calculate 24 h pmp was applied based on simulated climate data from the crcm the method is based on the moisture maximization approach recommended by the wmo wmo 1973 wmo 1986 wmo 2009 1 pmp p obs w max w storm p obs r in eq 1 r is the maximization ratio pobs is the maximum observed precipitation depth wmax is the maximum precipitable water at the same time of year and same location as pobs and wstorm is the actual precipitable water of the observed storm pobs wmo 1973 wmo 1986 wmo 2009 to obtain precipitable water the most accurate approach is to take humidity measurements at different atmospheric levels and sum them up for example by using data collected by radiosondes schreiner and riedel 1978 in this study precipitable water was instead calculated using simulated specific humidity from the crcm database 2 w 1 g p 1 p 2 q p dp where w is the atmospheric moisture precipitable water g is the gravitational acceleration q is specific humidity and p represents pressure wstorm was calculated as the maximum precipitable water that occurred in a two day period prior to and during the storm beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 wmax can be estimated by different methods if the observation record is long enough at least 50 years the maximum in the record can be used as wmax however this is rarely the case in this study w100 the 100 year return period precipitable water was taken as a representative value for wmax according to beauchamp et al 2013 and rousseau et al 2014 the statistical distribution used to calculate w100 is the general extreme value gev distribution this distribution has been recommended for annual maximum rainfall koutsoyiannis 1999 and precipitable water distributions chow and jones 1994a thus the maximization ratio corresponds to 3 r w 100 w storm to estimate w100 a time series of the annual maximum of precipitable water values was established in the traditional method each element of this time series is the maximum recorded precipitable water at the same location as pobs for the same period of each year wmo 2009 it is suggested to limit the maximization ratio by an upper bound to avoid overestimation different values for the upper limit have been suggested but there is a lack of a sound physical basis therefore the validity of these values under climate change conditions can be questioned instead of imposing an upper limit on the maximization ratio a different approach was adopted to build the time series of maximum precipitable water from which w100 is retrieved briefly each element of this time series is the maximum among precipitable water values in each year for which selected climate variables resemble those of pobs climate variables of pobs are estimated based on the data before and during the storm climate variables used in this study include atmospheric temperature at the surface and cape which are considered indicative of conditions leading to significant storm events details of the approach can be found in rouhani and leconte 2016 as this approach is not constrained by setting an upper limit on the maximization ratio and because it attempts to preserve the original storm dynamics in calculating w100 we postulate that it is better suited to calculate pmp under climate change conditions as opposed to the traditional method rouhani 2016 the pmp approach was applied to estimate the summer fall and spring pmp for current and future climates at each crcm tile of the region encompassing each of the three watersheds under study the area covering each watershed was established in a manner to maximize the number of crcm virtual meteorological stations that are subject to a direct pmp transfer to the watershed under study the largest value for the pmp obtained in each watershed and surrounding area in case of transferability was considered as the representative pmp value for the corresponding watershed the seasons initial and final dates were established based on the geographical location of watersheds see table 1 that also indicates different precipitation patterns where summer fall extreme rainfalls are typically larger than spring events cehq and snc lavalin 2003 the summer fall season starts on may 16th in the chaudière and june 16th in the moisie and great whale watersheds and ends on november 30th it is also possible to define seasons based upon snow on the ground foulon et al 2017 klein et al 2016 rousseau et al 2014 however in this study calendar dates were used to enable comparison between two same length seasons 3 5 pmf pmf is obtained by combining critical meteorological and hydrological conditions one approach for estimating summer fall pmf is to force a hydrological model with a large precipitation event to produce saturated soil conditions followed by a pmp cehq and snc lavalin 2004 rousseau et al 2012 recently statistical approaches have been developed to better reflect the influence of different soil moisture levels on pmf beauchamp et al 2013 paquet et al 2013 in such methods a distribution of pmf values is obtained as opposed to a unique value these methods do not require establishing initial conditions prior to the pmp in this study a method inspired by beauchamp et al 2013 was used to calculate a distribution of summer fall pmf for the current and future climates basically the pmp computed for each watershed was inserted in each day of a precipitation temperature time series and the resulting runoff was simulated and counted as a potential watershed pmf the precipitation and temperature time series were obtained from the crcm simulations under current and future climate conditions although quantification of soil moisture was not possible in this study this approach allowed covering the entire range of possible soil moisture conditions that actually happened in the watersheds during the time horizons under study the resulting pmf values were ranked and a representative value in this case the 90th percentile value was selected as the watershed pmf there are different thresholds for identifying extreme values such as the 99th percentile for temperature e g mishra et al 2015 in this study the 90th percentile was inspired by a definition of extreme climate conditions an event which is higher lower than the tenth percentile karl et al 1996 however using other values based on pmf percentiles is possible according to the judgment of engineers managers or decision makers the temporal evolution of pmf distributions according to future climate scenarios will indicate how climate change influences pmf values for spring pmf an alternative methodology was used spring pmf results from the melting of a deep snowpack during an unusually warm period along with extreme rainfall therefore three hydrometeorological variables events come into play for establishing the pmf here a single critical combination of the three factors has been adopted leading to the production of a single pmf value rather than a distribution the occurrence of three maximized events snowpack temperature and rainfall simultaneously is unrealistic and may cause overestimates debs et al 1999 hydro québec and snc shawinigan 1992 instead two possible scenarios were defined i a pmp was estimated and was combined with a 100 year swe s100 and ii 100 year rainfall p100 was combined with the probable maximum snowpack accumulation pmsa it is worth mentioning that non stationarity of time series can be explicitly taken into account for estimating 100 year return period events e g rousseau et al 2014 and klein et al 2016 for more details in the current study in 30 year time horizons were assumed to be stationary however the probability density functions obtained for the different time horizons selected in our study did not have the same parameter values hence reflecting non stationarity between the horizons using crcm pmsa has recently been shown to be subject to variations as climate changes klein et al 2016 this justifies the application of a second scenario in this study for the first scenario annual maximum swe values were retrieved from crcm output from which s100 was estimated the air temperature time series should be established in a way that reflects an extreme yet realistic warm period the method selected followed that of debs et al 1999 it typically begins with a warm temperature period which ripens the snowpack followed by a second warm period which produces the snowmelt eventually the scenario ends with a colder temperature series that includes a rainfall event debs et al 1999 a two week melting period is recommended to be sufficient in the province of québec however it can be shortened or extended when it is necessary to do so debs et al 1999 the temperature values during the melting period were estimated through statistical analyses of observed air temperature to obtain a 100 year air temperature time series t100 according to chow and jones 1994a for the second scenario pmsa was calculated for current and future climate conditions and inserted along with p100 to calculate corresponding pmf one approach to calculate pmsa is to sum up maximized and non maximized storms that would occur in a winter season that experienced large snow accumulations storm maximization is based on moisture maximization similar to estimating pmp only storms with maximum precipitation efficiency are maximized this estimation procedure should be repeated on several severe winters and the largest snow depth after maximization among these winters is the pmsa klein et al 2016 cehq and snc lavalin 2004 chow and jones 1994b debs et al 1999 however a modified version of this approach was adopted for the following reasons first precipitation efficiency is a difficult and complex quantity for definition and estimation gao and li 2008 and therefore poses a challenge to properly identify maximizable storms to circumvent this difficulty debs et al 1999 selected as storms to be maximized those events which produced more than 5 cm of snow accumulation this criterion does not guarantee that selected storms are efficient the second reason is that we believe this approach is prone to overestimate pmsa as it is highly unlikely that several maximized storms occur in the same season especially if storms to maximize are selected based on low snow accumulations instead the following approach was used to construct the pmsa first the five largest winters in terms of snow accumulation are selected in each time horizon for each winter selected the three largest storms are identified and maximized from which the largest maximized storm is kept regardless of the time of occurrence in the season this maximized storm is then added to the snowpack before the thaw begins the winter with the largest maximized snowpack produces the pmsa as mentioned above swat is a semi distributed hydrological model therefore unlike lumped models precipitation needs to be spatially distributed at the watershed scale in this study the elliptical pattern approach for rainfall events proposed by the wmo wmo 2009 was used to spatially distribute pmps which are calculated at the crcm tile scale in the elliptical method the direction of the ellipses was found by trial and error to obtain the direction that yields the most severe flood the eye of the storm which is also the center of the ellipses was positioned at the centroid of the watershed yielding the largest areal precipitation mean and thus the most severe flood finally the pmp value set at the centroid of each watershed to compute pmf was the maximum value among the pmps estimated over all crcm tiles covering the watershed and its surroundings in other words it was assumed that the computed pmp could be directly transposed to the watershed centroid more details can be found in rouhani 2016 4 results results are presented for summer fall and spring seasons the largest pmf value obtained is defined as the all year pmf 4 1 climate change scenarios since pmp and watershed hydrology are closely linked to seasons data analysis was performed on a seasonal basis projected daily precipitation and temperature plots are presented in fig 3 for the three watersheds and two future time slices reference and future in this figure for each time horizon median values of seven climate simulations described in table 2 are displayed fig 3 shows that for each watershed the crcm projections produce a temperature increase this increase can be up to 7 c depending on the season and watershed considered the temperature increase is larger in colder months than in warmer ones for precipitation a 5 decrease was obtained in the summer fall season for the future time horizon in the chaudière while for the moisie and great whale watersheds an increase up to 14 was obtained modest increases are noted in the winter in the moisie and great whale watersheds while a larger augmentation is observed in the chaudière watershed in general the increase in temperature and precipitation is more pronounced at high latitudes this is in accordance with various studies bernstein et al 2007 karl et al 2008 solomon et al 2007 4 2 summer fall floods in fig 4 summer fall pmp values in three watersheds for two time horizons are displayed the box plots correspond to pmp variability due to climate related uncertainties as represented by the different climate scenarios as can be seen in this figure pmp tends to increase in the future for all three watersheds also pmp values decrease at higher latitudes this is because the atmosphere holds less water vapor in higher latitudes according to the clausius clapeyron equation therefore less severe storms occur in higher latitudes as confirmed by 100 year rainfall values for the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds see table 1 in addition pmp values from different climate models tend to converge for both current and future climates at higher latitudes as denoted by a narrower range of the corresponding box plots the summer fall pmf was estimated first by inserting a pmp in all simulation days of the corresponding time horizon this produced a distribution of large flood events from which a pmf value was extracted in this study the value corresponding to the 90th percentile of the cumulative distribution was considered as representative of summer pmf cumulative distribution functions cdf of extreme flood events including pmf for the three watersheds and two time horizons can be found in fig 5 each cdf displays variability resulting from different soil moisture conditions which naturally evolve and vary along the summer fall season considering seven climate simulations an array of cdf curves of extreme flood events for each watershed and time horizon is obtained reflecting uncertainty due to gcm structure climate variability and the ghg emission scenario as can be seen in this figure for all three watersheds the range of possible pmfs widens and shifts rightward in the future in other words summer fall pmf is most likely to increase in the future moreover moving toward higher latitudes renders a narrow range of possible pmf values and this can be interpreted as decreasing climate related uncertainties model natural variability and ghg emission scenarios in higher latitudes in accordance with decreasing pmp variability see fig 4 increasing pmf uncertainty from the current to future climate is observed for all three watersheds which is in accordance with fig 3 where t and p uncertainty increases in the future fig 5 allows distinguishing the influence of climate related uncertainty due to climate model structure natural climate variability and the ghg emission scenario through selected pmp values from uncertainty due to soil moisture conditions on the resulting pmf more specifically the range of pmf values for a given cdf curve displays pmf variability due to soil moisture whereas the lateral spread of all cdf curves corresponds to variability due to the climate related uncertainties note that the cdf curves for a given watershed and time horizon all tend to be parallel meaning that the effect of soil moisture on pmf tends to be similar no matter what climate scenario is used the figure also reveals that uncertainty due to soil moisture tends to outweigh uncertainty due to climate scenarios as the watershed is located at higher latitude 4 3 spring floods the spring pmf was obtained according to two scenarios the first scenario was forcing a hydrological model with the largest pmp estimate in the watershed for each climate model along with s100 as an initial condition in the model and a 100 year time series of air temperature t100 to melt the snowpack sc1 the second scenario was forcing a hydrological model with a 100 year return period rainfall p100 along with probable maximum snow accumulation pmsa and t100 sc2 the length of the temperature series was adjusted extended or shortened to capture the largest possible flood fig 6 represents the driving forces for computing spring pmf i e extreme snow water equivalent s100 and pmsa extreme rainfall pmp and p100 and critical air temperature time series t100 represented here as an average value over the melting time period for the two scenarios described above and for the current and future climate the variability displayed in the box plots is the result of climate related uncertainties model structure natural climate variability and ghg emission scenario fig 3 shows that the temperature rises in future climate conditions as well as the precipitation in winter months in lower latitudes this temperature rise will convert solid precipitation events to rainfall consequently solid precipitation is reduced by 10 in the chaudière watershed median value while it is slightly increased by 1 and 0 5 in moisie and great whale respectively this in turn reduces s100 and pmsa see fig 6 temperature is expected to rise in the future so will t100 see fig 6 these changes in rainfall swe and t100 will in turn affect future spring pmf in a way that depends on the relative contributions of the individual driving forces as seen in fig 7 which shows the range of possible spring pmf values reflecting for each individual watershed climate related uncertainties as can be seen in the figure spring pmf values remain stable for the chaudière watershed while they tend to increase under future climate conditions in higher latitudes for both investigated scenarios this is mainly the result of increasing swe both s100 and pmsa in the northernmost watersheds see fig 6 meanwhile swe tends to decrease in the future in the chaudière watershed as the comparatively smaller increase in winter precipitation see fig 3 is counterbalanced by increasing midwinter thaw events resulting from a warmer winter moreover fig 7 shows that for all studied watersheds the second scenario pmsa p100 produced larger pmf values as compared to the first scenario pmp s100 for both current and future climates this is because the difference between pmsa and s100 is much larger than the one between pmp and p100 therefore the second scenario was kept for the determination of the spring pmf this is contrary to findings by debs et al 1999 where scenario 1 pmp s100 produced the largest pmf in their study of the ste marguerite watershed located close to the moisie watershed however debs et al 1999 used a 3 day pmp that includes a 204 mm rain in a 24 h period which is more than twice the 24 h pmp used in our study 95 value of 97 mm see fig 6 which explains why their pmp s100 scenario produced the largest pmf value the ste marguerite and moisie results are discussed further in section 5 5 discussion results of this work indicate that the pmf in québec s watersheds will undergo changes as the climate shifts the overall change for both spring and summer fall pmf is computed according to the following equation 4 δ pmf 100 pmf future pmf reference pmf reference which helps to reduce the effect of inherent model climate and hydrological biases minville et al 2008 as seen in figs 5 and 7 the spring pmf will surpass the summer fall pmf for all watersheds considered and all time horizons reference and future in other words simulation results indicate that the pmf in a future climate will still be governed by a combination of rainfall and snowmelt processes furthermore the impact of climate change on pmf will differ with latitude average spring pmf of the chaudière watershed located in the southern part of the province will only be marginally affected by a changing climate 3 increase as increasing rainfall will be outweighed by a decreasing snowpack resulting from the warmer air temperature watersheds located in the northernmost areas would have an average future spring pmf increase of 8 and 11 respectively for the moisie and great whale watersheds as both the rainfall and snowpack will be increasing a different procedure was used to calculate the summer fall pmf in order to account for the impact of soil moisture on the magnitude of the design flood according to this procedure a distribution of pmf values was obtained for each climate scenario see fig 5 the 90th percentile value of the cumulative distribution reflecting a high soil moisture content was considered as representative of summer fall pmf and was used in eq 4 to calculate the shift in pmf due to climate change separately for each climate scenario see fig 8 as can be seen in this figure all summer fall pmf values follow an increasing trend except for two models in the moisie watershed the average summer fall increase in pmf is 31 13 and 17 for the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds respectively contrary to the spring pmf no trend exists with the watershed latitude this is perhaps not surprising given the significant influence of soil moisture on pmf and the complex interactions between soil moisture and temperature precipitation regimes these results were obtained through a climatic hydrological modeling process and therefore are subject to climate related uncertainties model structure natural climate variability ghg emission scenarios as well as the hydrological model s structure and calibration two interrelated questions thus arise 1 what confidence can be placed in the values of the pmf obtained and 2 what confidence can be placed in the temporal trends obtained due to climate change providing an answer to these two questions is a challenging task because the pmf is a conceptual flood in other words the theoretically largest flood resulting from a combination of the most severe meteorological and hydrologic conditions that could conceivably occur in a given area it is therefore virtually impossible to validate a pmf its value will be disproven only once it is surpassed by a real flood an additional challenge is that future climate scenarios are uncertain climate models represent the state of the art in simulating future climatic regimes however there is no method of validating the climate simulations produced by these models the goodness of climate models at simulating current and future climate regimes is the subject of controversy as some researchers consider all climate models as equally good scholze et al 2006 while others believe that verification of natural systems is impossible oreskes et al 1994 petersen 2000 some researchers claim every model is definitely false morgan et al 1992 stainforth et al 2007 consequently the best way to help answering the above questions is to carry out a full uncertainty analysis of the modeling process in a study by chen et al 2011 the largest source of uncertainty in the hydrological impacts of climate change was attributed to the structure of climate models chen et al 2011 in our study seven climate scenarios were used in an attempt to better understand uncertainties due to climate model structure natural climate variability and ghg emissions on pmf therefore a range of potential scenarios can be the best representative of future pmf values other sources of uncertainties that are known to affect the estimation of future hydrological regimes and therefore pmf estimates such as hydrological model structure and calibration only one hydrological model was used and downscaling approach only one regional model was used were not addressed in our study consequently the climate scenarios used in this study provide an incomplete portrait of the sources of uncertainty affecting spring and summer fall pmf this is perhaps best reflected in fig 7 where the box plots display an asymmetry in the distribution of spring pmf values particularly for the great whale watershed more climate scenarios are thus required to better quantify uncertainty so that the average pmf obtained from such an analysis would be more representative of the true pmf furthermore the negative summer fall pmf trends obtained with two climate models for the moisie watershed which affect the computed average trend are linked to outliers in both current and future pmp estimates see fig 4 this further points out the necessity of adding more climate scenarios for better defining future pmf a related issue is that climate models including the crcm are typically biased as mentioned above bias was not removed to preserve the coherency of data and also because of observational data scarcity therefore it is possible that pmp pmsa t100 p100 and s100 values derived from crcm output are affected by biases and uncertainties resulting from the crcm structure note that chen et al 2011 concluded that downscaling techniques i e regional climate models statistical downscaling had a significant impact on the simulated average spring peak flow this further reinforces the need to increase the number of climate scenarios to better address this source of uncertainty in evaluating spring pmf in watersheds dominated by snow processes as noted above analyzing climate change impacts as trends rather than as absolute values diminishes the effects of model biases on results another way to provide some level of confidence as to the validity of the pmf values obtained in this study is to compare them with estimates from other studies carried out in the same regions one such study is that of debs et al 1999 who calculated the pmf of the sainte marguerite watershed which is located just east of the moisie watershed these authors calculated the pmf of the watershed by combining a pmp with s100 and also pmsa and p100 as was done in this study table 4 compares the results of debs et al 1999 with our study for the two scenarios combining extreme precipitation and snowpack as shown in table 4 the moisie watershed is three times larger than the sainte marguerite watershed depending on which scenario is taken the moisie sainte marguerite pmf ratio is either smaller scenario 1 or larger scenario 2 than the watershed area ratio considering scenario 1 the moisie sainte marguerite pmf ratio is 1 70 0 53 if divided by area suggesting that the pmf in the moisie watershed may be underestimated relative to that of the sainte marguerite watershed since s100 is similar in both watersheds 354 mm vs 404 mm the main reason for the mismatch between the pmf values is the pmp estimates which are shown in table 4 however comparing the pmp from the two watersheds must be done with caution as the pmp developed by debs et al 1999 is for a three day storm while a one day pmp was developed in this study with scenario 2 the moisie sainte marguerite pmf ratio is 4 04 1 28 if divided by area this time suggesting overestimation of pmf in the moisie however the pmf ratio was calculated with an average pmf value from the climate scenarios analyzed using the 25 percentile pmf value 7000 m3 s see fig 7 a pmf ratio of 3 29 1 06 when divided by area was obtained which is close to the watershed area ratio it is therefore difficult to ascertain whether there is an overestimation of pmf in the moisie watershed and more climate scenarios are required to draw more definitive conclusions also although both studies used the wmo approach to estimate the pmp the databases used for the studies significantly differ this study used the crcm output data including a large storm over an area encompassing the moisie watershed while the debs et al 1999 study analyzed 18 major storms which were maximized and transposed both spatially and temporally moreover it is known that crcm underestimates precipitation in cold months rouhani and leconte 2016 however the fact that the s100 values in both studies are of comparable magnitude gives some confidence in using the crcm output data as snowpack observations to conclude the comparative analysis between the debs et al 1999 study and our study did not provide any evidence that the pmf estimated for the moisie watershed was either over or underestimated note in table 4 that the model averaged pmsa calculated for the moisie watershed is notably less than that obtained by debs et al 1999 as well the average pmsa of the chaudière watershed is less than that obtained by klein et al 2016 for the yamaska watershed which is located not far from the chaudière moreover the range of pmsa values spanned 385 515 mm in the chaudière which is narrower compared to the 443 724 mm range obtained by klein et al 2016 for the yamaska these differences are attributed to different estimation approaches used in the current study and in debs et al 1999 and klein et al 2016 as described above a generalized method to estimate pmp based on the wmo approach for storm maximization and transposition has been developed for the province of québec cehq and snc lavalin 2003 using storms that have occurred over eastern canada i e maritimes québec and ontario provinces the method referred to as the snc method relies on the use of diagrams tables and graphs to generate pmp estimates for a specific region table 5 compares spring and summer fall pmp estimates average values from the snc method and the approach used in this study table 5 indicates that using the crcm data may be underestimating the pmp relative to estimates of the pmp using observations of major storms again since the true value of the pmp cannot be assessed a part of the observed difference may be attributed to an overestimation of the pmp using the snc method and or to an underestimation with the crcm approach estimates of the pmf should therefore be interpreted with caution the pmp approach used here avoids the need to put an upper bound on the maximization ratios recommended in the original wmo approach since the calculation of the maximization ratios is based on using atmospheric variables closely related to storm formation the proposed approach is deemed more suitable for climate change studies figs 4 7 present the temporal evolution of the pmp and pmf from the reference period to future 2041 2070 time horizon respectively for the summer fall and spring seasons as a warmer atmosphere has an increased capacity to hold water vapor one expects the pmp to increase with climate change figs 4 and 6 confirm that the pmp increases over time for the three studied watersheds as explained above the computed pmf also changes from the control period to future time horizons and the direction of the changes is closely related to interactions between the pmp and soil moisture for summer fall pmf and s100 and t100 events for spring pmf used in the hydrological modeling process moreover trend analyses offer the advantage that uncertainties due to the model structure climate and hydrology are minimized therefore we believe that the results presented in this study provide a plausible evolution of the pmf due to climate change for instance our study showed that the average increase in the spring pmf using pmp and s100 sc1 was 8 and 11 between the 1961 1990 and the 2041 2070 time horizon respectively for the moisie and great whale watersheds clavet gaumont et al 2017 also used sc1 and obtained an 11 increase for the manic 5 watershed geographically located between the moisie and the great whale watersheds as mentioned above a decreasing trend in the summer fall pmp was obtained for two climate scenarios afx afx and agw ahb see table 2 over the moisie watershed a decrease in pmp as the atmosphere is warming appears counterintuitive and additional analyses should be conducted before reaching definitive conclusions as to the temporal trend obtained in the watersheds as it may be related to climate model structure more specifically one cause may be related to the trends in extreme precipitation and or maximization ratios produced by or derived from the crcm as the climate shifts fig 9 shows the summer fall extreme precipitation events that led to the pmp values as expected there is a general increasing trend for extreme events which was also found by others e g mailhot et al 2007 this means that the maximization ratio of eq 1 is decreasing in the future at least for those two climate models in the moisie watershed whether such trends are expected remains to be confirmed however as the atmospheric moisture holding capacity increases with increasing air temperature the trend for the maximization ratio can theoretically decrease or increase indeed the maximization ratio is composed of two variables maximum precipitable water and actual precipitable water maximum precipitable water the numerator in the maximization ratio is likely to increase in the future as air temperature rises clark 1987 kunkel et al 2013 it is limited by an upper bound for a given temperature corresponding to atmospheric saturation for example this upper bound for the gulf coast in the usa was found to be 75 mm in the past 50 years for the summer season kunkel et al 2013 an increase of the actual precipitable water is also a possibility in the future because the atmospheric capacity to hold water vapor increases with warmer temperatures however depending on the magnitude of this increase relative to a corresponding increase of the maximum precipitable water the net effect could be either a rise or a reduction of the maximization ratio it is therefore the combination of both trends extreme precipitation events and maximization ratios in eq 1 that can result in either an increasing or a decreasing trend in future pmp klein et al 2016 analyzed climate change influence on the maximization ratio for two watersheds in the province of quebec they found that the number of crcm tiles with maximization ratio exceeding 2 5 set as an upper limit decreases in the future this can be interpreted as an overall reduction of the maximization ratio this also raises a question about the validity of eq 1 for estimating pmp for example convective activities in north america are expected to increase in future climate scenarios paquin et al 2014 therefore the occurrence of convective rainfall of increased severity is more likely averaged cape for all simulations shows that cape increased by 68 51 and 52 in the future for the chaudière moisie and great whale watersheds respectively yet severe convective storms can be sustained with moderate precipitable water values as they are fed by atmospheric convective activity during rainfall this process is not taken into account by the moisture maximization pmp estimation method as described by eq 1 the validity of eq 1 has been challenged with the conclusion that the linear relationship in this equation does not hold in some cases abbs 1999 to resolve this issue attempts were made to estimate pmp using numerical weather models ohara et al 2011 although not constrained by assumptions such as in eq 1 output of these models is not necessarily pmp but rather maximum precipitation mp as its calculation is deterministic and based on boundary conditions fed to the model representing extreme atmospheric conditions leading to severe storms results from this research show that there are multiple factors that influence the pmf values in watersheds dominated by snow processes the great whale watershed which is the largest in terms of surface area has a smaller spring pmf value compared to the moisie watershed this is because the spring pmp and s100 in the moisie watershed are larger by up to 24 and 31 respectively and the melt is occurring faster since the watershed is located at a lower latitude than great whale therefore the surface area alone is not necessarily the major contributor to the pmf value a similar conclusion was reported for asian watersheds bao quang and laituri 2013 finally one may argue that 48 or even 72 h pmp events should have been selected to estimate pmf in this study as larger watersheds usually demand longer pmp duration indeed in designing hydraulic structures such as dam spillways the optimal duration of pmp should be the one which produces the largest pmf which is linked to watershed area however the goal of this paper is not producing pmf values to be used for design purposes but rather to investigate how pmf is expected to change as the climate shifts therefore we believe that the choice of a 24 h pmp event to compute its corresponding pmf event is justified in this context note that in a research by beauchamp et al 2013 who used 24 to 72 h summer pmp events to calculate corresponding pmf on the manicouagan river watershed in québec which is of similar size of the larger watershed used in our study their authors actually obtained a smaller 72 h pmf as compared to the 48 h event as the larger magnitude of the storm was distributed over a longer duration reinforcing the hypothesis that an optimal pmp duration will produce the largest pmf value of a given watershed 6 conclusion in this paper the influence of climate change on pmp and pmf for three northern watersheds with different climate and physiographic characteristics was studied the watersheds are located in southern central and northern regions of the province of québec canada to simulate climate change conditions projected climate data of seven simulations using the crcm model with different gcm forcings ghg emission scenarios and initial conditions were used providing climate data that include daily precipitation temperature specific humidity cape and swe with a spatial resolution of 45 km pmp for two time horizons 1961 1990 and 2041 2070 were estimated through a deterministic approach based on the wmo and adapted to climate change impact studies by rouhani and leconte 2016 the pmp values were estimated for two different seasons summer fall and spring which produced two pmf values based on the results the spring pmf was found to be larger than the summer fall pmf for all watersheds and all time horizons therefore the all season pmf should be estimated from spring scenarios the spring pmf in the chaudière watershed located in southern québec would increase by 3 in the future time horizon while in the moisie and great whale watersheds respectively located in central and northern québec an 8 and 11 increase were obtained for these two respective watersheds scenario 1 the magnitude of the trends is closely tied to the interactions between the pmp s100 and temperature time series used to melt the snowpack the largest pmf is obtained for the moisie watershed although its surface area is much smaller than that of the great whale watershed finally these results were obtained using seven climate projections from the crcm while pmp appears to be underestimated along with an underestimation of the pmf the temporal trends are a reasonable indicator of future changes in spring pmf resulting from climate change finally this study did not consider all sources of uncertainty that may affect the results we considered uncertainties due to climate variability initial conditions and ghg scenarios however yet there are other sources of uncertainties for example only one regional climate model and one hydrological model were used including more models would help to quantify uncertainties due to downscaling many rcms and hydrological model structure parameters many hydrological models chen et al 2011 have demonstrated that downscaling techniques may introduce significant uncertainty in estimating spring peak flow and by extension pmf also the swat hydrological model uses a simplified snow melt routine based on the temperature index method and also calculates flow at a daily time step having other models with a diversity of snowmelt equations and sub daily time steps would allow investigating their effect on spring peak flows as in chen et al 2011 and therefore assessing model uncertainty on spring pmf

7312,stream and groundwater interactions play an essential role in regulating flow temperature and water quality for stream ecosystems temperature gradients have been used to quantify vertical water movement in the streambed since the 1960s but advancements in thermal methods are still possible seepage runs are a method commonly used to quantify exchange rates through a series of streamflow measurements but can be labor and time intensive the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a thermal equilibrium method as a technique for quantifying groundwater flux using monitored stream water temperature at a single point and readily available hydrological and atmospheric data our primary assumption was that stream water temperature at the monitored point was at thermal equilibrium with the combination of all heat transfer processes including mixing with groundwater by expanding the monitored stream point into a hypothetical horizontal one dimensional thermal modeling domain we were able to simulate the thermal equilibrium achieved with known atmospheric variables at the point and quantify unknown groundwater flux by calibrating the model to the resulting temperature signature stream water temperatures were monitored at single points at nine streams in the ozark highland ecoregion and five reaches of the kiamichi river to estimate groundwater fluxes using the thermal equilibrium method when validated by comparison with seepage runs performed at the same time and reach estimates from the two methods agreed with each other with an r2 of 0 94 a root mean squared error rmse of 0 08 m d and a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 93 in conclusion the thermal equilibrium method was a suitable technique for quantifying groundwater flux with minimal cost

the importance of groundwater to stream biota has led to increased efforts to quantify the effects of groundwater on both stream temperatures constantz 1998 and energy sources barlocher and murdoch

from air temperature with a 1 5 month time lag as recommended by pluhowski 1970 fig 3 the air temperature offset assumed in this research allows easy application of the tem alternatively practitioners can measure or estimate gw temperatures using a method of their choice and utilize those data in the tem methodology measuring local groundwater temperatures can allow the consideration of more local conditions also note that the length and number of segments constructed in the model did not physically represent the monitored point but served only as a model domain that allowed the model to stabilize 2 2 study areas to validate the tem by comparison with seepage runs i e streamflow measurements five sampling reaches were chosen on the kiamichi river fig 4 the kiamichi river watershed in southeast oklahoma has an area of about 4 800 km2 with elevation ranging from 270 to 810 m pyron et al 1998 the sedimentary rocks of the area have been deformed into tightly folding anticlines and synclines forming steep east west trending ridges separated by a broad and flat bottomed stream valley the area was expected to have substantial groundwater storage potential as well as permeability to allow stream and groundwater interactions nine additional sampling reaches were located on different streams in the springfield plateau in the ozark highland ecoregion of missouri arkansas and oklahoma fig 4 the springfield plateau comprises the southwest portion of the ozark plateau with an area of approximately 26 700 km2 including parts of west central and southwest missouri northeast oklahoma southeast kansas and northern arkansas adamski et al 1995 elevations range from 300 to 520 m with mostly gentle topographic relief except for eureka springs escarpment that separates the springfield and salem plateaus adamski et al 1995 nigh and schroeder 2002 the limestone bedrock in the region is intermittently soluble producing regionally abundant sinkholes springs and caves nigh and schroeder 2002 the springfield plateau overlies the ozark plateau aquifer system which extends throughout southern missouri eastern oklahoma southeast kansas and a large area of northwest arkansas miller and appel 1997 extending sites to the ozark highlands allowed us to test the tem on streams with higher expected groundwater contributions due to the predominant karst topography all of the study sites were chosen for near natural flow characteristics examination of the study reaches in a gis showed that most of the reaches were near small farm ponds 1 km some of the reaches were relatively near household water wells 200 300 m and one reach contained a permitted surface water irrigation diversion although it was unlikely to be active during the winter when the seepage run and temperature monitoring were conducted none had instream impoundments 2 3 incremental streamflow method seepage runs seepage runs were performed at each site to validate the tem fig 1 table 2 reaches were selected from candidate streams without flow contributions from tributary streams or major springs once identified each reach was divided into three to five transects separated by 200 500 m fig 1 table 2 discharge at each transect was measured with a riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler current profiler sontek san diego ca hereafter adcp the enhanced density of transects per reach was established to achieve a smaller spatial scale which more closely matched the model setup used in the tem while maintaining accurate groundwater flux estimation in consideration of instrument accuracy error 0 015 m3 s at each reach the adcp measured discharge at each transect was normalized for any flow changes detected at nearby usgs gauges during the sampling period to remove any temporal variation the normalized transect discharges were then regressed against the separation distance upstream to downstream with the slope of the regression representing the flux between the stream and groundwater for the specific reach rosenberry and labaugh 2008 each seepage run included a flow and transect measurement at each logger site that were used to describe the channel geometry and hydrology in the model the groundwater flux measurements were normalized by the streambed area i e stream length and average adcp transect width using ts measured instantaneously by the adcp the ts difference among transects within each seepage run was determined to be less than 2 c with this temperature variation likely due to diurnal temperature variations 2 4 stream temperature and atmospheric time series temperature loggers hobo water temp pro v2 were placed in the thalweg at each of the selected reaches hourly averaged ts readings were recorded over a 15 d period in september 2016 on the kiamichi river and june and december 2016 in the ozark streams those times covered an extended low flow period without any significant precipitation event in the shallow ozark streams the loggers were placed at a depth between 0 3 and 1 m and 1 0 to 1 5 m in the deeper kiamichi river a time series of air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity was obtained for each site from the nearest oklahoma mesonet site ocs 2016 with the largest distance from a stream site being approximately 35 km for the kiamichi river and approximately 40 km for the ozark streams the mesonet stations are automated and collect data at 5 min increments and reported an hourly average corresponding to the ts time series note that there was some regional variation from site to site table 3 but the variation was not substantial for the tem approach if users have meteorological data closer to their sites they can easily use that data in other words the tem approach should utilize the best available meteorological and hydrological data 2 5 statistical evaluation to validate the tem the fiteval software was used to evaluate the fit between groundwater fluxes measured from seepage runs and predicted by the tem fiteval is a software tool that uses procedures presented by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 to incorporate both data and model uncertainty into standardized model evaluation fiteval conducts model evaluations using a combination of graphical illustrations absolute value error statistics root mean square error rmse and normalized goodness of fit statistics nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse bias corrected confidence intervals were calculated based on approximated probability distributions derived from bootstrapping followed by hypothesis test results of the indicators helping to reduce subjectivity in the interpretation of the model performance ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 tem versus seepage runs model validation suggested that tem was a suitable technique for estimating groundwater flux into streams the groundwater flux into the streams measured via seepage runs ranged from 0 01 to 1 09 m d and from 0 00 to 0 95 m d with the tem table 4 as expected given the underlying geology the estimated groundwater flux at the ozark sites was generally higher than the flux at the kiamichi sites the resulting rmse and nse for the tem fit to the seepage run data from fiteval were 0 08 m d and 0 93 respectively and indicated a very good fit linear regression analysis suggested a uniform variance across the range of estimates with an r2 of 0 94 fig 5 however the tem tended to under predict the seepage run flux estimates by 5 7 fig 5 an example continuous application of the tem at a weekly time scale is shown in fig 6 for one of the sites the corresponding groundwater flux estimated by the seepage run is also shown in the figure deviations are to be expected between the two measurements the seepage run represents a spatially integrated flux estimate over a small temporal scale 2 h whereas the tem represented a temporally integrated flux estimate of a small spatial scale more specifically during a seepage run locally alternating gaining and losing sections of the stream are integrated into this spatially integrated measurement these two estimates were similar suggesting that the groundwater flux into these streams may not vary widely over the approximately 1 5 km of stream length or the 15 d time period used in this study also the seepage runs measured the net groundwater exchange if the groundwater discharge along a reach was exactly balanced with the groundwater recharge then the net change of streamflow would not be detected the tem method however will quantify the groundwater inflow because it generates a temperature signal this difference may explain situations when the tem method overestimated the groundwater flux compared to that measured during the seepage runs e g kiamichi river future research should examine the prediction from tem further by comparison against estimates derived from other methods at different times of the year and with temporal scales that align better with tem other than the groundwater flux the expanded domain length was the only model parameter not represented by measurements therefore it was important to examine that parameter and its influence on the groundwater flux results the model domain in the tem was a 2 km conceptual stream reach composed of twenty segments of 100 m each to test the effect of model domain length groundwater flux for spavinaw creek in northwest arkansas was estimated with tem using alternate total domain lengths of 0 2 and 20 km each with twenty equal length segments the estimated groundwater fluxes indicated by the minimum of sse between the upstream and downstream boundaries were identical for the 0 2 and 2 km domains but larger for the 20 km domain this is likely due to the accumulation of groundwater flux over an extended simulation distance that significantly changed the heat capacity of the stream for example at spavinaw creek the average flow rate was 2 m3 s and the total estimated groundwater flux accumulation over a 2 km model domain was 0 1 m3 s a difference that is unlikely to significantly change the energy balance of the stream in contrast the total groundwater flux accumulation over a 20 km model domain was 1 0 m3 s with the same rate of groundwater flux an increase that greatly affected the stream heat capacity since the design of the model domain also affects runtime some test runs with different domain dimensions may be helpful to balance accuracy and processing time the temperature module of wasp applied the given thermal and stream parameters sequentially to each segment using a variable internal time step to reach satisfactory convergence for the test simulations mentioned above the run time of the 0 2 km model domain extended to over an hour whereas the 2 km domain took only 7 10 min this was likely due to the extra iterations required for time dependent thermal processes to converge in the reduced length of the smaller domain 3 2 where is tem applicable due to the one dimensional nature of the temperature model used in tem the method was most appropriate for shallow well mixed streams that were unlikely to exhibit stratified zones of temperature or flow a groundwater temperature signature defined as the temperature difference between tae and te caused by groundwater flux was required for the tem to predict effectively streams with low flow and no groundwater flux tend to equilibrate at a high temperature during warm weather conditions te tae in contrast streams with groundwater flux cooler than stream water equilibrate at a lower temperature during warm weather conditions te tae causing a temperature signature that could be used to quantify groundwater flux through tem however groundwater recharge i e losing streams would not result in a similar temperature signature and thus could not be quantified by the tem similarly when ts approximate groundwater temperatures during certain times of the year fig 3 briggs et al 2016 kurylyk et al 2016 the temperature signature of the groundwater flux would be difficult to detect therefore the tem is most effective where the temperature signature of groundwater flux is strong i e gaining reaches and seasons when groundwater temperatures deviate from ts nevertheless the change in heat capacity caused by the loss or addition of stream water volume will lead to an altered ts temporal variance future research with higher data precision may be able to identify the altered ts variance and use it to quantify groundwater interactions similarly to tem to improve the robustness of the thermal equilibrium assumption it is important to consider the location of the ts monitoring point and the sampling duration when groundwater flux changes gradually stream water remains at thermal equilibrium and therefore ts te fig 7 in contrast upwelling zones where there would be an abrupt change in groundwater flux would cause a loss of thermal equilibrium that recovers over some downstream distance ts te groundwater flux estimates made at any point at thermal equilibrium represented the true magnitude of groundwater flux into the stream at that point estimates made at points where thermal equilibrium is recovering would yield an inaccurate groundwater flux because the ts does not meet the primary assumption of the tem although an investigator is unlikely to have prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of groundwater interactions in a particular stream it would be advantageous to avoid placing temperature loggers at locations with drastically varying temperatures moreover based on previous research we suggest that at least one week of ts time series should be collected for the thermal equilibrium assumption to be met bogan et al 2003 4 conclusions the tem proposed in this research has several advantages to researchers interested in characterizing stream and groundwater interactions as long as the primary assumptions of the approach are met with this approach only ts is needed at a single point to monitor groundwater flux this can also potentially add significant value to ts data typically collected in stream biology studies hawkins et al 1997 and ts data are readily available at a number of usgs gage locations although a minimum of one week of ts data is recommended to satisfy the thermal equilibrium assumption bogan et al 2003 the tem can be used to estimate groundwater flux at any temporal scale coarser than one week i e monthly seasonally or yearly similarly the proposed method has the potential to economically quantify spatial differences in groundwater fluxes at multiple stream points or to create a flux estimate for a large area if applied in an array the main limitation of the tem is that it requires a detectable and equilibrated temperature signature of groundwater flux another weakness of the method and one that it shares with other model approaches is that the precision of groundwater flux is heavily dependent on the availability and quality of the input data our study utilized atmospheric and solar radiation data from the oklahoma mesonet however similar systems exist or are being installed in other many other states finally the approach performs best in well mixed shallow streams because those conditions most closely match the one dimensional model structure acknowledgements this research is a contribution

7312,stream and groundwater interactions play an essential role in regulating flow temperature and water quality for stream ecosystems temperature gradients have been used to quantify vertical water movement in the streambed since the 1960s but advancements in thermal methods are still possible seepage runs are a method commonly used to quantify exchange rates through a series of streamflow measurements but can be labor and time intensive the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a thermal equilibrium method as a technique for quantifying groundwater flux using monitored stream water temperature at a single point and readily available hydrological and atmospheric data our primary assumption was that stream water temperature at the monitored point was at thermal equilibrium with the combination of all heat transfer processes including mixing with groundwater by expanding the monitored stream point into a hypothetical horizontal one dimensional thermal modeling domain we were able to simulate the thermal equilibrium achieved with known atmospheric variables at the point and quantify unknown groundwater flux by calibrating the model to the resulting temperature signature stream water temperatures were monitored at single points at nine streams in the ozark highland ecoregion and five reaches of the kiamichi river to estimate groundwater fluxes

conditions also note that the length and number of segments constructed in the model did not physically represent the monitored point but served only as a model domain that allowed the model to stabilize 2 2 study areas to validate the tem by comparison with seepage runs i e streamflow measurements five sampling reaches were chosen on the kiamichi river fig 4 the kiamichi river watershed in southeast oklahoma has an area of about 4 800 km2 with elevation ranging from 270 to 810 m pyron et al 1998 the sedimentary rocks of the area have been deformed into tightly folding anticlines and synclines forming steep east west trending ridges separated by a broad and flat bottomed stream valley the area was expected to have substantial groundwater storage potential as well as permeability to allow stream and groundwater interactions nine additional sampling reaches were located on different streams in the springfield plateau in the ozark highland ecoregion of missouri arkansas and oklahoma fig 4 the springfield plateau comprises the southwest portion of the ozark plateau with an area of approximately 26 700 km2 including parts of west central and southwest missouri northeast oklahoma southeast kansas and northern arkansas adamski et al 1995 elevations range from 300 to 520 m with mostly gentle topographic relief except for eureka springs escarpment that separates the springfield and salem plateaus adamski et al 1995 nigh and schroeder 2002 the limestone bedrock in the region is intermittently soluble producing regionally abundant sinkholes springs and caves nigh and schroeder 2002 the springfield plateau overlies the ozark plateau aquifer system which extends throughout southern missouri eastern oklahoma southeast kansas and a large area of northwest arkansas miller and appel 1997 extending sites to the ozark highlands allowed us to test the tem on streams with higher expected groundwater contributions due to the predominant karst topography all of the study sites were chosen for near natural flow characteristics examination of the study reaches in a gis showed that most of the reaches were near small farm ponds 1 km some of the reaches were relatively near household water wells 200 300 m and one reach contained a permitted surface water irrigation diversion although it was unlikely to be active during the winter when the seepage run and temperature monitoring were conducted none had instream impoundments 2 3 incremental streamflow method seepage runs seepage runs were performed at each site to validate the tem fig 1 table 2 reaches were selected from candidate streams without flow contributions from tributary streams or major springs once identified each reach was divided into three to five transects separated by 200 500 m fig 1 table 2 discharge at each transect was measured with a riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler current profiler sontek san diego ca hereafter adcp the enhanced density of transects per reach was established to achieve a smaller spatial scale which more closely matched the model setup used in the tem while maintaining accurate groundwater flux estimation in consideration of instrument accuracy error 0 015 m3 s at each reach the adcp measured discharge at each transect was normalized for any flow changes detected at nearby usgs gauges during the sampling period to remove any temporal variation the normalized transect discharges were then regressed against the separation distance upstream to downstream with the slope of the regression representing the flux between the stream and groundwater for the specific reach rosenberry and labaugh 2008 each seepage run included a flow and transect measurement at each logger site that were used to describe the channel geometry and hydrology in the model the groundwater flux measurements were normalized by the streambed area i e stream length and average adcp transect width using ts measured instantaneously by the adcp the ts difference among transects within each seepage run was determined to be less than 2 c with this temperature variation likely due to diurnal temperature variations 2 4 stream temperature and atmospheric time series temperature loggers hobo water temp pro v2 were placed in the thalweg at each of the selected reaches hourly averaged ts readings were recorded over a 15 d period in september 2016 on the kiamichi river and june and december 2016 in the ozark streams those times covered an extended low flow period without any significant precipitation event in the shallow ozark streams the loggers were placed at a depth between 0 3 and 1 m and 1 0 to 1 5 m in the deeper kiamichi river a time series of air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity was obtained for each site from the nearest oklahoma mesonet site ocs 2016 with the largest distance from a stream site being approximately 35 km for the kiamichi river and approximately 40 km for the ozark streams the mesonet stations are automated and collect data at 5 min increments and reported an hourly average corresponding to the ts time series note that there was some regional variation from site to site table 3 but the variation was not substantial for the tem approach if users have meteorological data closer to their sites they can easily use that data in other words the tem approach should utilize the best available meteorological and hydrological data 2 5 statistical evaluation to validate the tem the fiteval software was used to evaluate the fit between groundwater fluxes measured from seepage runs and predicted by the tem fiteval is a software tool that uses procedures presented by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 to incorporate both data and model uncertainty into standardized model evaluation fiteval conducts model evaluations using a combination of graphical illustrations absolute value error statistics root mean square error rmse and normalized goodness of fit statistics nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse bias corrected confidence intervals were calculated based on approximated probability distributions derived from bootstrapping followed by hypothesis test results of the indicators helping to reduce subjectivity in the interpretation of the model performance ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 tem versus seepage runs model validation suggested that tem was a suitable technique for estimating groundwater flux into streams the groundwater flux into the streams measured via seepage runs ranged from 0 01 to 1 09 m d and from 0 00 to 0 95 m d with the tem table 4 as expected given the underlying geology the estimated groundwater flux at the ozark sites was generally higher than the flux at the kiamichi sites the resulting rmse and nse for the tem fit to the seepage run data from fiteval were 0 08 m d and 0 93 respectively and indicated a very good fit linear regression analysis suggested a uniform variance across the range of estimates with an r2 of 0 94 fig 5 however the tem tended to under predict the seepage run flux estimates by 5 7 fig 5 an example continuous application of the tem at a weekly time scale is shown in fig 6 for one of the sites the corresponding groundwater flux estimated by the seepage run is also shown in the figure deviations are to be expected between the two measurements the seepage run represents a spatially integrated flux estimate over a small temporal scale 2 h whereas the tem represented a temporally integrated flux estimate of a small spatial scale more specifically during a seepage run locally alternating gaining and losing sections of the stream are integrated into this spatially integrated measurement these two estimates were similar suggesting that the groundwater flux into these streams may not vary widely over the approximately 1 5 km of stream length or the 15 d time period used in this study also the seepage runs measured the net groundwater exchange if the groundwater discharge along a reach was exactly balanced with the groundwater recharge then the net change of streamflow would not be detected the tem method however will quantify the groundwater inflow because it generates a temperature signal this difference may explain situations when the tem method overestimated the groundwater flux compared to that measured during the seepage runs e g kiamichi river future research should examine the prediction from tem further by comparison against estimates derived from other methods at different times of the year and with temporal scales that align better with tem other than the groundwater flux the expanded domain length was the only model parameter not represented by measurements therefore it was important to examine that parameter and its influence on the groundwater flux results the model domain in the tem was a 2 km conceptual stream reach composed of twenty segments of 100 m each to test the effect of model domain length groundwater flux for spavinaw creek in northwest arkansas was estimated with tem using alternate total domain lengths of 0 2 and 20 km each with twenty equal length segments the estimated groundwater fluxes indicated by the minimum of sse between the upstream and downstream boundaries were identical for the 0 2 and 2 km domains but larger for the 20 km domain this is likely due to the accumulation of groundwater flux over an extended simulation distance that significantly changed the heat capacity of the stream for example at spavinaw creek the average flow rate was 2 m3 s and the total estimated groundwater flux accumulation over a 2 km model domain was 0 1 m3 s a difference that is unlikely to significantly change the energy balance of the stream in contrast the total groundwater flux accumulation over a 20 km model domain was 1 0 m3 s with the same rate of groundwater flux an increase that greatly affected the stream heat capacity since the design of the model domain also affects runtime some test runs with different domain dimensions may be helpful to balance accuracy and processing time the temperature module of wasp applied the given thermal and stream parameters sequentially to each segment using a variable internal time step to reach satisfactory convergence for the test simulations mentioned above the run time of the 0 2 km model domain extended to over an hour whereas the 2 km domain took only 7 10 min this was likely due to the extra iterations required for time dependent thermal processes to converge in the reduced length of the smaller domain 3 2 where is tem applicable due to the one dimensional nature of the temperature model used in tem the method was most appropriate for shallow well mixed streams that were unlikely to exhibit stratified zones of temperature or flow a groundwater temperature signature defined as the temperature difference between tae and te caused by groundwater flux was required for the tem to predict effectively streams with low flow and no groundwater flux tend to equilibrate at a high temperature during warm weather conditions te tae in contrast streams with groundwater flux cooler than stream water equilibrate at a lower temperature during warm weather conditions te tae causing a temperature signature that could be used to quantify groundwater flux through tem however groundwater recharge i e losing streams would not result in a similar temperature signature and thus could not be quantified by the tem similarly when ts approximate groundwater temperatures during certain times of the year fig 3 briggs et al 2016 kurylyk et al 2016 the temperature signature of the groundwater flux would be difficult to detect therefore the tem is most effective where the temperature signature of groundwater flux is strong i e gaining reaches and seasons when groundwater temperatures deviate from ts nevertheless the change in heat capacity caused by the loss or addition of stream water volume will lead to an altered ts temporal variance future research with higher data precision may be able to identify the altered ts variance and use it to quantify groundwater interactions similarly to tem to improve the robustness of the thermal equilibrium assumption it is important to consider the location of the ts monitoring point and the sampling duration when groundwater flux changes gradually stream water remains at thermal equilibrium and therefore ts te fig 7 in contrast upwelling zones where there would be an abrupt change in groundwater flux would cause a loss of thermal equilibrium that recovers over some downstream distance ts te groundwater flux estimates made at any point at thermal equilibrium represented the true magnitude of groundwater flux into the stream at that point estimates made at points where thermal equilibrium is recovering would yield an inaccurate groundwater flux because the ts does not meet the primary assumption of the tem although an investigator is unlikely to have prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of groundwater interactions in a particular stream it would be advantageous to avoid placing temperature loggers at locations with drastically varying temperatures moreover based on previous research we suggest that at least one week of ts time series should be collected for the thermal equilibrium assumption to be met bogan et al 2003 4 conclusions the tem proposed in this research has several advantages to researchers interested in characterizing stream and groundwater interactions as long as the primary assumptions of the approach are met with this approach only ts is needed at a single point to monitor groundwater flux this can also potentially add significant value to ts data typically collected in stream biology studies hawkins et al 1997 and ts data are readily available at a number of usgs gage locations although a minimum of one week of ts data is recommended to satisfy the thermal equilibrium assumption bogan et al 2003 the tem can be used to estimate groundwater flux at any temporal scale coarser than one week i e monthly seasonally or yearly similarly the proposed method has the potential to economically quantify spatial differences in groundwater fluxes at multiple stream points or to create a flux estimate for a large area if applied in an array the main limitation of the tem is that it requires a detectable and equilibrated temperature signature of groundwater flux another weakness of the method and one that it shares with other model approaches is that the precision of groundwater flux is heavily dependent on the availability and quality of the input data our study utilized atmospheric and solar radiation data from the oklahoma mesonet however similar systems exist or are being installed in other many other states finally the approach performs best in well mixed shallow streams because those conditions most closely match the one dimensional model structure acknowledgements this research is a contribution

7313,sediment connectivity has been shown in recent years to explain how the watershed configuration controls sediment transport however we find no studies develop a watershed erosion modeling framework based on sediment connectivity and few if any studies have quantified sediment connectivity for gently rolling systems we develop a new predictive sediment connectivity model that relies on the intersecting probabilities for sediment supply detachment transport and buffers to sediment transport which is integrated in a watershed erosion model framework the model predicts sediment flux temporally and spatially across a watershed using field reconnaissance results a high resolution digital elevation models a hydrologic model and shear based erosion formulae model results validate the capability of the model to predict erosion pathways causing sediment connectivity more notably disconnectivity dominates the gently rolling watershed across all morphologic levels of the uplands including microtopography from low energy undulating surfaces across the landscape swales and gullies only active in the highest events karst sinkholes that disconnect drainage areas and floodplains that de couple the hillslopes from the stream corridor results show that sediment connectivity is predicted for about 2 or more the watershed s area 37 days of the year with the remaining days showing very little or no connectivity only 12 8 0 7 of the gently rolling watershed shows sediment connectivity on the wettest day of the study year results also highlight the importance of urban suburban sediment pathways in gently rolling watersheds and dynamic and longitudinal distributions of sediment connectivity might be further investigated in future work we suggest the method herein provides the modeler with an added tool to account for sediment transport criteria and has the potential to reduce computational costs in watershed erosion modeling keywords sediment transport stochastic watershed scale disconnectivity 1 introduction watershed erosion modeling aims to simulate sediment flux in a basin to discern impacts of sediment loss on landscape practices and sediment impacts on stream biology reservoir water supply and water quality morris and fan 2009 usepa 2004 however quantifying watershed erosion has proven precarious due to spatially diverse landscapes that can buffer and disconnect sediment pathways fryirs 2013 we argue sediment connectivity theory provides a meaningful concept to elucidate the role of the watershed configuration and advance watershed erosion modeling especially in light of now often available high resolution digital elevation models our motivation was to develop a probability based theory of sediment connectivity that may be integrated within continuous based watershed erosion simulations we apply our modeling framework with the intent to gain knowledge of sediment disconnectivity in gently rolling terrains which are understudied currently there is a need to advance watershed erosion models within the water resources community substantial advancement of watershed erosion modeling over the past four decades results from the intensive field data collection systems and experimental watersheds of the 1970s and 1980s the coupled hydrologic formulae advancement of the 1980s and the computational and geospatial data advancements of the 1990s and 2000s walling 1983 merritt et al 2003 mahoney 2017 researchers and practitioners now have watershed erosion modeling platforms that are often freely available and can be readily applied however current watershed models often do not explicitly account for the three dimensional spatial complexity of the landscape and its dynamic nature when predicting erosion and routing of sediment the advanced ability of our current computational environment allows parameterization of watershed erosion models that shifts the physical based functions within the models away from the inputs and parameters for which the equations were originally designed often the governing erosion formulae providing the basis of the watershed model is one or a few assumed erosion processes e g plot scale sheet flow extrapolating these processes to the entire watershed surface produces an empirically parameterized model assuming sufficient verification data in which the modeler produces a posterior solution space that may not reflect the sediment detachment and transport occurring across the uplands in this case the modeler neglects the three dimensional and temporally dynamic landscape presently we detail a promising approach to help overcome spatial complexity limitations and advance watershed erosion modeling by coupling erosion formulae with sediment connectivity using high resolution spatial data we argue the time is ripe to advance watershed erosion modeling by improving its spatiotemporal context for several reasons highly resolved topographic datasets are often freely available making incorporation of such data into watershed platforms feasible also geomorphologic field based and geospatial based investigation have been advanced in recent years to focus on the topic of sediment connectivity sediment connectivity is a contemporary term that we define similarly to bracken et al 2015 as the integrated detachment and transport of sediment from source to sink between geomorphic zones of a watershed while the term is contemporary we recognize general concern for how erosion zones are connected to the stream channel i e sediment delivery has been studied for the past 60 years e g maner and barnes 1953 glymph 1954 schumm 1954 if not earlier the contemporary definition of sediment connectivity has evolved from several bodies of sediment transport and geomorphologic literature one body of literature is research focused on the sediment delivery ratio which was developed in the 1950s and 60s by maner and barnes 1953 roehl 1962 and studied extensively thereafter a second body of literature is the work by schumm 1977 and researchers thereafter which conceptually compartmentalizes zones of the watershed by their respective dominance of sediment production transfer and deposition this work led to numerous studies assessing sediment source to channel delivery at various scales e g ferguson 1981 roberts and church 1986 knighton 1989 brunsden 1993 harvey 1996 michaelides and wainwright 2002 the third body of literature is general connectivity theory which is defined as the transfer of matter between two landscape compartments or throughout an entire system chorley and kennedy 1971 general connectivity theory was further developed by ecologists e g taylor et al 1993 pringle 2003 until adopted by geomorphologists to describe the hydrologic connection of geomorphologic compartments the contemporary idea of sediment connectivity has evolved by synthesizing the above literature bodies contemporary sediment connectivity aims to identify the watershed s configuration and its role within the sediment continuum including the stores and sinks of sediment the pathways of sediment detachment and transport and the morphologic features disconnecting the pathways of sediment transport during hydrologic events fryirs et al 2007 jain and tandon 2010 to work towards solving the sediment delivery problem walling 1983 contemporary sediment connectivity gained popularity in the early and mid 2000s through conceptual work from researchers such as hooke 2003 brierley et al 2006 fryirs et al 2007 bracken and croke 2007 and bracken et al 2015 and was extended to morphological budgeting croke et al 2013 and morphometric analysis marchamalo et al 2016 current application of sediment connectivity includes index based empirical and process based analyses e g borselli et al 2008 messenzehl et al 2014 liu and fu 2016 masselink et al 2016 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 sediment connectivity is implicit within empirical models such as the sediment delivery ratio but as identified by many researchers e g walling 1983 bracken and croke 2007 fryirs 2013 these historic sediment models lack integration of the complex physical processes governing sediment erosion transport and deposition due to spatial and temporal lumping sediment connectivity is now recognized to be a major control on sediment budgets fryirs et al 2007 but has seldom taken precedence in quantitative sediment transport models ambroise 2004 de vente et al 2005 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 we suggest sediment connectivity s emphasis on the watershed s configuration provides a meaningful descriptive and topologic concept for integrating within watershed erosion modeling numerous features of sediment connectivity including its emphasis on field assessment and geospatial modeling are attractive for advancing watershed erosion modeling field assessment of the watershed s morphology provides the foundation of sediment connectivity theory and allows identification of features that may disconnect sediment pathways lacking inclusion in watershed modeling frameworks for example field assessments identify sediment transport buffers such as long flat floodplains that laterally disconnect hillslopes to the stream corridor fryirs 2013 spatially explicit modeling of the watershed via sediment connectivity models has the potential to reflect the actual three dimensional landscape to elucidate zones of active erosion and concentrated pathways of sediment transport cavalli et al 2013 thereafter researchers may apply erosion formulae typical of watershed models to active erosion zones and active contributing area of the watershed ambroise 2004 rather than extrapolating and calibrating formulae beyond their physical basis across the entire landscape we commend the pioneering and recent efforts of scientists to advance the theory and application of sediment connectivity e g fryirs et al 2007 borselli et al 2008 cavalli et al 2013 fryirs 2013 bracken et al 2015 souza et al 2016 which in turn provides a promising basis for improving watershed erosion models however we highlight several features of sediment connectivity theory requiring further development to allow integration with continuous based watershed erosion model simulations first previous sediment connectivity modeling has focused on one or a few factors controlling sediment transport in a watershed such as fryirs et al 2007 who focused on sediment dis connectivity and borselli et al 2008 who focused on upstream and downstream sediment transport a recent perspective article emphasizes the need to consider the many hydrologic and non hydrologic factors controlling sediment connectivity across a watershed bracken et al 2015 therefore our approach aims to extend sediment connectivity theory by developing a probabilistic framework that accounts for hydrologic and non hydrologic supply detachment transport and disconnectivity features second sediment connectivity is dynamic by its nature and varies temporally yet most models of sediment connectivity are static emphasizing physical connections in the landscape and do not capture dynamic features such as varying soil moisture conditions ambroise 2004 lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 fryirs 2013 therefore our approach aims to couple hydrologic connectivity within the watershed modeling framework to help elucidate the dynamic nature of sediment connectivity third we remind the reader that sediment connectivity alone does not provide erosive flux prediction bracken et al 2015 and therefore we couple their sediment connectivity theory with erosive formulae within the watershed modeling framework as a second contribution we advance knowledge of sediment disconnectivity for gently rolling watersheds most slopes of our study watershed are gentle or undulating although the steeper sections of complex hillslopes are classified as rolling in our system sims et al 1968 pp 58 usda 2017 pp 44 to highlight this idea we use the term gently rolling watershed which has been used previously concerning watersheds with similar terrain where fine sediment deposition occurs e g morris and fan 2009 and used extensively to describe our study region mcgrain 1983 and citations thereafter the upland morphology of gently rolling watersheds includes relatively stable land surfaces and ephemeral pathways jarrit and lawrence 2007 ford and fox 2014 mild gradients and fertile soils of gently rolling watersheds foster agricultural and suburban land uses which in turn further stabilizes the morphology of the sediment pathways and floodplains previous studies investigating sediment disconnectivity emphasize moderate and steep gradient systems e g fryirs et al 2007 borselli et al 2008 and gently rolling watersheds have been understudied the objective of the present research was twofold and includes i developing a watershed erosion model grounded in probability theory for sediment connectivity and ii investigating sediment connectivity and erosion within a gently rolling watershed we present a probabilistic based development of sediment connectivity that is general to the governing factors controlling sediment transport but can be tailored and parameterized for a watershed specific configuration we include the concept of dynamic connectivity of sediment transport by integrating hydrologic connectivity within a continuous based model simulation we use probability theory to develop a predictive model reliant upon the intersecting probabilities for sediment supply detachment transport and the absence of buffers the model predicts sediment flux temporally and spatially across the watershed using high resolution geospatial data field reconnaissance external modeling of hydrologic connectivity and erosion formulae we apply the model to a gently rolling watershed to fulfill our second objective 2 modeling framework and formulation the watershed erosion modeling framework includes geospatial field assessment and meteorological inputs that lead to three stages of model simulation to produce spatially and temporally explicit sediment connectivity and flux outputs see fig 1 high resolution geospatial data reflect the actual three dimensional landscape of the watershed inputs from field assessment identify features that may connect and disconnect sediment pathways across the watershed continuous precipitation and weather data provide information leading to the dynamic nature of the watershed s connectivity the first stage of modeling assists with simulating dynamic connectivity by integrating hydrologic connectivity within a continuous based model simulation for this stage we prescribe use of an off the shelf hydrologic model providing continuous simulation of soil moisture conditions and runoff depth across the watershed the second stage of modeling simulates the probability of sediment connectivity see fig 2 to estimate pathways and buffers impacting the delivery of sediment from the uplands to the stream corridor as a precursor to erosion rates and routing in stage three we express the intersecting probabilities of sediment supply detachment transport and the absence of buffers to produce the probability of sediment connectivity in fig 2 we specify the union of both hydrologic and non hydrologic processes mathematically we express the probability of sediment connectivity p c as 1 p c p s p d h d nh p t h t nh 1 p b where s denotes supply dh is hydrologic detachment dnh is non hydrologic detachment th is hydrologic transport tnh is non hydrologic transport and b is buffers the intersections and unions of probabilities via their multiplicative and summation definitions becomes 2 p c p s p d h p d nh p d h p d nh p t h p t nh p t h p t nh 1 p b the probability of sediment connectivity can be calculated when each process associated probability is known or can be estimated in the present study we take a boolean approach to eq 2 by modeling each geospatial grid cell represented across the landscape as having a probability of zero or one and then integration provides the watershed s net probability of sediment connectivity we keep eq 2 as general for the moment highlighting that future work could adopt a fuzzy or bayesian approach to the probabilities of each spatial cell several features of eq 2 require some elaboration as to their background and justification first we adopt a probabilistic definition of sediment connectivity because we recognize the stochastic nature of sediment transport across a heterogeneous landscape probability theory has long been a suitable approach to the sediment transport problem given the non uniformity of sediment size distributions the stochastic nature of turbulence and the heterogeneity of landscapes see examples of such studies in table 1 concerning sediment connectivity the probability approach is attractive because of its multiplicative ability to account for the many processes required for transport our approach reflects the ideas of borselli et al 2008 who defines the probability of connectivity as the probability that the landscape can transport sediment laterally and longitudinally in the fluvial network second the probability of sediment connectivity model reflects the necessity for co occurrence of sediment supply detachment and transport conditions as these processes are well known to potentially limit transport leopold et al 1964 third the model accepts the dynamic nature of the sediment transport controls e g jencso et al 2009 and thus couples with the stage one modeling fourth we include both non hydrologic connectivity i e connectivity caused by non fluvial processes and hydrologic connectivity given the recent realization of non hydrologic prevalence eolian transport landslides in some systems at some time scales see theory by bracken et al 2015 fifth we explicitly include the concept of disconnectivity via morphologic features and anthropogenic obstacles given the recent realization that buffers can create sediment disconnectivity fryirs et al 2007 fryirs 2013 the probability model in eq 2 may be applied for an entire watershed by using spatially explicit information across the landscape and thus reflects a distributed watershed modeling framework the output may be used to map erosion prone features and disconnected regions the output has specific utility in watershed erosion modeling because the probability of sediment connectivity for a hydrologic event is distributed spatially and can be integrated to estimate the active watershed area for sediment transport the third stage of modeling simulates erosion formulae for connected features and is tailored to the specific erosion processes known to exist in a watershed parameterization of the erosion formulae will vary depending on the timescale of intent the spatial scale reflecting the connected feature and the dominant sediment transport processes distributed across the upland landscape e g mass wasting fluvial erosion eolian transport outputs include both distributed soil loss and net sediment transport results we intend that the model may be verified via practical qualitative data of erosional features as well as quantitative data such that the model may be useful as a predictive tool in watershed studies 3 modeling application 3 1 study site we applied the model to the upper south elkhorn watershed 65 1 km2 located in the inner bluegrass physiographic region of kentucky usa see fig 3 the watershed has mixed land uses consisting of primarily agricultural lands 55 and urban areas 45 fry et al 2011 the watershed was chosen for model application because i past studies conducted in the watershed provide data results for calibration of modeling davis 2008 fox et al 2010 russo 2009 ford 2011 russo and fox 2012 ford 2014 ii on going data collection is conducted by the university of kentucky and the united states geological survey usgs and iii the proximity of the watershed to the university of kentucky headwaters of the south elkhorn creek originate in southwestern lexington kentucky within urban areas and the middle and lower watershed extends into agricultural pastureland gently rolling hills and relatively mild slopes characterize the land surface the stream channel is bedrock controlled with fine sediment deposits silt loams primarily make up the south elkhorn watershed s soil cover upland erosion occurs primarily through rill erosion and ephemeral gully erosion while diffusional erosion processes i e sheet and interrill erosion are a minor contribution to the overall sediment flux gumbert 2017 smallwood 2017 livestock and construction sites in the uplands exacerbate the detachment rates of sediment particles through the removal of protective vegetation and exposure to fluvial shear stresses evans 2017 the upper south elkhorn watershed is also characterized by long flat floodplains adjacent to the stream network air temperature ranges between on average 0 5 c in january to 24 5 c in july the average yearly rainfall for this region is 1148 mm the climate is classified as humid subtropical ulack et al 1998 the inner bluegrass region of kentucky usa is well recognized as exhibiting terrain with high karst potential thrailkill 1974 thrailkill et al 1991 phillips 2015 with the land surface showing depressions and sinkholes leading to springsheds based on analyses of geospatial data files and results published by taylor and nelson 2008 and the kentucky geological survey kgs 2017 the sub region of the south elkhorn watershed is immature karst terrain e g termed channel rich karst poor phillips et al 2004 relative to neighboring and nearby watersheds in the inner bluegrass for example the karst impacted drainage area of the south elkhorn watershed is very low 13 of the watershed drainage area see table 2 relative to other watersheds in the inner bluegrass region e g nearby watersheds show karst impacted drainage areas ranging from 26 to 99 see table 2 the result is highly consistent with past morphologic research in the inner bluegrass karst region where the landscape is organized into discrete local zones dominated by either karst or fluvial features to the near exclusion of the other phillips et al 2004 dye traces performed in the south elkhorn watershed have shown that existing sinkhole to spring flow pathways follow the same general pathways as topographic flowlines currens et al 2002 therefore we assume sediment pirated by sinkholes likely does not leave the watershed s topographic boundary nevertheless we realized the potential importance of the karst sinkhole to impart sediment disconnectivity hence we explicitly include the role of the karst terrain in watershed sediment connectivity modeling 3 2 field assessment geospatial data and hydrologic data a field assessment and geospatial analyses method was designed and carried out to identify sediment processes e g sheet rill and gully erosion instream sediment storage channel morphology and sediment disconnectivity the field method combined published methods to visually assess sediment in watersheds and streams including region specific methods nrcs 2009 rosgen 2001 usepa 1999 fryirs et al 2007 third rock consultants 2016 geospatial analyses of high resolution digital elevation models dems and orthophotos complimented the field work and were used to map karst sinkholes in the basin before field visits we created maps in arcgis version 10 4 1 showing the stream corridor surrounding land cover and tributaries we discretized reaches into sub reaches and spatially identified features for field inspection in the field we assessed connectivity of streambanks and floodplains the streambed upland hillslopes and tributaries we observed the density of vegetation surrounding the stream the structure of the banks and human infrastructure potentially influencing sediment transport we estimated channel bathymetry morphology and the type and depth of sediment stored in the streambed we assessed hillslope conditions through identification of the type of land use evidence of historic upland erosion and upland human interferences that may accelerate sediment transport via visual observations from within the stream network coupled with orthophotograph assessment we walked tributaries and noted bank angles heights bed material erosional hotspots and upstream land cover we geolocated photographs of dis connectivity within the watershed including check dams bedrock outcrops point bars depositional zones armoring zones connected hillslopes floodplains in stream features riffles runs and pools as well as upland features human or livestock interference to assess long term connectivity we coupled this method with the following procedures 1 we inferred evidence of strongly connected sediment transport pathways in the field by mapping erosion scars ephemeral gullies and concentrated flow pathways with evidence of erosion 2 we coupled the field disconnectivity assessment with gis analyses to observe larger and more prominent landscape features that might also influence the connectivity such as floodplains and karst sinkholes 3 we used general knowledge of the system gathered from field visits and data collection the past three years of study from researchers at the university of kentucky and 4 we compared landscape features land use and erosion pathways visually using multiple sets of orthophotos from varying years especially in regards to parameterizing the probability of non hydrologic detachment component of the model after completing each site visit we post processed reach information on a geospatial database using a weighting and averaging technique to score qualitatively several watershed sedimentation parameters including erosion deposition and lateral and longitudinal disconnectivity conglomerate scores led to the development of hotspot maps in particular the presence of buffers such as floodplains sinkholes farm dams and terraces within sub reaches qualitatively determined lateral disconnectivity we recognized the potential for subjectivity in the field assessment and thus multiple researchers individually scored each parameter of the sub reaches and the average of the researchers scores was used to create the conglomerate hotspot maps for the major parameters assessed one main utility of the field assessment and geospatial analyses was to understand disconnectivity from floodplains and karst sinkholes the land surface upstream of floodplain buffers was assumed disconnected from the stream network and thus not contributing to sediment flux at the watershed outlet approximately 5200 points simulated the extent of the delineated buffer features using archydro which is a set of data models that delineate and characterize watersheds in arcmap maidment 2002 and specifically the batch watershed delineation tool we determined the upstream contributing area of each point to delineate disconnected land another feature of potential sediment disconnectivity was water and sediment transport to karst sinkholes karst sinkholes are depressions leading to active or legacy i e clogged holes in the ground surface caused by cover collapse resulting from chemical dissolution of carbonate rock taylor 1992 in the south elkhorn sinkhole drainage area can vary from a few square meters to as large as five hectares where the former is from a relatively new cover collapse and the latter from successive dissolution and collapse leading to depression in the land surface during rainfall events runoff and eroded sediment can transport in the depressions and either deposit or enter the karst subsurface we quantified the extent of the sinkhole drainage area in our study basin using published files from the usgs and the kentucky geological survey currens et al 2002 taylor and nelson 2008 zhu et al 2014 kgs 2017 currens et al 2002 as well as references cited therein performed extensive study of the karst features in the basin and surrounding watersheds over the course of a 25 year period sinkhole occurrence drainage areas and flow pathways were mapped in a geospatial data file using dye trace studies water level data and inference geologic structure the existence of significant sinkhole and spring features and delineation methods currens et al 2002 taylor and nelson 2008 zhu et al 2014 the karst geospatial data served to highlight the percent coverage of sinkholes and their pathways and then we coupled the spatially explicit data with sediment connectivity modeling as discussed later additional hydrologic and geospatial data served as model inputs a land cover map was coupled with soil survey data as determined by the united states department of agriculture usda and the natural resources conservation service nrcs a high resolution dem created by the kentucky aerial photography and elevation data program in 2014 kyaped 2014 was used to predict the probability of connectivity at 1 5 m by 1 5 m practicality of using the high resolution dem is a function of its availability and computational processing time the high resolution dems are freely available for the entire state of kentucky usa where the study is performed simulation of the probability of connectivity model using a 1 5 m dem for a 62 km2 watershed for one year took 28 h on a desktop pc intel core i7 6700 cpu at 3 40 ghz 64 bit operating system x64 based processor the computational time will increase with watershed scale but the time could be offset with the use of parallel computing a usgs gage located near the watershed provided discharge data from october 1 2017 until the present turbidity and total suspended solids data were collected intermittently in the watershed since 2005 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa maintains a precipitation and temperature monitoring station at the lexington bluegrass airport located centrally in the watershed 3 3 hydrologic modeling we used an off the shelf hydrologic model deemed suitable for the study watershed to simulate the hydrologic connectivity the soil and water assessment tool swat was developed arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 swat 2012 to simulate the physical processes of water movement from different land uses and management practices at various watershed scales we chose this model due to its past successful application in the central kentucky usa region palanisamy and workman 2014 al aamery and fox 2016 and its wide popularity equation 3 represents the water balance equation used by swat to simulate the hydrologic cycle and is presented as 3 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surface e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil water content on day t mm of water sw 0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm of water r day is the amount of precipitation on day i mm of water q surface is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm of water e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm of water w seep is the amount of lateral flow interflow on day i mm of water and q gw is the amount of return flow on day i mm of water hydrologic response units hrus group landscapes with similar land uses soil types and slopes swat outputs runoff soil water content and many other parameters for each hru at the indicated time step to simulate hydrologic connectivity each of the 62 hrus modeled within the upper south elkhorn were spatially mapped in arcmap and model results were assigned as attributes output parameters from swat used in the probability of connectivity model include daily runoff and daily curve number for each hru daily runoff for each hru is determined using the nrcs curve number method nrcs 1972 which is shown in eq 4 as 4 q surface r day i a 2 r day i a s where q surface is the accumulative surface runoff or rainfall excess on a day mm of water r day is the depth of the rain on a day mm of water s is the retention parameter mm of water i a is the initial abstraction on a day mm of water and is generally estimated as 0 2s the retention parameter s varies spatially due to changes in soil land cover and surface slope and temporally due to changes in soil water content this parameter is explained as the following 5 s 25 4 1000 cn 10 where cn is the curve number semi automatic calibration was adopted to calibrate the swat model for our watershed al aamery and fox 2016 on a daily basis the focus of this paper investigates sediment mobility at the event time scale because sediment connectivity is a dynamic processes ambroise 2004 lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 fryirs 2013 and because of the event based pulses of sediment transport that are important at the watershed scale fryirs 2013 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 of swat cup abbaspour et al 2007a b was used to perform the calibration sensitivity analysis and uncertainty of our results the statistical metrics selected for this study to assess the simulated versus the observed streamflow were the coefficient of determination r 2 percent bias pbias nash sutcliff efficiency nse and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr moriasi et al 2007 the degree of uncertainty of the calibrated model was assessed using the p factor and r factor swat 2012 the parameters chosen for model evaluation were selected based on what was reported in previous studies arnold et al 2012 two years 2004 2005 of the swat simulation were treated as a warm up period the model evaluation was consistent with methods and results in al aamery and fox 2016 model simulation from 2006 to 2010 served as the calibration phase while 2011 to 2013 served as the validation phase results from the model evaluation see table 3 showed the hydrologic model performed very well based on hydrologic model evaluation criteria outlined in moriasi et al 2007 the monthly time step model performance is considered satisfactory if the ns greater than 0 5 rsr less than 0 7 and pbias 25 our simulation met all criteria in both calibration and validation model performance on daily time steps is expected to be poorer than the criteria set for monthly time steps somewhat relaxing the mentioned thresholds moriasi et al 2007 engel et al 2007 in the present case the daily simulation meets the monthly threshold criteria further highlighting the very good performance of the model 3 4 probability of sediment connectivity modeling we parameterized the individual probabilities in eq 2 as a set of discrete piecewise distributions to represent small regions or geospatial cells of the watershed the six probabilities were estimated for each geospatial cell and the discretized results were later integrated to provide continuous distribution functions applicable to the entire watershed a simple piecewise function predicts the probability of sediment supply for a geospatial cell n as 6 p i s 1 if sediment is present within the cell 0 if sediment is absent within the cell where i is an index representing a geospatial cell we parameterized equation 6 through observations both from field visits and remote sensing of the occurrence of a sediment surface that might be eroded we consider erodible surfaces to be any pervious surface impervious surfaces were digitized using aerial imagery provided by the usda national agriculture imagery program naip in 2010 the digitization of the probability of sediment supply was converted into a raster with resolution of 1 5 m by 1 5 m we express the probability of hydrologic detachment using an excessive shear stress approach as 7 p ij d h 1 if τ fij τ cri 0 0 if τ fij τ cri 0 where j is an index representing a time step the probability of hydrologic detachment was a temporally varying probability because the runoff depth changes with time as function of the distribution of precipitation and soil conditions equation 7 evaluates the shear stress of the fluid in the geospatial cell τ f with respect to the critical shear stress the shear stress of the fluid was approximated via the fluid momentum equation considering one dimensional uniform flow see jain 2001 pp 58 the runoff depth of the geospatial cell for a given time step was estimated from the hydrologic model the energy gradient was assumed the landscape slope determined in arcmap the critical shear stress of the sediment to resist erosion was parameterized by considering the soil characteristics and land management characteristics controlling the binding of particles into aggregates tisdall and oades 1982 alberts et al 1995 foster et al 1995 lal 1999 critical shear stress was predicted using the empirical critical shear stress equation for rangeland soil alberts et al 1995 as a function of texture organic matter and soil bulk density which were available in the soil geospatial layers from the usda the probability of non hydrologic detachment considers the presence of natural or anthropogenic disturbance agents other than fluvial processes that might initiate sediment detachment as 8 p i d nh 1 if a disturbance agent exists 0 if a disturbance agent is not present equation 8 is not dependent on watershed scale however thorough field or remote sensing observations of non hydrologic disturbances that detach sediment from the soil surface must be identified to parameterize the probability of non hydrologic detachment examples include livestock that trample and dislodge soil particles and mechanized detachment that might occur during construction farms with livestock nearby the stream corridor and construction sites were digitized in arcmap and assumed to detach sediment other non hydrologic disturbances such as tillage vehicle traffic and mass wasting were not included in the analyses which is a potential limitation of the study however we assumed tillage vehicle traffic and mass wasting to be of small importance to sediment transport in this watershed for following reasons regarding tillage almost all of the agriculture in the watershed is hay pasture and cultivated crops account for less than 3 of the land cover see fig 3 of the existing cultivated crops most of the row crops are grown with no till and the farming industry protects the cropland from erosion smallwood 2017 dirt roads and skidding trails have been shown to increase connectivity in forest regions lópez vicente et al 2017 in the present study we do not expect roadways to cause sediment mobilization other than water accumulation in ditches from roadway runoff based on our field assessment there are no commonly used dirt roads in the watershed some gravel roads exist but these are highly compacted the agriculture lands had paved or gravel roads attributed to the profitable and optical equine industry the agriculture of the basin is well established pasture to serve the 3 billion dollar equine industry in the bluegrass and the horse farms generally do a good job of maintaining their pastureland resource esr 2013 smallwood 2017 the watershed falls within the low landslide incidence less than 1 5 of the area involved in the united states radbruch hall et al 1982 we found no evidence of mass wasting in the basin during field assessments which is consistent with the gently rolling topography we parameterize the probability for upstream hydrologic transport with the following piecewise function as 9 p ij t h up 1 if s aci s crij 0 0 if s aci s crij 0 where sac indicates the slope of geospatial cell i and is assumed equal to the energy gradient and scr represents the critical slope required to initiate ephemeral gully incision of geospatial cell i montgomery and dietrich 1994 vandaele et al 1996 torri and poesen 2014 equation 9 compares the actual slope sac with the critical slope scr to estimate the probability of upstream hydrologic transport when sac of the land surface in the geospatial cell is greater than the scr the probability is one for that individual cell we parameterized sac using gradient analyses of a dem we parameterize scr using the equation of vandaele 1993 as 10 s cri a i a i b where a is a coefficient representative of the local climate and land use and soil characteristics of geospatial cell i a is the upstream drainage area of geospatial cell i and b is an exponent the theory reflects the concept that the upstream drainage area may be a surrogate for the volume of concentrated surface runoff with sufficient magnitude and duration to sustain erosion vandaele 1993 torri and poesen 2014 empirically derived a critical slope upstream drainage area relationship for geospatial cells after extensively reviewing data collected by many researchers from 1983 to 2011 across six continents and the relationship between critical slope and the upslope area was included here as 11 s crij 0 73 c i e 1 3 rfc i 0 00124 s 0 05 ij 0 37 a i 0 38 where s0 05 represents the maximum potential loss to runoff as determined from the nrcs curve number cn method for a geospatial cell at a particular time step rfc is the rock fragment cover of the soil which affects the infiltration rate of runoff and c represents other sources of the variation of the coefficient a from equation 10 in geospatial cell i not accounted for by the cn approximation data from torri and poesen s 2014 study included numerous landscape features ranging from rills to large ephemeral gullies we included this equation in the model since these landscape features are known to facilitate sediment transport in the study basin the cn method is assumed appropriate because runoff initiates in the silt loam soils and the system as a whole is fluvial dominated sinkhole drainage areas cover 13 of the drainage basin but the sinkhole flow pathways align well with the dendritic stream network when runoff occurs water is routed through sinkholes to the shallow subsurface and out springheads connecting to the stream the cn method models the effect that vegetation land use and soil type have on runoff abstraction initial abstraction was predicted using the empirical equation developed by hawkins et al 2009 as 12 s 0 05 0 819 25 4 1000 cn ij 10 1 15 where cnij represents the curve number of cell i at time step j the daily curve number output for individual hrus via the swat hydrologic model represents cnij we parameterized the probability for downstream hydrologic transport as 13 p i t h dwn 1 ifs i s up n 0 0 ifs i s up n 0 where si representative of the slope in a particular geospatial cell was found by applying the slope tool in arcmap to the upper south elkhorn dem n is representative of the number of upstream cells flowing into cell i determined via the flow accumulation tool which estimates the number of cells flowing into a downstream cell s up is the sum of the slopes of each cell upstream of cell i this is determined by weighting the flow accumulation raster by the slope raster in this manner the fluid energy to transport sediment in cell i is compared to the incoming fluid energy the probability of downstream hydrologic transport parameterization reflects the static connectivity of the watershed when surrogating slope for the energy gradient of the fluid note disconnected cells downstream of connected cells do not necessarily cause deposition rather we imply that disconnected cells downstream of connected cells simply do not have the capacity to pick up more sediment that is contributable to the stream network we believe this is reasonable considering very low gradient features causing deposition are explicitly included in the probability of buffers equation and the realization that fine sediments once entrained can take hours or even days to settle jin and romkens 2001 jin et al 2002 le bissonnais et al 2004 owens et al 2007 liu et al 2008 rienzi et al 2018 the probability of non hydrologic transport represents processes such as eolian transport and land sliding however the present application focuses on a fluvial dominated system only thus non hydrologic transport was not parameterized we parameterize the probability of buffer disconnectivity as 14 p i b 1 if a buffer exists 0 if abuffer does not exist we identified features causing sediment disconnectivity via observations in the field assessment if features did exist the entire upstream region of the watershed that was disconnected was parameterized with p b 1 however we had uncertainty regarding the ability of karst sinkhole features to cause a net disconnectivity and act as buffers of lateral transport i e p b 1 within the basin sinkhole drainage areas are expected to pirate transported sediment or sediment may deposit in the surface depression itself similarly to the fallout of sediment transported from hillslopes to floodplains uncertainty of the disconnectivity occurs because pirated sediment may resurface at springheads and therefore the sediment may reconnect back to the fluvial network recent studies in the inner bluegrass have mixed results regarding springhead sediment production for example we analyzed karst spring sediment productivity from data reported in recent journal papers for the inner bluegrass reed et al 2010 husic et al 2017a b husic et al 2017b showed the royal spring to produce an order of magnitude lower sediment concentration than surface streams during hydrologic events of various magnitude reed et al 2010 showed two springs in the region produced sediment concentrations on the same order of magnitude as surface streams albeit they collected data from rather substantial hydrologic events with 4 to 6 cm of rainfall in the south elkhorn the sinkhole drainage area is small 13 of the drainage area relative to surrounding basins see table 2 but springhead sediment production may not be negligible therefore we perform disconnectivity analyses and propagate the analyses through the probability of connectivity modeling by considering the sinkhole drainages as disconnected and separately analyzed the watershed considering the sinkholes as connected the analyses provides upper and lower level uncertainty bounds on our results 3 5 surface erosion modeling the probability of sediment connectivity model provides the spatially explicit erosion features and the active contributing area for sediment transport in any time step the erosion model simulates sediment yield at the watershed outlet by integrating the daily volume of eroded sediment from the active contributing area predicted by the probability of connectivity model at the specified time step yearly sediment yield is predicted by integrating the daily sediment yield daily sediment yield was predicted as 15 s y ε ρ s tlw where sy is the sediment yielded at the watershed outlet from the active contributing area tonnes ε is the erosion rate m s as predicted by the partheniades 1965 equation ρ s is the bulk density of the sediment kg m3 t is the amount of time sediment is contributed from the active contributing area s l is the length of the eroding rill or ephemeral gully m and w is the width of the eroding rill or ephemeral gully m we assume the erosion rate is proportional to shear stress in excess of the critical shear stress of the eroding surface as predicted by partheniades 1965 as 16 ε k d τ f τ cr where ε is the erosion rate of the soil m s kd is the erodibility coefficient m3 n s τ cr is the critical shear stress of the eroding surface pa and τ f is the effective shear stress pa of the accumulated flow on the eroding surface the effective shear stress of the accumulated flow on the eroding surface was approximated via the fluid momentum equation considering one dimensional uniform flow of runoff and runoff depth was approximated using the darcy weisbach approach e g jain 2001 the inputs to the erosion model are shown in table 4 and included the critical shear stress of the eroding surface bathymetries channel lengths relative roughness of the channel bulk density of the eroded sediment storm length the time sediment is produced from an eroding channel and an erodibility coefficient we specified several parameters using literature derived methods time of concentration was used as a surrogate for storm length when surface erosion was occurring we applied three methods to estimate the storm length including the watershed lag method mockus 1961 the velocity method nrcs 2010 and the kirpich equation wanielista et al 1997 average rill and gully width were empirically parameterized using the equation developed by nachtergaele et al 2002 erodibility kd and critical shear stress τ cr of the eroding soil were parameterized via typical literature values alberts et al 1995 hanson and simon 2001 we applied the friction factor following the colebrook white equation the relative roughness ranged between 10 and 20 of the flow depth to estimate the net erosion rate of the connected cells cells were lumped into three discrete fractions based on upstream contributing area a flow accumulation raster within the gis model was multiplied with the probability of sediment connectivity raster to estimate the upstream contributing area for each cell we chose size fractions iteratively such that several orders of magnitude of upstream contributing area were represented the average slope of the connected cells was estimated using the most connected day of the first study year the accumulated flow rate was determined for each cell by multiplying the average upstream contributing area times the runoff depth at the particular time step and then dividing by a representative storm length we performed data assimilation to reduce propagation of error from the water model to the sediment model as mentioned the hydrologic model performed very well see table 3 however even when a hydrologic model performs very well differences between point observation and point simulation of the model results will still occur we did not want to propagate these differences through the sediment transport model so we performed data assimilation for days when the predicted average flow rate differed by more than 30 of the actual average daily flow rate mahoney 2017 in turn the sediment model could better reflect the actual runoff of the individual day and reduce propagation of error to the sediment formulae we calibrated and validated the erosion model by comparing the prediction of daily sediment flux to sediment flux estimated via measurements at the watershed outlet sediment flux estimates were completed by russo and fox 2012 using automated sampling and the einstein approach einstein 1950 the model was iteratively calibrated so the predicted daily sediment flux matched as closely as possible with the observed sediment flux three hydrologic events were used to calibrate the model and two hydrologic events were used for validation mahoney 2017 calibration parameters that were adjusted included the erodibility coefficient kd the critical shear stress of the eroding surface τ cr the relative roughness of the channel surface ε d the length of storm and the contribution time of sediment from the eroding surface the coefficient of determination and the nash sutcliff coefficient were optimized during calibration thereafter annual sediment yield was compared with results from russo 2009 for additional verification 4 results 4 1 evaluating model sensitivity we investigated how each probability in eq 1 captured well known erosion mechanisms to validate the probability of connectivity model was working well our validation was confirmed as shown in fig 4 where the individual probabilities predict disconnectivity from impervious surfaces with no sediment supply low gradient surfaces with limited shear surfaces towards the top of a slope length with limited flow accumulation and surfaces upstream of buffers we next investigated the sensitivity of the individual probabilities to the results integration showed the probability of upstream transport exhibited the most control on the probability of connectivity and this was true of both moderate and high rainfall events simulated throughout the model run see fig 5 differences in the results for moderate and high rainfall events show the dynamic nature of the probabilities of detachment and upstream transport given their dependence on hydrologic connectivity the probabilities of downstream transport buffer disconnectivity and supply are shown in fig 5 to be static given their dependence on the topography morphologic features and human associated land cover the dominant control of upstream transport in the present study qualitatively agrees with the high success of the borselli et al 2008 model founded on upstream transport nevertheless the results in fig 5 show the importance of the other individual probabilities we included in our sediment connectivity model our sensitivity analysis fig 6 next focused on evaluating parameters in the model affecting the sediment connectivity including the critical shear stress and sediment transport coefficients and results suggest our model parameterization is robust for the conditions of our application the critical shear stress of sediment to resist detachment showed a lack of sensitivity until reaching a value of approximately 15 pa fig 6a and critical shear stress parameterization beyond this threshold could reduce the sediment connectivity by as much as 100 the high critical shear stresses reflect surface conditions more akin to vegetated channels and consolidated stabilized bank soil conditions millar and quick 1998 the 15 pa threshold is considerably higher than the critical shear stress expected for agricultural surface erosion processes alberts et al 1995 and we do not expect such high critical shear stress conditions across the soils of the present study the b exponent represents the flow condition to initiate erosion and showed a lack of sensitivity until reaching very low values for the exponent of approximately 0 2 the very low threshold for sensitivity reflects conditions of viscous laminar flow conditions results show that such laminar conditions would double sediment connectivity in the watershed and these conditions reflect the dominance of pure sheet flow or perhaps pseudo laminar flows with extremely high sediment concentrations nevertheless we do not expect these conditions in the concentrated turbulent flow pathways to occur in the present study montgomery and dietrich 1994 vandaele et al 1996 torri and poesen 2014 the c factor represents additional fluid and sediment pathways in the landscape that are not captured by the surface transport formula and previous research emphasized the ability of the c factor to reflect piping torri and poesen 2014 suggest a range of 0 1 to 0 4 reflects pronounced piping results show that a c factor in this range would nearly double sediment connectivity estimated from the model although the south elkhorn soils do not experience piping given the lack of soil texture variation vertically in the soil column fox et al 2006 the south elkhorn does have immature karst and 13 of the drainage area is sinkhole controlled rather than adjusting the c factor to try and account for the karst we accounted for sinkholes within the probability of buffers term see below for additional discussion of karst sinkholes we next investigated the sensitivity of geospatial resolution upon the results dem resolution showed a substantial impact on the results the 9 m by 9 m dem estimated the probability of sediment connectivity to be nearly two times greater than the 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem for the most highly connected days of the year fig 6b the sensitivity of the dems was a noteworthy result and on average the deviation between the 1 5 m by 1 5 m and 9 m by 9 m dem was 80 the low resolution dem always estimated greater connectivity we carried forward the higher resolution 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem when estimating sediment connectivity for several reasons the higher resolution dem better reflects the microtopography of the landscape and its ability or lack thereof to accumulate water which agrees with recent sentiment by cavalli et al 2013 that higher resolution dems better reflect the actual landscape in connectivity studies visually broad regions of connectivity and disconnectivity agree with one another for both the 1 5 m by 1 5 m and 9 m by 9 m dems see fig 6c however results show the 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem better captures the microtopography including steeper gradient swales where water accumulates before entering the stream while the 9 m by 9 m dem masks across leads and ridges in the topography and treats entire sub regions of the land surface as connected also locally flat surfaces recognizable within the 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem were masked in 9 m by 9 m dem and further increased the connectivity estimate we inspected the results and found delineation of the landscape contributing area was one mathematical reason for higher connectivity estimates from the low resolution dem as the upstream contributing area increases so too does the accumulated runoff to transport sediment in the ephemeral pathways of the uplands reflected via the probability of upstream transport the lower resolution 9 m by 9 m dem masks across locally flat surfaces in upstream geospatial scales and in turn increases the contributing area and the probability of connectivity we considered the sensitivity of karst sinkholes upon connectivity results sinkholes intercept approximately 13 of the watershed s drainage and are distributed throughout the landscape see fig 7 we realized the potential importance of the sinkholes to impart sediment disconnectivity due to buffering lateral transport i e p b 1 because sinkhole drainage areas may pirate transported sediment or sediment may deposit within the surface depression at the same time pirated sediment may resurface at springheads and reconnect back to the fluvial network i e p b 0 this consideration was also deemed possible because dye traces showed that sinkhole pathways are consistent with the dendritic surface network in this watershed see insert in fig 7 we considered a net disconnectivity versus net connectivity effect of the sinkhole drainage areas and found that the uncertainty from the karst features had a rather small effect on results for example the probability of connectivity varied from 12 1 to 13 5 on a wet day of the simulation period when including the karst uncertainty the result is commensurate with the 13 coverage of sinkhole drainage in the south elkhorn at the same time the results highlight the potential of karst sinkholes to cause sediment disconnectivity from microtopography we include this uncertainty component by accounting for the range of results throughout the remainder of the paper generally predicted and observed daily sediment flux values showed good agreement when comparing data and modeling results fig 8 a assimilation of hydrologic data during calibration and validation reduced the propagation of error from the hydrologic model to the watershed erosion model and we found substantial differences in daily sediment flux when comparing assimilated and non assimilated model runs fig 8b however data assimilation did not affect net sediment yield results at the end of the simulation period the results highlight the effectiveness of our data assimilation procedure for calibration purposes on an event based daily to multi day basis but also the annual prediction capabilities of the watershed erosion model for times when data assimilation is not possible annual sediment yield for the watershed 3300 140 t y 1 was 2 more than annual sediment yield estimated for the upland contribution reported in russo and fox 2012 for the same period which provides further verification of the modeling results sensitivity analysis of parameters calibrated in the watershed erosion model showed the importance of the erodibility coefficient fig 8c which varies widely in the literature e g review in hanson and simon 2001 the time of concentration also showed moderate sensitivity upon sediment flux while the impact of the friction coefficient and critical shear stress of sediment to resist erosion was marginal upon the sediment yield results 4 2 watershed scale results the probability of sediment connectivity varied throughout the year fig 9 and reached a maximum value of 12 8 0 7 on march 12 day 72 of the study year when high rainfall fell on wet soils the results imply 12 8 0 7 of the watershed s surface had the potential to erode sediment on march 12 the mean sediment connectivity for the 104 days with some connectivity was 2 26 0 1 and the standard deviation was 3 5 0 15 sediment connectivity ranged from 0 to 1 5 for 67 of the 104 days and ranged from 1 7 to 13 for remaining 37 days fig 10 a the beta distribution best fit the dynamic connectivity results the beta distribution is a logical choice for representation of the dynamic probability given the beta distribution is continuous but bounded by 0 and 1 and therefore is suitable for representing the behavior of probabilities results showed that the probability of sediment connectivity alone was not a good predictor of sediment flux we highlight this idea in fig 10b where temporal results are different for the probability of sediment connectivity and sediment flux obviously sediment flux occurs only when some sediment connectivity exists but sediment connectivity by itself does not predict sediment flux as recently noted by bracken et al 2015 modeling results estimate that sediment connectivity was spatially distributed across the watershed and that the northern region of the south elkhorn watershed exhibits the highest sediment connectivity we attribute the spatially distributed results to a shift in the soil conditions in this region engineering properties of the soils shift from being dominated by moderately drained soils i e nrcs hydrologic soil group b in the southern and central regions of the watershed to dominated by poorly and very poorly drained soils i e nrcs hydrologic groups c and d in the northern region the nrcs attributes the shift in the engineering properties to the decrease in percent sand and increase in percent fine clay in the northern region nrcs 2009 sediment connectivity is slightly higher in the central eastern region of the watershed relative to the central western and southern regions the result reflects the higher contribution of urban and suburban land uses in the central eastern region which in turn produce impervious surfaces higher estimated runoff and therefore higher values for the probability of hydrologic detachment and probability of upstream hydrologic transport we also assessed longitudinal variability of sediment connectivity by investigating the probability of sediment connectivity from catchment 1 km2 to mid sized watershed scales 60 km2 longitudinal variability results included a weak increase in the probability of sediment connectivity with scale fig 10c and the variance of sediment connectivity was highest at the smaller scale the longitudinal variability of sediment connectivity reflects competing processes operating at different scales in a watershed configuration phillips 2003 borselli et al 2008 fryirs 2013 researchers suggest relatively steep landscape gradients promote sediment connectivity at smaller scales such as hillslope and small catchment scales fryirs et al 2007 on the other hand as the watershed scale increases fluid accumulation has the potential to increase fluid shear stress and produce hydrologic connectivity for conveying sediment borselli et al 2008 the weak power function result tends to suggest the latter process i e flow accumulation for the south elkhorn which we attribute to the dominance of erosion in concentrated flow pathways as opposed to sheet erosion processes 4 3 features of connectivity and disconnectivity unsurprisingly sediment connectivity was high for the ephemeral network steep slopes in newly constructed areas ditches adjacent to roadways and hillslopes adjacent to the stream see fig 11 in turn erosion prone landscape features showed sediment flux from these sources and the watershed erosion model results provided a spatially explicit estimate of erosion rates see fig 12 the results further validated that our model was working well because past research has suggested that erosion dominates from rill erosion ephemeral gully erosion and concentrated flow pathways in the watershed gumbert 2017 smallwood 2017 and livestock and construction sites have been suggested to show increased detachment rates evans 2017 more surprisingly sediment disconnectivity was dominated by microtopography across the gently rolling landscape the greatest control on disconnectivity was the probability of upstream transport fig 5 and upon further inspection of results from the high resolution dem we found that the disconnectivity occurs because undulating land surfaces produces local low to zero gradient surfaces i e flat slopes the microtopography from the undulations causes small sources of disconnectivity because runoff loses its energy in small depressions our field visits during storm events justified the geospatial model results we found that even during intense rainfall events when runoff and flow accumulation were pronounced in ditches and swales there was little to no runoff or sediment transport across pastureland surfaces and rather pooling within microtopographic depressions the microtopography identified with the high resolution dem is noteworthy given the watershed itself was not flat i e average hillslope gradient was 7 the potential of karst microtopography to impart disconnectivity is also noteworthy sinkhole microtopography may pirate transported sediment or cause fallout within depressions similarly to floodplain deposition thus increasing lateral disconnectivity while sinkhole impact was relatively small in this basin sinkhole microtopography could potentially act as the dominant in neighboring basins in this region see table 2 as well as other regions with karst morphology other recent studies corroborate the importance of microtopography upon sediment connectivity phillips et al 2017 shows that microtopography associated with pits from tree uprooting and local surface armoring of rock fragments can disconnect erosion processes in an old growth forest lopez et al 2017 shows that a high resolution dem is useful to reveal how microtopography impacts hydrological connectivity for roads and skidding trails in forest catchments the usefulness of high resolution dems is encouraging for sediment connectivity studies the floodplains are another disconnecting feature yet the floodplains did not dominate disconnectivity as perhaps sometimes assumed based on our field assessment while walking the stream corridor we initially presumed such a dominant behavior for the upper south elkhorn watershed due to the prevalence of floodplains with flat gradients adjacent to the stream network however after completing the spatially explicit modeling we found that floodplains buffered only 5 of the catchment we recognized that the net effect of floodplains causes disconnectivity beyond the 5 measure due to the extension of low gradient surfaces forcing deposition of sediment from adjacent hillslopes draining to the floodplains nevertheless the net effect of the floodplains was only 35 disconnectivity which was low relative to the probabilities of detachment upstream transport and downstream transport i e 55 to 90 disconnectivity during hydrologic events see example in fig 5b 5 discussion 5 1 spatially explicit and computational advancement of watershed erosion modeling our results show the efficacy of the probability of sediment connectivity approach to advance watershed erosion modeling for several reasons first results show that the approach accounts for spatial variability across the landscape by coupling the probability of sediment connectivity with the high resolution digital elevation model dem the high resolution dem helps resolve specific erosion features and sources such as sediment connectivity around roadside ditches and disconnectivity from flat land surface gradients in general advantages of the 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem suggest the researcher acquire the highest resolution dem possible which tends to agree with sentiment in the literature cavalli et al 2013 however some qualification is needed and we suggest an upper limit is conceivable based on the underlying fluid mechanics assumptions for example calculations of both the probability of detachment and the probability of transport assume the landscape gradient equals the energy gradient of the fluid these simplified representations assume the fluid mechanics in a geospatial cell may be treated as uniform flow the assumption is reasonable albeit a recognized practical simplification when the flow depth across the landscape is on the order of a few centimeters while the streamwise length scale is two orders of magnitude greater the assumption may break down and require further investigation as to its sensitivity as the dem resolution increases to a resolution of a few centimeters a resolution that is no longer out of the question as technology continues to improve in this case the flow depth of runoff would be on the same order of magnitude as the resolution of the streamwise length scale and individual large roughness elements act as hydraulic controls inducing non uniformity to the flow the landscape gradient in the profile of the hydraulic controls will be more extreme than the energy gradient of the flow for example an adverse landscape gradient has the potential to predict disconnectivity when the decelerating flow still has sufficient fluid shear stress to detach sediment we point out that applying a very high few centimeter resolution dem in the probability of sediment connectivity does not negate the multiplicative theoretical basis for intersecting probabilities however researchers might consider parameterizing the flow as non uniform across the landscape for such a high resolution application second our results show that the watershed erosion model structure accounts for supply shear and transport criteria of sediment transport coupling sediment connectivity in watershed erosion models is a new area of research and we suggest the approach provides the modeler with an added tool to account for sediment transport criteria via permutations of erosion formulae and connectivity principles we highlight our model application as one such permutation the model approach considers sediment supply limitations in a spatially explicit manner by calculating the probability of sediment supply using geospatial analyses the approach considers transport limitations explicitly by calculating upstream and downstream probabilities of transport at each cell see fig 4 and by identifying buffer discontinuities using field reconnaissance with supply and transport accounted we emphasized the shear limitation when coupling to the surface erosion formulae we maximized the advantages of the spatially explicit datasets and the quantitative hydraulic formulae when considering shear supply and transport limitations for the specific conditions of our system we expect researchers may find many other permutations of erosion formulae and connectivity principles in future modeling of watershed erosion third we highlight that reducing the cost of computational hydrology is another attractive feature of a connectivity based watershed erosion model in the present application the watershed modeling included calculations for 3 1010 space time combinations the probability of sediment connectivity subroutine added explicit formulae to the watershed erosion model and a geospatial modeling software performed calculations requiring several hours to run on a desktop pc considering all space time combinations in the watershed modeling only 0 7 of the combinations contained connectivity therefore the model carried forward only 2 108 space time combinations in the hydraulic and sediment transport formulae and removed 2 98 1010 space time calculations hydraulic calculations are often computationally intensive requiring solution of implicit formulae at each space time step computational sediment transport is even more demanding as higher dimensional formulae e g see above discussion of flow non uniformities and as researchers implement advanced routing methods thus we suggest the inclusion of the connectivity based watershed erosion model may have a net reduction in overall computational complexity further the connectivity based watershed erosion model provides the flexibility to include advanced computational complexity simulation of the breach of a buffer within the watershed configuration e g see descriptions in bracken et al 2015 allows calling up sophisticated hydraulic and sediment subroutines that could simulate such spatiotemporal feedback and connectivity between sediment sources and sinks 5 2 extending our view of sediment disconnectivity and connectivity the newly quantified features of the gently rolling watershed complement existing knowledge and extend our view of disconnectivity our results agree with the concept that the gently rolling watershed morphology includes relatively stable land surfaces ephemeral flow pathways and the presence of decoupled floodplains jarrit and lawrence 2007 ford and fox 2014 that can lead to trapping of as much as 90 of mobilized sediments in disconnected land surfaces meade et al 1990 hupp 2000 walling et al 2006 our results reflect this idea and show spatial disconnectivity on the order of 90 on the wettest day of the year microtopography across the landscape dominates disconnectivity because local low to zero gradient surfaces cause the ponding of runoff and sediment deposition in the undulating landscape our result is corroborated by past studies where sediment erosion from diffusive processes on land surfaces of the uplands only travel a spatial scale of several meters or less roering et al 1999 as well as by recent results highlighting the influence of microtopography in forest catchments lopez et al 2017 phillips et al 2017 karst microtopography and the ability of sinkholes to pirate transported sediment and cause lateral disconnectivity is also noteworthy for the gently rolling watershed the ephemeral network represents the most connected morphology of the uplands however disconnectivity persists through much of the ephemeral network even during high magnitude events floodplains cause lateral disconnectivity due to their potential to break connectivity between the ephemeral network and main channel which is consistent with the work of others goudie 2004 florsheim et al 2006 kronvang et al 2007 jaeger et al 2017 only about 10 of the uplands showed lateral sediment connectivity with the stream for the gently rolling watershed which contrasts steeper gradient systems where connectivity results are much higher e g fryirs et al 2007 fryirs et al 2007 predicted the active contributing area for four landscape units in the upper hunter catchment in australia which have relatively high elevation deep dissection and a rugged hilly landscape nearly 50 of the catchment was connected for a moderate storm event which contrasts greatly with our gently rolling results of 10 connectivity for one of the most hydrologically intensive days of the year we caution fine scale quantitative comparisons of papers given the modeling approaches applied and dem resolution applied nevertheless we mention the vast differences in connectivity that cast gently rolling watersheds as event resilient disconnected systems regarding sediment connectivity one potentially interesting result is the net importance of ditches and roadside gullies in the urban regions the urban regions showed net higher connectivity than surrounding agricultural regions the importance of roadways to induce erosion and sediment connectivity has been discussed previously for mountainous catchments latocha 2014 and urban sprawl i e urbanization has been well understood to induce gully formation and channeling processes trimble 1993 however few papers to our knowledge have reported the net importance of roadway ditches and gullies in well established urban environments more generally these ephemeral networks of urban and suburban regions may exhibit more sediment connectivity than agricultural regions in gently rolling systems given the presence of a higher concentration of impervious surfaces and the well defined drainage network promoting flow accumulation the exception would likely be poorly managed watersheds where agricultural best management practices have yet to be adopted 6 conclusions model evaluation results verify the capability of the probability of sediment connectivity to be integrated within watershed erosion modeling the modeling approach accounts for the spatial variability of sediment connectivity across the landscape and high resolution dems were able to predict erosion features impacting sediment connectivity and disconnectivity we suggest this approach provides the modeler with an added tool to account for sediment transport criteria given that each of the individual sediment probabilities exhibit some importance and coupling with erosion formulae provides sediment flux estimates we also highlight the potential ability of the approach to reduce the cost of computational hydrology as modeling tools rely more and more on high resolution prediction in the gently rolling watershed results show that sediment connectivity occurs within ephemeral pathways across the uplands but disconnectivity dominates the watershed configuration both spatially and temporally all morphologic levels of the uplands exhibit disconnecting features including microtopography causing low energy undulating surfaces karst sinkholes disconnecting drainage areas and floodplains that de couple the hillslopes from the stream corridor only 12 8 0 7 of the gently rolling watershed shows sediment connectivity on the wettest day of the year spatially results highlight the importance of sediment connectivity in urban and suburban pathways given the well defined channel network and influence of impervious surfaces dynamic and longitudinal results suggest the beta distribution and power function respectively might be further investigated for their ability to reflect the gently rolling watershed s connectivity more generally acknowledgements we thank an anonymous reviewer for comments that helped us to improve greatly the quality of the work we

7313,sediment connectivity has been shown in recent years to explain how the watershed configuration controls sediment transport however we find no studies develop a watershed erosion modeling framework based on sediment connectivity and few if any studies have quantified sediment connectivity for gently rolling systems we develop a new predictive sediment connectivity model that relies on the intersecting probabilities for sediment supply detachment transport and buffers to sediment transport which is integrated in a watershed erosion model framework the model predicts sediment flux temporally and spatially across a watershed using field reconnaissance results a high resolution digital elevation models a hydrologic model and shear based erosion formulae model results validate the capability of the model to predict erosion pathways causing sediment connectivity more notably disconnectivity dominates the gently rolling watershed across all morphologic levels of the uplands including microtopography from low energy undulating surfaces across the landscape swales and gullies only active in the highest events karst sinkholes that disconnect drainage areas and floodplains that de couple the hillslopes from the stream corridor results show that sediment connectivity is predicted for about 2 or more the watershed s area 37 days of the year with the remaining days showing very little or no connectivity only 12 8 0 7 of the gently rolling watershed shows sediment connectivity on the wettest day of the study year results also highlight the importance of urban suburban sediment pathways in gently rolling watersheds and dynamic and longitudinal distributions of sediment connectivity might be further investigated in future work we suggest the method herein provides the modeler with an added tool to account for sediment transport criteria and has the potential to reduce computational costs in watershed erosion modeling keywords sediment transport stochastic watershed scale disconnectivity 1 introduction watershed erosion modeling aims to simulate sediment flux in a basin to discern impacts of sediment loss on landscape practices and sediment impacts on stream biology reservoir water supply and water quality morris and fan 2009 usepa 2004 however quantifying watershed erosion has proven precarious due to spatially diverse landscapes that can buffer and disconnect sediment pathways fryirs 2013 we argue sediment connectivity theory provides a meaningful concept to elucidate the role of the watershed configuration and advance watershed erosion modeling especially in light of now often available high resolution digital elevation models our motivation was to develop a probability based theory of sediment connectivity that may be integrated within continuous based watershed erosion simulations we apply our modeling framework with the intent to gain knowledge of sediment disconnectivity in gently rolling terrains which are understudied currently there is a need to advance watershed erosion models within the water resources community substantial advancement of watershed erosion modeling over the past four decades results from the intensive field data collection systems and experimental watersheds of the 1970s and 1980s the coupled hydrologic formulae advancement of the 1980s and the computational and geospatial data advancements of the 1990s and 2000s walling 1983 merritt et al 2003 mahoney 2017 researchers and practitioners now have watershed erosion modeling platforms that are often freely available and can be readily applied however current watershed models often do not explicitly account for the three dimensional spatial complexity of the landscape and its dynamic nature when predicting erosion and routing of sediment the advanced ability of our current computational environment allows parameterization of watershed erosion models that shifts the physical based functions within the models away from the inputs and parameters for which the equations were originally designed often the governing erosion formulae providing the basis of the watershed model is one or a few assumed erosion processes e g plot scale sheet flow extrapolating these processes to the entire watershed surface produces an empirically parameterized model assuming sufficient verification data in which the modeler produces a posterior solution space that may not reflect the sediment detachment and transport occurring across the uplands in this case the modeler neglects the three dimensional and temporally dynamic landscape presently we detail a promising approach to help overcome spatial complexity limitations and advance watershed erosion modeling by coupling erosion formulae with sediment connectivity using high resolution spatial data we argue the time is ripe to advance watershed erosion modeling by improving its spatiotemporal context for several reasons highly resolved topographic datasets are often freely available making incorporation of such data into watershed platforms feasible also geomorphologic field based and geospatial based investigation have been advanced in recent years to focus on the topic of sediment connectivity sediment connectivity is a contemporary term that we define similarly to bracken et al 2015 as the integrated detachment and transport of sediment from source to sink between geomorphic zones of a watershed while the term is contemporary we recognize general concern for how erosion zones are connected to the stream channel i e sediment delivery has been studied for the past 60 years e g maner and barnes 1953 glymph 1954 schumm 1954 if not earlier the contemporary definition of sediment connectivity has evolved from several bodies of sediment transport and geomorphologic literature one body of literature is research focused on the sediment delivery ratio which was developed in the 1950s and 60s by maner and barnes 1953 roehl 1962 and studied extensively thereafter a second body of literature is the work by schumm 1977 and researchers thereafter which conceptually compartmentalizes zones of the watershed by their respective dominance of sediment production transfer and deposition this work led to numerous studies assessing sediment source to channel delivery at various scales e g ferguson 1981 roberts and church 1986 knighton 1989 brunsden 1993 harvey 1996 michaelides and wainwright 2002 the third body of literature is general connectivity theory which is defined as the transfer of matter between two landscape compartments or throughout an entire system chorley and kennedy 1971 general connectivity theory was further developed by ecologists e g taylor et al 1993 pringle 2003 until adopted by geomorphologists to describe the hydrologic connection of geomorphologic compartments the contemporary idea of sediment connectivity has evolved by synthesizing the above literature bodies contemporary sediment connectivity aims to identify the watershed s configuration and its role within the sediment continuum including the stores and sinks of sediment the pathways of sediment detachment and transport and the morphologic features disconnecting the pathways of sediment transport during hydrologic events fryirs et al 2007 jain and tandon 2010 to work towards solving the sediment delivery problem walling 1983 contemporary sediment connectivity gained popularity in the early and mid 2000s through conceptual work from researchers such as hooke 2003 brierley et al 2006 fryirs et al 2007 bracken and croke 2007 and bracken et al 2015 and was extended to morphological budgeting croke et al 2013 and morphometric analysis marchamalo et al 2016 current application of sediment connectivity includes index based empirical and process based analyses e g borselli et al 2008 messenzehl et al 2014 liu and fu 2016 masselink et al 2016 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 sediment connectivity is implicit within empirical models such as the sediment delivery ratio but as identified by many researchers e g walling 1983 bracken and croke 2007 fryirs 2013 these historic sediment models lack integration of the complex physical processes governing sediment erosion transport and deposition due to spatial and temporal lumping sediment connectivity is now recognized to be a major control on sediment budgets fryirs et al 2007 but has seldom taken precedence in quantitative sediment transport models ambroise 2004 de vente et al 2005 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 we suggest sediment connectivity s emphasis on the watershed s configuration provides a meaningful descriptive and topologic concept for integrating within watershed erosion modeling numerous features of sediment connectivity including its emphasis on field assessment and geospatial modeling are attractive for advancing watershed erosion modeling field assessment of the watershed s morphology provides the foundation of sediment connectivity theory and allows identification of features that may disconnect sediment pathways lacking inclusion in watershed modeling frameworks for example field assessments identify sediment transport buffers such as long flat floodplains that laterally disconnect hillslopes to the stream corridor fryirs 2013 spatially explicit modeling of the watershed via sediment connectivity models has the potential to reflect the actual three dimensional landscape to elucidate zones of active erosion and concentrated pathways of sediment transport cavalli et al 2013 thereafter researchers may apply erosion formulae typical of watershed models to active erosion zones and active contributing area of the watershed ambroise 2004 rather than extrapolating and calibrating formulae beyond their physical basis across the entire landscape we commend the pioneering and recent efforts of scientists to advance the theory and application of sediment connectivity e g fryirs et al 2007 borselli et al 2008 cavalli et al 2013 fryirs 2013 bracken et al 2015 souza et al 2016 which in turn provides a promising basis for improving watershed erosion models however we highlight several features of sediment connectivity theory requiring further development to allow integration with continuous based watershed erosion model simulations first previous sediment connectivity modeling has focused on one or a few factors controlling sediment transport in a watershed such as fryirs et al 2007 who focused on sediment dis connectivity and borselli et al 2008 who focused on upstream and downstream sediment transport a recent perspective article emphasizes the need to consider the many hydrologic and non hydrologic factors controlling sediment connectivity across a watershed bracken et al 2015 therefore our approach aims to extend sediment connectivity theory by developing a probabilistic framework that accounts for hydrologic and non hydrologic supply detachment transport and disconnectivity features second sediment connectivity is dynamic by its nature and varies temporally yet most models of sediment connectivity are static emphasizing physical connections in the landscape and do not capture dynamic features such as varying soil moisture conditions ambroise 2004 lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 fryirs 2013 therefore our approach aims to couple hydrologic connectivity within the watershed modeling framework to help elucidate the dynamic nature of sediment connectivity third we remind the reader that sediment connectivity alone does not provide erosive flux prediction bracken et al 2015 and therefore we couple their sediment connectivity theory with erosive formulae within the watershed modeling framework as a second contribution we advance knowledge of sediment disconnectivity for gently rolling watersheds most slopes of our study watershed are gentle or undulating although the steeper sections of complex hillslopes are classified as rolling in our system sims et al 1968 pp 58 usda 2017 pp 44 to highlight this idea we use the term gently rolling watershed which has been used previously concerning watersheds with similar terrain where fine sediment deposition occurs e g morris and fan 2009 and used extensively to describe our study region mcgrain 1983 and citations thereafter the upland morphology of gently rolling watersheds includes relatively stable land surfaces and ephemeral pathways jarrit and lawrence 2007 ford and fox 2014 mild gradients and fertile soils of gently rolling watersheds foster agricultural and suburban land uses which in turn further stabilizes the morphology of the sediment pathways and floodplains previous studies investigating sediment disconnectivity emphasize moderate and steep gradient systems e g fryirs et al 2007 borselli et al 2008 and gently rolling watersheds have been understudied the objective of the present research was twofold and includes i developing a watershed erosion model grounded in probability theory for sediment connectivity and ii investigating sediment connectivity and erosion within a gently rolling watershed we present a probabilistic based development of sediment connectivity that is general to the governing factors controlling sediment transport but can be tailored and parameterized for a watershed specific configuration we include the concept of dynamic connectivity of sediment transport by integrating hydrologic connectivity within a continuous based model simulation we use probability theory to develop a predictive model reliant upon the intersecting probabilities for sediment supply detachment transport and the absence of buffers the model predicts sediment flux temporally and spatially across the watershed using high resolution geospatial data field reconnaissance external modeling of hydrologic connectivity and erosion formulae we apply the model to a gently rolling watershed to fulfill our second objective 2 modeling framework and formulation the watershed erosion modeling framework includes geospatial field assessment and meteorological inputs that lead to three stages of model simulation to produce spatially and temporally explicit sediment connectivity and flux outputs see fig 1 high resolution geospatial data reflect the actual three dimensional landscape of the watershed inputs from field assessment identify features that may connect and disconnect sediment pathways across the watershed continuous precipitation and weather data provide information leading to the dynamic nature of the watershed s connectivity the first stage of modeling assists with simulating dynamic connectivity by integrating hydrologic connectivity within a continuous based model simulation for this stage we prescribe use of an off the shelf hydrologic model providing continuous simulation of soil moisture conditions and runoff depth across the watershed the second stage of modeling simulates the probability of sediment connectivity see fig 2 to estimate pathways and buffers impacting the delivery of sediment from the uplands to the stream corridor as a precursor to erosion rates and routing in stage three we express the intersecting probabilities of sediment supply detachment transport and the absence of buffers to produce the probability of sediment connectivity in fig 2 we specify the union of both hydrologic and non hydrologic processes mathematically we express the probability of sediment connectivity p c as 1 p c p s p d h d nh p t h t nh 1 p b where s denotes supply dh is hydrologic detachment dnh is non hydrologic detachment th is hydrologic transport tnh is non hydrologic transport and b is buffers the intersections and unions of probabilities via their multiplicative and summation definitions becomes 2 p c p s p d h p d nh p d h p d nh p t h p t nh p t h p t nh 1 p b the probability of sediment connectivity can be calculated when each process associated probability is known or can be estimated in the present study we take a boolean approach to eq 2 by modeling each geospatial grid cell represented across the landscape as having a probability of zero or one and then integration provides the watershed s net probability of sediment connectivity we keep eq 2 as general for the moment highlighting that future work could adopt a fuzzy or bayesian approach to the probabilities of each spatial cell several features of eq 2 require some elaboration as to their background and justification first we adopt a probabilistic definition of sediment connectivity because we recognize the stochastic nature of sediment transport across a heterogeneous landscape probability theory has long been a suitable approach to the sediment transport problem given the non uniformity of sediment size distributions the stochastic nature of turbulence and the heterogeneity of landscapes see examples of such studies in table 1 concerning sediment connectivity the probability approach is attractive because of its multiplicative ability to account for the many processes required for transport our approach reflects the ideas of borselli et al 2008 who defines the probability of connectivity as the probability that the landscape can transport sediment laterally and longitudinally in the fluvial network second the probability of sediment connectivity model reflects the necessity for co occurrence of sediment supply detachment and transport conditions as these processes are well known to potentially limit transport leopold et al 1964 third the model accepts the dynamic nature of the sediment transport controls e g jencso et al 2009 and thus couples with the stage one modeling fourth we include both non hydrologic connectivity i e connectivity caused by non fluvial processes and hydrologic connectivity given the recent realization of non hydrologic prevalence eolian transport landslides in some systems at some time scales see theory by bracken et al 2015 fifth we explicitly include the concept of disconnectivity via morphologic features and anthropogenic obstacles given the recent realization that buffers can create sediment disconnectivity fryirs et al 2007 fryirs 2013 the probability model in eq 2 may be applied for an entire watershed by using spatially explicit information across the landscape and thus reflects a distributed watershed modeling framework the output may be used to map erosion prone features and disconnected regions the output has specific utility in watershed erosion modeling because the probability of sediment connectivity for a hydrologic event is distributed spatially and can be integrated to estimate the active watershed area for sediment transport the third stage of modeling simulates erosion formulae for connected features and is tailored to the specific erosion processes known to exist in a watershed parameterization of the erosion formulae will vary depending on the timescale of intent the spatial scale reflecting the connected feature and the dominant sediment transport processes distributed across the upland landscape e g mass wasting fluvial erosion eolian transport outputs include both distributed soil loss and net sediment transport results we intend that the model may be verified via practical qualitative data of erosional features as well as quantitative data such that the model may be useful as a predictive tool in watershed studies 3 modeling application 3 1 study site we applied the model to the upper south elkhorn watershed 65 1 km2 located in the inner bluegrass physiographic region of kentucky usa see fig 3 the watershed has mixed land uses consisting of primarily agricultural lands 55 and urban areas 45 fry et al 2011 the watershed was chosen for model application because i past studies conducted in the watershed provide data results for calibration of modeling davis 2008 fox et al 2010 russo 2009 ford 2011 russo and fox 2012 ford 2014 ii on going data collection is conducted by the university of kentucky and the united states geological survey usgs and iii the proximity of the watershed to the university of kentucky headwaters of the south elkhorn creek originate in southwestern lexington kentucky within urban areas and the middle and lower watershed extends into agricultural pastureland gently rolling hills and relatively mild slopes characterize the land surface the stream channel is bedrock controlled with fine sediment deposits silt loams primarily make up the south elkhorn watershed s soil cover upland erosion occurs primarily through rill erosion and ephemeral gully erosion while diffusional erosion processes i e sheet and interrill erosion are a minor contribution to the overall sediment flux gumbert 2017 smallwood 2017 livestock and construction sites in the uplands exacerbate the detachment rates of sediment particles through the removal of protective vegetation and exposure to fluvial shear stresses evans 2017 the upper south elkhorn watershed is also characterized by long flat floodplains adjacent to the stream network air temperature ranges between on average 0 5 c in january to 24 5 c in july the average yearly rainfall for this region is 1148 mm the climate is classified as humid subtropical ulack et al 1998 the inner bluegrass region of kentucky usa is well recognized as exhibiting terrain with high karst potential thrailkill 1974 thrailkill et al 1991 phillips 2015 with the land surface showing depressions and sinkholes leading to springsheds based on analyses of geospatial data files and results published by taylor and nelson 2008 and the kentucky geological survey kgs 2017 the sub region of the south elkhorn watershed is immature karst terrain e g termed channel rich karst poor phillips et al 2004 relative to neighboring and nearby watersheds in the inner bluegrass for example the karst impacted drainage area of the south elkhorn watershed is very low 13 of the watershed drainage area see table 2 relative to other watersheds in the inner bluegrass region e g nearby watersheds show karst impacted drainage areas ranging from 26 to 99 see table 2 the result is highly consistent with past morphologic research in the inner bluegrass karst region where the landscape is organized into discrete local zones dominated by either karst or fluvial features to the near exclusion of the other phillips et al 2004 dye traces performed in the south elkhorn watershed have shown that existing sinkhole to spring flow pathways follow the same general pathways as topographic flowlines currens et al 2002 therefore we assume sediment pirated by sinkholes likely does not leave the watershed s topographic boundary nevertheless we realized the potential importance of the karst sinkhole to impart sediment disconnectivity hence we explicitly include the role of the karst terrain in watershed sediment connectivity modeling 3 2 field assessment geospatial data and hydrologic data a field assessment and geospatial analyses method was designed and carried out to identify sediment processes e g sheet rill and gully erosion instream sediment storage channel morphology and sediment disconnectivity the field method combined published methods to visually assess sediment in watersheds and streams including region specific methods nrcs 2009 rosgen 2001 usepa 1999 fryirs et al 2007 third rock consultants 2016 geospatial analyses of high resolution digital elevation models dems and orthophotos complimented the field work and were used to map karst sinkholes in the basin before field visits we created maps in arcgis version 10 4 1 showing the stream corridor surrounding land cover and tributaries we discretized reaches into sub reaches and spatially identified features for field inspection in the field we assessed connectivity of streambanks and floodplains the streambed upland hillslopes and tributaries we observed the density of vegetation surrounding the stream the structure of the banks and human infrastructure potentially influencing sediment transport we estimated channel bathymetry morphology and the type and depth of sediment stored in the streambed we assessed hillslope conditions through identification of the type of land use evidence of historic upland erosion and upland human interferences that may accelerate sediment transport via visual observations from within the stream network coupled with orthophotograph assessment we walked tributaries and noted bank angles heights bed material erosional hotspots and upstream land cover we geolocated photographs of dis connectivity within the watershed including check dams bedrock outcrops point bars depositional zones armoring zones connected hillslopes floodplains in stream features riffles runs and pools as well as upland features human or livestock interference to assess long term connectivity we coupled this method with the following procedures 1 we inferred evidence of strongly connected sediment transport pathways in the field by mapping erosion scars ephemeral gullies and concentrated flow pathways with evidence of erosion 2 we coupled the field disconnectivity assessment with gis analyses to observe larger and more prominent landscape features that might also influence the connectivity such as floodplains and karst sinkholes 3 we used general knowledge of the system gathered from field visits and data collection the past three years of study from researchers at the university of kentucky and 4 we compared landscape features land use and erosion pathways visually using multiple sets of orthophotos from varying years especially in regards to parameterizing the probability of non hydrologic detachment component of the model after completing each site visit we post processed reach information on a geospatial database using a weighting and averaging technique to score qualitatively several watershed sedimentation parameters including erosion deposition and lateral and longitudinal disconnectivity conglomerate scores led to the development of hotspot maps in particular the presence of buffers such as floodplains sinkholes farm dams and terraces within sub reaches qualitatively determined lateral disconnectivity we recognized the potential for subjectivity in the field assessment and thus multiple researchers individually scored each parameter of the sub reaches and the average of the researchers scores was used to create the conglomerate hotspot maps for the major parameters assessed one main utility of the field assessment and geospatial analyses was to understand disconnectivity from floodplains and karst sinkholes the land surface upstream of floodplain buffers was assumed disconnected from the stream network and thus not contributing to sediment flux at the watershed outlet approximately 5200 points simulated the extent of the delineated buffer features using archydro which is a set of data models that delineate and characterize watersheds in arcmap maidment 2002 and specifically the batch watershed delineation tool we determined the upstream contributing area of each point to delineate disconnected land another feature of potential sediment disconnectivity was water and sediment transport to karst sinkholes karst sinkholes are depressions leading to active or legacy i e clogged holes in the ground surface caused by cover collapse resulting from chemical dissolution of carbonate rock taylor 1992 in the south elkhorn sinkhole drainage area can vary from a few square meters to as large as five hectares where the former is from a relatively new cover collapse and the latter from successive dissolution and collapse leading to depression in the land surface during rainfall events runoff and eroded sediment can transport in the depressions and either deposit or enter the karst subsurface we quantified the extent of the sinkhole drainage area in our study basin using published files from the usgs and the kentucky geological survey currens et al 2002 taylor and nelson 2008 zhu et al 2014 kgs 2017 currens et al 2002 as well as references cited therein performed extensive study of the karst features in the basin and surrounding watersheds over the course of a 25 year period sinkhole occurrence drainage areas and flow pathways were mapped in a geospatial data file using dye trace studies water level data and inference geologic structure the existence of significant sinkhole and spring features and delineation methods currens et al 2002 taylor and nelson 2008 zhu et al 2014 the karst geospatial data served to highlight the percent coverage of sinkholes and their pathways and then we coupled the spatially explicit data with sediment connectivity modeling as discussed later additional hydrologic and geospatial data served as model inputs a land cover map was coupled with soil survey data as determined by the united states department of agriculture usda and the natural resources conservation service nrcs a high resolution dem created by the kentucky aerial photography and elevation data program in 2014 kyaped 2014 was used to predict the probability of connectivity at 1 5 m by 1 5 m practicality of using the high resolution dem is a function of its availability and computational processing time the high resolution dems are freely available for the entire state of kentucky usa where the study is performed simulation of the probability of connectivity model using a 1 5 m dem for a 62 km2 watershed for one year took 28 h on a desktop pc intel core i7 6700 cpu at 3 40 ghz 64 bit operating system x64 based processor the computational time will increase with watershed scale but the time could be offset with the use of parallel computing a usgs gage located near the watershed provided discharge data from october 1 2017 until the present turbidity and total suspended solids data were collected intermittently in the watershed since 2005 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa maintains a precipitation and temperature monitoring station at the lexington bluegrass airport located centrally in the watershed 3 3 hydrologic modeling we used an off the shelf hydrologic model deemed suitable for the study watershed to simulate the hydrologic connectivity the soil and water assessment tool swat was developed arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 swat 2012 to simulate the physical processes of water movement from different land uses and management practices at various watershed scales we chose this model due to its past successful application in the central kentucky usa region palanisamy and workman 2014 al aamery and fox 2016 and its wide popularity equation 3 represents the water balance equation used by swat to simulate the hydrologic cycle and is presented as 3 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surface e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil water content on day t mm of water sw 0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm of water r day is the amount of precipitation on day i mm of water q surface is the amount of

flow on day i mm of water hydrologic response units hrus group landscapes with similar land uses soil types and slopes swat outputs runoff soil water content and many other parameters for each hru at the indicated time step to simulate hydrologic connectivity each of the 62 hrus modeled within the upper south elkhorn were spatially mapped in arcmap and model results were assigned as attributes output parameters from swat used in the probability of connectivity model include daily runoff and daily curve number for each hru daily runoff for each hru is determined using the nrcs curve number

automatic calibration was adopted to calibrate the swat model for our watershed al aamery and fox 2016 on a daily basis the focus of this paper investigates sediment mobility at the event time scale because sediment connectivity is a dynamic processes ambroise 2004 lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 fryirs 2013 and because of the event based pulses of sediment transport that are important at the watershed scale fryirs 2013 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 of swat cup abbaspour et al 2007a b was used to perform the calibration sensitivity analysis and uncertainty of our results the statistical metrics selected for this study to assess the simulated versus the observed streamflow were the coefficient of determination r 2 percent bias pbias nash sutcliff efficiency nse and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr moriasi et al 2007 the degree of uncertainty of the calibrated model was assessed using the p factor and r factor swat 2012 the parameters chosen for model evaluation were selected based on what was reported in previous studies arnold et al 2012 two years 2004 2005 of the swat simulation were treated as a warm up period the model evaluation was consistent with methods and results in al aamery and fox 2016 model simulation from 2006 to 2010 served as the calibration phase while 2011 to 2013 served as the validation phase results from the model evaluation see table 3 showed the hydrologic model performed very well based on hydrologic model evaluation criteria outlined in moriasi et al 2007 the monthly time step model performance is considered satisfactory if the ns greater than 0 5 rsr less than 0 7 and pbias 25 our simulation met all criteria in both calibration and validation model performance on daily time steps is expected to be poorer than the criteria set for monthly time steps somewhat relaxing the mentioned thresholds moriasi et al 2007 engel et al 2007 in the present case the daily simulation meets the monthly threshold criteria further highlighting the very good performance of the model 3 4 probability of sediment connectivity modeling we parameterized the individual probabilities in eq 2 as a set of discrete piecewise distributions to represent small regions or geospatial cells of the watershed the six probabilities were estimated for each geospatial cell and the discretized results were later integrated to provide continuous distribution functions applicable to the entire watershed a simple piecewise function predicts the probability of sediment supply for a geospatial cell n as 6 p i s 1 if sediment is present within the cell 0 if sediment is absent within the cell where i is an index representing a geospatial cell we parameterized equation 6 through observations both from field visits and remote sensing of the occurrence of a sediment surface that might be eroded we consider erodible surfaces to be any pervious surface impervious surfaces were digitized using aerial imagery provided by the usda national agriculture imagery program naip in 2010 the digitization of the probability of sediment supply was converted into a raster with resolution of 1 5 m by 1 5 m we express the probability of hydrologic detachment using an excessive shear stress approach as 7 p ij d h 1 if τ fij τ cri 0 0 if τ fij τ cri 0 where j is an index representing a time step the probability of hydrologic detachment was a temporally varying probability because the runoff depth changes with time as function of the distribution of precipitation and soil conditions equation 7 evaluates the shear stress of the fluid in the geospatial cell τ f with respect to the critical shear stress the shear stress of the fluid was approximated via the fluid momentum equation considering one dimensional uniform flow see jain 2001 pp 58 the runoff depth of the geospatial cell for a given time step was estimated from the hydrologic model the energy gradient was assumed the landscape slope determined in arcmap the critical shear stress of the sediment to resist erosion was parameterized by considering the soil characteristics and land management characteristics controlling the binding of particles into aggregates tisdall and oades 1982 alberts et al 1995 foster et al 1995 lal 1999 critical shear stress was predicted using the empirical critical shear stress equation for rangeland soil alberts et al 1995 as a function of texture organic matter and soil bulk density which were available in the soil geospatial layers from the usda the probability of non hydrologic detachment considers the presence of natural or anthropogenic disturbance agents other than fluvial processes that might initiate sediment detachment as 8 p i d nh 1 if a disturbance agent exists 0 if a disturbance agent is not present equation 8 is not dependent on watershed scale however thorough field or remote sensing observations of non hydrologic disturbances that detach sediment from the soil surface must be identified to parameterize the probability of non hydrologic detachment examples include livestock that trample and dislodge soil particles and mechanized detachment that might occur during construction farms with livestock nearby the stream corridor and construction sites were digitized in arcmap and assumed to detach sediment other non hydrologic disturbances such as tillage vehicle traffic and mass wasting were not included in the analyses which is a potential limitation of the study however we assumed tillage vehicle traffic and mass wasting to be of small importance to sediment transport in this watershed for following reasons regarding tillage almost all of the agriculture in the watershed is hay pasture and cultivated crops account for less than 3 of the land cover see fig 3 of the existing cultivated crops most of the row crops are grown with no till and the farming industry protects the cropland from erosion smallwood 2017 dirt roads and skidding trails have been shown to increase connectivity in forest regions lópez vicente et al 2017 in the present study we do not expect roadways to cause sediment mobilization other than water accumulation in ditches from roadway runoff based on our field assessment there are no commonly used dirt roads in the watershed some gravel roads exist but these are highly compacted the agriculture lands had paved or gravel roads attributed to the profitable and optical equine industry the agriculture of the basin is well established pasture to serve the 3 billion dollar equine industry in the bluegrass and the horse farms generally do a good job of maintaining their pastureland resource esr 2013 smallwood 2017 the watershed falls within the low landslide incidence less than 1 5 of the area involved in the united states radbruch hall et al 1982 we found no evidence of mass wasting in the basin during field assessments which is consistent with the gently rolling topography we parameterize the probability for upstream hydrologic transport with the following piecewise function as 9 p ij t h up 1 if s aci s crij 0 0 if s aci s crij 0 where sac indicates the slope of geospatial cell i and is assumed equal to the energy gradient and scr represents the critical slope required to initiate ephemeral gully incision of geospatial cell i montgomery and dietrich 1994 vandaele et al 1996 torri and poesen 2014 equation 9 compares the actual slope sac with the critical slope scr to estimate the probability of upstream hydrologic transport when sac of the land surface in the geospatial cell is greater than the scr the probability is one for that individual cell we parameterized sac using gradient analyses of a dem we parameterize scr using the equation of vandaele 1993 as 10 s cri a i a i b where a is a coefficient representative of the local climate and land use and soil characteristics of geospatial cell i a is the upstream drainage area of geospatial cell i and b is an exponent the theory reflects the concept that the upstream drainage area may be a surrogate for the volume of concentrated surface runoff with sufficient magnitude and duration to sustain erosion vandaele 1993 torri and poesen 2014 empirically derived a critical slope upstream drainage area relationship for geospatial cells after extensively reviewing data collected by many researchers from 1983 to 2011 across six continents and the relationship between critical slope and the upslope area was included here as 11 s crij 0 73 c i e 1 3 rfc i 0 00124 s 0 05 ij 0 37 a i 0 38 where s0 05 represents the maximum potential loss to runoff as determined from the nrcs curve number cn method for a geospatial cell at a particular time step rfc is the rock fragment cover of the soil which affects the infiltration rate of runoff and c represents other sources of the variation of the coefficient a from equation 10 in geospatial cell i not accounted for by the cn approximation data from torri and poesen s 2014 study included numerous landscape features ranging from rills to large ephemeral gullies we included this equation in the model since these landscape features are known to facilitate sediment transport in the study basin the cn method is assumed appropriate because runoff initiates in the silt loam soils and the system as a whole is fluvial dominated sinkhole drainage areas cover 13 of the drainage basin but the sinkhole flow pathways align well with the dendritic stream network when runoff occurs water is routed through sinkholes to the shallow subsurface and out springheads connecting to the stream the cn method models the effect that vegetation land use and soil type have on runoff abstraction initial abstraction was predicted using the empirical equation developed by hawkins et al 2009 as 12 s 0 05 0 819 25 4 1000 cn ij 10 1 15 where cnij represents the curve number of cell i at time step j the daily curve number output for individual hrus via the swat hydrologic model represents cnij we parameterized the probability for downstream hydrologic transport as 13 p i t h dwn 1 ifs i s up n 0 0 ifs i s up n 0 where si representative of the slope in a particular geospatial cell was found by applying the slope tool in arcmap to the upper south elkhorn dem n is representative of the number of upstream cells flowing into cell i determined via the flow accumulation tool which estimates the number of cells flowing into a downstream cell s up is the sum of the slopes of each cell upstream of cell i this is determined by weighting the flow accumulation raster by the slope raster in this manner the fluid energy to transport sediment in cell i is compared to the incoming fluid energy the probability of downstream hydrologic transport parameterization reflects the static connectivity of the watershed when surrogating slope for the energy gradient of the fluid note disconnected cells downstream of connected cells do not necessarily cause deposition rather we imply that disconnected cells downstream of connected cells simply do not have the capacity to pick up more sediment that is contributable to the stream network we believe this is reasonable considering very low gradient features causing deposition are explicitly included in the probability of buffers equation and the realization that fine sediments once entrained can take hours or even days to settle jin and romkens 2001 jin et al 2002 le bissonnais et al 2004 owens et al 2007 liu et al 2008 rienzi et al 2018 the probability of non hydrologic transport represents processes such as eolian transport and land sliding however the present application focuses on a fluvial dominated system only thus non hydrologic transport was not parameterized we parameterize the probability of buffer disconnectivity as 14 p i b 1 if a buffer exists 0 if abuffer does not exist we identified features causing sediment disconnectivity via observations in the field assessment if features did exist the entire upstream region of the watershed that was disconnected was parameterized with p b 1 however we had uncertainty regarding the ability of karst sinkhole features to cause a net disconnectivity and act as buffers of lateral transport i e p b 1 within the basin sinkhole drainage areas are expected to pirate transported sediment or sediment may deposit in the surface depression itself similarly to the fallout of sediment transported from hillslopes to floodplains uncertainty of the disconnectivity occurs because pirated sediment may resurface at springheads and therefore the sediment may reconnect back to the fluvial network recent studies in the inner bluegrass have mixed results regarding springhead sediment production for example we analyzed karst spring sediment productivity from data reported in recent journal papers for the inner bluegrass reed et al 2010 husic et al 2017a b husic et al 2017b showed the royal spring to produce an order of magnitude lower sediment concentration than surface streams during hydrologic events of various magnitude reed et al 2010 showed two springs in the region produced sediment concentrations on the same order of magnitude as surface streams albeit they collected data from rather substantial hydrologic events with 4 to 6 cm of rainfall in the south elkhorn the sinkhole drainage area is small 13 of the drainage area relative to surrounding basins see table 2 but springhead sediment production may not be negligible therefore we perform disconnectivity analyses and propagate the analyses through the probability of connectivity modeling by considering the sinkhole drainages as disconnected and separately analyzed the watershed considering the sinkholes as connected the analyses provides upper and lower level uncertainty bounds on our results 3 5 surface erosion modeling the probability of sediment connectivity model provides the spatially explicit erosion features and the active contributing area for sediment transport in any time step the erosion model simulates sediment yield at the watershed outlet by integrating the daily volume of eroded sediment from the active contributing area predicted by the probability of connectivity model at the specified time step yearly sediment yield is predicted by integrating the daily sediment yield daily sediment yield was predicted as 15 s y ε ρ s tlw where sy is the sediment yielded at the watershed outlet from the active contributing area tonnes ε is the erosion rate m s as predicted by the partheniades 1965 equation ρ s is the bulk density of the sediment kg m3 t is the amount of time sediment is contributed from the active contributing area s l is the length of the eroding rill or ephemeral gully m and w is the width of the eroding rill or ephemeral gully m we assume the erosion rate is proportional to shear stress in excess of the critical shear stress of the eroding surface as predicted by partheniades 1965 as 16 ε k d τ f τ cr where ε is the erosion rate of the soil m s kd is the erodibility coefficient m3 n s τ cr is the critical shear stress of the eroding surface pa and τ f is the effective shear stress pa of the accumulated flow on the eroding surface the effective shear stress of the accumulated flow on the eroding surface was approximated via the fluid momentum equation considering one dimensional uniform flow of runoff and runoff depth was approximated using the darcy weisbach approach e g jain 2001 the inputs to the erosion model are shown in table 4 and included the critical shear stress of the eroding surface bathymetries channel lengths relative roughness of the channel bulk density of the eroded sediment storm length the time sediment is produced from an eroding channel and an erodibility coefficient we specified several parameters using literature derived methods time of concentration was used as a surrogate for storm length when surface erosion was occurring we applied three methods to estimate the storm length including the watershed lag method mockus 1961 the velocity method nrcs 2010 and the kirpich equation wanielista et al 1997 average rill and gully width were empirically parameterized using the equation developed by nachtergaele et al 2002 erodibility kd and critical shear stress τ cr of the eroding soil were parameterized via typical literature values alberts et al 1995 hanson and simon 2001 we applied the friction factor following the colebrook white equation the relative roughness ranged between 10 and 20 of the flow depth to estimate the net erosion rate of the connected cells cells were lumped into three discrete fractions based on upstream contributing area a flow accumulation raster within the gis model was multiplied with the probability of sediment connectivity raster to estimate the upstream contributing area for each cell we chose size fractions iteratively such that several orders of magnitude of upstream contributing area were represented the average slope of the connected cells was estimated using the most connected day of the first study year the accumulated flow rate was determined for each cell by multiplying the average upstream contributing area times the runoff depth at the particular time step and then dividing by a representative storm length we performed data assimilation to reduce propagation of error from the water model to the sediment model as mentioned the hydrologic model performed very well see table 3 however even when a hydrologic model performs very well differences between point observation and point simulation of the model results will still occur we did not want to propagate these differences through the sediment transport model so we performed data assimilation for days when the predicted average flow rate differed by more than 30 of the actual average daily flow rate mahoney 2017 in turn the sediment model could better reflect the actual runoff of the individual day and reduce propagation of error to the sediment formulae we calibrated and validated the erosion model by comparing the prediction of daily sediment flux to sediment flux estimated via measurements at the watershed outlet sediment flux estimates were completed by russo and fox 2012 using automated sampling and the einstein approach einstein 1950 the model was iteratively calibrated so the predicted daily sediment flux matched as closely as possible with the observed sediment flux three hydrologic events were used to calibrate the model and two hydrologic events were used for validation mahoney 2017 calibration parameters that were adjusted included the erodibility coefficient kd the critical shear stress of the eroding surface τ cr the relative roughness of the channel surface ε d the length of storm and the contribution time of sediment from the eroding surface the coefficient of determination and the nash sutcliff coefficient were optimized during calibration thereafter annual sediment yield was compared with results from russo 2009 for additional verification 4 results 4 1 evaluating model sensitivity we investigated how each probability in eq 1 captured well known erosion mechanisms to validate the probability of connectivity model was working well our validation was confirmed as shown in fig 4 where the individual probabilities predict disconnectivity from impervious surfaces with no sediment supply low gradient surfaces with limited shear surfaces towards the top of a slope length with limited flow accumulation and surfaces upstream of buffers we next investigated the sensitivity of the individual probabilities to the results integration showed the probability of upstream transport exhibited the most control on the probability of connectivity and this was true of both moderate and high rainfall events simulated throughout the model run see fig 5 differences in the results for moderate and high rainfall events show the dynamic nature of the probabilities of detachment and upstream transport given their dependence on hydrologic connectivity the probabilities of downstream transport buffer disconnectivity and supply are shown in fig 5 to be static given their dependence on the topography morphologic features and human associated land cover the dominant control of upstream transport in the present study qualitatively agrees with the high success of the borselli et al 2008 model founded on upstream transport nevertheless the results in fig 5 show the importance of the other individual probabilities we included in our sediment connectivity model our sensitivity analysis fig 6 next focused on evaluating parameters in the model affecting the sediment connectivity including the critical shear stress and sediment transport coefficients and results suggest our model parameterization is robust for the conditions of our application the critical shear stress of sediment to resist detachment showed a lack of sensitivity until reaching a value of approximately 15 pa fig 6a and critical shear stress parameterization beyond this threshold could reduce the sediment connectivity by as much as 100 the high critical shear stresses reflect surface conditions more akin to vegetated channels and consolidated stabilized bank soil conditions millar and quick 1998 the 15 pa threshold is considerably higher than the critical shear stress expected for agricultural surface erosion processes alberts et al 1995 and we do not expect such high critical shear stress conditions across the soils of the present study the b exponent represents the flow condition to initiate erosion and showed a lack of sensitivity until reaching very low values for the exponent of approximately 0 2 the very low threshold for sensitivity reflects conditions of viscous laminar flow conditions results show that such laminar conditions would double sediment connectivity in the watershed and these conditions reflect the dominance of pure sheet flow or perhaps pseudo laminar flows with extremely high sediment concentrations nevertheless we do not expect these conditions in the concentrated turbulent flow pathways to occur in the present study montgomery and dietrich 1994 vandaele et al 1996 torri and poesen 2014 the c factor represents additional fluid and sediment pathways in the landscape that are not captured by the surface transport formula and previous research emphasized the ability of the c factor to reflect piping torri and poesen 2014 suggest a range of 0 1 to 0 4 reflects pronounced piping results show that a c factor in this range would nearly double sediment connectivity estimated from the model although the south elkhorn soils do not experience piping given the lack of soil texture variation vertically in the soil column fox et al 2006 the south elkhorn does have immature karst and 13 of the drainage area is sinkhole controlled rather than adjusting the c factor to try and account for the karst we accounted for sinkholes within the probability of buffers term see below for additional discussion of karst sinkholes we next investigated the sensitivity of geospatial resolution upon the results dem resolution showed a substantial impact on the results the 9 m by 9 m dem estimated the probability of sediment connectivity to be nearly two times greater than the 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem for the most highly connected days of the year fig 6b the sensitivity of the dems was a noteworthy result and on average the deviation between the 1 5 m by 1 5 m and 9 m by 9 m dem was 80 the low resolution dem always estimated greater connectivity we carried forward the higher resolution 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem when estimating sediment connectivity for several reasons the higher resolution dem better reflects the microtopography of the landscape and its ability or lack thereof to accumulate water which agrees with recent sentiment by cavalli et al 2013 that higher resolution dems better reflect the actual landscape in connectivity studies visually broad regions of connectivity and disconnectivity agree with one another for both the 1 5 m by 1 5 m and 9 m by 9 m dems see fig 6c however results show the 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem better captures the microtopography including steeper gradient swales where water accumulates before entering the stream while the 9 m by 9 m dem masks across leads and ridges in the topography and treats entire sub regions of the land surface as connected also locally flat surfaces recognizable within the 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem were masked in 9 m by 9 m dem and further increased the connectivity estimate we inspected the results and found delineation of the landscape contributing area was one mathematical reason for higher connectivity estimates from the low resolution dem as the upstream contributing area increases so too does the accumulated runoff to transport sediment in the ephemeral pathways of the uplands reflected via the probability of upstream transport the lower resolution 9 m by 9 m dem masks across locally flat surfaces in upstream geospatial scales and in turn increases the contributing area and the probability of connectivity we considered the sensitivity of karst sinkholes upon connectivity results sinkholes intercept approximately 13 of the watershed s drainage and are distributed throughout the landscape see fig 7 we realized the potential importance of the sinkholes to impart sediment disconnectivity due to buffering lateral transport i e p b 1 because sinkhole drainage areas may pirate transported sediment or sediment may deposit within the surface depression at the same time pirated sediment may resurface at springheads and reconnect back to the fluvial network i e p b 0 this consideration was also deemed possible because dye traces showed that sinkhole pathways are consistent with the dendritic surface network in this watershed see insert in fig 7 we considered a net disconnectivity versus net connectivity effect of the sinkhole drainage areas and found that the uncertainty from the karst features had a rather small effect on results for example the probability of connectivity varied from 12 1 to 13 5 on a wet day of the simulation period when including the karst uncertainty the result is commensurate with the 13 coverage of sinkhole drainage in the south elkhorn at the same time the results highlight the potential of karst sinkholes to cause sediment disconnectivity from microtopography we include this uncertainty component by accounting for the range of results throughout the remainder of the paper generally predicted and observed daily sediment flux values showed good agreement when comparing data and modeling results fig 8 a assimilation of hydrologic data during calibration and validation reduced the propagation of error from the hydrologic model to the watershed erosion model and we found substantial differences in daily sediment flux when comparing assimilated and non assimilated model runs fig 8b however data assimilation did not affect net sediment yield results at the end of the simulation period the results highlight the effectiveness of our data assimilation procedure for calibration purposes on an event based daily to multi day basis but also the annual prediction capabilities of the watershed erosion model for times when data assimilation is not possible annual sediment yield for the watershed 3300 140 t y 1 was 2 more than annual sediment yield estimated for the upland contribution reported in russo and fox 2012 for the same period which provides further verification of the modeling results sensitivity analysis of parameters calibrated in the watershed erosion model showed the importance of the erodibility coefficient fig 8c which varies widely in the literature e g review in hanson and simon 2001 the time of concentration also showed moderate sensitivity upon sediment flux while the impact of the friction coefficient and critical shear stress of sediment to resist erosion was marginal upon the sediment yield results 4 2 watershed scale results the probability of sediment connectivity varied throughout the year fig 9 and reached a maximum value of 12 8 0 7 on march 12 day 72 of the study year when high rainfall fell on wet soils the results imply 12 8 0 7 of the watershed s surface had the potential to erode sediment on march 12 the mean sediment connectivity for the 104 days with some connectivity was 2 26 0 1 and the standard deviation was 3 5 0 15 sediment connectivity ranged from 0 to 1 5 for 67 of the 104 days and ranged from 1 7 to 13 for remaining 37 days fig 10 a the beta distribution best fit the dynamic connectivity results the beta distribution is a logical choice for representation of the dynamic probability given the beta distribution is continuous but bounded by 0 and 1 and therefore is suitable for representing the behavior of probabilities results showed that the probability of sediment connectivity alone was not a good predictor of sediment flux we highlight this idea in fig 10b where temporal results are different for the probability of sediment connectivity and sediment flux obviously sediment flux occurs only when some sediment connectivity exists but sediment connectivity by itself does not predict sediment flux as recently noted by bracken et al 2015 modeling results estimate that sediment connectivity was spatially distributed across the watershed and that the northern region of the south elkhorn watershed exhibits the highest sediment connectivity we attribute the spatially distributed results to a shift in the soil conditions in this region engineering properties of the soils shift from being dominated by moderately drained soils i e nrcs hydrologic soil group b in the southern and central regions of the watershed to dominated by poorly and very poorly drained soils i e nrcs hydrologic groups c and d in the northern region the nrcs attributes the shift in the engineering properties to the decrease in percent sand and increase in percent fine clay in the northern region nrcs 2009 sediment connectivity is slightly higher in the central eastern region of the watershed relative to the central western and southern regions the result reflects the higher contribution of urban and suburban land uses in the central eastern region which in turn produce impervious surfaces higher estimated runoff and therefore higher values for the probability of hydrologic detachment and probability of upstream hydrologic transport we also assessed longitudinal variability of sediment connectivity by investigating the probability of sediment connectivity from catchment 1 km2 to mid sized watershed scales 60 km2 longitudinal variability results included a weak increase in the probability of sediment connectivity with scale fig 10c and the variance of sediment connectivity was highest at the smaller scale the longitudinal variability of sediment connectivity reflects competing processes operating at different scales in a watershed configuration phillips 2003 borselli et al 2008 fryirs 2013 researchers suggest relatively steep landscape gradients promote sediment connectivity at smaller scales such as hillslope and small catchment scales fryirs et al 2007 on the other hand as the watershed scale increases fluid accumulation has the potential to increase fluid shear stress and produce hydrologic connectivity for conveying sediment borselli et al 2008 the weak power function result tends to suggest the latter process i e flow accumulation for the south elkhorn which we attribute to the dominance of erosion in concentrated flow pathways as opposed to sheet erosion processes 4 3 features of connectivity and disconnectivity unsurprisingly sediment connectivity was high for the ephemeral network steep slopes in newly constructed areas ditches adjacent to roadways and hillslopes adjacent to the stream see fig 11 in turn erosion prone landscape features showed sediment flux from these sources and the watershed erosion model results provided a spatially explicit estimate of erosion rates see fig 12 the results further validated that our model was working well because past research has suggested that erosion dominates from rill erosion ephemeral gully erosion and concentrated flow pathways in the watershed gumbert 2017 smallwood 2017 and livestock and construction sites have been suggested to show increased detachment rates evans 2017 more surprisingly sediment disconnectivity was dominated by microtopography across the gently rolling landscape the greatest control on disconnectivity was the probability of upstream transport fig 5 and upon further inspection of results from the high resolution dem we found that the disconnectivity occurs because undulating land surfaces produces local low to zero gradient surfaces i e flat slopes the microtopography from the undulations causes small sources of disconnectivity because runoff loses its energy in small depressions our field visits during storm events justified the geospatial model results we found that even during intense rainfall events when runoff and flow accumulation were pronounced in ditches and swales there was little to no runoff or sediment transport across pastureland surfaces and rather pooling within microtopographic depressions the microtopography identified with the high resolution dem is noteworthy given the watershed itself was not flat i e average hillslope gradient was 7 the potential of karst microtopography to impart disconnectivity is also noteworthy sinkhole microtopography may pirate transported sediment or cause fallout within depressions similarly to floodplain deposition thus increasing lateral disconnectivity while sinkhole impact was relatively small in this basin sinkhole microtopography could potentially act as the dominant in neighboring basins in this region see table 2 as well as other regions with karst morphology other recent studies corroborate the importance of microtopography upon sediment connectivity phillips et al 2017 shows that microtopography associated with pits from tree uprooting and local surface armoring of rock fragments can disconnect erosion processes in an old growth forest lopez et al 2017 shows that a high resolution dem is useful to reveal how microtopography impacts hydrological connectivity for roads and skidding trails in forest catchments the usefulness of high resolution dems is encouraging for sediment connectivity studies the floodplains are another disconnecting feature yet the floodplains did not dominate disconnectivity as perhaps sometimes assumed based on our field assessment while walking the stream corridor we initially presumed such a dominant behavior for the upper south elkhorn watershed due to the prevalence of floodplains with flat gradients adjacent to the stream network however after completing the spatially explicit modeling we found that floodplains buffered only 5 of the catchment we recognized that the net effect of floodplains causes disconnectivity beyond the 5 measure due to the extension of low gradient surfaces forcing deposition of sediment from adjacent hillslopes draining to the floodplains nevertheless the net effect of the floodplains was only 35 disconnectivity which was low relative to the probabilities of detachment upstream transport and downstream transport i e 55 to 90 disconnectivity during hydrologic events see example in fig 5b 5 discussion 5 1 spatially explicit and computational advancement of watershed erosion modeling our results show the efficacy of the probability of sediment connectivity approach to advance watershed erosion modeling for several reasons first results show that the approach accounts for spatial variability across the landscape by coupling the probability of sediment connectivity with the high resolution digital elevation model dem the high resolution dem helps resolve specific erosion features and sources such as sediment connectivity around roadside ditches and disconnectivity from flat land surface gradients in general advantages of the 1 5 m by 1 5 m dem suggest the researcher acquire the highest resolution dem possible which tends to agree with sentiment in the literature cavalli et al 2013 however some qualification is needed and we suggest an upper limit is conceivable based on the underlying fluid mechanics assumptions for example calculations of both the probability of detachment and the probability of transport assume the landscape gradient equals the energy gradient of the fluid these simplified representations assume the fluid mechanics in a geospatial cell may be treated as uniform flow the assumption is reasonable albeit a recognized practical simplification when the flow depth across the landscape is on the order of a few centimeters while the streamwise length scale is two orders of magnitude greater the assumption may break down and require further investigation as to its sensitivity as the dem resolution increases to a resolution of a few centimeters a resolution that is no longer out of the question as technology continues to improve in this case the flow depth of runoff would be on the same order of magnitude as the resolution of the streamwise length scale and individual large roughness elements act as hydraulic controls inducing non uniformity to the flow the landscape gradient in the profile of the hydraulic controls will be more extreme than the energy gradient of the flow for example an adverse landscape gradient has the potential to predict disconnectivity when the decelerating flow still has sufficient fluid shear stress to detach sediment we point out that applying a very high few centimeter resolution dem in the probability of sediment connectivity does not negate the multiplicative theoretical basis for intersecting probabilities however researchers might consider parameterizing the flow as non uniform across the landscape for such a high resolution application second our results show that the watershed erosion model structure accounts for supply shear and transport criteria of sediment transport coupling sediment connectivity in watershed erosion models is a new area of research and we suggest the approach provides the modeler with an added tool to account for sediment transport criteria via permutations of erosion formulae and connectivity principles we highlight our model application as one such permutation the model approach considers sediment supply limitations in a spatially explicit manner by calculating the probability of sediment supply using geospatial analyses the approach considers transport limitations explicitly by calculating upstream and downstream probabilities of transport at each cell see fig 4 and by identifying buffer discontinuities using field reconnaissance with supply and transport accounted we emphasized the shear limitation when coupling to the surface erosion formulae we maximized the advantages of the spatially explicit datasets and the quantitative hydraulic formulae when considering shear supply and transport limitations for the specific conditions of our system we expect researchers may find many other permutations of erosion formulae and connectivity principles in future modeling of watershed erosion third we highlight that reducing the cost of computational hydrology is another attractive feature of a connectivity based watershed erosion model in the present application the watershed modeling included calculations for 3 1010 space time combinations the probability of sediment connectivity subroutine added explicit formulae to the watershed erosion model and a geospatial modeling software performed calculations requiring several hours to run on a desktop pc considering all space time combinations in the watershed modeling only 0 7 of the combinations contained connectivity therefore the model carried forward only 2 108 space time combinations in the hydraulic and sediment transport formulae and removed 2 98 1010 space time calculations hydraulic calculations are often computationally intensive requiring solution of implicit formulae at each space time step computational sediment transport is even more demanding as higher dimensional formulae e g see above discussion of flow non uniformities and as researchers implement advanced routing methods thus we suggest the inclusion of the connectivity based watershed erosion model may have a net reduction in overall computational complexity further the connectivity based watershed erosion model provides the flexibility to include advanced computational complexity simulation of the breach of a buffer within the watershed configuration e g see descriptions in bracken et al 2015 allows calling up sophisticated hydraulic and sediment subroutines that could simulate such spatiotemporal feedback and connectivity between sediment sources and sinks 5 2 extending our view of sediment disconnectivity and connectivity the newly quantified features of the gently rolling watershed complement existing knowledge and extend our view of disconnectivity our results agree with the concept that the gently rolling watershed morphology includes relatively stable land surfaces ephemeral flow pathways and the presence of decoupled floodplains jarrit and lawrence 2007 ford and fox 2014 that can lead to trapping of as much as 90 of mobilized sediments in disconnected land surfaces meade et al 1990 hupp 2000 walling et al 2006 our results reflect this idea and show spatial disconnectivity on the order of 90 on the wettest day of the year microtopography across the landscape dominates disconnectivity because local low to zero gradient surfaces cause the ponding of runoff and sediment deposition in the undulating landscape our result is corroborated by past studies where sediment erosion from diffusive processes on land surfaces of the uplands only travel a spatial scale of several meters or less roering et al 1999 as well as by recent results highlighting the influence of microtopography in forest catchments lopez et al 2017 phillips et al 2017 karst microtopography and the ability of sinkholes to pirate transported sediment and cause lateral disconnectivity is also noteworthy for the gently rolling watershed the ephemeral network represents the most connected morphology of the uplands however disconnectivity persists through much of the ephemeral network even during high magnitude events floodplains cause lateral disconnectivity due to their potential to break connectivity between the ephemeral network and main channel which is consistent with the work of others goudie 2004 florsheim et al 2006 kronvang et al 2007 jaeger et al 2017 only about 10 of the uplands showed lateral sediment connectivity with the stream for the gently rolling watershed which contrasts steeper gradient systems where connectivity results are much higher e g fryirs et al 2007 fryirs et al 2007 predicted the active contributing area for four landscape units in the upper hunter catchment in australia which have relatively high elevation deep dissection and a rugged hilly landscape nearly 50 of the catchment was connected for a moderate storm event which contrasts greatly with our gently rolling results of 10 connectivity for one of the most hydrologically intensive days of the year we caution fine scale quantitative comparisons of papers given the modeling approaches applied and dem resolution applied nevertheless we mention the vast differences in connectivity that cast gently rolling watersheds as event resilient disconnected systems regarding sediment connectivity one potentially interesting result is the net importance of ditches and roadside gullies in the urban regions the urban regions showed net higher connectivity than surrounding agricultural regions the importance of roadways to induce erosion and sediment connectivity has been discussed previously for mountainous catchments latocha 2014 and urban sprawl i e urbanization has been well understood to induce gully formation and channeling processes trimble 1993 however few papers to our knowledge have reported the net importance of roadway ditches and gullies in well established urban environments more generally these ephemeral networks of urban and suburban regions may exhibit more sediment connectivity than agricultural regions in gently rolling systems given the presence of a higher concentration of impervious surfaces and the well defined drainage network promoting flow accumulation the exception would likely be poorly managed watersheds where agricultural best management practices have yet to be adopted 6 conclusions model evaluation results verify the capability of the probability of sediment connectivity to be integrated within watershed erosion modeling the modeling approach accounts for the spatial variability of sediment connectivity across the landscape and high resolution dems were able to predict erosion features impacting sediment connectivity and disconnectivity we suggest this approach provides the modeler with an added tool to account for sediment transport criteria given that each of the individual sediment probabilities exhibit some importance and coupling with erosion formulae provides sediment flux estimates we also highlight the potential ability of the approach to reduce the cost of computational hydrology as modeling tools rely more and more on high resolution prediction in the gently rolling watershed results show that sediment connectivity occurs within ephemeral pathways across the uplands but disconnectivity dominates the watershed configuration both spatially and temporally all morphologic levels of the uplands exhibit disconnecting features including microtopography causing low energy undulating surfaces karst sinkholes disconnecting drainage areas and floodplains that de couple the hillslopes from the stream corridor only 12 8 0 7 of the gently rolling watershed shows sediment connectivity on the wettest day of the year spatially results highlight the importance of sediment connectivity in urban and suburban pathways given the well defined channel network and influence of impervious surfaces dynamic and longitudinal results suggest the beta distribution and power function respectively might be further investigated for their ability to reflect the gently rolling watershed s connectivity more generally acknowledgements we thank an anonymous reviewer for comments that helped us to improve greatly the quality of the work we

literature source method reported conclusion this present study heinen 2006 normalized sensitivity elasticity analysis denitrification is most sensitive to moisture function nitrogen process including denitrification and nitrification is sensitive to moisture condition instead of to the parameter of moisture function see section 5 4 wang et al 2005 two step global sensitivity analysis nitrogen simulation is sensitivity to denitrification parameters on temperature parameters on temperature function are important however the optimal denitrification rate is more important see table 2 and 6 bateman and baggs 2005 laboratory experiment nitrification is the main process in nitrogen reactive at low moisture the importance of nitrification activity increases with low soil moisture nitrification also becomes more important at low temperature see table 2 and 6 furthermore the increasing importance of nitrification activity with decreased temperature depends on the selected model see table 2 and 6 stevens et al 1997 laboratory experiment denitrification and nitrification are alternately dominant our study is consistent with their conclusion however such alternation also depends on the selected models see table 2 and 6 mcintyre et al 2005 regionalized sensitivity analysis the most sensitive parameters were spatially inconsistent the importance of parameter not only varies with space but also varies substantially among models and scenarios see table 6 table 5 variance of simulated nitrate concentration for individual models columns 2 5 and model averaging the

reactive transport modeling is subject to uncertainty in model parameters structures and scenarios by using a new variance based global sensitivity analysis method this paper identifies important parameters for nitrogen reactive transport with simultaneous consideration of these three uncertainties a combination of three scenarios of soil temperature and two scenarios of soil moisture creates a total of six scenarios four alternative models describing the effect of soil temperature and moisture content are used to evaluate the reduction functions used for calculating actual reaction rates the results show that for nitrogen reactive transport problem parameter importance varies substantially among different models and scenarios denitrification and nitrification process is sensitive to soil moisture content status rather than to the moisture function parameter nitrification process becomes more important at low moisture content and low temperature however the changing importance of nitrification activity with respect to temperature change highly relies on the selected model model averaging is suggested to assess the nitrification or denitrification contribution by reducing the possible model error despite the introduction of biochemical heterogeneity or not fairly consistent parameter importance rank is obtained in this study optimal denitrification rate k den is the most important parameter reference temperature t r is more important than temperature coefficient q 10 empirical constant in moisture response function m is the least important one vertical distribution of soil moisture but not temperature plays predominant role controlling nitrogen reaction this study provides insight into the nitrogen reactive transport modeling and demonstrates an effective strategy of selecting the important parameters when future temperature and soil moisture carry uncertainties or when modelers face with multiple ways of establishing nitrogen models keywords nitrification and denitrification reduction function model averaging scenario averaging sobol method of sensitivity analysis 1 introduction the nitrogen cycle together with the carbon cycle plays an important role in sustaining subsurface and terrestrial environments and ecosystems european environment agency eea 2000 galloway et al 2004 rivett et al 2007 in subsurface hydrology nitrogen reactive transport modeling is a vital tool for simulating nitrogen transformation and for estimating the amount of nitrogen transport within and between soil and groundwater nitrogen reactive transport modeling is complicated for the fact that nitrogen transport is controlled by a large number of physical chemical and biological processes and their associated parameters it is important to identify the important parameters that control nitrogen reactive transport so that limited resources can be used to better characterize the important parameters to improve the accuracy of model predictions the identification of important parameters is nontrivial due in part to the following three challenges 1 the parameters vary substantially in space and time and it is uncertain which parameter values should be used for the identification of important parameters 2 the parameters may be used by a number of alternative models and the parameter importance may vary between different models 3 the scenarios of future system conditions under which model predictions are made are uncertain and the scenario uncertainty may affect the parameter importance while existing methods of global sensitivity analysis are able to identify important parameters under parametric uncertainty griensven et al 2006 mishra et al 2009 saltelli et al 2010 rakovec et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 razavi and gupta 2015 2016a b song et al 2015 wainwright et al 2014 there has been few study that identifies important parameters under model and scenario uncertainty for nitrogen reactive transport modeling model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty are prevalent in nitrogen reactive transport modeling with respect to model uncertainty various models have been developed based on different conceptual and mathematical descriptions of nitrogen reactive transport hansen et al 1995 compared five alternative models animo soiln omni nleap and daisy and heinen 2006 reviewed more than fifty models frolking et al 1998 described four models century dndc expert n and nasa casa for simulating nitrous oxide n2o emissions wu and mcgechan 1998 compared four soil nitrogen dynamics models animo sundial soiln and daisy rodrigo et al 1997 discussed nine models that have been developed for simulating the effects of temperature and water content on carbon and nitrogen transformation in soils following meyer et al 2014 a scenario is defined as a future state or condition under which the models are simulated with respect to scenario uncertainty it is always uncertain under what future temperature and precipitation conditions nitrogen reactive transport predictions are made and there is also no consensus on how scenarios influence model predictions for example heinen 2006 found that moisture content is important to denitrification wang et al 2005 reported that temperature is a controlling factor of denitrification pohlert et al 2007 pointed out that ph is important to nitrogen cycling mcintyre et al 2005 and wang et al 2013 considered impacts of spatial variability of model parameters e g hydraulic conductivity on nitrogen transport these studies indicate that the nitrogen reactive transport models are diverse and that these models are used under different future system conditions this study is focused on identifying the important parameters that control nitrification and denitrification which play an important role in the nitrogen cycle particularly speaking the model uncertainty considered in this study are related to various reduction functions used in literature for estimating actual nitrification and denitrification rates the rates are evaluated by multiplying potential rates the maximum rates under optimal conditions with reduction functions that depend on various factors such as nitrate concentration moisture content temperature and ph of soils see the review article of heinen 2006 and references therein since the factors affect nitrification and denitrification in different ways a number of reduction functions have been developed and it is often uncertain which function should be used taking denitrification as an example according to heinen 2006 reduction by soil conditions is site specific and therefore a universal simple process model for denitrification does not seem to exist for all the reduction functions they heavily depend on soil temperature and moisture which affect microbial processes in soils rodrigo et al 1997 the two factors usually vary substantially in space and time and the variation leads to scenario uncertainty it is necessary to identify important parameters for a range of future temperature and precipitation rather than for fixed e g present day temperature and precipitation values there are some other factors such as ph and soil organic carbon that may affect nitrogen reactive transport but they are ignored in this study with the consideration of parametric uncertainty model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty the following three questions are raised immediately for identifying important parameters in nitrogen reactive transport problem 1 are the parameters important to one model also important to another model 2 are parameters important under one prediction condition still important under another prediction condition 3 how scenario affects the performance of model prediction this study answers the above three questions in the field of nitrogen reactive transport modeling by using a method recently developed by dai and ye 2015 different from existing methods of global sensitivity that can be used only for a single model and a single modeling scenario this method considers multiple models and multiple scenarios in the context of model averaging and scenario averaging rather than choosing a single model and define a single scenario model and scenario averaging method is introduced to alleviate the disparity of sensitivity analysis between different models and scenarios although this study is focused on the nitrification and denitrification processes the method of global sensitivity analysis is mathematically general and can be applied to other reactive transport processes of nitrogen and other contaminants it is hoped that this study can provide a framework and an example of using global sensitivity analysis to select important parameters in nitrogen modeling and reactive transport modeling in a broad sense under the uncertainty of model parameters structures and scenarios to the best of our knowledge such an example is unprecedented in the rest of this paper section 2 describes the new method for variance based global sensitivity analysis under parametric model and scenario uncertainties section 3 presents the details of nitrogen reactive transport modeling at the lysimeter scale as well as the six modeling scenarios four models and the parameter distributions the results of sensitivity analysis are listed in section 4 in section 5 we discussed the necessity of consideration of models and scenarios in sensitivity analysis and the impact of scenarios on nitrogen processes the conclusions of this study are given in section 6 2 methodology this section gives a brief description of the sensitivity indices defined by dai and ye 2015 for the following three situations 1 for a single model and a single scenario 2 for multiple models but a single scenario and 3 for multiple models and multiple scenarios the details of deriving the indices are referred to dai and ye 2015 for a single model m and a single scenario s y f x m s where y is a scalar model output and x x 1 x 2 x k denotes a vector of random model parameters when considering model and scenario uncertainty the model output can be written as y f x m s where m denotes a model set with multiple models m m 1 m 2 m j and s denotes a scenario set with multiple scenarios s s 1 s 2 s i respectively since parameters are different in different models x is the union of parameters in each model x x 1 x 2 x j where x j is the parameters of model m j by using the law of total variance and the law of total expectation the predictive variance of y can be decomposed as dai and ye 2015 1 v y e s e m s e x m s v y x m s e s e m s v x m s e y x m s e s v m s e x m s e y x m s v s e m s e x m s e y x m s where m s and x m s indicate the hierarchical relations that models are conditioned on scenarios and that parameters are conditioned on models and scenarios note that the total uncertainty consists of three parts i e parameter model and scenario uncertainty while the interactions between them are ignored the four terms at the right hand side of eq 1 represent data uncertainty e s e m s e x m s v y x m s parametric uncertainty e s e m s v x m s e y x m s model uncertainty e s v m s e x m s e y x m s and scenario uncertainty v s e m s e x m s e y x m s the data uncertainty here is treated as the variance of measurement error and it is assumed to be a constant and thus not involved in sensitivity analysis the model uncertainty is caused by different mean predictions given by different models also known as between model uncertainty similarly the term of scenario uncertainty is caused by different mean predictions under different scenarios also known as between scenario uncertainty the parametric uncertainty is not limited to a single model but for multiple models and under different model scenarios therefore e s e m s v x m s e y x m s is used in this paper as the basis of global sensitivity analysis under parametric model and scenario uncertainties for a single model m and a single scenario s the mean operations over models and scenarios disappear and the e s e m s v x m s e y x m s term becomes 2 e s e m s v x m s e y x m s v x m s e y x m s based on this equation and in the same manner of sobol sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2010 the first order sensitivity index is defined as 3 s i v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i v x m s e y x m s and the total effect sensitivity index is defined as 4 s t i e x i m s v x i m s e y x m s x i v x m s e y x m s 1 v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i v x m s e y x m s where x i is the i th parameter and x i denotes all other parameters but x i the mean and variance can be evaluated using the monte caro mc method of saltelli et al 2010 imagine there have two independent sampling matrices a and b with k n as dimensions where k is the number of factors n is the number of simulations now introduce matrix a b i b a i where all columns are from a b except the i th column which is from b a saltelli et al 2010 compared several practices for the simultaneous computation of sobols sensitivity indices and suggested an improved computation for s i where the numerator is proposed for a fixed model and scenario 5 v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i v x i e x i y x i 1 n j 1 n f b j f a b i j f a j where b j denotes the j th row of matrix b the computation of s t i proceeds from eq 4 where the numerator is obtained from 6 e x i m s v x i m s e y x m s x i e x i v x i y x i 1 2 n j 1 n f a j f a b i j 2 a total of 2 n simulations are needed to compute y corresponding to sampling matrices a and b while k n simulations are required to compute y from matrices a b i for all factors when considering multiple models m but a single scenario s the mean operation over scenarios disappears and the e s e m s v x m s e y x m s term becomes 7 e s e m s v x m s e y x m s e m s v x m s e y x m s the corresponding first order and total effect sensitivity indices for the multiple models but the single scenario are defined as 8 s i m e m s v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i e m s v x m s e y x m s and 9 s t i m e m s e x i m s v x i m s e y x m s x i e m s v x m s e y x m s the mean of multiple models e m s in eqs 8 and 9 is evaluated by using the model averaging method e m s k p m k s where p m k s is the probability of model m k under scenario s and satisfies k p m k s 1 the computation here are under a hierarchical structure taking the denominator of the right hand side of eq 8 as an example the first mean is with respect to the models postulated for scenario s and the variance v x m s e y x m s is the variance of inner expectation e y x m s calculated over all the changing values of the parameters under the model set m and scenario s here is the difference between the new method and the conventional method such as the sobol sensitivity analysis unlike the model averaging output that is the weighted average of individual models the index s i m is not a weighted averaging of s t i of individual models instead model averaging is conducted for the denominator and numerator separately and the ratio of the weighted averages is used for evaluating the sensitivity index when considering multiple models m and multiple scenarios s the first order and total effect sensitivity indices for the multiple models and the multiple scenarios are defined as 10 s i ms e s e m s v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i e s e m s v x m s e y x m s s m p s p m s v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i s m p s p m s v x m s e y x m s and 11 s t i ms e s e m s e x i m s v x i m s e y x m s x i e s e m s v x m s e y x m s s m p s p m s e x i m s v x i m s e y x m s x i s m p s p m s v x m s e y x m s the mean of multiple scenarios e s in eqs 10 and 11 is evaluated by using the scenario averaging method e s l p s l where p s l is the probability of scenario s l and satisfies l p s l 1 the computation are similar to eqs 6 and 7 3 nitrogen reactive transport modeling and associated uncertainty this section first describes the numerical modeling for simulating unsaturated flow and nitrogen transport at the lysimeter scale we consider six scenarios and four models for modeling nitrogen nitrification and denitrification and identify important parameters related to the scenarios and models the different models in this study are established based on different responses to environmental factors and the scenarios are designed by setting the possible future states of environmental factors the mathematical functions evaluating nitrification and denitrification processes considered in this study are widely used in nitrogen modeling therefore the numerical modeling of this study presents a case in which model parameters structures and structures are tangled together to render the identification of important parameters sophisticated 3 1 lysimeter scale nitrogen reactive transport modeling as shown in fig 1 the lysimeter domain is 3 m in length the soil texture is clay loam the soil water characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are described by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 with the following parameter values residual soil water content θ r 0 095 saturated soil water content θ s 0 41 α 1 9 m 1 n 1 31 and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks 0 6 md 1 simunek et al 2005 the initial averaging volumetric water content is 0 31 the top boundary is subject to an atmospheric boundary condition and the bottom and lateral boundaries are prescribed as the no flow boundary condition the horizontal flow is not considered in the domain the finite element mesh with 36 triangular elements and 38 nodes is used in modeling the time step is automatically adjusted with an initial time step of 0 01 day and a maximum time step of 0 05 day the total simulation period is 100 days the initial concentrations of ammonium and nitrate are uniform over the whole domain with the values of 5 mg l and 20 mg l respectively the flow and solute transport equations are solved by orthomin method mendoza et al 1991 soil temperature and moisture are the environmental factors which influence reactive nitrogen transport in this study which are given in section 3 3 3 2 unsaturated flow and nitrogen transport modeling nitrogen 2d developed by yang et al 2008 is used for the numerical modeling the numerical model involves a two dimensional variably unsaturated flow and nitrogen transport with consideration of nitrification and denitrification the flow model is governed by the richards equation 12 θ t x i k ij h x j k i 2 x i s where θ is volumetric water content h is pressure head s is a sink source term x i the spatial coordinates with x 1 in the horizontal and x 2 in the vertical directions k ij represents the components of the unsaturated soil conductivity tensor the transport of ammonium and nitrate in the soil is governed by the conventional advection dispersion equation the governing equation of ammonium transport is 13 x i θ d ij c nh 4 x j q i c nh 4 x i θ c nh 4 t r nit where d ij denotes the components of the dispersion coefficient tensor q i is the magnitude of darcy flux c nh 4 is ammonium concentration r nit is the actual nitrification rate the governing equation of nitrate transport is 14 x i θ d ij c no 3 x j q i c no 3 x i θ c no 3 t r nit r den where c no 3 is the nitrate solution concentration and r den is the actual denitrification rate the details of modeling nitrification and denitrification are given in section 3 4 where the alternative functions for evaluating actual nitrification and denitrification rates are discussed 3 3 six scenarios of temperature and precipitation the six scenarios considered in this study are a combination of three scenarios of future soil temperature and two scenarios of future precipitation the three temperature scenarios correspond to three different yearly average temperatures of 15 5 and 25 c and the scenarios are denoted as s15 s5 and s25 respectively for each of the three temperature scenarios the temperature profile t z t at depth z of the soil and a given time t is calculated from the empirical equation of rijtema and kroes 1991 15 t z t t a a 0 exp z d m cos ω t φ z d m where t a is the yearly average temperature c a 0 is the amplitude of temperature wave c d m is damping depth m ω is the frequency of temperature wave φ is a phase shift except t a the parameter values are the same under the three scenarios and they are a 0 5 d m 3 ω 0 017214 and φ 2 388 eq 15 indicates that the temperature profiles in depth have the same shape under the three scenarios but have different values due to the different t a values when calculating the response of nitrogen process to temperature discussed in section 3 4 the reference temperature was suggested within the range of 15 35 c heinen 2006 our design of the temperature scenario was based on this suggestion while the yearly average temperature in the base scenario is 15 c denoted as s15 under scenario s5 the yearly average temperature is designed at 5 c and the lowest temperature in the domain is 0 c under which the biofilm is inactive for scenario s25 the largest temperature in the domain is 30 c as it has been reported that the optimal temperature for nitrification and denitrification is around 25 to 30 c rysgaard et al 2004 saad and conrad 1993 therefore nitrification and denitrification may respond differently under the three temperature scenarios which is discussed in section 3 4 below the two precipitation scenarios are the present day scenario with the precipitation of 13 mm and the wet scenarios with the increased precipitation of 26 mm during the whole simulation period under the two precipitation scenarios the averaging soil moisture in this domain ranges from 0 3 to 0 33 and 0 3 to 0 37 the nitrification rate may respond differently to the soil moisture which is discussed in section 3 4 by applying these two designed precipitation scenarios the impact of soil moisture on nitrogen reactive models and parameters is presented in the next part combining the three temperature scenarios and the two precipitation scenarios leads to a total of six scenarios that are denoted as s15p s5p s25p s15w s5w and s25w for which the letter s stands for scenario the numbers for soil temperature and the letters of p and w for precipitation the scenarios have substantial impacts on the unsaturated flow and nitrogen transport the precipitation scenarios also affect the simulations of nitrogen concentration because moisture content affects the actual rates of nitrification and denitrification as discussed in section 3 4 below 3 4 four reduction functions and their random parameters following yang et al 2008 nitrification is modeled as the first order process 16 r nit θ n t k nit θ ρ k d f m f t n and denitrification as the michaelis menten process 17 r den θ n t k den f m f t θ ρ k d n θ ρ k d n k c where n is the ammonium or nitrate concentration in the soil solution k nit the optimal nitrification rate k d the distribution coefficient for adsorbing solute ρ is soil bulk density k den is the optimal denitrification rate k c the half saturation coefficient and f m and f t are the reduction factors of the soil moisture and soil temperature respectively in this study the reduction factors f m and f t are evaluated using alternative models given in soiln johnsson et al 1987 and daisy hansen et al 1993 two software that have been widely used for nitrogen modeling e g de neergaard et al 2002 eckersten et al 2007 liang et al 2014 yang et al 2008 table 1 lists the four alternative models used for the nitrification process and the other four models for the denitrification process two alternative functions denoted as t1 and t2 are used for modeling the impacts of soil temperature on nitrification and denitrification function t1 adopted from soiln and used for both nitrification and denitrification processes is based on the arrhenius or van t hoff laws rodrigo et al 1997 t is the soil temperature evaluated using eq 15 t r is the reference temperature for which f t 1 q 10 is the response to a 10 c soil temperature change q 10 and t r are treated as random variables and discussed below function t2 used in daisy of nitrification is based on the understanding that the nitrification process is controlled by different types of microbes in different temperature ranges and takes the form of the piecewise function the t2 function of denitrification also used in daisy does not consider the temperature impacts and uses the constant value of one for any temperature two alternative functions denoted as m1 and m2 are used for modeling the impacts of moisture content on nitrification and denitrification function m1 of nitrification used in soiln simulates the impacts of moisture content on actual nitrification rate where θ s is the saturated moisture content θ hi and θ lo are the high and low water content respectively within which the reduction function is one and θ w is the minimum water content for process activity and m is an empirical constant for the soil used in this study and based on literatures johnsson et al 1987 wu and mcgechan 1998 the suggested values of the parameters are θ s 0 41 θ hi 0 33 θ lo 0 3 θ w 0 17 and e s 0 6 parameter m is treated as a random variable and discussed below in function m1 of denitrification used in soiln θ d is the threshold moisture content for denitrification and its value is taken as 0 17 wu and mcgechan 1998 function m2 of nitrification used in daisy is a function of soil matric potential pf the 10 base logarithm of the soil water tension in cm water function m2 of denitrification used in daisy is a function of the degree of water saturation x w the ratio of moisture content to saturated moisture content since matric potential and the degree of saturation are simulated by the flow model eq 12 m2 does not have its specific parameters a combination of the two reduction functions of soil temperature and the two reduction functions of moisture content gives a total of four alternative models t1m1 t1m2 t2m1 and t2m2 representing a variety of ways of evaluating the reduction functions integrating these models into the nitrogen transport models described in section 3 2 leads to four alternative models of nitrogen reactive transport for the four models because of the diversity of substrates environmental conditions and temperature ranges the following five parameters related to nitrification and denitrification processes are considered as random variables k nit the optimal rate of nitrification k den the optimal rate of denitrification q 10 and t r used in function t1 and m used in function m1 based on literature search korom 1992 bengtsson et al 2003 heinen 2006 the following uniform distributions are assumed for the parameters k nit u 0 0001 0 1 k den u 0 0001 0 1 q 10 u 1 01 3 5 t r u 10 30 and m u 0 5 2 5 3 5 case with stratified biochemical heterogeneity the above case considered one very simple situation however nitrogen transport and reaction may face a much more complex situation in a real world application for example the biomass species varies along the vertical direction which leads to a stratified distribution of biotic reaction activity thus the model parameters would be spatially stratified at the field site to simplify the spatial stratified heterogeneity is defined as between strata variance in this study which means model parameters are different between strata we further investigate nitrogen reactive transport in a vertical stratified domain which is equally divided into two layers the hydraulic parameters in both layers are same with those discussed in section 3 1 while the five reactive parameters are set differently in two layers the same four models six scenarios and parameter distributions are applied in this case thus the sensitivity analysis of a total of ten parameters is evaluated results and discussion of this two layer case will be presented in section 5 4 4 results this section presents the results of the global sensitivity index evaluated for individual models and scenarios for multiple models after model averaging but individual scenarios and for multiple models and multiple scenarios after scenario averaging although both the first order and total sensitivity indices defined in section 2 are calculated only the results of total sensitivity index are presented because it considers the impacts of parameter interaction on model outputs which is not considered by the first order sensitivity index in addition only the sensitivity analysis results regarding to nitrate concentration are presented the total sensitivity index is evaluated at the 11 observation points shown in fig 1 and the average index value of each 11 index values is calculated and used for the plotting and discussion below without loss of generality equal probability of scenarios and models i e the probability of each of the six scenarios is 1 6 and the probability of each of the four models is 1 4 are used for evaluating the sensitivity indices below while the impacts of the probability on the sensitivity results were found by dai and ye 2015 discussing the impacts is beyond the scope of this study fig 2 plots the probability density functions pdfs of nitrate concentration averaged over the eleven observation points shown in fig 1 simulated using different models under different scenarios at the simulation time of 100 day as an example the pdfs of other simulation times are similar to those shown in fig 2 and thus not shown the figure shows that the variability of simulated nitrate concentration is substantially different for different models and scenarios since the variance of simulated nitrate concentration is the denominator of the sensitivity index eqs 3 and 4 for a single model and scenario the importance of parameters under different models and scenarios are not directly comparable it is therefore necessary to use the method described in section 2 to evaluate the sensitivity index for multiple models and scenarios table 2 lists the total sensitivity index averaged over the eleven observation points shown in fig 1 of the five parameters evaluated using the individual models and scenarios for nitrate concentration at the simulation time of 100 days if a parameter is not used in a model the index value of the parameter is set to zero for the model for example since parameters q 10 and t r are not used in the models related only to t2 the sensitivity index values of the two parameters are zero for all the models associated with t2 table 3 lists the total sensitivity index averaged over the eleven observation points shown in fig 1 evaluated for the four models but every single scenario as indicated by eqs 8 and 9 the multi model sensitivity index of a parameter is not the arithmetic mean of the parameter s sensitivity index of the four models but the ratio between the model averaged variance of the specific parameter and the model averaged variance of all the parameters in other words the results listed table 3 are not simply the arithmetic mean of the results listed in table 2 taking scenario s5p as an example the sensitivity index value of q 10 in table 3 is 23 34 significantly larger than the arithmetic mean 12 55 of the four index values 30 49 0 19 7 and 0 listed in table 2 the multi model sensitivity index is more informative than the arithmetic average because the former better reflects the contribution of the variance caused by a parameter to the variance caused by all the parameters in the model averaging sense in the last column of table 3 the total sensitivity index of each parameter for multiple models and multiple scenarios are listed this index is the composite parametric sensitivity by simultaneously considering uncertainty in model parameters structures and scenarios the table shows that parameter k den is the most important parameter for the simulated nitrate concentration under the multiple models and scenarios considered in this study the second most important parameter is parameter t r followed by parameters q 10 and then k nit parameter m is the least important parameter 5 discussion this section discusses the results presented in the last section to understand why the parameter importance varies or remains invariant for different models and scenarios why the concepts of model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty help understand conflicting results of parameter importance reported in literature and why the new parameter sensitivity indices with consideration of model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty help identify the parameters important to nitrification and denitrification 5 1 important nitrogen parameters vary among different individual functions and scenarios table 2 shows that the values of sensitivity index of model parameters except m vary substantially for different models and scenarios for example under scenario s5p the total sensitivity index of parameter k den changes from 62 59 for model t1m1 to 4 80 for model t2m2 taking model t2m2 as an example the index changes from 4 8 under scenario s5p to 99 76 under scenario s25w these results indicate that without considering model and scenario uncertainties identifying important parameters based on a single model and a single scenario may lead to incorrect identification the substantial variation of important parameters across different models and scenarios is not surprising because model simulations vary substantially under different models and scenarios more specifically speaking according to eq 4 the sensitivity index of a model parameter for a single model under a single scenario is the ratio between the variance related to the parameter e g the numerator of eq 4 and the variance related to all model parameters e g the denominator of eq 4 since the two variances vary between models under different scenarios the sensitivity index changes for different models and scenarios for example since the numerator variance for parameter k den and the denominator variance are 0 435 and 0 491 respectively for model t2m2 under scenario s15p the corresponding sensitivity index is 88 52 for model t1m1 under scenario s5p the numerator variance and the denominator variance become 1 268 and 2 026 which leads to the sensitivity index of 62 59 therefore the sensitivity indices of individual models under individual scenarios are not comparable and cannot be used to select the important parameters to confirm the identified important parameters for the individual models and scenarios we compare the variance of simulated nitrate concentration for two cases by varying all parameters in the parameter ranges given in section 3 3 and by reducing the parameter range by 40 e g the 20 80 of the original range for one parameter value at a time the basic idea is that if a parameter is more important than other parameters reducing its parameter range will lead to a larger reduction of the variance of simulated nitrate concentration fig 3 plots the marginal distributions of simulated nitrate concentration for the two cases and the corresponding variance for the two cases are also shown in the figure in fig 3 a for model t1m1 and scenario s15p fixing the most important parameter k den leads to a variance reduced from 3 868 to 2 134 the largest reduction for all the parameters the amount of variance reduction is consistent with the ranking of model importance given by the sensitivity index listed in table 2 in other words fixing the value of a more important parameter leads to large variance reduction this indicates that the sobols sensitivity index can be used to identify important model parameters comparing fig 3 a with fig 3 b for model t1m1 and scenario s5p and fig 3 c for model t2m1 and scenario s5p indicates that the values of variance and the amounts of variance reduction change for different models and or different scenarios therefore without considering model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty an inaccurate selection of important parameters may occur 5 2 reasons for conflicting results reported in literature the variability of the sensitivity index may be used to explain different conclusions reported in literature about the importance of the parameters related to nitrification and denitrification processes in table 4 we reviewed some conflicting conclusions which were obtained by various methods the conclusion of wang et al 2005 is supported by the summation of the sensitivity index of q 10 and t r because the index ranges between 24 87 for model t1m2 and scenario s15p and 39 39 for model t1m2 and scenario s25p suggesting that temperature is important to nitrogen transformation however our results demonstrate that the optimal denitrification rate k den is more important the conclusion of heinen 2006 is supported by the sensitivity index of model t1m2 for which the sensitivity index of k den increases when precipitation increases in the wet scenario for example the sensitivity index increases from 26 05 under scenario s5p to 55 13 under scenario s5w it should be noted that nitrogen reaction is sensitive to moisture function doesn t mean it is sensitive to the parameter in moisture function since the parameter here m is always unimportant under all conditions in this study a detailed discussion about this phenomenon is further presented in section 5 4 the results in table 2 also qualitatively support the observation that the nitrification and denitrification processes alternately dominate nitrogen transformation bateman and baggs 2005 concluded that nitrification is the dominant process in nitrogen reactive at low moisture our study on model t1m2 is consistent with their conclusion where the optimal nitrification rate is the most important parameter under scenario s5p lower moisture comparing with scenario s5w higher moisture however the optimal denitrification rate is most important under other conditions which suggests denitrification is a more important process that affects nitrate concentration than nitrification stevens et al 1997 also found the similar conclusion that denitrification and nitrification are alternately dominant however such alternation also depends on the selected models the change of parameter importance for different models and under different scenarios suggests again the need of considering model and scenario uncertainties when selecting important parameters for nitrification and denitrification processes 5 3 identification of important parameters with model and scenario averaging method using the multi model sensitivity index makes it unnecessary to compare the sensitivity indices of different models which are actually incomparable because of the different variance values of different models i e the denominator of eqs 3 and 4 more importantly using the multi model sensitivity index avoids the problem of inaccurate selection of important parameters taking parameter k nit under scenario s5p as an example the index values in table 2 indicate that this parameter is the third important parameter in model t1m1 with the index value of 10 92 but the most important parameter in model t2m2 with the index value of 95 51 the multi model sensitivity index listed in table 3 suggests that this parameter is the second most important parameter with the index value of 28 00 these results show that a parameter important in one model may not be important in another model and the multi model sensitivity index is a more reasonable indicator for evaluating the relative importance of model parameters the change of the sensitivity index values after model averaging can be qualitatively understood by examining the pdfs shown in fig 3 the figure shows that for scenario s5p the variance of model t1m1 is significantly larger than that of model t2m2 quantitatively speaking the sensitivity index of 95 51 for model t2m2 corresponds to a small total variance of 0 204 whereas the sensitivity index of 10 92 for model t1m1 corresponds to a larger total variance of 2 026 the variance of model averaging is the average of the variance of each model which equals 0 720 similarly the variance caused by k nit under model averaging is 0 202 these results explain why the multi model sensitivity index value of k nit listed in table 3 is smaller than the sensitivity index of the three models t2m1 t1m2 and t2m2 listed in table 2 table 5 lists the data that helps gain a quantitative understanding why the multi model index is better than the individual model index the second row of the table lists the variance of simulated nitrate concentration given by the four models and model averaging under scenario s5p the variance of model t2m2 is the smallest of the four models less than 10 of that of model t1m1 the other five rows of table 4 list the variance of simulated nitrate concentration obtained by fixing one parameter at a time similar to the discussion in section 5 2 the reduction of variance between the two cases all parameter varying and one parameter fixed is used to understand why the multi model index is better than the individual model index for identifying important model parameters taking parameter k nit as an example although fixing this parameter reduces the variance substantially from 0 172 to 0 025 for model t2m2 the reduction is smaller than the corresponding reduction of the other three models because the total variance when all parameter varies of model t2m2 is significantly smaller than the corresponding total variance of the other three models more importantly the variance reduction of 0 147 achieved by fixing parameter k nit in model t2m2 is significantly smaller than the variance reduction of 0 73 achieved by fixing parameter k den in model t1m1 in line with this the reduction of model averaging variance by fixing one parameter a time is the largest for parameter k den and the second largest for parameter k nit this example illustrates that the multi model sensitivity index considers the variance reduction of not a single model but of all the models and thus identify the parameters that are important not to a single model but to all the models this is necessary in the situation when model uncertainty exists the same conclusion can be drawn for the multi scenario and individual scenario sensitivity indices although results are not shown 5 4 comparison between one layer case and two layer case table 6 lists the sensitivity analysis index of each parameter for the two layer case the results show that after considering biochemical heterogeneity the importance of parameters for model output shares some similarities with the single layer case for example parameter k den k den up and k den bot often plays a dominant role the results also show that the importance of one parameter varies between layers parameter in bottom layer always has larger sensitivity index than in top layer under each model and scenario since denitrification process is the controlling process of affecting nitrate concentration in this study and denitrification activity in the bottom layer caused by larger moisture content in this layer is significantly stronger than the top layer it is reasonable that the model output nitrate concentration more depends on the parameters in the bottom layer nitrogen reaction activity gains with the increase of soil moisture and temperature since output nitrate concentration uncertainty increases with higher reactive rate the importance of parameters becomes larger in the area with higher moisture content and temperature than in the area with lower soil moisture and temperature it is observed that in this two layer case moisture content is higher in the bottom layer while the temperature is opposite the larger importance of bottom parameters indicates that soil moisture contributes more uncertainty than temperature the results suggest that spatial distribution of soil moisture needs more delicate attention than the temperature in order to better characterize the nitrogen reactive transport however it is not necessary to conclude that parameter related to soil moisture response function is more important than parameters associated with temperature response function from table 6 m is always less important than t r and q 10 this phenomenon indicates that the response of nitrate reaction to an environmental factor i e moisture content sometimes is more controlled by that factor itself but not parameter the above sensitivity analysis can help modeler to contemplate the focus of establishing a nitrogen reactive transport model it is worthy to note that the sensitivity index of one parameter in the single layer case may have a considerable difference with the sum of indices of the same parameter in the top and bottom layers for example sensitivity index of k nit is 57 93 under model t2m1 and scenario s5p in the single layer case which is significantly different with 78 44 the value of the sensitivity index of k nit sum summing indices of k nit up and k nit bot in the two layer case this is understandable since model output nitrate concentration here responds to different number of parameters in different ways by including stratification or not from another perspective the stratification strategy of biochemical reaction parameters can be regarded as another source of model uncertainty recalling the findings when considering various response functions of soil moisture and temperature the new results reconfirm that sensitivity analysis outcomes unavoidably vary between different models no matter where the model uncertainty originates attention must be paid to the model uncertainty when a reasonable sensitivity analysis is required table 7 lists sensitivity indices under model averaging and or scenario averaging by comparing the column 7 in tables 3 and 7 it is interesting to find that parameter k den is still the most important one to model output under model and scenario averaging t r is still more important than q 10 and parameter m remains least important the only exception is that k nit is more important than t r the results from this case together with the results from single layer case indicate that introduced global sensitivity analysis method could largely avoid the inaccurate selection of important parameters under model and scenario uncertainties in a broad sense although the inclusion of stratification produces rather complicated parameter importance rank under each mode and scenario table 6 the results in table 7 positively imply that regardless of the possibly biochemical heterogeneity in nitrogen reactive transport model the global sensitivity analysis by considering model and scenario uncertainties produce fairly consistent parameter importance rank 5 5 limitations of this study there are some limitations to this study 1 the parameter model and scenario uncertainty are considered within a hierarchical framework the interactions between different uncertainty sources are not expressed explicitly during the variance decomposition eq 1 and sensitivity analysis eqs 3 4 8 9 10 and 11 thus the interactions and their impact on output are not quantified in this study 2 since models are conditioned on scenarios and parameters are conditioned on models and scenarios under the given hierarchical framework it is not able to quantify the marginal effect of model and scenario on the outputs by changing models scenarios while keeping parameters and models fixed in this study 6 conclusions and future research recommendations this study conducts a global sensitivity analysis to identify important parameters to the nitrification and denitrification processes in nitrogen reactive transport modeling the reduction functions of soil temperature and moisture content are developed for the scenarios of yearly average temperature and precipitation and the reduction functions have their own parameters that are treated as random variables the five parameters considered in this study are the optimal nitrification and denitrification rates k den and k nit the two parameters t r and q 10 related to the reduction function of temperature and the parameter m related to the reduction function of moisture content to our knowledge this is the first attempt of global sensitivity analysis for nitrification and denitrification processes with simultaneous consideration of parametric uncertainty model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty while the results are specific to the numerical models in this study the results may be useful for understanding variably saturated flow and nitrogen reactive transport this study leads to the following major conclusions 1 the results highlight the complexity of identifying important parameters for nitrogen reactive transport when faced with multiple choices of describing nitrogen reaction and diversely possible temperature and soil moisture variations it is not appropriate to compare the global sensitivity index values under different scenarios and models due to the difference of total variance of prediction the rank of important nitrogen parameters also shows notable disparities the impact of soil temperature and soil moisture content on nitrification and denitrification process can only be properly evaluated by further considering model and scenario uncertainty by introducing the new global sensitivity index the comparison between sensitivity analysis results under different models and scenarios becomes unnecessary 2 a multi model and scenario study reveals that nitrification process becomes more important at either low moisture content or low temperature moreover the increasing importance of nitrification activity with decreased temperature strongly depends on the selected model under given environment model averaging is suggested to make an objective assessment to nitrification or denitrification activity contribution to avoid artificial model error 3 for the five parameters used for simulating the nitrification and denitrification processes in a single layer and two layer case the multi model and multi scenario sensitivity analysis in this study presents a few common features optimal denitrification rate k den is the most important parameter reference temperature t r is more important than temperature coefficient q 10 m is the least important one 4 both environmental factors soil moisture content and temperature themselves and the parameters of response functions impose effect on output nitrate concentration however the response of nitrate reaction to soil moisture depends more on moisture content itself but not moisture function parameter m and the spatial distribution of soil moisture play a more decisive role controlling nitrogen reaction than temperature several future directions are recommended first the equal probability for the four models and six scenarios are assumed in this current study the evaluation of model probability based on observations can be done in various ways e g ye et al 2008 lu et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2016 and scenario probability can be estimated based on expert judgment meyer et al 2007 another future work is to evaluate model probability and scenario probability conditioned on observations of state variables e g moisture content and nitrogen concentration it is expected that by infusing these data into the modeling system uncertainties brought by parameter and model can be restrained however the reduction of scenario uncertainty relies on the improvement on the reliability of future forcing data e g precipitation temperature evapotranspiration the total uncertainty of model output consists of three parts parametric model and scenario uncertainty while the interactions between them are ignored in this study the evaluation of marginal effects from

literature source method reported conclusion this present study heinen 2006 normalized sensitivity elasticity analysis denitrification is most sensitive to moisture function nitrogen process including denitrification and nitrification is sensitive to moisture condition instead of to the parameter of moisture function see section 5 4 wang et al 2005 two step global sensitivity analysis nitrogen simulation is sensitivity to denitrification parameters on temperature parameters on temperature function are important however the optimal denitrification rate is more important see table 2 and 6 bateman and baggs 2005 laboratory experiment nitrification is the main process in nitrogen reactive at low moisture the importance of nitrification activity increases with low soil moisture nitrification also becomes more important at low temperature see table 2 and 6 furthermore the increasing importance of nitrification activity with decreased temperature depends on the selected model see table 2 and 6 stevens et al 1997 laboratory experiment denitrification and nitrification are alternately dominant our study is consistent with their conclusion however such alternation also depends on the selected models see table 2 and 6 mcintyre et al 2005 regionalized sensitivity analysis the most sensitive parameters were spatially inconsistent the importance of parameter not only

reactive transport modeling is subject to uncertainty in model parameters structures and scenarios by using a new variance based global sensitivity analysis method this paper identifies important parameters for nitrogen reactive transport with simultaneous consideration of these three uncertainties a combination of three scenarios of soil temperature and two scenarios of soil moisture creates a total of six scenarios four alternative models describing the effect of soil temperature and moisture content are used to evaluate the reduction functions used for calculating actual reaction rates the results show that for nitrogen reactive transport problem parameter importance varies substantially among different models and scenarios denitrification and nitrification process is sensitive to soil moisture content status rather than to the moisture function parameter nitrification process becomes more important at low moisture content and low temperature however the changing importance of nitrification activity with respect to temperature change highly relies on the selected model model averaging is suggested to assess the nitrification or denitrification contribution by reducing the possible model error despite the introduction of biochemical heterogeneity or not fairly consistent parameter importance rank is obtained in this study optimal denitrification rate k den is the most important parameter reference temperature t r is more important than temperature coefficient q 10 empirical constant in moisture response function m is the least important one vertical distribution of soil moisture but not temperature plays predominant role controlling nitrogen reaction this study provides insight into the nitrogen reactive transport modeling and demonstrates an effective strategy of selecting the important parameters when future temperature and soil moisture carry uncertainties or when modelers face with multiple ways of establishing nitrogen models keywords nitrification and denitrification reduction function model averaging scenario averaging sobol method of sensitivity analysis 1 introduction the nitrogen cycle together with the carbon cycle plays an important role in sustaining subsurface and terrestrial environments and ecosystems european environment agency eea 2000 galloway et al 2004 rivett et al 2007 in subsurface hydrology nitrogen reactive transport modeling is a vital tool for simulating nitrogen transformation and for estimating the amount of nitrogen transport within and between soil and groundwater nitrogen reactive transport modeling is complicated for the fact that nitrogen transport is controlled by a large number of physical chemical and biological processes and their associated parameters it is important to identify the important parameters that control nitrogen reactive transport so that limited resources can be used to better characterize the important parameters to improve the accuracy of model predictions the identification of important parameters is nontrivial due in part to the following three challenges 1 the parameters vary substantially in space and time and it is uncertain which parameter values should be used for the identification of important parameters 2 the parameters may be used by a number of alternative models and the parameter importance may vary between different models 3 the scenarios of future system conditions under which model predictions are made are uncertain and the scenario uncertainty may affect the parameter importance while existing methods of global sensitivity analysis are able to identify important parameters under parametric uncertainty griensven et al 2006 mishra et al 2009 saltelli et al 2010 rakovec et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 razavi and gupta 2015 2016a b song et al 2015 wainwright et al 2014 there has been few study that identifies important parameters under model and scenario uncertainty for nitrogen reactive transport modeling model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty are prevalent in nitrogen reactive transport modeling with respect to model uncertainty various models have been developed based on different conceptual and mathematical descriptions of nitrogen reactive transport hansen et al 1995 compared five alternative models animo soiln omni nleap and daisy and heinen 2006 reviewed more than fifty models frolking et al 1998 described four models century dndc expert n and nasa casa for simulating nitrous oxide n2o emissions wu and mcgechan 1998 compared four soil nitrogen dynamics models animo sundial soiln and daisy rodrigo et al 1997 discussed nine models that have been developed for simulating the effects of temperature and water content on carbon and nitrogen transformation in soils following meyer et al 2014 a scenario is defined as a future state or condition under which the models are simulated with respect to scenario uncertainty it is always uncertain under what future temperature and precipitation conditions nitrogen reactive transport predictions are made and there is also no consensus on how scenarios influence model predictions for example heinen 2006 found that moisture content is important to denitrification wang et al 2005 reported that temperature is a controlling factor of denitrification pohlert et al 2007 pointed out that ph is important to nitrogen cycling mcintyre et al 2005 and wang et al 2013 considered impacts of spatial variability of model parameters e g hydraulic conductivity on nitrogen transport these studies indicate that the nitrogen reactive transport models are diverse and that these models are used under different future system conditions this study is focused on identifying the important parameters that control nitrification and denitrification which play an important role in the nitrogen cycle particularly speaking the model uncertainty considered in this study are related to various reduction functions used in literature for estimating actual nitrification and denitrification rates the rates are evaluated by multiplying potential rates the maximum rates under optimal conditions with reduction functions that depend on various factors such as nitrate concentration moisture content temperature and ph of soils see the review article of heinen 2006 and references therein since the factors affect nitrification and denitrification in different ways a number of reduction functions have been developed and it is often uncertain which function should be used taking denitrification as an example according to heinen 2006 reduction by soil conditions is site specific and therefore a universal simple process model for denitrification does not seem to exist for all the reduction functions they heavily depend on soil temperature and moisture which affect microbial processes in soils rodrigo et al 1997 the two factors usually vary substantially in space and time and the variation leads to scenario uncertainty it is necessary to identify important parameters for a range of future temperature and precipitation rather than for fixed e g present day temperature and precipitation values there are some other factors such as ph and soil organic carbon that may affect nitrogen reactive transport but they are ignored in this study with the consideration of parametric uncertainty model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty the following three questions are raised immediately for identifying important parameters in nitrogen reactive transport problem 1 are the parameters important to one model also important to another model 2 are parameters important under one prediction condition still important under another prediction condition 3 how scenario affects the performance of model prediction this study answers the above three questions in the field of nitrogen reactive transport modeling by using a method recently developed by dai and ye 2015 different from existing methods of global sensitivity that can be used only for a single model and a single modeling scenario this method considers multiple models and multiple scenarios in the context of model averaging and scenario averaging rather than choosing a single model and define a single scenario model and scenario averaging method is introduced to alleviate the disparity of sensitivity analysis between different models and scenarios although this study is focused on the nitrification and denitrification processes the method of global sensitivity analysis is mathematically general and can be applied to other reactive transport processes of nitrogen and other contaminants it is hoped that this study can provide a framework and an example of using global sensitivity analysis to select important parameters in nitrogen modeling and reactive transport modeling in a broad sense under the uncertainty of model parameters structures and scenarios to the best of our knowledge such an example is unprecedented in the rest of this paper section 2 describes the new method for variance based global sensitivity analysis under parametric model and scenario uncertainties section 3 presents the details of nitrogen reactive transport modeling at the lysimeter scale as well as the six modeling scenarios four models and the parameter distributions the results of sensitivity analysis are listed in section 4 in section 5 we discussed the necessity of consideration of models and scenarios in sensitivity analysis and the impact of scenarios on nitrogen processes the conclusions of this study are given in section 6 2 methodology this section gives a brief description of the sensitivity indices defined by dai and ye 2015 for the following three situations 1 for a single model and a single scenario 2 for multiple models but a single scenario and 3 for multiple models and multiple scenarios the details of deriving the indices are referred to dai and ye 2015 for a single model m and a single scenario s y f x m s where y is a scalar model output and x x 1 x 2 x k denotes a vector of random model parameters when considering model and scenario uncertainty the model output can be written as y f x m s where m denotes a model set with multiple models m m 1 m 2 m j and s denotes a scenario set with multiple scenarios s s 1 s 2 s i respectively since parameters are different in different models x is the union of parameters in each model x x 1 x 2 x j where x j is the parameters of model m j by using the law of total variance and the law of total expectation the predictive variance of y can be decomposed as dai and ye 2015 1 v y e s e m s e x m s v y x m s e s e m s v x m s e y x m s e s v m s e x m s e y x m s v s e m s e x m s e y x m s where m s and x m s indicate the hierarchical relations that models are conditioned on scenarios and that parameters are conditioned on models and scenarios note that the total uncertainty consists of three parts i e parameter model and scenario uncertainty while the interactions between them are ignored the four terms at the right hand side of eq 1 represent data uncertainty e s e m s e x m s v y x m s parametric uncertainty e s e m s v x m s e y x m s model uncertainty e s v m s e x m s e y x m s and scenario uncertainty v s e m s e x m s e y x m s the data uncertainty here is treated as the variance of measurement error and it is assumed to be a constant and thus not involved in sensitivity analysis the model uncertainty is caused by different mean predictions given by different models also known as between model uncertainty similarly the term of scenario uncertainty is caused by different mean predictions under different scenarios also known as between scenario uncertainty the parametric uncertainty is not limited to a single model but for multiple models and under different model scenarios therefore e s e m s v x m s e y x m s is used in this paper as the basis of global sensitivity analysis under parametric model and scenario uncertainties for a single model m and a single scenario s the mean operations over models and scenarios disappear and the e s e m s v x m s e y x m s term becomes 2 e s e m s v x m s e y x m s v x m s e y x m s based on this equation and in the same manner of sobol sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2010 the first order sensitivity index is defined as 3 s i v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i v x m s e y x m s and the total effect sensitivity index is defined as 4 s t i e x i m s v x i m s e y x m s x i v x m s e y x m s 1 v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i v x m s e y x m s where x i is the i th parameter and x i denotes all other parameters but x i the mean and variance can be evaluated using the monte caro mc method of saltelli et al 2010 imagine there have two independent sampling matrices a and b with k n as dimensions where k is the number of factors n is the number of simulations now introduce matrix a b i b a i where all columns are from a b except the i th column which is from b a saltelli et al 2010 compared several practices for the simultaneous computation of sobols sensitivity indices and suggested an improved computation for s i where the numerator is proposed for a fixed model and scenario 5 v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i v x i e x i y x i 1 n j 1 n f b j f a b i j f a j where b j denotes the j th row of matrix b the computation of s t i proceeds from eq 4 where the numerator is obtained from 6 e x i m s v x i m s e y x m s x i e x i v x i y x i 1 2 n j 1 n f a j f a b i j 2 a total of 2 n simulations are needed to compute y corresponding to sampling matrices a and b while k n simulations are required to compute y from matrices a b i for all factors when considering multiple models m but a single scenario s the mean operation over scenarios disappears and the e s e m s v x m s e y x m s term becomes 7 e s e m s v x m s e y x m s e m s v x m s e y x m s the corresponding first order and total effect sensitivity indices for the multiple models but the single scenario are defined as 8 s i m e m s v x i m s e x i m s e y x m s x i e m s v x m s e y x m s and 9 s t i m e m s e x i m s v x i m s e y x m s x i e m s v x m s e y x m s the mean of multiple models e m s in eqs 8 and 9 is evaluated by using the model averaging method e m s k p m k s where p m k s is the probability of model m k under scenario s and satisfies k p m k s 1 the computation here are under a hierarchical structure taking the denominator of the right hand side of eq 8 as an example the first mean is with respect to the models postulated for scenario s and the variance v x m s e y x m s is the variance of inner expectation e y x m s calculated over all the changing values of the parameters under the model set m and scenario s here is the difference between the new method and the conventional method such as the sobol sensitivity analysis unlike the model averaging output that is the weighted average of individual models the index s i m is not a weighted averaging of s t i of individual models instead model averaging is conducted for the denominator and numerator separately and the ratio of the weighted averages is used for evaluating the sensitivity

uncertainty this section first describes the numerical modeling for simulating unsaturated flow and nitrogen transport at the lysimeter scale we consider six scenarios and four models for modeling nitrogen nitrification and denitrification and identify important parameters related to the scenarios and models the different models in this study are established based on different responses to environmental factors and the scenarios are designed by setting the possible future states of environmental factors the mathematical functions evaluating nitrification and denitrification processes considered in this study are widely used in nitrogen modeling therefore the numerical modeling of this study presents a case in which model parameters structures and structures are tangled together to render the identification of important parameters sophisticated 3 1 lysimeter scale nitrogen reactive transport modeling as shown in fig 1 the lysimeter domain is 3 m in length the soil texture is clay loam the soil water characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are described by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 with the following parameter values residual soil water content θ r 0 095 saturated soil water content θ s 0 41 α 1 9 m 1 n 1 31 and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks 0 6 md 1 simunek et al 2005 the initial averaging volumetric water content is 0 31 the top boundary is subject to an atmospheric boundary condition and the bottom and lateral boundaries are prescribed as the no flow boundary condition the horizontal flow is not considered in the domain the finite element mesh with 36 triangular elements and 38 nodes is used in modeling the time step is automatically adjusted with an initial time step of 0 01 day and a maximum time step of 0 05 day the total simulation period is 100 days the initial concentrations of ammonium and nitrate are uniform over the whole domain with the values of 5 mg l and 20 mg l respectively the flow and solute transport equations are solved by orthomin method mendoza et al 1991 soil temperature and moisture are the environmental factors which influence reactive nitrogen transport in this study which are given in section 3 3 3 2 unsaturated flow and nitrogen transport modeling nitrogen 2d developed by yang et al 2008 is used for the numerical modeling the numerical model involves a two dimensional variably unsaturated flow and nitrogen transport with consideration of nitrification and denitrification the flow model is governed by the richards equation 12 θ t x i k ij h x j k i 2 x i s where θ is volumetric water content h is pressure head s is a sink source term x i the spatial coordinates with x 1 in the horizontal and x 2 in the vertical directions k ij represents the components of the unsaturated soil conductivity tensor the transport of ammonium and nitrate in the soil is governed by the conventional advection dispersion equation the governing equation of ammonium transport is 13 x i θ d ij c nh 4 x j q i c nh 4 x i θ c nh 4 t r nit where d ij denotes the components of the dispersion coefficient tensor q i is the magnitude of darcy flux c nh 4 is ammonium concentration r nit is the actual nitrification rate the governing equation of nitrate transport is 14 x i θ d ij c no 3 x j q i c no 3 x i θ c no 3 t r nit r den where c no 3 is the nitrate solution concentration and r den is the actual denitrification rate the details of modeling nitrification and denitrification are given in section 3 4 where the alternative functions for evaluating actual nitrification and denitrification rates are discussed 3 3 six scenarios of temperature and precipitation the six scenarios considered in this study are a combination of three scenarios of future soil temperature and two scenarios of future precipitation the three temperature scenarios correspond to three different yearly average temperatures of 15 5 and 25 c and the scenarios are denoted as s15 s5 and s25 respectively for each of the three temperature scenarios the temperature profile t z t at depth z of the soil and a given time t is calculated from the empirical equation of rijtema and kroes 1991 15 t z t t a a 0 exp z d m cos ω t φ z d m where t a is the yearly average temperature c a 0 is the amplitude of temperature wave c d m is damping depth m ω is the frequency of temperature wave φ is a phase shift except t a the parameter values are the same under the three scenarios and they are a 0 5 d m 3 ω 0 017214 and φ 2 388 eq 15 indicates that the temperature profiles in depth have the same shape under the three scenarios but have different values due to the different t a values when calculating the response of nitrogen process to temperature discussed in section 3 4 the reference temperature was suggested within the range of 15 35 c heinen 2006 our design of the temperature scenario was based on this suggestion while the yearly average temperature in the base scenario is 15 c denoted as s15 under scenario s5 the yearly average temperature is designed at 5 c and the lowest temperature in the domain is 0 c under which the biofilm is inactive for scenario s25 the largest temperature in the domain is 30 c as it has been reported that the optimal temperature for nitrification and denitrification is around 25 to 30 c rysgaard et al 2004 saad and conrad 1993 therefore nitrification and denitrification may respond differently under the three temperature scenarios which is discussed in section 3 4 below the two precipitation scenarios are the present day scenario with the precipitation of 13 mm and the wet scenarios with the increased precipitation of 26 mm during the whole simulation period under the two precipitation scenarios the averaging soil moisture in this domain ranges from 0 3 to 0 33 and 0 3 to 0 37 the nitrification rate may respond differently to the soil moisture which is discussed in section 3 4 by applying these two designed precipitation scenarios the impact of soil moisture on nitrogen reactive models and parameters is presented in the next part combining the three temperature scenarios and the two precipitation scenarios leads to a total of six scenarios that are denoted as s15p s5p s25p s15w s5w and s25w for which the letter s stands for scenario the numbers for soil temperature and the letters of p and w for precipitation the scenarios have substantial impacts on the unsaturated flow and nitrogen transport the precipitation scenarios also affect the simulations of nitrogen concentration because moisture content affects the actual rates of nitrification and denitrification as discussed in section 3 4 below 3 4 four reduction functions and their random parameters following yang et al 2008 nitrification is modeled as the first order process 16 r nit θ n t k nit θ ρ k d f m f t n and denitrification as the michaelis menten process 17 r den θ n t k den f m f t θ ρ k d n θ ρ k d n k c where n is the ammonium or nitrate concentration in the soil solution k nit the optimal nitrification rate k d the distribution coefficient for adsorbing solute ρ is soil bulk density k den is the optimal denitrification rate k c the half saturation coefficient and f m and f t are the reduction factors of the soil moisture and soil temperature respectively in this study the reduction factors f m and f t are evaluated using alternative models given in soiln johnsson et al 1987 and daisy hansen et al 1993 two software that have been widely used for nitrogen modeling e g de neergaard et al 2002 eckersten et al 2007 liang et al 2014 yang et al 2008 table 1 lists the four alternative models used for the nitrification process and the other four models for the denitrification process two alternative functions denoted as t1 and t2 are used for modeling the impacts of soil temperature on nitrification and denitrification function t1 adopted from soiln and used for both nitrification and denitrification processes is based on the arrhenius or van t hoff laws rodrigo et al 1997 t is the soil temperature evaluated using eq 15 t r is the reference temperature for which f t 1 q 10 is the response to a 10 c soil temperature change q 10 and t r are treated as random variables and discussed below function t2 used in daisy of nitrification is based on the understanding that the nitrification process is controlled by different types of microbes in different temperature ranges and takes the form of the piecewise function the t2 function of denitrification also used in daisy does not consider the temperature impacts and uses the constant value of one for any temperature two alternative functions denoted as m1 and m2 are used for modeling the impacts of moisture content on nitrification and denitrification function m1 of nitrification used in soiln simulates the impacts of moisture content on actual nitrification rate where θ s is the saturated moisture content θ hi and θ lo are the high and low water content respectively within which the reduction function is one and θ w is the minimum water content for process activity and m is an empirical constant for the soil used in this study and based on literatures johnsson et al 1987 wu and mcgechan 1998 the suggested values of the parameters are θ s 0 41 θ hi 0 33 θ lo 0 3 θ w 0 17 and e s 0 6 parameter m is treated as a random variable and discussed below in function m1 of denitrification used in soiln θ d is the threshold moisture content for denitrification and its value is taken as 0 17 wu and mcgechan 1998 function m2 of nitrification used in daisy is a function of soil matric potential pf the 10 base logarithm of the soil water tension in cm water function m2 of denitrification used in daisy is a function of the degree of water saturation x w the ratio of moisture content to saturated moisture content since matric potential and the degree of saturation are simulated by the flow model eq 12 m2 does not have its specific parameters a combination of the two reduction functions of soil temperature and the two reduction functions of moisture content gives a total of four alternative models t1m1 t1m2 t2m1 and t2m2 representing a variety of ways of evaluating the reduction functions integrating these models into the nitrogen transport models described in section 3 2 leads to four alternative models of nitrogen reactive transport for the four models because of the diversity of substrates environmental conditions and temperature ranges the following five parameters related to nitrification and denitrification processes are considered as random variables k nit the optimal rate of nitrification k den the optimal rate of denitrification q 10 and t r used in function t1 and m used in function m1 based on literature search korom 1992 bengtsson et al 2003 heinen 2006 the following uniform distributions are assumed for the parameters k nit u 0 0001 0 1 k den u 0 0001 0 1 q 10 u 1 01 3 5 t r u 10 30 and m u 0 5 2 5 3 5 case with stratified biochemical heterogeneity the above case considered one very simple situation however nitrogen transport and reaction may face a much more complex situation in a real world application for example the biomass species varies along the vertical direction which leads to a stratified distribution of biotic reaction activity thus the model parameters would be spatially stratified at the field site to simplify the spatial stratified heterogeneity is defined as between strata variance in this study which means model parameters are different between strata we further investigate nitrogen reactive transport in a vertical stratified domain which is equally divided into two layers the hydraulic parameters in both layers are same with those discussed in section 3 1 while the five reactive parameters are set differently in two layers the same four models six scenarios and parameter distributions are applied in this case thus the sensitivity analysis of a total of ten parameters is evaluated results and discussion of this two layer case will be presented in section 5 4 4 results this section presents the results of the global sensitivity index evaluated for individual models and scenarios for multiple models after model averaging but individual scenarios and for multiple models and multiple scenarios after scenario averaging although both the first order and total sensitivity indices defined in section 2 are calculated only the results of total sensitivity index are presented because it considers the impacts of parameter interaction on model outputs which is not considered by the first order sensitivity index in addition only the sensitivity analysis results regarding to nitrate concentration are presented the total sensitivity index is evaluated at the 11 observation points shown in fig 1 and the average index value of each 11 index values is calculated and used for the plotting and discussion below without loss of generality equal probability of scenarios and models i e the probability of each of the six scenarios is 1 6 and the probability of each of the four models is 1 4 are used for evaluating the sensitivity indices below while the impacts of the probability on the sensitivity results were found by dai and ye 2015 discussing the impacts is beyond the scope of this study fig 2 plots the probability density functions pdfs of nitrate concentration averaged over the eleven observation points shown in fig 1 simulated using different models under different scenarios at the simulation time of 100 day as an example the pdfs of other simulation times are similar to those shown in fig 2 and thus not shown the figure shows that the variability of simulated nitrate concentration is substantially different for different models and scenarios since the variance of simulated nitrate concentration is the denominator of the sensitivity index eqs 3 and 4 for a single model and scenario the importance of parameters under different models and scenarios are not directly comparable it is therefore necessary to use the method described in section 2 to evaluate the sensitivity index for multiple models and scenarios table 2 lists the total sensitivity index averaged over the eleven observation points shown in fig 1 of the five parameters evaluated using the individual models and scenarios for nitrate concentration at the simulation time of 100 days if a parameter is not used in a model the index value of the parameter is set to zero for the model for example since parameters q 10 and t r are not used in the models related only to t2 the sensitivity index values of the two parameters are zero for all the models associated with t2 table 3 lists the total sensitivity index averaged over the eleven observation points shown in fig 1 evaluated for the four models but every single scenario as indicated by eqs 8 and 9 the multi model sensitivity index of a parameter is not the arithmetic mean of the parameter s sensitivity index of the four models but the ratio between the model averaged variance of the specific parameter and the model averaged variance of all the parameters in other words the results listed table 3 are not simply the arithmetic mean of the results listed in table 2 taking scenario s5p as an example the sensitivity index value of q 10 in table 3 is 23 34 significantly larger than the arithmetic mean 12 55 of the four index values 30 49 0 19 7 and 0 listed in table 2 the multi model sensitivity index is more informative than the arithmetic average because the former better reflects the contribution of the variance caused by a parameter to the variance caused by all the parameters in the model averaging sense in the last column of table 3 the total sensitivity index of each parameter for multiple models and multiple scenarios are listed this index is the composite parametric sensitivity by simultaneously considering uncertainty in model parameters structures and scenarios the table shows that parameter k den is the most important parameter for the simulated nitrate concentration under the multiple models and scenarios considered in this study the second most important parameter is parameter t r followed by parameters q 10 and then k nit parameter m is the least important parameter 5 discussion this section discusses the results presented in the last section to understand why the parameter importance varies or remains invariant for different models and scenarios why the concepts of model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty help understand conflicting results of parameter importance reported in literature and why the new parameter sensitivity indices with consideration of model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty help identify the parameters important to nitrification and denitrification 5 1 important nitrogen parameters vary among different individual functions and scenarios table 2 shows that the values of sensitivity index of model parameters except m vary substantially for different models and scenarios for example under scenario s5p the total sensitivity index of parameter k den changes from 62 59 for model t1m1 to 4 80 for model t2m2 taking model t2m2 as an example the index changes from 4 8 under scenario s5p to 99 76 under scenario s25w these results indicate that without considering model and scenario uncertainties identifying important parameters based on a single model and a single scenario may lead to incorrect identification the substantial variation of important parameters across different models and scenarios is not surprising because model simulations vary substantially under different models and scenarios more specifically speaking according to eq 4 the sensitivity index of a model parameter for a single model under a single scenario is the ratio between the variance related to the parameter e g the numerator of eq 4 and the variance related to all model parameters e g the denominator of eq 4 since the two variances vary between models under different scenarios the sensitivity index changes for different models and scenarios for example since the numerator variance for parameter k den and the denominator variance are 0 435 and 0 491 respectively for model t2m2 under scenario s15p the corresponding sensitivity index is 88 52 for model t1m1 under scenario s5p the numerator variance and the denominator variance become 1 268 and 2 026 which leads to the sensitivity index of 62 59 therefore the sensitivity indices of individual models under individual scenarios are not comparable and cannot be used to select the important parameters to confirm the identified important parameters for the individual models and scenarios we compare the variance of simulated nitrate concentration for two cases by varying all parameters in the parameter ranges given in section 3 3 and by reducing the parameter range by 40 e g the 20 80 of the original range for one parameter value at a time the basic idea is that if a parameter is more important than other parameters reducing its parameter range will lead to a larger reduction of the variance of simulated nitrate concentration fig 3 plots the marginal distributions of simulated nitrate concentration for the two cases and the corresponding variance for the two cases are also shown in the figure in fig 3 a for model t1m1 and scenario s15p fixing the most important parameter k den leads to a variance reduced from 3 868 to 2 134 the largest reduction for all the parameters the amount of variance reduction is consistent with the ranking of model importance given by the sensitivity index listed in table 2 in other words fixing the value of a more important parameter leads to large variance reduction this indicates that the sobols sensitivity index can be used to identify important model parameters comparing fig 3 a with fig 3 b for model t1m1 and scenario s5p and fig 3 c for model t2m1 and scenario s5p indicates that the values of variance and the amounts of variance reduction change for different models and or different scenarios therefore without considering model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty an inaccurate selection of important parameters may occur 5 2 reasons for conflicting results reported in literature the variability of the sensitivity index may be used to explain different conclusions reported in literature about the importance of the parameters related to nitrification and denitrification processes in table 4 we reviewed some conflicting conclusions which were obtained by various methods the conclusion of wang et al 2005 is supported by the summation of the sensitivity index of q 10 and t r because the index ranges between 24 87 for model t1m2 and scenario s15p and 39 39 for model t1m2 and scenario s25p suggesting that temperature is important to nitrogen transformation however our results demonstrate that the optimal denitrification rate k den is more important the conclusion of heinen 2006 is supported by the sensitivity index of model t1m2 for which the sensitivity index of k den increases when precipitation increases in the wet scenario for example the sensitivity index increases from 26 05 under scenario s5p to 55 13 under scenario s5w it should be noted that nitrogen reaction is sensitive to moisture function doesn t mean it is sensitive to the parameter in moisture function since the parameter here m is always unimportant under all conditions in this study a detailed discussion about this phenomenon is further presented in section 5 4 the results in table 2 also qualitatively support the observation that the nitrification and denitrification processes alternately dominate nitrogen transformation bateman and baggs 2005 concluded that nitrification is the dominant process in nitrogen reactive at low moisture our study on model t1m2 is consistent with their conclusion where the optimal nitrification rate is the most important parameter under scenario s5p lower moisture comparing with scenario s5w higher moisture however the optimal denitrification rate is most important under other conditions which suggests denitrification is a more important process that affects nitrate concentration than nitrification stevens et al 1997 also found the similar conclusion that denitrification and nitrification are alternately dominant however such alternation also depends on the selected models the change of parameter importance for different models and under different scenarios suggests again the need of considering model and scenario uncertainties when selecting important parameters for nitrification and denitrification processes 5 3 identification of important parameters with model and scenario averaging method using the multi model sensitivity index makes it unnecessary to compare the sensitivity indices of different models which are actually incomparable because of the different variance values of different models i e the denominator of eqs 3 and 4 more importantly using the multi model sensitivity index avoids the problem of inaccurate selection of important parameters taking parameter k nit under scenario s5p as an example the index values in table 2 indicate that this parameter is the third important parameter in model t1m1 with the index value of 10 92 but the most important parameter in model t2m2 with the index value of 95 51 the multi model sensitivity index listed in table 3 suggests that this parameter is the second most important parameter with the index value of 28 00 these results show that a parameter important in one model may not be important in another model and the multi model sensitivity index is a more reasonable indicator for evaluating the relative importance of model parameters the change of the sensitivity index values after model averaging can be qualitatively understood by examining the pdfs shown in fig 3 the figure shows that for scenario s5p the variance of model t1m1 is significantly larger than that of model t2m2 quantitatively speaking the sensitivity index of 95 51 for model t2m2 corresponds to a small total variance of 0 204 whereas the sensitivity index of 10 92 for model t1m1 corresponds to a larger total variance of 2 026 the variance of model averaging is the average of the variance of each model which equals 0 720 similarly the variance caused by k nit under model averaging is 0 202 these results explain why the multi model sensitivity index value of k nit listed in table 3 is smaller than the sensitivity index of the three models t2m1 t1m2 and t2m2 listed in table 2 table 5 lists the data that helps gain a quantitative understanding why the multi model index is better than the individual model index the second row of the table lists the variance of simulated nitrate concentration given by the four models and model averaging under scenario s5p the variance of model t2m2 is the smallest of the four models less than 10 of that of model t1m1 the other five rows of table 4 list the variance of simulated nitrate concentration obtained by fixing one parameter at a time similar to the discussion in section 5 2 the reduction of variance between the two cases all parameter varying and one parameter fixed is used to understand why the multi model index is better than the individual model index for identifying important model parameters taking parameter k nit as an example although fixing this parameter reduces the variance substantially from 0 172 to 0 025 for model t2m2 the reduction is smaller than the corresponding reduction of the other three models because the total variance when all parameter varies of model t2m2 is significantly smaller than the corresponding total variance of the other three models more importantly the variance reduction of 0 147 achieved by fixing parameter k nit in model t2m2 is significantly smaller than the variance reduction of 0 73 achieved by fixing parameter k den in model t1m1 in line with this the reduction of model averaging variance by fixing one parameter a time is the largest for parameter k den and the second largest for parameter k nit this example illustrates that the multi model sensitivity index considers the variance reduction of not a single model but of all the models and thus identify the parameters that are important not to a single model but to all the models this is necessary in the situation when model uncertainty exists the same conclusion can be drawn for the multi scenario and individual scenario sensitivity indices although results are not shown 5 4 comparison between one layer case and two layer case table 6 lists the sensitivity analysis index of each parameter for the two layer case the results show that after considering biochemical heterogeneity the importance of parameters for model output shares some similarities with the single layer case for example parameter k den k den up and k den bot often plays a dominant role the results also show that the importance of one parameter varies between layers parameter in bottom layer always has larger sensitivity index than in top layer under each model and scenario since denitrification process is the controlling process of affecting nitrate concentration in this study and denitrification activity in the bottom layer caused by larger moisture content in this layer is significantly stronger than the top layer it is reasonable that the model output nitrate concentration more depends on the parameters in the bottom layer nitrogen reaction activity gains with the increase of soil moisture and temperature since output nitrate concentration uncertainty increases with higher reactive rate the importance of parameters becomes larger in the area with higher moisture content and temperature than in the area with lower soil moisture and temperature it is observed that in this two layer case moisture content is higher in the bottom layer while the temperature is opposite the larger importance of bottom parameters indicates that soil moisture contributes more uncertainty than temperature the results suggest that spatial distribution of soil moisture needs more delicate attention than the temperature in order to better characterize the nitrogen reactive transport however it is not necessary to conclude that parameter related to soil moisture response function is more important than parameters associated with temperature response function from table 6 m is always less important than t r and q 10 this phenomenon indicates that the response of nitrate reaction to an environmental factor i e moisture content sometimes is more controlled by that factor itself but not parameter the above sensitivity analysis can help modeler to contemplate the focus of establishing a nitrogen reactive transport model it is worthy to note that the sensitivity index of one parameter in the single layer case may have a considerable difference with the sum of indices of the same parameter in the top and bottom layers for example sensitivity index of k nit is 57 93 under model t2m1 and scenario s5p in the single layer case which is significantly different with 78 44 the value of the sensitivity index of k nit sum summing indices of k nit up and k nit bot in the two layer case this is understandable since model output nitrate concentration here responds to different number of parameters in different ways by including stratification or not from another perspective the stratification strategy of biochemical reaction parameters can be regarded as another source of model uncertainty recalling the findings when considering various response functions of soil moisture and temperature the new results reconfirm that sensitivity analysis outcomes unavoidably vary between different models no matter where the model uncertainty originates attention must be paid to the model uncertainty when a reasonable sensitivity analysis is required table 7 lists sensitivity indices under model averaging and or scenario averaging by comparing the column 7 in tables 3 and 7 it is interesting to find that parameter k den is still the most important one to model output under model and scenario averaging t r is still more important than q 10 and parameter m remains least important the only exception is that k nit is more important than t r the results from this case together with the results from single layer case indicate that introduced global sensitivity analysis method could largely avoid the inaccurate selection of important parameters under model and scenario uncertainties in a broad sense although the inclusion of stratification produces rather complicated parameter importance rank under each mode and scenario table 6 the results in table 7 positively imply that regardless of the possibly biochemical heterogeneity in nitrogen reactive transport model the global sensitivity analysis by considering model and scenario uncertainties produce fairly consistent parameter importance rank 5 5 limitations of this study there are some limitations to this study 1 the parameter model and scenario uncertainty are considered within a hierarchical framework the interactions between different uncertainty sources are not expressed explicitly during the variance decomposition eq 1 and sensitivity analysis eqs 3 4 8 9 10 and 11 thus the interactions and their impact on output are not quantified in this study 2 since models are conditioned on scenarios and parameters are conditioned on models and scenarios under the given hierarchical framework it is not able to quantify the marginal effect of model and scenario on the outputs by changing models scenarios while keeping parameters and models fixed in this study 6 conclusions and future research recommendations this study conducts a global sensitivity analysis to identify important parameters to the nitrification and denitrification processes in nitrogen reactive transport modeling the reduction functions of soil temperature and moisture content are developed for the scenarios of yearly average temperature and precipitation and the reduction functions have their own parameters that are treated as random variables the five parameters considered in this study are the optimal nitrification and denitrification rates k den and k nit the two parameters t r and q 10 related to the reduction function of temperature and the parameter m related to the reduction function of moisture content to our knowledge this is the first attempt of global sensitivity analysis for nitrification and denitrification processes with simultaneous consideration of parametric uncertainty model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty while the results are specific to the numerical models in this study the results may be useful for understanding variably saturated flow and nitrogen reactive transport this study leads to the following major conclusions 1 the results highlight the complexity of identifying important parameters for nitrogen reactive transport when faced with multiple choices of describing nitrogen reaction and diversely possible temperature and soil moisture variations it is not appropriate to compare the global sensitivity index values under different scenarios and models due to the difference of total variance of prediction the rank of important nitrogen parameters also shows notable disparities the impact of soil temperature and soil moisture content on nitrification and denitrification process can only be properly evaluated by further considering model and scenario uncertainty by introducing the new global sensitivity index the comparison between sensitivity analysis results under different models and scenarios becomes unnecessary 2 a multi model and scenario study reveals that nitrification process becomes more important at either low moisture content or low temperature moreover the increasing importance of nitrification activity with decreased temperature strongly depends on the selected model under given environment model averaging is suggested to make an objective assessment to nitrification or denitrification activity contribution to avoid artificial model error 3 for the five parameters used for simulating the nitrification and denitrification processes in a single layer and two layer case the multi model and multi scenario sensitivity analysis in this study presents a few common features optimal denitrification rate k den is the most important parameter reference temperature t r is more important than temperature coefficient q 10 m is the least important one 4 both environmental factors soil moisture content and temperature themselves and the parameters of response functions impose effect on output nitrate concentration however the response of nitrate reaction to soil moisture depends more on moisture content itself but not moisture function parameter m and the spatial distribution of soil moisture play a more decisive role controlling nitrogen reaction than temperature several future directions are recommended first the equal probability for the four models and six scenarios are assumed in this current study the evaluation of model probability based on observations can be done in various ways e g ye et al 2008 lu et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2016 and scenario probability can be estimated based on expert judgment meyer et al 2007 another future work is to evaluate model probability and scenario probability conditioned on observations of state variables e g moisture content and nitrogen concentration it is expected that by infusing these data into the modeling system uncertainties brought by parameter and model can be restrained however the reduction of scenario uncertainty relies on the improvement on the reliability of future forcing data e g precipitation temperature evapotranspiration the total uncertainty of model output consists of three parts parametric model and scenario uncertainty while the interactions between them are ignored in this study the evaluation of marginal effects from models scenarios and their interactions with parameters require further investigation acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grants 51629901
