2140,how simple or complex catchment models need to be is still unclear particularly for tracer aided models that go beyond hydrograph fitting here we take advantage of a sub daily hydrometric and tracer data set from a tropical montane páramo experimental catchment to fill this knowledge gap we evaluated six conceptual rainfall runoff model structures with different complexity that represent the perceptual understanding of the catchment s hydrological functioning the models solved conservative and reactive tracer mass balances to simulate streamflow stable isotopes and doc concentrations and were assessed for performance and parsimony using three calibration targets discharge only discharge and stable isotopes and discharge and doc resulting in 18 model configurations although all models satisfied the discharge calibration kge 0 8 differences arose when considering tracer transport the more complex models outperformed the simpler ones in terms of goodness of fit and parsimony indicating that the catchment streamflow response consisted of quick near surface flow and tracer contributions more mixed flow through the two main soil types andosols and histosols as well as flow from the well mixed shallow fractured rock up to 20 m depth the bedrock flow pathway contributed up to 25 of total flow during baseflow conditions this study provides a benchmark experiment to identify hydrological and biogeochemical behavior in tropical montane catchments using relatively parsimonious tracer aided hydrological models keywords stable isotopes andes storage transit times páramo tracers doc data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction montane catchments play a vital role in the water supply for millions of people messerli et al 2004 viviroli et al 2007 an example is the vastly populated tropical andes which highly depends on flow generated from a tropical alpine ecosystem known as páramo buytaert et al 2006a water provision from the páramo is essential not only to satisfy human demands but also for irrigation and hydropower generation celleri and feyen 2009 to date some studies have focused on understanding and identifying environmental changes e g climate change and how they will affect these catchments bradley et al 2006 correa et al 2020 mora et al 2014 land use change driven by population growth for example is projected to intensify agricultural use grazing fire and fertilization among others ochoa tocachi et al 2016 quichimbo et al 2012 these activities could play a critical role in the transformation of páramo soils e g by promoting tillage increasing soil compaction impairing hydrological buffering capacity resulting in severe consequences for the hydrological and biogeochemical processes of the ecosystem patiño et al 2021 in addition climate change may lead to shifts in precipitation patterns and extremes as well as increasing temperatures particularly in the highest areas of the andes bradley et al 2006 mora et al 2014 vuille 2013 however climate change impacts are still difficult to predict due to a limited understanding about the hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of paramo catchments e g water and solute mixing transit times and biogeochemical cycling aparecido et al 2017 correa et al 2020 gutiérrez salazar and medrano vizcaíno 2019 rainfall runoff modelling is amongst the most important tools to understand catchment hydrological behavior beven 2012 hydrological models assisted by conservative and reactive tracer information can provide a more comprehensive understanding of hydrological functioning buytaert and beven 2011 clark et al 2011 mcguire and mcdonnell 2015 and also to associated biogeochemical processes birkel and soulsby 2016 dick et al 2015 regier et al 2016 however since models are simplifications of complex real world systems with many inherent uncertainties a thorough assessment as to how simple or complex they should be to adequately represent ecosystem processes is necessary beven and chappell 2021 in this sense several authors have proposed to use models with different degrees of complexity and using them as multiple working hypotheses to identify the most appropriate and parsimonious model structure for a particular hydrological system buytaert and beven 2011 clark et al 2011 pfister and kirchner 2017 in the following we refer to this as a multi model framework the main goal within a multi model framework is to identify the best performing and most parsimonious model representation of the system thus avoiding over simplification and overparameterization of complex processes clark et al 2011 pfister and kirchner 2017 the multi model framework has been used to answer scientific questions in the past e g how to adequately evaluate major hydrological challenges in catchment modelling e g model complexity water fluxes spatial variability computational efficiency clark et al 2015 2017 how different model structures affect runoff simulations for climate change scenarios dams et al 2015 reinecke et al 2021 and how to improve the simulation of discharge and hydrological extremes by including human activity in hydrological models veldkamp et al 2018 although it is still not very common including tracers within a multi model framework could support an adequate simulation of flow paths and also the determination of the sources and residence times of water within a catchment birkel et al 2014 birkel and soulsby 2016 hrachowitz et al 2013 mcdonnell and beven 2014 mcmillan et al 2012 in addition to a better understanding of catchment flow pathways mixing storage and transit times including biogeochemical processes such as dissolved organic carbon doc cycling in models could represent a significant step towards bridging the gap between water quantity and quality hrachowitz et al 2016 proposed transit time distributions ttd as the missing link between water quantity and quality but tracer aided hydrological models that accommodate the biogeochemical processes in their structure have the potential to provide important insights into water and nutrient cycling relations as well birkel et al 2020 in high elevation andean catchments transit times have been evaluated assuming steady state conditions and during baseflow conditions not taking into account flow paths under variable wetness catchment conditions larco et al 2023 lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016b in this context the use of a tracer aided multi model framework can help to unveil interactions between hydrological and biogeochemical processes birkel et al 2014 few studies have incorporated tracers into a multi model framework and we are not aware of any other study in the high elevation tropics with similar objectives understanding doc dynamics is vital for supporting human and aquatic ecosystem health high temporal frequency in stream doc monitoring is relatively easy to achieve birkel et al 2020 chow et al 2003 deforest et al 2018 ouyang et al 2006 pesántez et al 2021 and is particularly useful in peat dominated ecosystems or those with carbon rich soils such as the páramo because the high carbon content could result in the release of high amounts of doc to the streams arízaga idrovo et al 2022 freeman et al 2001 moreover if doc dynamics are influenced by soil moisture and or temperature climate and land use change can significantly increase carbon release to streams pesántez et al 2018 vuille et al 2000 improved knowledge on doc export sources and dynamics can help close the net carbon balance and enhance understanding of terrestrial aquatic carbon connectivity in the páramo carrillo rojas et al 2019 using a novel high resolution flow and tracer data set stable isotopes 4 to 6 hours sampling doc hourly sampling we aimed to improve knowledge of hydrological and biogeochemical catchment functioning of the andean páramo using a multi model framework our specific aims were 1 to develop conceptual tracer aided hydrological models of varying complexity to represent different empirically known hydrological processes for a data rich tropical alpine páramo catchment 2 to identify the best model representing catchment hydrological processes at a minimum complexity by evaluating the performances of the models developed in 1 and 3 to link catchment hydrological behavior to biogeochemical processes through the simultaneous calibration of water fluxes and in stream stable isotopes and doc concentrations using tracer aided hydrological models developed in 1 2 study site and current understanding of hydrological processes the tropical alpine zhurucay ecohydrological observatory table 1 is located on the western slope of the andean mountain range in the highlands of southern ecuador 3 04 s 79 14 w and drains to the pacific ocean at elevations between 3662 and 3900 m a s l the observatory has been the focus of various hydrometeorological and ecohydrological studies aimed to enhance our understanding of rainfall runoff processes in páramo catchments correa et al 2017 lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2015 mosquera et al 2016a these studies identified the amazon rainforest situated east of the andean mountain range as the main moisture source esquivel hernández et al 2018 zhiña et al 2022 that generates mainly low intensity precipitation throughout the year padrón et al 2015 fig 2 zhurucay is an energy limited and water abundant system it has two dominant landscape units that differ markedly in hydrological functioning hillslopes and valley bottom wetlands the hillslopes are characterized by volcanic ash soils known as andosols with tussock grass vegetation and cover 78 of the catchment area the valley bottom wetlands are mainly composed of organic rich peat type soils known as histosols and cover 22 of the catchment lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2015 these wetlands are generally recharged by the hillslope andosols the wetlands close to the stream network significantly influence the water yield in zhurucay the chemical composition of the soils is composed of high contents of aluminum iron and other metals buytaert et al 2005 buytaert et al 2006b another important feature is the high subsurface hydrological connectivity between hillslopes andosols and wetlands histosols during rainstorm events correa et al 2019 andosols have a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity 47 less and porosity 16 less than the shallow organic soil layers of the histosols lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016a vertical soil water movement is driven by a quicker response of a shallow organic soil horizon compared to the slower response of deeper soil layers table 1 crespo et al 2012 lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016a mosquera et al 2021 the main runoff generation process is therefore the shallow subsurface flow in histosols and andosols these differences in the páramo soils properties and distribution within the catchment affect the transport of water from the hillslopes streams and soils to the wetlands and therefore the regulation of water quantity and quality downstream generally rainfall that infiltrates the soil on the upper to the middle slope andosols flows laterally through the shallow organic soil mosquera et al 2016b as it reaches the bottom of the slope histosols more vertical flow paths are activated and the water reaches more hydrologically inactive zones in the wetlands mosquera et al 2016a hortonian overland flow in these soils is rare due to the high porosity infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity of the soils which is higher than typical rainfall intensities table 1 observations indicate that histosols remain close to saturation year round saturation is reached during periods of sustained rainfall or high intensity rainfall events correa et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016a springs sourced by shallow groundwater also contribute to streamflow the geology in zhurucay is mainly composed by compacted volcanic rocks from the quimsacocha basaltic flows with plagioclases feldspars and andesitic pyroclasts and turi tuffaceous andesitic breccias conglomerates and horizontal stratified sands formations coltorti and ollier 2000 hydrogeological surveys near zhurucay revealed a shallow fractured rock layer of around 20 m depth itasca denver inc 2020 this layer is hydraulically disconnected from the deeper bedrock which has a very low quasi compact permeability therefore low deep groundwater contributions to streams were observed at zhurucay traveling through mineral soil especially during low flow conditions correa et al 2017 transit times have been calculated in this ecosystem 188 days using lumped convolution integral models lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016b 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrometric data collection rainfall p streamflow q and actual evapotranspiration eta were measured at 5 min resolution during the period october 2017 february 2019 fig 2 a texas electronics tipping bucket rain gauge 0 1 mm resolution tr 525m dallas tx usa was installed at the meteorological station and two additional onset rain gauges 0 2 mm resolution rg3 m onset bourne usa elsewhere in the catchment fig 1 both gauges have a 1 accuracy and were used to calculate the average precipitation in the catchment using the thiessen polygon method we installed cs616 water content reflectometers campbell scientific logan usa next to the meteorological station at 10 cm soil depth to record soil water content swc the swc was recorded at a 5 min resolution and has a precision better than 0 1 with the calibration procedure explained in ochoa sánchez et al 2018 an inw aquistar ct2x kirkland wa usa pressure transducer sensor with 0 06 accuracy was installed in a combined rectangular v notch weir at the micro catchment outlet fig 1 and used to measure the stream water level which was transformed into discharge using a calibrated rating curve percentage absolute error 2 1 guallpa et al 2022 based on the kindsvater shen equation united states bureau of reclamation 2001 discharge was measured using the salt dilution technique 17 guallpa et al 2022 the calibration range 0 001 600 l s 1 was smaller than the observed discharge range 0 002 3093 l s 1 but the percentage of the time that the discharge was outside the calibration period was very small 0 9 actual evapotranspiration eta fig 2 was measured using the eddy covariance ec technique as explained in carrillo rojaset al 2019 3 2 tracer monitoring and water sampling two tracers were monitored during the period october 2017 february 2019 stable isotopes specifically deuterium δ2h and doc fig 2 rain water for isotopic analysis was accumulated in a custom made pressure based sequential rainfall sampler mcdonnell et al 1990 collecting one sample for every 2 08 mm of rain the setup of the device is described in detail in zhiña et al 2022 streamflow samples were taken using a campbell scientific automatic sampler pvs4100d logan ut usa every four hours isotope laboratory analysis were carried out with a cavity ring down spectrometer l2130 i picarro picarro inc usa the complete analysis procedure is explained in zhiña et al 2022 even though both stable isotopes oxygen 18 and deuterium δ2h were analyzed we used deuterium for illustration purposes high values range and refer to it as stable isotopes the rainfall and streamflow samples plotted close to the global meteoric water line fig 2 f suggesting little to no evaporative fractionation therefore both isotopes would yield identical results as tracers in modelling streamflow doc concentrations were estimated using an uv vis spectrometer spectrolyser s can messtechnik gmbh vienna austria following the calibration procedure described in detail in pesántez et al 2021 number of samples used for calibration 1822 normalized rmse 20 nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 7 calibration range 2 16 mg l 1 which was the same period and range as the present study percentage of the time outside the calibration period 0 3 3 tracer aided multi model conceptualizations we formulated six different model structures based on previous empirical understanding of páramo catchment hydrological behavior fig 3 the model structures ranged from a simple lumped to a more complex semi distributed structures and describe the role of the two dominant soil types or hydrologic response units for runoff fig 3 and table 2 for the model constitutive equations model m1 fig 3 1 represents the simplest lumped conceptualization of two vertically connected reservoirs representing the soil profile the shallow near surface reservoir generates relatively quick near surface flow qs and is connected vertically to the deeper reservoir representing subsurface flow the first shallow near surface reservoir provides a quick potentially preferential response to the stream q1 the shallow reservoir recharges the deeper mineral reservoir only if there is water available above field capacity the deeper reservoir provides baseflow q2 to the stream based on the linear reservoir assumption model m2 fig 3 1 is similar to model m1 but additionally includes a shallow fractured rock reservoir that is recharged and drained in the same way as the mineral reservoir described for model 1 q3 model m3 fig 3 3 is a semi distributed conceptualization of two parallel reservoirs which in this study represent the main soil types in the páramo ecosystem andosols on the hillslopes and histosols in the valley bottoms connected to the stream both reservoirs can provide a quick preferential response to the stream similar to the organic layers previously described the water drains from the andosol reservoir to the histosol q1 and then directly drains to the stream q2 the histosol reservoir generates quick near surface flow qs model m4 fig 3 4 is similar to model m3 but includes a shallow fractured rock reservoir that is recharged by both the histosol wetland and andosol hillslopes reservoirs only the histosol q2 and the shallow fractured rock q3 reservoirs generate streamflow model m5 fig 3 5 is a mix of models m1 and m3 here the andosol consists of an organic fast response reservoir and a slower responding deeper reservoir similar to the first structure however both hillslope reservoirs drain into the parallel histosol reservoir from which streamflow is generated q2 representing a potentially faster response due to higher connectivity model m6 fig 3 6 is similar to model m5 but additionally includes a fourth shallow fractured rock reservoir that is recharged by both the mineral reservoir of the andosol and the histosol reservoir the histosol quickly drains water to the stream q2 plus the slower and more constant deeper baseflow contribution to streamflow from the deep reservoir q3 the histosol reservoir generates quick near surface flow qs tracer mass balances for stable isotopes and doc transport were implemented in the rainfall runoff models for these simulations we used the dynamic storage volumes in the hydrological module to mix tracers in the reservoirs for the stable isotopes and to simulate the doc dynamics in the biogeochemical module table 2 for the stable isotope module we assumed a complete mixing of incoming rain with stored soil water isotopes the complete mixing assumption was based on previous studies in the same catchment that yielded the best results for the paramo system lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016b we also included calibrated passive storage volumes psup storage in the shallow soil water psdw storage in the deep soil water and psfr storage in shallow fractured rock in each reservoir creating additional volume for stable isotopes mixing and transport without affecting the dynamic storage in the hydrological module similar to birkel and soulsby 2016 we define the term passive storage as the immobile or non active water in the catchment pore water or water that is outside the hydro physical structure of the soil that has been observed through experimentation and available for tracer mixing but that does not hydrologically contribute to streamflow birkel et al 2011 the biogeochemical module used a production parameter kdoc biogeochemical module table 2 an energy activation parameter e a simple loss parameter l that consumes absorbs or mineralizes doc and a calibrated soil moisture parameter that represents a lower limit to doc production similar to birkel et al 2017 we did not use air soil temperature as a driver of doc because in tropical páramo ecosystems the temperature has a very low intra annual variability córdova et al 2016 furthermore pesántez et al 2018 identified soil moisture as the sole hydro meteorological doc control for natural páramo vegetation 3 4 model calibration and assessment all models were calibrated using three different targets i only water fluxes i e only calibrating q ii water flux and stable isotopes i e calibrating q stable isotopes and iii water flux and doc i e calibrating q doc for cases ii and iii tracer dynamics were simulated within the hydrological model and the hydrological and tracer modules were calibrated simultaneously we split the data set in two parts the first 75 was used for model calibration october 2017 october 2018 and the other 25 for model validation november 2018 february 2019 we applied a multi objective genetic algorithm nsga2 deb et al 2002 to simultaneously optimize the simulation of discharge q and either tracer stable isotopes and doc the two dimensional and equally weighted optimized objective functions were i the kling gupta efficiency kge of q and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of q ii the kge of q and the kge of stable isotopes and iii the kge of q and the kge of doc the kge accounts for correlation r bias α and variability β expected kge values range from to 1 nse has the same range with a value of 1 indicating a perfect fit gupta et al 2009 efficiencies above 0 45 were considered acceptable mosquera et al 2016b the nsga2 seeks to minimize the objective functions and we therefore used 1 kge and 1 nse for model calibration and evaluation i e values close to 0 indicate better model performance we used a total of 500 generations in each calibration run with 200 parameter set populations deb et al 2002 wang et al 2019 to sufficiently explore the parameter space 100 000 iterations for the different model configurations 4 to 18 calibrated parameters table 2 we then retained the final i e best 200 solutions for each model to visualize simulation ranges as a qualitative indicator of parameter uncertainty two dimensional pareto fronts were used to visualize the resulting approximations found by the nsga2 in terms of convergence spread and distribution of objective functions zitzler et al 2003 pareto fronts of each model and each calibration target were compared to assess model performance in addition the bayesian information criteria bic was used to select the most parsimonious model to represent the system penalizing the number of calibrated parameters gideon 1978 as follows 1 bic n l n sse n p l n n where ln is de natural log n is the number of observations p represents the number of calibrated parameters and sse is the sum of the residual error and the maximized likelihood function models with a lower bic are preferred 3 5 storage and transit time estimates catchment storage is composed of a dynamic component hydraulically connected to the stream table 2 the s reservoir variables calculated from the running water balance and an additional passive mixing volume that is available for tracer mixing but does not contribute to streamflow the dynamic storage component represents the water in each model reservoir above a certain threshold at which the reservoir starts contributing to the stream the passive storage volume is a calibrated parameter for each reservoir that is only available for mixing tracers stable isotopes birkel et al 2011 staudinger et al 2017 the sum of the dynamic and passive storage volume total storage was used to calculate transit times tt eq 2 based on the assumption that the catchment is a single unit that includes all the possible water flow pathways lazo et al 2019 mcmillan et al 2012 thus the tt can be calculated as a lumped but time variable catchment descriptor based on the catchment water balance lazo et al 2019 using the discharge as the output for stationary processes eq 2 and discharge plus eta as the outputs for non stationary processes eq 3 2 tt s t o r a g e q 3 tt s t o r a g e q et a 4 results 4 1 tracer based multi model simulation of páramo catchment dynamics the six model conceptualizations of catchment hydrological behavior fig 3 table 2 yielded acceptable simulation of streamflow dynamics with peak flows being well represented fig 4 only q nevertheless the models that did not include an additional shallow fractured rock reservoir models m1 m3 and m5 did not adequately reproduce hydrograph recessions and baseflow dynamics fig 4 m1 m3 m5 in addition models m5 and m6 that included slow and fast flow components on the hillslopes simulated the overall streamflow dynamics better than the simpler model configurations models m1 m2 m3 and m4 kge 0 9 boxplot panel in fig 4 further testing of the models for isotope and doc simulations fig 5 showed that the simpler models 1 4 failed to adequately capture the tracer dynamics only model m6 resulted in a good streamflow isotope simulations while models m5 and m6 adequately simulated doc most notably the peak concentrations of both tracers were well represented by these models direct comparison of simulated and observed tracer dynamics fig 5 showed that model m6 yielded the most accurate representation of stable isotopes and doc in streamflow these results confirmed the need to represent the páramo hydrological system by the dominant soil types andosols on the hillslopes and histosols at valley bottoms and with a shallow fractured bedrock reservoir that constantly contributes to total streamflow the latter was even more evident during low flow periods e g 11 2017 to 01 2018 and 10 2018 to 11 2018 and allowed an accurate simulation of the dynamics of discharge conservative and reactive tracers figs 4 and 5 4 2 comparing tracer based calibration targets fig 6 shows the comparison of model performance i e goodness of fit for the six evaluated model structures m1 m6 through the visualization of two dimensional pareto fronts fig 6 a b c and the distribution of model performance fig 5 d e f for the retained parameter sets after calibration using the three different calibration targets i e with and without tracers the pareto fronts show that the most complex model m6 outperformed the other five models for the only q and the q stable isotopes calibration targets for the q doc calibration target models 5 and 6 presented a similar discharge performance and outperformed the simpler models 1 4 but model 5 had a slightly better performance for doc kge improvement 0 05 this also had implications for the best parameter sets of the models 1 to 6 where the parameter sets for comparing the three calibration targets were more consistent for the complex models see appendix when penalizing the models for the number of calibrated parameters to account for potential overparameterization the bic values in terms of discharge simulation fig 7 a for the validation period were quite similar with better results for models m6 9 parameters bic 17641 and m5 6 parameters bic 17630 when introducing stable isotopes as tracer in the models models m2 9 parameters bic 17226 and m6 13 parameters bic 17059 led to the best results for discharge when introducing doc as tracer for model calibration models m5 13 parameters bic 17043 and m4 14 parameters bic 16863 led to the best results for tracer simulations model m6 13 parameters for q stable isotopes bic 791 was the best model fig 7a despite the highest number of parameters compared to the other models for the doc simulations models m5 15 parameters bic 514 and m6 19 parameters bic 1421 were the most parsimonious of all assessed models 4 3 water age storage fluxes and independent model evaluation we compared the dynamic storage that hydraulically contributes to streamflow using the median of the best retained parameter sets for each model and calibration target table 3 roughly the dynamic storage varied from 10 mm to 106 mm for all models and targets and was almost an order of magnitude smaller than the passive storage 450 mm to 1220 mm thus the dynamic storage represented between 1 and 13 of the total storage the highest dynamic storage of around 100 mm resulted from models m1 and m2 for all targets whereas the dynamic storages from models m3 to m6 were smaller than 50 mm model m6 had the most consistent dynamic storage with less than 10 mm difference between the three calibration targets the passive storage and mean transit times of the best results of all models were significantly different wilcoxon test p value 0 005 table 3 the largest passive storage 971 1216 mm and resulting mtts 649 813 days for stationary conditions and 316 396 days for non stationary conditions values were obtained for model m4 smaller passive storage 455 1014 mm and mtts 287 640 days for stationary conditions and 144 321 days for non stationary conditions values coincided for model m2 overall mtts were in the order of 9 months to 2 5 years for stationary conditions and in the order of 5 months to 13 months for non stationary conditions the separation of the simulated hydrograph into the sources contributing water to streamflow revealed the important contribution of deeper soil layers and shallow fractured rock during baseflow conditions only q 18 q stable isotopes 21 q doc 36 fig 8 these water sources help to maintain streamflow during rain free periods fig 8 models 1 2 4 6 this is most evident in models m3 and m5 which did not include a deep soil layer or shallow fractured rock water source and resulted in a poor representation of baseflow however wetter periods are consistently well simulated by all models for all calibration targets with water mainly originating from shallower and well connected water sources we independently evaluated all proposed models by comparing their simulated dynamic storage with the temporal dynamics of observed soil water content swc we rescaled the swc values measured in the shallow andosol horizon fig 9 from the actual range 0 1 cm3 cm 3 to the storage range of the models 50 to 100 mm for comparison purposes the dynamic storage of all models was high and significant correlated with soil water content the best linear regressions were found for the only discharge calibration target of model m2 r2 0 88 intercept 2 5 followed by model m6 r2 0 88 intercept 25 for the q stable isotopes calibration targets the best correlations were found for model m6 r2 0 9 intercept 8 and models m5 and m2 r2 0 84 intercept 3 06 and r2 0 84 intercept 5 02 respectively for the q doc target the best correlations were found for model m5 r2 0 85 intercept 11 and models m2 and m4 r2 0 85 intercept 13 and r2 0 85 intercept 17 4 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 best model representation of the páramo hydrological system different rainfall runoff model structures i e multi model framework resulted in a very similar overall discharge model performance figs 4 and 7 the very simple 4 parameter model e g model m1 was able to simulate streamflow almost equally well as the much more complex model m6 with 9 parameters however there can be severe limitations of rainfall runoff models in representing the water flow paths or catchment functioning even when discharge simulations are acceptable birkel and soulsby 2015 mcguire and mcdonnell 2015 if additional hydrological characteristics such as catchment storage transit time and hydrograph separation were considered the advantages of tracer aided hydrological models over only rainfall runoff models become clear cf christian birkel and soulsby 2015 mcguire and mcdonnell 2015 the independent model evaluation comparing dynamic storage and observed swc showed qualitatively similar dynamics fig 8 but the simulated storage was better represented with the most complex model model m6 for all calibration targets r squared 0 93 the model performance comparisons nse and kge showed that the more complex models had an advantage over simpler ones particularly when using tracers for model calibration fig 6 and fig 9 significant differences were observed among almost all groups of optimized kge values kruskal wallis rank sum test p value 0 001 however the greatest differences were found for the tracer aided model simulations fig 6 the tracer scatter plots fig 5 clearly indicated the improvement of the simulations as the more complex models approach the 1 1 line thus the more complex models models m4 m5 m6 that included flow through deep soil layers and shallow fractured rock in addition to quicker near surface runoff generation outperformed other models these findings support previous findings in this ecosystem that found that andosols on hillslopes drain water to the valley bottom histosols which in turn contribute the bulk of water to discharge correa et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016a in addition a shallow rock model reservoir was necessary to maintain baseflows during rain free periods similar to the results for nearby páramo catchments studied by ramónet al 2021 and buytaert and beven 2011 indeed the thin layer of fractured rock observed in geological studies itasca denver inc 2020 could play an important role in the hydrology of the páramo similar to the rock moisture hypothesis by rempe and dietrich 2018 the latter was observed in a different geological setting with a more seasonal climate in california usa and can be thought of as a more widespread global hydrological feature the fractured rock layer in our models generated 18 37 of streamflow and was particularly important for baseflows the contribution from this additional but disconnected reservoir can potentially contain waters 1 year old i e older than streamflow mtts estimated at catchment scales 6 9 months mosquera et al 2016b and causes non stationary tts similar to other fast responding systems in the tropics muñoz villers et al 2016 5 2 biogeochemical dynamics in the páramo hydrological system the hourly doc data series included peaks or mobilization events whose representation in most hydrological models remains a challenge blaurock et al 2021 ducharme et al 2021 werner et al 2019 unless the dynamics of not only carbon production but also those of deposition and consumption in the hydrological system are adequately represented by the model aitkenhead et al 2007 rosset et al 2020 in the páramo specifically doc production is more related to soil moisture conditions than to meteorological conditions pesántez et al 2018 in contrast to other more temperate ecosystems birkel et al 2017 the more complex models models m5 and m6 that react only to the amount of water stored in each reservoir were successful at simulating doc at high temporal resolution the simpler models did not reproduce most of the quick production events in the histosol reservoirs birkel et al 2020 pesántez et al 2018 wei et al 2021 resulting in a lower model performance fig 4 the latter supports evidence from previous observations in which wetting and rewetting events are directly related to high doc concentrations in peat ecosystems fenner and freeman 2011 tunaley et al 2017 lumped models or even the simple semi distributed histosol andosol models models m1 m4 could not accurately mimic doc dynamics in the stream due to the fact that the high production of carbon in the shallow soils needs to be accompanied by consumption deposition processes in the deeper soils which were not represented by the simplest models the latter was also visible from the pareto fronts in fig 6 even model 6 that resulted in acceptable discharge and doc simulations showed a trade off effects with slightly lower discharge performance at the expense of satisfying two calibration targets fowler et al 2018 in addition we believe that including dispersion and partial mixing processes into simple conceptual models can give additional insights into the functioning of catchment systems fenicia et al 2010 hrachowitz et al 2013 but crucially depends on future data availability for different soil water pools to help with model parameterization doc export rate estimates yielded by the six models were similar to those measured previously in the study catchment 48 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 arízaga idrovo et al 2022 from all the models export rates obtained from model m6 calibrated on the discharge and doc targets represented the observations best model m1 62 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m2 61 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m3 64 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m4 59 1 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m5 58 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m6 45 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 the representation of lateral flow rewetting processes and riparian areas as doc production hotspots strongly influenced the carbon export from the catchment highlighting possible consequences of climate and land use change on water quantity quality of the páramo ecosystem pesántez et al 2018 such results could only have been produced by direct comparison of different model structures and a temporally high resolution data set fig 4 and fig 8 in this sense our proposed more complex models resolved limitations of previous studies in approximating flow and tracer dynamics particularly at low flows in the páramo cabrera balarezo et al 2022 gil and tobón 2016 vázquez 2010 5 3 multi model catchment storage and tt simulations modelled dynamic storage was similar to that estimated from hydrological data in the study catchment lazo et al 2019 particularly for model m6 important differences emerged when comparing the results derived for total storage including passive storage mixing volumes for model m6 855 1193 mm and those calculated from streamflow mean transit time estimates 445 mm in the same catchment based on the catchment water balance lazo et al 2019 our results can be compared to lazoet al 2019 specifically to their calculated soil horizon passive storages 854 mm a possible explanation for storage differences is that some flow paths are not hydrologically active when calculating tts and storage birkel et al 2011 kirchner 2009 however our results are comparable to others for peat dominated catchments amvrosiadi et al 2017 van huijgevoort et al 2016 the latter studies accounted for all the water available for mixing and not only the shallow hydrologically active flow paths cf mcguire and mcdonnell 2015 soulsby et al 2009 it seems that in comparison to tracer aided hydrological model estimates calculations based on soil properties of the hydrologically active layers lead to an underestimation of total storage bishop et al 2011 guangxuan et al 2021 furthermore different methods to estimate storage can yield different transit times staudinger et al 2017 most common rainfall runoff models only consider the hydraulically active soil and groundwater contributions to streamflow related to the higher storage estimates our calculated transit times calculated assuming stationary conditions 542 to 757 days using the most parsimonious model model m6 were longer than those previously reported for the same catchment using lumped convolution integral models 188 days lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016b this difference is likely related to the fact that the tracer aided hydrological models consider the system as a whole including potential non stationary changes in water storage associated to flow paths under different catchment wetness conditions cain et al 2019 heidbüchel et al 2012 staudinger et al 2017 transit times calculated under non stationary conditions already found in this catchment by larcoet al 2023 were much closer to those found previously using lumped convolution integral models larco et al 2023 mosquera et al 2016b in addition we identified an additional reservoir shallow fractured rock which generates a significant volume of water 18 37 to the stream during baseflow conditions increasing transit times and related passive storage our results improve the understanding of páramo catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry while highlighting the benefit of including tracers into conceptual rainfall runoff models to enhance hydrobiogeochemical process knowledge kirchner 2006 the results indicate that due to the compact geology and low precipitation volumes distributed throughout the year small changes in climate or land use directly affect the soil water dynamics with likely significant affect the páramo ecohydrology e g export of carbon and other associated solutes therefore future work should focus on a spatial analysis of doc generation hotspots in the catchment assessing doc source contributions to streamflow carbon export 6 conclusions and outlook this study presents for the first time a complete suite of rainfall runoff models of different complexity to conceptualize the hydrological behavior of an experimental páramo catchment in the tropical andean highlands of southern ecuador the incorporation of conservative stable isotopes and reactive doc tracers into these models helped to assess the hydrological and biogeochemical catchment functioning of the páramo models of higher complexity outperformed the simpler ones when introducing tracers for calibration our simulations identified the importance of flow through deep soil layers and shallow fractured rock to sustain streamflow generation during drier periods baseflow this finding was only possible by including a conservative tracer module in the rainfall runoff model structures tracer based simulations clearly showed a mix of fast and slow flows generated from the shallow and deeper soil layers of histosols and andosols in combination with water from a shallow fractured rock layer on top of the compact bedrock these results were consistent for both tracer calibration targets discharge stable isotopes and discharge doc but for slightly different reasons the biogeochemical module simulated doc dynamics at high temporal resolution based only on the modeled soil water content without the need of including temperature as a predictor for doc production but the estimated doc mass flux depends on the accurate simulation of the combination of flow paths as identified with stable isotopes based on our findings we conclude that tracer selection depends on the specific objectives and study purpose as each have advantages and limitations in field experimental design and analytical cost to bridge the gap from hydrological to biogeochemical catchment functioning incorporation of both tracers into models is crucially needed credit authorship contribution statement juan pesántez

2140,how simple or complex catchment models need to be is still unclear particularly for tracer aided models that go beyond hydrograph fitting here we take advantage of a sub daily hydrometric and tracer data set from a tropical montane páramo experimental catchment to fill this knowledge gap we evaluated six conceptual rainfall runoff model structures with different complexity that represent the perceptual understanding of the catchment s hydrological functioning the models solved conservative and reactive tracer mass balances to simulate streamflow stable isotopes and doc concentrations and were assessed for performance and parsimony using three calibration targets discharge only discharge and stable isotopes and discharge and doc resulting in 18 model configurations although all models satisfied the discharge calibration kge 0 8 differences arose when considering tracer transport the more complex models outperformed the simpler ones in terms of goodness of fit and parsimony indicating that the catchment streamflow response consisted of quick near surface flow and tracer contributions more mixed flow through the two main soil types andosols and histosols as well as flow from the well mixed shallow fractured rock up to 20 m depth the bedrock flow pathway contributed up to 25 of total flow during baseflow conditions this study provides a benchmark experiment to identify hydrological and biogeochemical behavior in tropical montane catchments using relatively parsimonious tracer aided hydrological models keywords stable isotopes andes storage transit times páramo tracers doc data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction montane catchments play a vital role in the water supply for millions of people messerli et al 2004 viviroli et al 2007 an example is the vastly populated tropical andes which highly depends on flow generated from a tropical alpine ecosystem known as páramo buytaert et al 2006a water provision from the páramo is essential not only to satisfy human demands but also for irrigation and hydropower generation celleri and feyen 2009 to date some studies have focused on understanding and identifying environmental changes e g climate change and how they will affect these catchments bradley et al 2006 correa et al 2020 mora et al 2014 land use change driven by population growth for example is projected to intensify agricultural use grazing fire and fertilization among others ochoa tocachi et al 2016 quichimbo et al 2012 these activities could play a critical role in the transformation of páramo soils e g by promoting tillage increasing soil compaction impairing hydrological buffering capacity resulting in severe consequences for the hydrological and biogeochemical processes of the ecosystem patiño et al 2021 in addition climate change may lead to shifts in precipitation patterns and extremes as well as increasing temperatures particularly in the highest areas of the andes bradley et al 2006 mora et al 2014 vuille 2013 however climate change impacts are still difficult to predict due to a limited understanding about the hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of paramo catchments e g water and solute mixing transit times and biogeochemical cycling aparecido et al 2017 correa et al 2020 gutiérrez salazar and medrano vizcaíno 2019 rainfall runoff modelling is amongst the most important tools to understand catchment hydrological behavior beven 2012 hydrological models assisted by conservative and reactive tracer information can provide a more comprehensive understanding of hydrological functioning buytaert and beven 2011 clark et al 2011 mcguire and mcdonnell 2015 and also to associated biogeochemical processes birkel and soulsby 2016 dick et al 2015 regier et al 2016 however since models are simplifications of complex real world systems with many inherent uncertainties a thorough assessment as to how simple or complex they should be to adequately represent ecosystem processes is necessary beven and chappell 2021 in this sense several authors have proposed to use models with different degrees of complexity and using them as multiple working hypotheses to identify the most appropriate and parsimonious model structure for a particular hydrological system buytaert and beven 2011 clark et al 2011 pfister and kirchner 2017 in the following we refer to this as a multi model framework the main goal within a multi model framework is to identify the best performing and most parsimonious model representation of the system thus avoiding over simplification and overparameterization of complex processes clark et al 2011 pfister and kirchner 2017 the multi model framework has been used to answer scientific questions in the past e g how to adequately evaluate major hydrological challenges in catchment modelling e g model complexity water fluxes spatial variability computational efficiency clark et al 2015 2017 how different model structures affect runoff simulations for climate change scenarios dams et al 2015 reinecke et al 2021 and how to improve the simulation of discharge and hydrological extremes by including human activity in hydrological models veldkamp et al 2018 although it is still not very common including tracers within a multi model framework could support an adequate simulation of flow paths and also the determination of the sources and residence times of water within a catchment birkel et al 2014 birkel and soulsby 2016 hrachowitz et al 2013 mcdonnell and beven 2014 mcmillan et al 2012 in addition to a better understanding of catchment flow pathways mixing storage and transit times including biogeochemical processes such as dissolved organic carbon doc cycling in models could represent a significant step towards bridging the gap between water quantity and quality hrachowitz et al 2016 proposed transit time distributions ttd as the missing link between water quantity and quality but tracer aided hydrological models that accommodate the biogeochemical processes in their structure have the potential to provide important insights into water and nutrient cycling relations as well birkel et al 2020 in high elevation andean catchments transit times have been evaluated assuming steady state conditions and during baseflow conditions not taking into account flow paths under variable wetness catchment conditions larco et al 2023 lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016b in this context the use of a tracer aided multi model framework can help to unveil interactions between hydrological and biogeochemical processes birkel et al 2014 few studies have incorporated tracers into a multi model framework and we are not aware of any other study in the high elevation tropics with similar objectives understanding doc dynamics is vital for supporting human and aquatic ecosystem health high temporal frequency in stream doc monitoring is relatively easy to achieve birkel et al 2020 chow et al 2003 deforest et al 2018 ouyang et al 2006 pesántez et al 2021 and is particularly useful in peat dominated ecosystems or those with carbon rich soils such as the páramo because the high carbon content could result in the release of high amounts of doc to the streams arízaga idrovo et al 2022 freeman et al 2001 moreover if doc dynamics are influenced by soil moisture and or temperature climate and land use change can significantly increase carbon release to streams pesántez et al 2018 vuille et al 2000 improved knowledge on doc export sources and dynamics can help close the net carbon balance and enhance understanding of terrestrial aquatic carbon connectivity in the páramo carrillo rojas et al 2019 using a novel high resolution flow and tracer data set stable isotopes 4 to 6 hours sampling doc hourly sampling we aimed to improve knowledge of hydrological and biogeochemical catchment functioning of the andean páramo using a multi model framework our specific aims were 1 to develop conceptual tracer aided hydrological models of varying complexity to represent different empirically known hydrological processes for a data rich tropical alpine páramo catchment 2 to identify the best model representing catchment hydrological processes at a minimum complexity by evaluating the performances of the models developed in 1 and 3 to link catchment hydrological behavior to biogeochemical processes through the simultaneous calibration of water fluxes and in stream stable isotopes and doc concentrations using tracer aided hydrological models developed in 1 2 study site and current understanding of hydrological processes the tropical alpine zhurucay ecohydrological observatory table 1 is located on the western slope of the andean mountain range in the highlands of southern ecuador 3 04 s 79 14 w and drains to the pacific ocean at elevations between 3662 and 3900 m a s l the observatory has been the focus of various hydrometeorological and ecohydrological studies aimed to enhance our understanding of rainfall runoff processes in páramo catchments correa et al 2017 lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2015 mosquera et al 2016a these studies identified the amazon rainforest situated east of the andean mountain range as the main moisture source esquivel hernández et al 2018 zhiña et al 2022 that generates mainly low intensity precipitation throughout the year padrón et al 2015 fig 2 zhurucay is an energy limited and water abundant system it has two dominant landscape units that differ markedly in hydrological functioning hillslopes and valley bottom wetlands the hillslopes are characterized by volcanic ash soils known as andosols with tussock grass vegetation and cover 78 of the catchment area the valley bottom wetlands are mainly composed of organic rich peat type soils known as histosols and cover 22 of the catchment lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2015 these wetlands are generally recharged by the hillslope andosols the wetlands close to the stream network significantly influence the water yield in zhurucay the chemical composition of the soils is composed of high contents of aluminum iron and other metals buytaert et al 2005 buytaert et al 2006b another important feature is the high subsurface hydrological connectivity between hillslopes andosols and wetlands histosols during rainstorm events correa et al 2019 andosols have a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity 47 less and porosity 16 less than the shallow organic soil layers of the histosols lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016a vertical soil water movement is driven by a quicker response of a shallow organic soil horizon compared to the slower response of deeper soil layers table 1 crespo et al 2012 lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016a mosquera et al 2021 the main runoff generation process is therefore the shallow subsurface flow in histosols and andosols these differences in the páramo soils properties and distribution within the catchment affect the transport of water from the hillslopes streams and soils to the wetlands and therefore the regulation of water quantity and quality downstream generally rainfall that infiltrates the soil on the upper to the middle slope andosols flows laterally through the shallow organic soil mosquera et al 2016b as it reaches the bottom of the slope histosols more vertical flow paths are activated and the water reaches more hydrologically inactive zones in the wetlands mosquera et al 2016a hortonian overland flow in these soils is rare due to the high porosity infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity of the soils which is higher than typical rainfall intensities table 1 observations indicate that histosols remain close to saturation year round saturation is reached during periods of sustained rainfall or high intensity rainfall events correa et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016a springs sourced by shallow groundwater also contribute to streamflow the geology in zhurucay is mainly composed by compacted volcanic rocks from the quimsacocha basaltic flows with plagioclases feldspars and andesitic pyroclasts and turi tuffaceous andesitic breccias conglomerates and horizontal stratified sands formations coltorti and ollier 2000 hydrogeological surveys near zhurucay revealed a shallow fractured rock layer of around 20 m depth itasca denver inc 2020 this layer is hydraulically disconnected from the deeper bedrock which has a very low quasi compact permeability therefore low deep groundwater contributions to streams were observed at zhurucay traveling through mineral soil especially during low flow conditions correa et al 2017 transit times have been calculated in this ecosystem 188 days using lumped convolution integral models lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016b 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrometric data collection rainfall p streamflow q and actual evapotranspiration eta were measured at 5 min resolution during the period october 2017 february 2019 fig 2 a texas electronics tipping bucket rain gauge 0 1 mm resolution tr 525m dallas tx usa was installed at the meteorological station and two additional onset rain gauges 0 2 mm resolution rg3 m onset bourne usa elsewhere in the catchment fig 1 both gauges have a 1 accuracy and were used to calculate the average precipitation in the catchment using the thiessen polygon method we installed cs616 water content reflectometers campbell scientific logan usa next to the meteorological station at 10 cm soil depth to record soil water content swc the swc was recorded at a 5 min resolution and has a precision better than 0 1 with the calibration procedure explained in ochoa sánchez et al 2018 an inw aquistar ct2x kirkland wa usa pressure transducer sensor with 0 06 accuracy was installed in a combined rectangular v notch weir at the micro catchment outlet fig 1 and used to measure the stream water level which was transformed into discharge using a calibrated rating curve percentage absolute error 2 1 guallpa et al 2022 based on the kindsvater shen equation united states bureau of reclamation 2001 discharge was measured using the salt dilution technique 17 guallpa et al 2022 the calibration range 0 001 600 l s 1 was smaller than the observed discharge range 0 002 3093 l s 1 but the percentage of the time that the discharge was outside the calibration period was very small 0 9 actual evapotranspiration eta fig 2 was measured using the eddy covariance ec technique as explained in carrillo rojaset al 2019 3 2 tracer monitoring and water sampling two tracers were monitored during the period october 2017 february 2019 stable isotopes specifically deuterium δ2h and doc fig 2 rain water for isotopic analysis was accumulated in a custom made pressure based sequential rainfall sampler mcdonnell et al 1990 collecting one sample for every 2 08 mm of rain the setup of the device is described in detail in zhiña et al 2022 streamflow samples were taken using a campbell scientific automatic sampler pvs4100d logan ut usa every four hours isotope laboratory analysis were carried out with a cavity ring down spectrometer l2130 i picarro picarro inc usa the complete analysis procedure is explained in zhiña et al 2022 even though both stable isotopes oxygen 18 and deuterium δ2h were analyzed we used deuterium for illustration purposes high values range and refer to it as stable isotopes the rainfall and streamflow samples plotted close to the global meteoric water line fig 2 f suggesting little to no evaporative fractionation therefore both isotopes would yield identical results as tracers in modelling streamflow doc concentrations were estimated using an uv vis spectrometer spectrolyser s can messtechnik gmbh vienna austria following the

the same period and range as the present study percentage of the time outside the calibration period 0 3 3 tracer aided multi model conceptualizations we formulated six different model structures based on previous empirical understanding of páramo catchment hydrological behavior fig 3 the model structures ranged from a simple lumped to a more complex semi distributed structures and describe the role of the two dominant soil types or hydrologic response units for runoff fig 3 and table 2 for the model constitutive equations model m1 fig 3 1 represents the simplest lumped conceptualization of two vertically connected reservoirs representing the soil profile the shallow near surface reservoir generates relatively quick near surface flow qs and is connected vertically to the deeper reservoir representing subsurface flow the first shallow near surface reservoir provides a quick potentially preferential response to the stream q1 the shallow reservoir recharges the deeper mineral reservoir only if there is water available above field capacity the deeper reservoir provides baseflow q2 to the stream based on the linear reservoir assumption model m2 fig 3 1 is similar to model m1 but additionally includes a shallow fractured rock reservoir that is recharged and drained in the same way as the mineral reservoir described for model 1 q3 model m3 fig 3 3 is a semi distributed conceptualization of two parallel reservoirs which in this study represent the main soil types in the páramo ecosystem andosols on the hillslopes and histosols in the valley bottoms connected to the stream both reservoirs can provide a quick preferential response to the stream similar to the organic layers previously described the water drains from the andosol reservoir to the histosol q1 and then directly drains to the stream q2 the histosol reservoir generates quick near surface flow qs model m4 fig 3 4 is similar to model m3 but includes a shallow fractured rock reservoir that is recharged by both the histosol wetland and andosol hillslopes reservoirs only the histosol q2 and the shallow fractured rock q3 reservoirs generate streamflow model m5 fig 3 5 is a mix of models m1 and m3 here the andosol consists of an organic fast response reservoir and a slower responding deeper reservoir similar to the first structure however both hillslope reservoirs drain into the parallel histosol reservoir from which streamflow is generated q2 representing a potentially faster response due to higher connectivity model m6 fig 3 6 is similar to model m5 but additionally includes a fourth shallow fractured rock reservoir that is recharged by both the mineral reservoir of the andosol and the histosol reservoir the histosol quickly drains water to the stream q2 plus the slower and more constant deeper baseflow contribution to streamflow from the deep reservoir q3 the histosol reservoir generates quick near surface flow qs tracer mass balances for stable isotopes and doc transport were implemented in the rainfall runoff models for these simulations we used the dynamic storage volumes in the hydrological module to mix tracers in the reservoirs for the stable isotopes and to simulate the doc dynamics in the biogeochemical module table 2 for the stable isotope module we assumed a complete mixing of incoming rain with stored soil water isotopes the complete mixing assumption was based on previous studies in the same catchment that yielded the best results for the paramo system lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016b we also included calibrated passive storage volumes psup storage in the shallow soil water psdw storage in the deep soil water and psfr storage in shallow fractured rock in each reservoir creating additional volume for stable isotopes mixing and transport without affecting the dynamic storage in the hydrological module similar to birkel and soulsby 2016 we define the term passive storage as the immobile or non active water in the catchment pore water or water that is outside the hydro physical structure of the soil that has been observed through experimentation and available for tracer mixing but that does not hydrologically contribute to streamflow birkel et al 2011 the biogeochemical module used a production parameter kdoc biogeochemical module table 2 an energy activation parameter e a simple loss parameter l that consumes absorbs or mineralizes doc and a calibrated soil moisture parameter that represents a lower limit to doc production similar to birkel et al 2017 we did not use air soil temperature as a driver of doc because in tropical páramo ecosystems the temperature has a very low intra annual variability córdova et al 2016 furthermore pesántez et al 2018 identified soil moisture as the sole hydro meteorological doc control for natural páramo vegetation 3 4 model calibration and assessment all models were calibrated using three different targets i only water fluxes i e only calibrating q ii water flux and stable isotopes i e calibrating q stable isotopes and iii water flux and doc i e calibrating q doc for cases ii and iii tracer dynamics were simulated within the hydrological model and the hydrological and tracer modules were calibrated simultaneously we split the data set in two parts the first 75 was used for model calibration october 2017 october 2018 and the other 25 for model validation november 2018 february 2019 we applied a multi objective genetic algorithm nsga2 deb et al 2002 to simultaneously optimize the simulation of discharge q and either tracer stable isotopes and doc the two dimensional and equally weighted optimized objective functions were i the kling gupta efficiency kge of q and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of q ii the kge of q and the kge of stable isotopes and iii the kge of q and the kge of doc the kge accounts for correlation r bias α and variability β expected kge values range from to 1 nse has the same range with a value of 1 indicating a perfect fit gupta et al 2009 efficiencies above 0 45 were considered acceptable mosquera et al 2016b the nsga2 seeks to minimize the objective functions and we therefore used 1 kge and 1 nse for model calibration and evaluation i e values close to 0 indicate better model performance we used a total of 500 generations in each calibration run with 200 parameter set populations deb et al 2002 wang et al 2019 to sufficiently explore the parameter space 100 000 iterations for the different model configurations 4 to 18 calibrated parameters table 2 we then retained the final i e best 200 solutions for each model to visualize simulation ranges as a qualitative indicator of parameter uncertainty two dimensional pareto fronts were used to visualize the resulting approximations found by the nsga2 in terms of convergence spread and distribution of objective functions zitzler et al 2003 pareto fronts of each model and each calibration target were compared to assess model performance in addition the bayesian information criteria bic was used to select the most parsimonious model to represent the system penalizing the number of calibrated parameters gideon 1978 as follows 1 bic n l n sse n p l n n where ln is de natural log n is the number of observations p represents the number of calibrated parameters and sse is the sum of the residual error and the maximized likelihood function models with a lower bic are preferred 3 5 storage and transit time estimates catchment storage is composed of a dynamic component hydraulically connected to the stream table 2 the s reservoir variables calculated from the running water balance and an additional passive mixing volume that is available for tracer mixing but does not contribute to streamflow the dynamic storage component represents the water in each model reservoir above a certain threshold at which the reservoir starts contributing to the stream the passive storage volume is a calibrated parameter for each reservoir that is only available for mixing tracers stable isotopes birkel et al 2011 staudinger et al 2017 the sum of the dynamic and passive storage volume total storage was used to calculate transit times tt eq 2 based on the assumption that the catchment is a single unit that includes all the possible water flow pathways lazo et al 2019 mcmillan et al 2012 thus the tt can be calculated as a lumped but time variable catchment descriptor based on the catchment water balance lazo et al 2019 using the discharge as the output for stationary processes eq 2 and discharge plus eta as the outputs for non stationary processes eq 3 2 tt s t o r a g e q 3 tt s t o r a g e q et a 4 results 4 1 tracer based multi model simulation of páramo catchment dynamics the six model conceptualizations of catchment hydrological behavior fig 3 table 2 yielded acceptable simulation of streamflow dynamics with peak flows being well represented fig 4 only q nevertheless the models that did not include an additional shallow fractured rock reservoir models m1 m3 and m5 did not adequately reproduce hydrograph recessions and baseflow dynamics fig 4 m1 m3 m5 in addition models m5 and m6 that included slow and fast flow components on the hillslopes simulated the overall streamflow dynamics better than the simpler model configurations models m1 m2 m3 and m4 kge 0 9 boxplot panel in fig 4 further testing of the models for isotope and doc simulations fig 5 showed that the simpler models 1 4 failed to adequately capture the tracer dynamics only model m6 resulted in a good streamflow isotope simulations while models m5 and m6 adequately simulated doc most notably the peak concentrations of both tracers were well represented by these models direct comparison of simulated and observed tracer dynamics fig 5 showed that model m6 yielded the most accurate representation of stable isotopes and doc in streamflow these results confirmed the need to represent the páramo hydrological system by the dominant soil types andosols on the hillslopes and histosols at valley bottoms and with a shallow fractured bedrock reservoir that constantly contributes to total streamflow the latter was even more evident during low flow periods e g 11 2017 to 01 2018 and 10 2018 to 11 2018 and allowed an accurate simulation of the dynamics of discharge conservative and reactive tracers figs 4 and 5 4 2 comparing tracer based calibration targets fig 6 shows the comparison of model performance i e goodness of fit for the six evaluated model structures m1 m6 through the visualization of two dimensional pareto fronts fig 6 a b c and the distribution of model performance fig 5 d e f for the retained parameter sets after calibration using the three different calibration targets i e with and without tracers the pareto fronts show that the most complex model m6 outperformed the other five models for the only q and the q stable isotopes calibration targets for the q doc calibration target models 5 and 6 presented a similar discharge performance and outperformed the simpler models 1 4 but model 5 had a slightly better performance for doc kge improvement 0 05 this also had implications for the best parameter sets of the models 1 to 6 where the parameter sets for comparing the three calibration targets were more consistent for the complex models see appendix when penalizing the models for the number of calibrated parameters to account for potential overparameterization the bic values in terms of discharge simulation fig 7 a for the validation period were quite similar with better results for models m6 9 parameters bic 17641 and m5 6 parameters bic 17630 when introducing stable isotopes as tracer in the models models m2 9 parameters bic 17226 and m6 13 parameters bic 17059 led to the best results for discharge when introducing doc as tracer for model calibration models m5 13 parameters bic 17043 and m4 14 parameters bic 16863 led to the best results for tracer simulations model m6 13 parameters for q stable isotopes bic 791 was the best model fig 7a despite the highest number of parameters compared to the other models for the doc simulations models m5 15 parameters bic 514 and m6 19 parameters bic 1421 were the most parsimonious of all assessed models 4 3 water age storage fluxes and independent model evaluation we compared the dynamic storage that hydraulically contributes to streamflow using the median of the best retained parameter sets for each model and calibration target table 3 roughly the dynamic storage varied from 10 mm to 106 mm for all models and targets and was almost an order of magnitude smaller than the passive storage 450 mm to 1220 mm thus the dynamic storage represented between 1 and 13 of the total storage the highest dynamic storage of around 100 mm resulted from models m1 and m2 for all targets whereas the dynamic storages from models m3 to m6 were smaller than 50 mm model m6 had the most consistent dynamic storage with less than 10 mm difference between the three calibration targets the passive storage and mean transit times of the best results of all models were significantly different wilcoxon test p value 0 005 table 3 the largest passive storage 971 1216 mm and resulting mtts 649 813 days for stationary conditions and 316 396 days for non stationary conditions values were obtained for model m4 smaller passive storage 455 1014 mm and mtts 287 640 days for stationary conditions and 144 321 days for non stationary conditions values coincided for model m2 overall mtts were in the order of 9 months to 2 5 years for stationary conditions and in the order of 5 months to 13 months for non stationary conditions the separation of the simulated hydrograph into the sources contributing water to streamflow revealed the important contribution of deeper soil layers and shallow fractured rock during baseflow conditions only q 18 q stable isotopes 21 q doc 36 fig 8 these water sources help to maintain streamflow during rain free periods fig 8 models 1 2 4 6 this is most evident in models m3 and m5 which did not include a deep soil layer or shallow fractured rock water source and resulted in a poor representation of baseflow however wetter periods are consistently well simulated by all models for all calibration targets with water mainly originating from shallower and well connected water sources we independently evaluated all proposed models by comparing their simulated dynamic storage with the temporal dynamics of observed soil water content swc we rescaled the swc values measured in the shallow andosol horizon fig 9 from the actual range 0 1 cm3 cm 3 to the storage range of the models 50 to 100 mm for comparison purposes the dynamic storage of all models was high and significant correlated with soil water content the best linear regressions were found for the only discharge calibration target of model m2 r2 0 88 intercept 2 5 followed by model m6 r2 0 88 intercept 25 for the q stable isotopes calibration targets the best correlations were found for model m6 r2 0 9 intercept 8 and models m5 and m2 r2 0 84 intercept 3 06 and r2 0 84 intercept 5 02 respectively for the q doc target the best correlations were found for model m5 r2 0 85 intercept 11 and models m2 and m4 r2 0 85 intercept 13 and r2 0 85 intercept 17 4 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 best model representation of the páramo hydrological system different rainfall runoff model structures i e multi model framework resulted in a very similar overall discharge model performance figs 4 and 7 the very simple 4 parameter model e g model m1 was able to simulate streamflow almost equally well as the much more complex model m6 with 9 parameters however there can be severe limitations of rainfall runoff models in representing the water flow paths or catchment functioning even when discharge simulations are acceptable birkel and soulsby 2015 mcguire and mcdonnell 2015 if additional hydrological characteristics such as catchment storage transit time and hydrograph separation were considered the advantages of tracer aided hydrological models over only rainfall runoff models become clear cf christian birkel and soulsby 2015 mcguire and mcdonnell 2015 the independent model evaluation comparing dynamic storage and observed swc showed qualitatively similar dynamics fig 8 but the simulated storage was better represented with the most complex model model m6 for all calibration targets r squared 0 93 the model performance comparisons nse and kge showed that the more complex models had an advantage over simpler ones particularly when using tracers for model calibration fig 6 and fig 9 significant differences were observed among almost all groups of optimized kge values kruskal wallis rank sum test p value 0 001 however the greatest differences were found for the tracer aided model simulations fig 6 the tracer scatter plots fig 5 clearly indicated the improvement of the simulations as the more complex models approach the 1 1 line thus the more complex models models m4 m5 m6 that included flow through deep soil layers and shallow fractured rock in addition to quicker near surface runoff generation outperformed other models these findings support previous findings in this ecosystem that found that andosols on hillslopes drain water to the valley bottom histosols which in turn contribute the bulk of water to discharge correa et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016a in addition a shallow rock model reservoir was necessary to maintain baseflows during rain free periods similar to the results for nearby páramo catchments studied by ramónet al 2021 and buytaert and beven 2011 indeed the thin layer of fractured rock observed in geological studies itasca denver inc 2020 could play an important role in the hydrology of the páramo similar to the rock moisture hypothesis by rempe and dietrich 2018 the latter was observed in a different geological setting with a more seasonal climate in california usa and can be thought of as a more widespread global hydrological feature the fractured rock layer in our models generated 18 37 of streamflow and was particularly important for baseflows the contribution from this additional but disconnected reservoir can potentially contain waters 1 year old i e older than streamflow mtts estimated at catchment scales 6 9 months mosquera et al 2016b and causes non stationary tts similar to other fast responding systems in the tropics muñoz villers et al 2016 5 2 biogeochemical dynamics in the páramo hydrological system the hourly doc data series included peaks or mobilization events whose representation in most hydrological models remains a challenge blaurock et al 2021 ducharme et al 2021 werner et al 2019 unless the dynamics of not only carbon production but also those of deposition and consumption in the hydrological system are adequately represented by the model aitkenhead et al 2007 rosset et al 2020 in the páramo specifically doc production is more related to soil moisture conditions than to meteorological conditions pesántez et al 2018 in contrast to other more temperate ecosystems birkel et al 2017 the more complex models models m5 and m6 that react only to the amount of water stored in each reservoir were successful at simulating doc at high temporal resolution the simpler models did not reproduce most of the quick production events in the histosol reservoirs birkel et al 2020 pesántez et al 2018 wei et al 2021 resulting in a lower model performance fig 4 the latter supports evidence from previous observations in which wetting and rewetting events are directly related to high doc concentrations in peat ecosystems fenner and freeman 2011 tunaley et al 2017 lumped models or even the simple semi distributed histosol andosol models models m1 m4 could not accurately mimic doc dynamics in the stream due to the fact that the high production of carbon in the shallow soils needs to be accompanied by consumption deposition processes in the deeper soils which were not represented by the simplest models the latter was also visible from the pareto fronts in fig 6 even model 6 that resulted in acceptable discharge and doc simulations showed a trade off effects with slightly lower discharge performance at the expense of satisfying two calibration targets fowler et al 2018 in addition we believe that including dispersion and partial mixing processes into simple conceptual models can give additional insights into the functioning of catchment systems fenicia et al 2010 hrachowitz et al 2013 but crucially depends on future data availability for different soil water pools to help with model parameterization doc export rate estimates yielded by the six models were similar to those measured previously in the study catchment 48 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 arízaga idrovo et al 2022 from all the models export rates obtained from model m6 calibrated on the discharge and doc targets represented the observations best model m1 62 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m2 61 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m3 64 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m4 59 1 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m5 58 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 model m6 45 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 the representation of lateral flow rewetting processes and riparian areas as doc production hotspots strongly influenced the carbon export from the catchment highlighting possible consequences of climate and land use change on water quantity quality of the páramo ecosystem pesántez et al 2018 such results could only have been produced by direct comparison of different model structures and a temporally high resolution data set fig 4 and fig 8 in this sense our proposed more complex models resolved limitations of previous studies in approximating flow and tracer dynamics particularly at low flows in the páramo cabrera balarezo et al 2022 gil and tobón 2016 vázquez 2010 5 3 multi model catchment storage and tt simulations modelled dynamic storage was similar to that estimated from hydrological data in the study catchment lazo et al 2019 particularly for model m6 important differences emerged when comparing the results derived for total storage including passive storage mixing volumes for model m6 855 1193 mm and those calculated from streamflow mean transit time estimates 445 mm in the same catchment based on the catchment water balance lazo et al 2019 our results can be compared to lazoet al 2019 specifically to their calculated soil horizon passive storages 854 mm a possible explanation for storage differences is that some flow paths are not hydrologically active when calculating tts and storage birkel et al 2011 kirchner 2009 however our results are comparable to others for peat dominated catchments amvrosiadi et al 2017 van huijgevoort et al 2016 the latter studies accounted for all the water available for mixing and not only the shallow hydrologically active flow paths cf mcguire and mcdonnell 2015 soulsby et al 2009 it seems that in comparison to tracer aided hydrological model estimates calculations based on soil properties of the hydrologically active layers lead to an underestimation of total storage bishop et al 2011 guangxuan et al 2021 furthermore different methods to estimate storage can yield different transit times staudinger et al 2017 most common rainfall runoff models only consider the hydraulically active soil and groundwater contributions to streamflow related to the higher storage estimates our calculated transit times calculated assuming stationary conditions 542 to 757 days using the most parsimonious model model m6 were longer than those previously reported for the same catchment using lumped convolution integral models 188 days lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016b this difference is likely related to the fact that the tracer aided hydrological models consider the system as a whole including potential non stationary changes in water storage associated to flow paths under different catchment wetness conditions cain et al 2019 heidbüchel et al 2012 staudinger et al 2017 transit times calculated under non stationary conditions already found in this catchment by larcoet al 2023 were much closer to those found previously using lumped convolution integral models larco et al 2023 mosquera et al 2016b in addition we identified an additional reservoir shallow fractured rock which generates a significant volume of water 18 37 to the stream during baseflow conditions increasing transit times and related passive storage our results improve the understanding of páramo catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry while highlighting the benefit of including tracers into conceptual rainfall runoff models to enhance hydrobiogeochemical process knowledge kirchner 2006 the results indicate that due to the compact geology and low precipitation volumes distributed throughout the year small changes in climate or land use directly affect the soil water dynamics with likely significant affect the páramo ecohydrology e g export of carbon and other associated solutes therefore future work should focus on a spatial analysis of doc generation hotspots in the catchment assessing doc source contributions to streamflow carbon export 6 conclusions and outlook this study presents for the first time a complete suite of rainfall runoff models of different complexity to conceptualize the hydrological behavior of an experimental páramo catchment in the tropical andean highlands of southern ecuador the incorporation of conservative stable isotopes and reactive doc tracers into these models helped to assess the hydrological and biogeochemical catchment functioning of the páramo models of higher complexity outperformed the simpler ones when introducing tracers for calibration our simulations identified the importance of flow through deep soil layers and shallow fractured rock to sustain streamflow generation during drier periods baseflow this finding was only possible by including a conservative tracer module in the rainfall runoff model structures tracer based simulations clearly showed a mix of fast and slow flows generated from the shallow and deeper soil layers of histosols and andosols in combination with water from a shallow fractured rock layer on top of the compact bedrock these results were consistent for both tracer calibration targets discharge stable isotopes and discharge doc but for slightly different reasons the biogeochemical module simulated doc dynamics at high temporal resolution based only on the modeled soil water content without the need of including temperature as a predictor for doc production but the estimated doc mass flux depends on the accurate simulation of the combination of flow paths as identified with stable isotopes based on our findings we conclude that tracer selection depends on the specific objectives and study purpose as each have advantages and limitations in field experimental design and analytical cost to bridge the gap from hydrological to biogeochemical catchment functioning incorporation of both tracers into models is crucially needed credit authorship contribution statement juan pesántez

2141,the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is a hotspot in the study of global climate change due to its profound impact on the atmospheric water cycle in asia and even the world previous studies on the qtp mainly focused on the spatial distribution of precipitation and its changing trend to investigate the temporal and spatial variations of precipitation variability on the qtp this study applied the standardized variability index svi based on entropy on its daily precipitation without any preset distribution the results showed that for most monsoon months in the past 40 years svi has a significant downward trend in the southwest foot of the himalayas and the border zone between barren and grassland areas indicating that precipitation has become more uniform which is beneficial for growth of grassland however the hurst exponent shows that such trend will reverse in the future which may cause natural disasters such as landslides and debris flows in the monsoon period considering the large amount of precipitation and the local topographic conditions in the southwest of the himalayan foothills the inducements of such precipitation variability were also studied including asian monsoon westerly jets sea land thermal difference and sea surface temperature sst compared with the monsoon index the sea land thermal difference has a stronger correlation with the precipitation variability the sst anomaly closer to the east coast of the equatorial pacific also has a great impact on the variability of precipitation over the plateau this study contributes to understanding precipitation variability in the qtp at a sub seasonal period keywords entropy standardized variability index svi qinghai tibet plateau seasonal monthly precipitation variability influencing factors on precipitation variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent decades global warming has strengthened the water cycle between land and ocean thus affecting the process of water cycle voigt and shaw 2015 human activities further promote the change of precipitation and runoff resulting in the change of spatial and temporal distribution of various forms of water resources zhang et al 2016 due to the climatic shift to a warmer temperature rapid industrialization and urbanization and intense agricultural practices the intensity frequency and extent of the hydroclimatic extremes i e droughts and floods are expected to increase in the near future with relatively severe consequences abhishek et al 2021 xiong et al 2022 known as the water tower of asia the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is characterized as a fragile and sensitive environment pithan 2010 with some researchers suggesting that global climate change originates from the qtp zhang et al 2017 the hydrologic and energy cycles in cold regions are sensitive to climate change and important in regulating water resources especially in high mountains hu et al 2022 precipitation is a key part of the global atmospheric and hydrological cycle and is also an important factor affecting the allocation of water resources li et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 subtle changes in precipitation significantly impacts the ecosystem energy cycle agricultural production and food security jiang et al 2022 shen et al 2011 furthermore because of climate change and human activities the temperature in the qtp has increased significantly in recent years which further affects its water cycle wu et al 2010 research shows that moderate rain intensity increased and contributes significantly to total rain change in recent decades over the qtp ayantobo et al 2022 the existing studies on precipitation on the qtp focus on the precipitation amount monthly seasonal and annual precipitation amount provide valuable information regarding the temporal distributions and variations in precipitation but they cannot reflect its frequency the number of rainy days or gaps in precipitation series vyshkvarkova et al 2018 the precipitation variability needs to be studied because it determines the availability of water resources and the occurrence of extreme precipitation events gu et al 2020 furthermore alterations in the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation leads to frequent flood and drought and loss of biodiversity and also disturbs the river ecosystem mathew et al 2021 quantifying precipitation variability is considerably challenging because of the complex nature of climatic variables that influence precipitation dynamics and their spatiotemporal variability and nonlinear interactions jin and wang 2017 several methods such as shannon entropy mishra et al 2009 principal component analysis yuan et al 2016 and harmonic analysis pohl et al 2015 have been applied to study precipitation variability compared with other methods shannon entropy does not make any assumptions about the probability distribution or statistical properties of the data thus it can be applied to any type of distribution regardless of whether it is known or unknown or if the underlying system is dynamic pechlivanidis et al 2016 kawachi et al 2001 proposed shannon entropy as precipitation entropy to assess the temporal precipitation apportionment later maruyama et al 2005 modified the precipitation entropy into apportionment entropy ae and intensity entropy ie to quantify the intra year variability of precipitation and precipitation days furthermore mishra et al 2009 applied for the first time the above information measures to the decadal dae inter year me and intra year ae ie time series to investigate the variability i e evenness of annual precipitation on the daily monthly seasonal scale and the interannual variability of monthly seasonal scale to compare the precipitation entropy at different time scales guntu et al 2020 defined the standardized variability index svi within the range of 0 1 however the application of entropy on the analysis of precipitation variability mainly concerns the intra year or inter year distribution of precipitation compared with long term statistical results the fine temporal structure of precipitation at a daily resolution is vitally significant because of its strong correlation with many natural disasters such as desertification floods and debris flows royé and martin vide 2017 besides the climate of the qtp is affected by monsoon and westerly jet which atmospheric circulations have obvious seasonality the study on the variability of daily precipitation within a month season helps to understand the precipitation structure in the plateau as for the causes of the precipitation changes research on the inter year variability of summer rainfall in the qtp suggests that its mechanisms include the summer north atlantic oscillation nao wang et al 2018b eurasian snow cover xu and lu 1992 sea surface temperature sst of the atlantic ocean gao et al 2013 el niño southern oscillation enso yeh et al 2018 indian ocean chen and you 2017 convection over the western maritime continent jiang et al 2016 and variability of the indian summer monsoon ism jiang and ting 2017 studies on the factors that influence winter precipitation in the qtp cuo et al 2013 revealed that changes in the north atlantic oscillation nao and east asian westerly jet can influence the region s winter precipitation tang et al 2005 proposed that winter snowstorms are associated with the summer geothermal vortex over the qtp plateau topography plays a role in the formation of a snowfall centre sun et al 2010a b nevertheless these studies are mainly focused on the relationship between precipitation and large scale circulation in the qtp and does not consider precipitation variability in this study the svi was used to determine the spatial distribution of seasonal monthly precipitation variability on a daily scale the changing trend of which in the past 40 years and its future persistence were also discussed the results showed that the average svi value in winter was significantly higher than that in summer indicating that the winter precipitation variability contributed the most for all the seasons the precipitation variability along the southwestern edge of the himalayas and the border between the grassland and bare land areas decreased in the past 40 years but the hurst exponent indicated that such trend would reverse in the future i e the uniform precipitation tends to be distributed unevenly resulting the risks of extremes the correlation analysis shows that among the considered factors the sea land thermal difference between the indian ocean and the tibetan plateau has the greatest influence on the precipitation variability in the qtp the southward shift and the intensification of westerly jet will lead to the increase of monthly precipitation variability in the plateau besides in the monsoon months the effects of the south and the east asian monsoon on the precipitation variability are consistent in spatial distribution but the areas of significant influence are complementary 2 data and methods 2 1 data precipitation data is from the national oceanic

2022 domeisen et al 2022 ferreira and reboita 2022 including the studies on the qtp lin et al 2022 li et al 2021a research shows that in almost all regions the quality of the cpc dataset is better than other fusion data sets which may be due to the poor simulation performance of numeric models in complex terrain lin et al 2022 since the release of the real time operated cpc product it has been

apportionment entropy ae entropy is a measure of dispersion uncertainty disorder and diversification a discrete form of entropy e x is shown in eq 1 shannon 1948 1 e x k 1 k p x k log 2 p x k where e x represents the average information of a random variable x and log2 p xk represents the information content surprise about the value xk occurring with probability p xk the value of e x varies from zero to log2 k that is from absolute certainty to maximum uncertainty or complete information to no information about the state of the system apportionment entropy ae is the application of information entropy in hydrology which is used to measure the uniformity of precipitation distribution at a certain time scale mishra et al 2009 for a certain summer in the qtp june july and august assuming daily precipitation sequence is ri i 1 2 3 92 and the total amount is a the precipitation on the i th day is pi ri a and the ae of this summer is shown in eq 2 2 ae k 1 92 r i a log 2 r i a where k is the total number of days the minimum ae indicates that the total precipitation is evenly distributed on each day and the maximum indicates that the total precipitation is concentrated on a certain day 2 3 precipitation variability as represented by standardized variability index svi the maximum entropy is dependent on the timescale of evaluation in order to compare the variability of time series with different data lengths and different timescales the svi defined in eq 3 is applied in this study 3 svi ae max a e ae max where ae max is the maximum of the apportionment entropy and svi 0 1 2 4

assumption on the data distribution and it is not affected by individual outliers di giuseppe et al 2019 ramachandra et al 2011 considering the autocorrelation of time series the modified mk mmk test proposed by yue et al 2002 is applied in this study and the significance level is 0 05 unless otherwise specified 2 5 persistence effect of precipitation variability the hurst s rescaled range r s analysis proposed by hurst 1951 is used to detect the persistence effect of the changing trend of the precipitation variability and quantify it with hurst exponent h as a non parametric analysis method hurst test based on r s analysis has been widely used in the fields of hydrology climatology economics geology and geochemistry due to of its robustness jiang et al 2015 tatli 2015 sánche et al 2008 specifically the hurst exponent h 0 1 if h 0 5 the time series can be described by a random walk known as brownian motion the closer h is to zero the stronger the anti persistence effect that is the future changing trend is opposite to the previous changing trend whereas the closer h is to one the future changing trend is the same as the previous changing trend shi et al 2015 2 6 framework of the proposed methodology fig 1 shows the overall methodological framework used to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of the seasonal and monthly svi in the qtp and its influencing factors 3 study area known as the third pole the qtp is the largest plateau in china with an average altitude of more than 4000 m and a total area of approximately 2 5 million km2 pithan 2010 it is the birthplace of many large rivers brahmaputra river salween river mekong river yangtze river and indus river the climate is warm and humid in the southeast region and cold and dry in the northwest region owing to the influence of the westerly circulation and the topography of the plateau the study area is a rectangular area between 25 5 40 n and 68 105 e that includes the qtp fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation of the qtp and its surrounding areas regions with high precipitation are concentrated on the southern edge of the qtp and experiences a maximum of more than 2500 mm precipitation over the northern plateau is low with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm the annual precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest precipitation occurs mainly during the monsoon period from june to september jjas and precipitation within this period contributes to more than 70 of the total annual precipitation as shown in fig 2b 4 precipitation variability in the qtp 4 1 variability of precipitation at different time scales fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the svi in different seasons and their constituent months during spring march to may mam higher monthly svi values were observed in the northern central and southwestern regions of the plateau whereas lower svi values were observed in a small part of the southeast and northwest regions of the plateau svi variability in the indian monsoon period was relatively low and the low value area of the svi in the southeast region expanded towards the west the pamir plateau in the northwest showed high svi values compared to the other seasons the uncertainty related to summer precipitation was low the precipitation variability of the summer monsoon period was the lowest which benefits the agricultural field because a large part of agricultural productivity comes from monsoon precipitation guntu et al 2020 gu et al 2020 studied the temporal and spatial of precipitation variability in the source area of the yellow river based on shannon entropy and pointed out that the arrival of summer monsoon was advanced which makes may the beginning of wet season and four quantitative evidences are given such phenomenon was also observed in fig 3 in may a continuous low svi area appeared on the southern edge of qtp from october the svi low value area in the southwest decreased to the southeast the svi of the pamir plateau in the northwest decreased and the svi low value area in the southeast disappeared in december the entire plateau is controlled by westerly winds during the winter yao et al 2013 because of topographical obstructions in the west and south of the qtp airflow from the indian ocean cannot enter the hinterland of the plateau and instead moves eastward along the southern foot of the himalayas and northward along the hengduan mountains in the east snowfall occurs in the kara mountains while in the western part of the pamir plateau its higher latitude and colder air causes snowfall to form more easily sun et al 2010a b the high precipitation area corresponds to the low svi value area during the winter the statistical results are listed in table a2 the variability of intra seasonal precipitation in summer was the lowest whereas that in winter was the highest the uniform precipitation in summer is related to the interaction of the westerly and indian ocean monsoons as well as water vapour transport and other factors maussion et al 2014 in general the seasonal svi is lower than that of the constituent months as in table a2 which was verified by mishra et al 2009 guntu et al 2020 also stated that the variability dampens when moving from finer to coarser time scales all svis are negatively correlated with altitude indicating that monsoon may barely disturb the water income in this region due to the altitude as shown in table a4 gu et al 2020 also stated that the water transformed from a solid state was more likely to be the main source of the local cycle 4 2 changing trend of svi in this section the change trend of seasonal svi and monthly svi is given the spatial distribution of different seasonal grids is shown in fig 4 the positive trend represents the increase in precipitation variability over the years which indicates that precipitation is only concentrated within a specific period otherwise the reverse in the northwest and southeast of the qtp there was a significant increase in the seasonal svi for all four seasons indicating that the precipitation distribution tends to be more uncertain in the northwest pamir plateau precipitation is mainly snowfall in winter and under climate warming uneven precipitation may lead to further melting and degradation of glaciers the southeast of the plateau is the origin of several large rivers this region has many mountains and experiences abundant precipitation uneven precipitation in this region further increases the risk of natural disasters such as debris flows such conclusion is verified by lu et al 2021 s study which used the precipitation concentration index and its complementary parameter combination to determine that the high incidence area of debris flow in the qtp is in the southeast of the plateau in addition the results showed spatial heterogeneity for different seasons for example in the southern grassland the svi showed a downward trend in summer and an upward trend in winter table a3 shows the number of grids with significant increases and decreases in the svi for each season and month in the study area the results show that 1 in winter the number of grids with a significant svi increase is significantly larger compared with a svi decrease while the results are opposite for other seasons and months except march and 2 in summer the grids with significant svi trend change is much higher than for other seasons specifically in summer the grids with an increasing svi trend are concentrated in the east and the grids with a decreasing trend are concentrated in the middle and west fig a1 shows that in winter only a few grids in the north have a decreasing trend while other regions show an increasing trend seasonal variation in the svi on the plateau indicates a change in large scale circulation in summer the northern part of the plateau is mainly controlled by the westerlies whereas the south is controlled by the indian monsoon in winter the entire qtp is essentially controlled by the westerlies yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 reported that the indian monsoon has exhibited a weakening trend since the 1980s resulting in decreased precipitation over the southern qtp dong et al 2016 the weakening trend of the plateau indian monsoon is closely related to the decrease of seasonal monthly svi in the southeast of the plateau in summer the region mainly affected by the monsoon the results in section 5 3 also show that the weaker the indian monsoon the stronger the variability of the plateau summer precipitation indicating that the weaker summer monsoon often causes unstable water vapor transport and precipitation supply and results in increased precipitation variability in contrast the strengthening of the prevailing mid latitude westerlies yao et al 2012 has increased moisture transport into the northern and western qtp mölg et al 2014 the strengthening of westerly jet is closely related to the strengthening of svi in almost the entire study area especially in the northwest in winter the results in section 5 2 show that the stronger the westerly jet is the stronger the variability of winter precipitation over the plateau will be indicating that strong westerly jet could cause unstable water vapor transport and precipitation supply at the junction of barren or sparsely vegetated and grassland areas seasonal svi showed a significant downward trend which was particularly evident in spring summer and autumn areas marked with red rectangles in fig 4b this zone is particularly critical under the condition of relatively uniform and abundant precipitation barren or sparsely vegetated areas are likely to become grasslands in contrast when the variability of precipitation is relatively large grasslands may be transformed into barren or sparse vegetation the significant decreasing trend in the seasonal svi is positive maintaining the current grassland area and even expanding its area is favourable this point also exists in the changing trend of the monthly svi especially from may to october the changing trend of the svi in winter was also distinct in barren or sparsely vegetated areas the svi showed a significant downward trend whereas in adjacent grassland areas the svi showed a significant upward trend this means that in winter there was a decrease in precipitation variability in barren or sparsely vegetated areas whereas grassland areas showed increasing uneven seasonal precipitation in the future some changes may occur in the coverage of these vegetation types because their coverage tends to be uniform or opposite however this trend has only been observed for winter during the other seasons the svi for grasslands still showed a decreasing trend however for all seasons the seasonal svi of barren or sparsely vegetated areas showed a decreasing trend which may be due to the melting of glaciers and the change in the local water vapour cycle under global warming conditions plant phenology is one of the most sensitive indicators of ecosystem response to climate change in the past decade studies on changes in plant phenology and their response to climate change in the qtp have become a popular international frontier sun et al 2020b found that the phenological changes in plants in the qtp during spring were not significant the phenology in autumn was significantly delayed and the length of the growing season was significantly prolonged summer and autumn are the main growing seasons of crops in the plateau in cultivated lands in the southwest of the qtp the svi shows a downward trend in summer and its constituent months fig a1 which is favourable for crop growth in autumn the svi in some cultivated areas show an increasing trend which is detrimental to the growth of water intensive crops therefore it is critical that efforts are made to construct water storage facilities to store excess precipitation in summer for the irrigation of water intensive crops during autumn 4 3 persistence of svi changing trend hurst indices were used to investigate if the areas bordering grasslands and barren or sparse vegetation will continue to experience a decreasing svi trend the results are shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that sporadic areas maintain the changing trend of precipitation variability including those with an increasing trend indicated by red and those with decreasing trend indicated by orange the area without black dots indicates that the change of svi trend is not significant it is worth noting that for all seasons the precipitation variability tended to increase from a decrease along the southwestern edge of the himalayas and the border between grassland and barren land that is the original uniform precipitation trend changed to uneven precipitation which may result in more extreme precipitation this trend is detrimental to either the western himalayas or the grassland barren land junction uneven precipitation may lead to natural disasters in the southwestern foothills of the himalayas such as mudslides and low precipitation in grassland areas is unfavourable for grassland restoration li et al 2022 studied the influence of precipitation structures on vegetation growth in the qtp and illustrated that both precipitation and the precipitation svi affect vegetation as precipitation in low vegetation areas had higher seasonal and monthly variability water allocation should be reconsidered 5 influencing factors on the precipitation variability in the qtp 5 1 thermal difference between qtp and the indian ocean the thermal difference between the qtp and tropical indian ocean in the middle and upper troposphere is closely related to the onset of the indian summer monsoon and its interannual and interdecadal changes the temperature over the qtp and the tropical eastern indian ocean is the two regions most sensitive to changes during the indian summer monsoon dai et al 2013 based on this the thermal contrast index tci is defined as the standardization of the temperature difference between the tibetan plateau and the tropical eastern indian ocean in the 500 200 hpa temperature field as shown in the dataset constructed by li et al 2019 the tci between the qtp and the indian ocean reflects the thermal difference between the plateau and northern indian ocean and its relationship with the later indian summer monsoon variability the tci has a better indication effect on the indian summer monsoon than the thermal conditions of the qtp or the indian ocean alone when the index is large the intensity of the indian summer monsoon in the later stages is often stronger li et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 a there is a significant negative correlation between the monthly svi and tci time series r 0 763 p 0 01 which reveals the impacts of thermal differences between the qtp and the indian ocean on precipitation variability the greater the thermal difference between the sea and land the smaller the variability of precipitation in the month the larger the thermal difference the stronger the monsoon monsoons provide relatively stable water vapour from the ocean thus bringing more stable precipitation that is lower precipitation variability in general svi and tci in the plateau and surrounding areas showed a strong negative correlation whereas in the pamir plateau in the northwest of the plateau svi and tci showed a strong positive correlation in fig 6b which means that when the summer monsoon is strong precipitation variability is high studies have shown that the change in the location of the westerlies is related to the strength of the summer monsoon over the plateau fang et al 2016 5 2 westerly the subtropical westerly jet stream over the northern hemisphere is a planetary scale atmospheric circulation system in the upper troposphere and its anomalies have important influence on the middle and lower atmospheric circulations lin and lu 2005 many studies have shown that the jet stream has a significant influence on the climate of asia especially for precipitation sampe and xie 2010 to quantitatively analyse the relationship between westerly jet and precipitation variability two jet indices were defined according to sun et al 2020a the position index of the jet is defined as the average latitude of the maximum westerly wind at 200 hpa at each longitude over the domain of 30 50 n and 80 120 n sun et al 2020a and the strength index of the jet is defined as the mean of the maximum westerly wind speed at 200 hpa at each longitude over the same domain fig 7 shows the calculation of the westerly jet indices and their relationship with precipitation variability the westerly jet was weaker and northerly from april to october as shown in fig 7a and 7c the results showed a strong negative correlation between the precipitation svi and the location of the westerly jet meaning the more northerly the centre of the westerly jet the higher the variability of monthly precipitation studies over the past 40 years have shown that global warming has caused westerly winds in the southern hemisphere to move towards the south pole and increase in intensity and this trend is also reflected in the northern hemisphere toward the north pole yang et al 2020a when the jet stream moves northward the daily precipitation variability within a month in the pamirs increases whereas it decreases in other regions as shown in fig 7b the precipitation svi has a strong positive correlation with the intensity of the westerly jet as shown in fig 7c meaning the greater the intensity of the westerly jet the more uneven the precipitation within that month this influence is distinct from that of the monsoons in terms of interannual variability precipitation over the qtp is negatively correlated with moisture transported by the westerlies and positively correlated with the indian summer monsoon and water vapour from nearby regions chen et al 2019 5 3 asian monsoon 5 3 1 south asian summer monsoon sasm the sasm index sasmi is defined as the area averaged seasonal jjas dynamical normalized seasonality dns at 850 hpa within the south asian domain 5 22 5 n 35 97 5 e li and zeng 2002 as shown in fig 8 the precipitation svi and sasmi in the pamirs and the eastern plateau showed a weak negative correlation whereas in most other regions they had a strong negative correlation recent studies have found that precipitation in may has been increasing over the southeast and central areas of the qtp thereby accelerating lake expansion wetting and greening of the qtp in recent decades chen and you 2017 furthermore the increasing precipitation trend in may for these two regions are mainly attributed to the early onset of the sasm which is connected to the thermodynamic and dynamic adjustments caused by the sst anomaly of the indian ocean xing et al 2016 the cyclones and anticyclones accompanying the anomalous activities of the sasm results in the convergence and divergence of water vapour together with the strong vertical motion and topographic effects this is conducive for the convergence and divergence of water vapour in the southeast and southwest of the plateau zhu et al 2020 sun et al 2019 reports that in the western qtp when the sasm is strong the anomalous upward movement intensifies the water vapour flux anomalously converges and the precipitation anomaly is greater while the opposite is true in the east in weak monsoon years an abnormally convergent area of water vapour fluxes appeared in the east as indicated by the blue area in fig 8a 5 3 2 east asian monsoon easm the eastern part of the qtp is particularly affected by the easm cherchi et al 2011 because of its high terrain during summer air in the qtp heats rapidly causing rising airflow and decreasing air pressure which accelerates the formation of low pressure on land and increases the force of the summer monsoon blowing from the ocean to land and even affecting the eastern and southern parts of the qtp interestingly the spatial pattern of the easm and the impact of the sasm on the precipitation svi are consistent as shown in fig 8b however this is opposite for the significance of the positive and negative correlations specifically the easm shows a strong positive correlation with the pamir plateau and the eastern plateau and thus has a greater impact on the yangtze river basin yellow river basin lancang river basin and salween river basin in general the easm and sasm have a coincident effect on the precipitation svi but the strong effect area is complementary furthermore increasing evidence suggests that the intensity of the easm is inversely correlated to the ism maher and hu 2006 5 4 sea surface temperature sst the indian meteorological department has observed and recorded monsoon patterns for several decades and has developed multiple stochastic models to forecast the initiation recession and strength of the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr of the many different factors affecting ismr the el niño southern oscillation enso is considered a significant large scale force that influences the behaviour of ismr ju and slingo 1995 during the development of an el niño summer the ctp central qtp dry anomaly tends to bridge the dry anomalies over india and northern china thereby forming a dry zone along the north western edge of the asian monsoon domain which implies that the northern edge of the asian monsoon domain tends to retreat equatorward expanding poleward during el niño la niña lei et al 2019 the numbers of the niño 1 2 3 and 4 regions correspond to the labels assigned to ship tracks that have crossed these regions data from these tracks enabled the historic records of el niño to be dated back to 1949 as discussed in a classic study by rasmusson and carpenter 1982 from the east to the west coast along the equatorial pacific it successively passes through the niño 1 2 niño 3 niño 3 4 and niño 4 subregions the impact of different niño subregions on precipitation variability in the qtp is spatially different fig 9 the closer the niño subregion is to the east coast of the equatorial pacific the greater the impact of the niño subregion on the variability of monthly precipitation in the plateau the abnormally high sst in the tropical eastern pacific niño 1 2 may be the cause of more uniform monthly precipitation in the pamirs plateau in the northwest of the qtp and simultaneously produce uneven precipitation in the central and eastern parts of the plateau which is similar to the effect of the strength of the westerly jet chen 1977 illustrated that for the southwest monsoon region of india the equatorial warm water period in the eastern pacific ocean is an anticyclonic anomalous current the southwest monsoon in india is weak or interrupted while the equatorial cold water period in the eastern pacific ocean is a cyclonic anomalous current and the southwest monsoon in india is strong which is conducive for precipitation the abnormally high sst in the central and western tropical pacific niño 4 leads to an opposite distribution of precipitation variability on the plateau compared with niño 1 2 the abnormally high sst in the niño 3 area makes the monthly precipitation distribution in the pamirs plateau and the upper reaches of the southeast outflow river basin more uniform the niño 3 4 area is negatively correlated with the svi in most areas which means that the abnormally high sst in this area makes the monthly precipitation distribution of the entire qtp more uniform ayesha et al 2021 also pointed out that the abnormal temperature increase in the tropical central and western pacific will lead to the formation of high pressure and easterly wind anomalies in the subtropical western pacific which will enhance the convergence and increase the precipitation in south asia 5 5 other climate factors to understand the possible teleconnection of the precipitation index with large scale circulations we correlated the svi with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo southern oscillation index soi pacific decadal oscillation pdo north pacific index npi and north atlantic oscillation nao as shown in fig 10 in which the npi had a higher correlation with the precipitation svi the npi is the area weighted sea level pressure over the region 30 n 65 n 160 e 140 w the npi measures interannual to decadal variations in atmospheric circulation trenberth and hurrell 1994 the main mode of the north pacific winter atmospheric circulation is the intensity change of the aleutian low pressure al npi is a sensitive index for this mode interestingly the npi index in the northern pacific ocean is inversely synchronized with the sst change in the tropical indian ocean on the interdecadal scale qian 2009 the correlation between soi pdo nao and svi was weak indicating that the three indexes contribute little to the variability of monthly precipitation over the plateau see fig 10 since the 1990s the amo has shifted to a warm phase and is closely related to more extreme precipitation events in non monsoon and monsoon regions ding et al 2019 moreover the amo has a greater influence on extreme precipitation than the enso and the asian monsoon index in non monsoon regions of china ding et al 2019 a survey of central asia conducted by yang et al 2020b shows that both the precipitation frequency entropy and precipitation entropy have a positive and significant correlation with the amo which was verified for the qtp in this study the warm phase of the amo provides more moisture flux and consequently enhanced precipitation piao et al 2005 moreover model simulations derived from the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl am2 1 provide direct evidence to demonstrate that the amo phase transition contributes to the unstable relationship between the summer nao and precipitation dipole pattern in the eastern qtp liu et al 2021 6 discussion 6 1 impact of human activities on precipitation variability human induced global warming is widely recognized wmo 2021 ipcc 2022 for instance anthropogenic aerosols have been detected in large scale changes in the water cycle since the mid 20th century ipcc 2022 continually increasing human activities are altering the global and regional terrestrial water balance directly e g water abstraction and infrastructure development and indirectly e g deforestation and increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases alter hydroclimate abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 abhishek et al 2021 observations and simulations have shown that land use can drive precipitation locally or remotely by changing surface energy balance water vapor advection and recirculation processes sea land thermal contrast and associated circulation modes alter et al 2015 wey et al 2015 large scale deforestation could result in reduced evaporation and precipitation devaraju et al 2015 urbanization increases local precipitation with medium reliability and runoff intensity with high reliability ipcc 2021 irrigation water also plays a regulating role in regional water cycle qin et al 2011 glacial meltwater may also contribute significantly to the water balance on the qtp zhang et al 2017 most glaciers on the qtp have experienced retreat of their termini and negative mass balance anomalies in the past two decades azam et al 2018 which is partly due to black carbon emissions south asia is recognized as a region with particularly acute air pollution when compared with the rest of the world ramanathan et al 2005 long range transport of black carbon from south asia to the qtp and its deposition on glaciers directly enhances glacier melt meanwhile south asian black carbon also has an indirect effect on the plateau s glaciers shrinkage by acting to reduce the water supply over the southern qtp yang et al 2022 since the beginning of the 21st century south asian black carbon emissions have been pivotal in altering summer precipitation over the southern qtp such emissions have reduced long range moisture advection and subsequent precipitation regimes to and within the southern qtp yang et al 2022 besides the weakening of the south asian monsoon illustrated in section 4 2 there is an additional explanation on the increase of precipitation variability in the southeast of the qtp i e the black carbon emissions led to the decrease of the water vapor transported from the indian ocean to the qtp as many large rivers originates from the qtp there have been a number of water storage projects in recent years especially in the indo gangetic plain many dams and floodgates have been built to control floods and mitigate droughts li et al 2022 however the lack of access to dam and gate regulation data makes it difficult to quantitatively analyze their impact on precipitation variability 6 2 comparison with other previous studies the collective average of the seven most advanced grid precipitation products shows that the annual precipitation of qtp from 1980 to 2018 increased slightly yao et al 2022 such statistically insignificant change in precipitation results from the average of spatially heterogeneous changes i e the precipitation in the north has increased significantly sun et al 2020a while that in the south has decreased significantly wang et al 2018a since 1979 the high resolution simulation using wrf model and gldas shows that the precipitation of inner qtp has increased significantly zhang et al 2017 this study shows that in the past 40 years the precipitation variability on the inner qtp has significantly decreased in almost all seasons and months especially in summer which may be resulted from the more frequent precipitation the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar6 states that annual precipitation in northern hemisphere mountains is expected to increase by 5 to 20 in the future while the regional and seasonal variation of extreme precipitation is quite different and the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall over the qtp will increase this study verifies that there will be an increasing trend of precipitation variability in the vicinity of the himalayas especially during the monsoon period which is often accompanied by an increase in extreme precipitation events 6 3 uncertainty analysis there inevitably exist outliers when analyzing time series in this study mmk test was used to analyze the changing trend of svi sequence and hurst test was used to evaluate the persistence of svi such trend both models are non parametric analysis methods which have certain robustness and can avoid the interference of a few outliers di giuseppe et al 2019 tatli 2015 sánche et al 2008 before using these two methods the pauta criterion also known as 3σ criterion was carried out for outlier detection on svi sequence and the results showed that only a few grids had 1 or 2 outliers as shown in fig a2 and table a5 these outliers are replaced with the mean value of the sequence uncertainty also exists when using hurst test which is related to data length although the main advantages of statistical models are their limited reliance on field calibration data zhao et al 2015 studies show that the longer the time series is the higher the accuracy of hurst estimation is peters 1994 hosking 1984 recommended at least 100 years of record to investigate long term persistence in hydrology instrumental records seldom exceed 100 years and therefore records do not generally satisfy the condition for a long term data khaliq et al 2009 in addition the hurst exponent is non deterministic because it is estimated from observations and expresses what is actually observed in nature khaliq et al 2009 while being more directly related to the records it is not capable of showing the longitudinal breakpoint in the precipitation dynamics brunsell 2010 when using r s analysis to calculate hurst exponent the fit goodness of the regression equation can be used to evaluate the quality of the equation fitting so as to estimate the reliability of hurst exponents the calculation results are shown in fig a3 and table a6 which indicate that in all seasons especially in summer the fit goodness is at a high level in the two areas emphasized in this study the southern foothill of the western himalayas and the bare land grass junction zone verifying the robustness of the conclusion many efforts have been made to estimate hurst index gómez águila et al 2022 zeinali and pourdarvish 2022 or improve the accuracy of the index zeinali and pourdarvish 2022 gómez águila et al 2022 antoniades et al 2021 for instance the use of what if analysis such as sensitivity analysis helps to calibrate the model and improve the robustness of the prediction model thus reducing uncertainty asheghi et al 2020 fragoulakis et al 2015 pichery 2014 in addition the continuous improvement of machine learning algorithms such as neural network and random forest also provides new methods for time series prediction the comparison of various methods improves the robustness of the results 6 4 issues need to be concerned in the future observational data on the qtp are relatively scarce owing to the limitations of the natural conditions lu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 this study uses a precipitation reanalysis data set cpc with resolution of one day although this data set has been proved to have good reliability and has been widely used chen et al 2008 xie et al 2007 lin et al 2022 li et al 2021a there are still inevitable errors since it is based on interpolation of station observation with the promotion of a series of major research projects such as the comprehensive scientific investigation plan of the qtp carried out by the qinghai tibet plateau institute of the chinese academy of sciences the ground monitoring network of the qtp has been further improved and a batch of high quality and high resolution precipitation data will be produced in the future besides developing the methods to generate reliable synthetic data shahri et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 zhang and gao 2021 is also desirable due to the high altitude and complex terrain bai et al 2004 the precipitation on the plateau can be characterized by sunny day and night rain and the mountain floods and geological disasters caused by heavy rainfall at night will result in greater damage zhai 2011 thus finer scale heavy precipitation with smaller time intervals may be the focus of future works zhao et al 2022 fowler et al 2021 in addition quantitative consideration of the human activity contribution to precipitation variability is also an important topic 7 conclusions svi measurement has great potential for disorder index because it allows for the comparison of precipitation variability at multiple time scales guntu et al 2020 previous studies on precipitation variability using svi have mainly focused on intra and interannual variability considering that smaller scale precipitation is more closely related to natural phenomena such as floods and waterlogging this study investigated the variability of daily precipitation on the qtp in seasonal and monthly periods estimated the possible change of vegetation cover in the plateau in the future and the potential natural disaster prone areas based on the persistence of svi change trend and systematically analyzed the influencing factors of svi further understanding of seasonal monthly precipitation variability in the qtp and its surrounding areas is provided more importantly the research framework is generally applicable the following are the main conclusions of the study the tarim basin in the north of the qtp showed high precipitation variability throughout the year when westerly winds prevail in winter and spring the pamirs plateau northwest of qtp show a low svi value area during the monsoon period the low svi value area in the pamirs disappeared while the low svi value area in the southeast of the qtp rapidly expanded to the west considering the whole study area winter season contributed the most to the annual variability and summer the least over the past 40 years daily precipitation variability at the border zone between the grassland and barren or sparsely vegetated areas and southwest of himalayas foothills have decreased significantly which means that precipitation has become more uniform this is beneficial for maintaining and even improving the growth and expansion of grassland in addition svi in several cultivated areas in the southwest of the plateau also decreased significantly during summer which is also beneficial to crop growth however especially in the monsoon period the hurst test showed that the decreasing svi trend in these regions is not sustainable and may reverse in the future which also means that more extreme precipitation may occur especially for southwest of himalayas foothills more precipitation is accompanied by high precipitation variability and combined with local terrain conditions it is easy to induce landslide debris flow and other natural disasters among many climate factors affecting svi tci and svi are most closely related specifically the greater the temperature difference over the qtp and the tropical east indian ocean the lower the variability of plateau precipitation except pamirs the effect of westerly jet on the precipitation variability in the northwest of the plateau is that the stronger the intensity of the westerly jet is and the more southward the westerly jet position is the smaller the precipitation variability will be in other regions the westerly jet has the opposite effect on svi although the effects of the east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon on the svi of the plateau in the summer months were consistent their high intensity action areas complemented each other the sst anomaly closer to the east coast of the equatorial pacific had a greater impact on the variability of precipitation over the plateau among the other climate factors such as amo soi pdo npi and nao npi had a greater impact on svi which corresponds to the finding in qian 2009 that there is teleconnection between the npi and indian ocean sst

2141,the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is a hotspot in the study of global climate change due to its profound impact on the atmospheric water cycle in asia and even the world previous studies on the qtp mainly focused on the spatial distribution of precipitation and its changing trend to investigate the temporal and spatial variations of precipitation variability on the qtp this study applied the standardized variability index svi based on entropy on its daily precipitation without any preset distribution the results showed that for most monsoon months in the past 40 years svi has a significant downward trend in the southwest foot of the himalayas and the border zone between barren and grassland areas indicating that precipitation has become more uniform which is beneficial for growth of grassland however the hurst exponent shows that such trend will reverse in the future which may cause natural disasters such as landslides and debris flows in the monsoon period considering the large amount of precipitation and the local topographic conditions in the southwest of the himalayan foothills the inducements of such precipitation variability were also studied including asian monsoon westerly jets sea land thermal difference and sea surface temperature sst compared with the monsoon index the sea land thermal difference has a stronger correlation with the precipitation variability the sst anomaly closer to the east coast of the equatorial pacific also has a great impact on the variability of precipitation over the plateau this study contributes to understanding precipitation variability in the qtp at a sub seasonal period keywords entropy standardized variability index svi qinghai tibet plateau seasonal monthly precipitation variability influencing factors on precipitation variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent decades global warming has strengthened the water cycle between land and ocean thus affecting the process of water cycle voigt and shaw 2015 human activities further promote the change of precipitation and runoff resulting in the change of spatial and temporal distribution of various forms of water resources zhang et al 2016 due to the climatic shift to a warmer temperature rapid industrialization and urbanization and intense agricultural practices the intensity frequency and extent of the hydroclimatic extremes i e droughts and floods are expected to increase in the near future with relatively severe consequences abhishek et al 2021 xiong et al 2022 known as the water tower of asia the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is characterized as a fragile and sensitive environment pithan 2010 with some researchers suggesting that global climate change originates from the qtp zhang et al 2017 the hydrologic and energy cycles in cold regions are sensitive to climate change and important in regulating water resources especially in high mountains hu et al 2022 precipitation is a key part of the global atmospheric and hydrological cycle and is also an important factor affecting the allocation of water resources li et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 subtle changes in precipitation significantly impacts the ecosystem energy cycle agricultural production and food security jiang et al 2022 shen et al 2011 furthermore because of climate change and human activities the temperature in the qtp has increased significantly in recent years which further affects its water cycle wu et al 2010 research shows that moderate rain intensity increased and contributes significantly to total rain change in recent decades over the qtp ayantobo et al 2022 the existing studies on precipitation on the qtp focus on the precipitation amount monthly seasonal and annual precipitation amount provide valuable information regarding the temporal distributions and variations in precipitation but they cannot reflect its frequency the number of rainy days or gaps in precipitation series vyshkvarkova et al 2018 the precipitation variability needs to be studied because it determines the availability of water resources and the occurrence of extreme precipitation events gu et al 2020 furthermore alterations in the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation leads to frequent flood and drought and loss of biodiversity and also disturbs the river ecosystem mathew et al 2021 quantifying precipitation variability is considerably challenging because of the complex nature of climatic variables that influence precipitation dynamics and their spatiotemporal variability and nonlinear interactions jin and wang 2017 several methods such as shannon entropy mishra et al 2009 principal component analysis yuan et al 2016 and harmonic analysis pohl et al 2015 have been applied to study precipitation variability compared with other methods shannon entropy does not make any assumptions about the probability distribution or statistical properties of the data thus it can be applied to any type of distribution regardless of whether it is known or unknown or if the underlying system is dynamic pechlivanidis et al 2016 kawachi et al 2001 proposed shannon entropy as precipitation entropy to assess the temporal precipitation apportionment later maruyama et al 2005 modified the precipitation entropy into apportionment entropy ae and intensity entropy ie to quantify the intra year variability of precipitation and precipitation days furthermore mishra et al 2009 applied for the first time the above information measures to the decadal dae inter year me and intra year ae ie time series to investigate the variability i e evenness of annual precipitation on the daily monthly seasonal scale and the interannual variability of monthly seasonal scale to compare the precipitation entropy at different time scales guntu et al 2020 defined the standardized variability index svi within the range of 0 1 however the application of entropy on the analysis of precipitation variability mainly concerns the intra year or inter year distribution of precipitation compared with long term statistical results the fine temporal structure of precipitation at a daily resolution is vitally significant because of its strong correlation with many natural disasters such as desertification floods and debris flows royé and martin vide 2017 besides the climate of the qtp is affected by monsoon and westerly jet which atmospheric circulations have obvious seasonality the study on the variability of daily precipitation within a month season helps to understand the precipitation structure in the plateau as for the causes of the precipitation changes research on the inter year variability of summer rainfall in the qtp suggests that its mechanisms include the summer north atlantic oscillation nao wang et al 2018b eurasian snow cover xu and lu 1992 sea surface temperature sst of the atlantic ocean gao et al 2013 el niño southern oscillation enso yeh et al 2018 indian ocean chen and you 2017 convection over the western maritime continent jiang et al 2016 and variability of the indian summer monsoon ism jiang and ting 2017 studies on the factors that influence winter precipitation in the qtp cuo et al 2013 revealed that changes in the north atlantic oscillation nao and east asian westerly jet can influence the region s winter precipitation tang et al 2005 proposed that winter snowstorms are associated with the summer geothermal vortex over the qtp plateau topography plays a role in the formation of a snowfall centre sun et al 2010a b nevertheless these studies are mainly focused on the relationship between precipitation and large scale circulation in the qtp and does not consider precipitation variability in this study the svi was used to determine the spatial distribution of seasonal monthly precipitation variability on a daily scale the changing trend of which in the past 40 years and its future persistence were also discussed the results showed that the average svi value in winter was significantly higher than that in summer indicating that the winter precipitation variability contributed the most for all the seasons the precipitation variability along the southwestern edge of the himalayas and the border between the grassland and bare land areas decreased in the past 40 years but the hurst exponent indicated that such trend would reverse in the future i e the uniform precipitation tends to be distributed unevenly resulting the risks of extremes the correlation analysis shows that among the considered factors the sea land thermal difference between the indian ocean and the tibetan plateau has the greatest influence on the precipitation variability in the qtp the southward shift and the intensification of westerly jet will lead to the increase of monthly precipitation variability in the plateau besides in the monsoon months the effects of the south and the east asian monsoon on the precipitation variability are consistent in spatial distribution but the areas of significant influence are complementary 2 data and methods 2 1 data precipitation data is from the national oceanic

apportionment entropy ae entropy is a measure of dispersion uncertainty disorder and diversification a discrete form of entropy e x is shown in eq 1 shannon 1948 1 e x k 1 k p x k log 2 p x k where e x represents the average information of a random variable x and log2 p xk represents the information content surprise about the value xk occurring with probability p xk the value of e x varies from zero to log2 k that is from absolute certainty to maximum uncertainty or complete information to no information about the state of the system apportionment entropy ae is the application of information entropy in hydrology which is used to measure the uniformity of precipitation distribution at a certain time scale mishra et al 2009 for a certain summer in the qtp june july and august assuming daily precipitation sequence is ri i 1 2 3 92 and the total amount is a the precipitation on the i th day is pi ri a and the ae of this summer is shown in eq 2 2 ae k 1 92 r i a log 2 r i a where k is the total number of days the minimum ae indicates that the total precipitation is evenly distributed on each day and the maximum indicates that the total precipitation is concentrated on a certain day 2 3 precipitation variability as represented by standardized variability index svi the maximum entropy is dependent on the timescale of evaluation in order to compare the variability of time series with different data lengths and different timescales the svi defined in eq 3 is applied in this study 3 svi ae max a e ae max where ae max is the maximum of the apportionment entropy and svi 0 1 2 4 changing trend of the precipitation variability mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 and sen s slope estimator sen 1968 are robust in the trend analysis without requirement of any prior assumption on the data distribution and it is not affected by individual outliers di giuseppe et al 2019 ramachandra et al 2011 considering the autocorrelation of time series the modified mk mmk test proposed by yue et al 2002 is applied in this study and the significance level is 0 05 unless otherwise specified 2 5 persistence effect of precipitation variability the hurst s rescaled range r s analysis proposed by hurst 1951 is used to detect the persistence effect of the changing trend of the precipitation variability and quantify it with hurst exponent h as a non parametric analysis method hurst test based on r s analysis has been widely used in the fields of hydrology climatology economics geology and geochemistry due to of its robustness jiang et al 2015 tatli 2015 sánche et al 2008 specifically the hurst exponent h 0 1 if h 0 5 the time series can be described by a random walk known as brownian motion the closer h is to zero the stronger the anti persistence effect that is the future changing trend is opposite to the previous changing trend whereas the closer h is to one the future changing trend is the same as the previous changing trend shi et al 2015 2 6 framework of the proposed methodology fig 1 shows the overall methodological framework used to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of the seasonal and monthly svi in the qtp and its influencing factors 3 study area known as the third pole the qtp is the largest plateau in china with an average altitude of more than 4000 m and a total area of approximately 2 5 million km2 pithan 2010 it is the birthplace of many large rivers brahmaputra river salween river mekong river yangtze river and indus river the climate is warm and humid in the southeast region and cold and dry in the northwest region owing to the influence of the westerly circulation and the topography of the plateau the study area is a rectangular area between 25 5 40 n and 68 105 e that includes the qtp fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation of the qtp and its surrounding areas regions with high precipitation are concentrated on the southern edge of the qtp and experiences a maximum of more than 2500 mm precipitation over the northern plateau is low with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm the annual precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest precipitation occurs mainly during the monsoon period from june to september jjas and precipitation within this period contributes to more than 70 of the total annual precipitation as shown in fig 2b 4 precipitation variability in the qtp 4 1 variability of precipitation at different time scales fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the svi in different seasons and their constituent months during spring march to may mam higher monthly svi values were observed in the northern central and southwestern regions of the plateau whereas lower svi values were observed in a small part of the southeast and northwest regions of the plateau svi variability in the indian monsoon period was relatively low and the low value area of the svi in the southeast region expanded towards the west the pamir plateau in the northwest showed high svi values compared to the other seasons the uncertainty related to summer precipitation was low the precipitation variability of the summer monsoon period was the lowest which benefits the agricultural field because a large part of agricultural productivity comes from monsoon precipitation guntu et al 2020 gu et al 2020 studied the temporal and spatial of precipitation variability in the source area of the yellow river based on shannon entropy and pointed out that the arrival of summer monsoon was advanced which makes may the beginning of wet season and four quantitative evidences are given such phenomenon was also observed in fig 3 in may a continuous low svi area appeared on the southern edge of qtp from october the svi low value area in the southwest decreased to the southeast the svi of the pamir plateau in the northwest decreased and the svi low value area in the southeast disappeared in december the entire plateau is controlled by westerly winds during the winter yao et al 2013 because of topographical obstructions in the west and south of the qtp airflow from the indian ocean cannot enter the hinterland of the plateau and instead moves eastward along the southern foot of the himalayas and northward along the hengduan mountains in the east snowfall occurs in the kara mountains while in the western part of the pamir plateau its higher latitude and colder air causes snowfall to form more easily sun et al 2010a b the high precipitation area corresponds to the low svi value area during the winter the statistical results are listed in table a2 the variability of intra seasonal precipitation in summer was the lowest whereas that in winter was the highest the uniform precipitation in summer is related to the interaction of the westerly and indian ocean monsoons as well as water vapour transport and other factors maussion et al 2014 in general the seasonal svi is lower than that of the constituent months as in table a2 which was verified by mishra et al 2009 guntu et al 2020 also stated that the variability dampens when moving from finer to coarser time scales all svis are negatively correlated with altitude indicating that monsoon may barely disturb the water income in this region due to the altitude as shown in table a4 gu et al 2020 also stated that the water transformed from a solid state was more likely to be the main source of the local cycle 4 2 changing trend of svi in this section the change trend of seasonal svi and monthly svi is given the spatial distribution of different seasonal grids is shown in fig 4 the positive trend represents the increase in precipitation variability over the years which indicates that precipitation is only concentrated within a specific period otherwise the reverse in the northwest and southeast of the qtp there was a significant increase in the seasonal svi for all four seasons indicating that the precipitation distribution tends to be more uncertain in the northwest pamir plateau precipitation is mainly snowfall in winter and under climate warming uneven precipitation may lead to further melting and degradation of glaciers the southeast of the plateau is the origin of several large rivers this region has many mountains and experiences abundant precipitation uneven precipitation in this region further increases the risk of natural disasters such as debris flows such conclusion is verified by lu et al 2021 s study which used the precipitation concentration index and its complementary parameter combination to determine that the high incidence area of debris flow in the qtp is in the southeast of the plateau in addition the results showed spatial heterogeneity for different seasons for example in the southern grassland the svi showed a downward trend in summer and an upward trend in winter table a3 shows the number of grids with significant increases and decreases in the svi for each season and month in the study area the results show that 1 in winter the number of grids with a significant svi increase is significantly larger compared with a svi decrease while the results are opposite for other seasons and months except march and 2 in summer the grids with significant svi trend change is much higher than for other seasons specifically in summer the grids with an increasing svi trend are concentrated in the east and the grids with a decreasing trend are concentrated in the middle and west fig a1 shows that in winter only a few grids in the north have a decreasing trend while other regions show an increasing trend seasonal variation in the svi on the plateau indicates a change in large scale circulation in summer the northern part of the plateau is mainly controlled by the westerlies whereas the south is controlled by the indian monsoon in winter the entire qtp is essentially controlled by the westerlies yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 reported that the indian monsoon has exhibited a weakening trend since the 1980s resulting in decreased precipitation over the southern qtp dong et al 2016 the weakening trend of the plateau indian monsoon is closely related to the decrease of seasonal monthly svi in the southeast of the plateau in summer the region mainly affected by the monsoon the results in section 5 3 also show that the weaker the indian monsoon the stronger the variability of the plateau summer precipitation indicating that the weaker summer monsoon often causes unstable water vapor transport and precipitation supply and results in increased precipitation variability in contrast the strengthening of the prevailing mid latitude westerlies yao et al 2012 has increased moisture transport into the northern and western qtp mölg et al 2014 the strengthening of westerly jet is closely related to the strengthening of svi in almost the entire study area especially in the northwest in winter the results in section 5 2 show that the stronger the westerly jet is the stronger the variability of winter precipitation over the plateau will be indicating that strong westerly jet could cause unstable water vapor transport and precipitation supply at the junction of barren or sparsely vegetated and grassland areas seasonal svi showed a significant downward trend which was particularly evident in spring summer and autumn areas marked with red rectangles in fig 4b this zone is particularly critical under the condition of relatively uniform and abundant precipitation barren or sparsely vegetated areas are likely to become grasslands in contrast when the variability of precipitation is relatively large grasslands may be transformed into barren or sparse vegetation the significant decreasing trend in the seasonal svi is positive maintaining the current grassland area and even expanding its area is favourable this point also exists in the changing trend of the monthly svi especially from may to october the changing trend of the svi in winter was also distinct in barren or sparsely vegetated areas the svi showed a significant downward trend whereas in adjacent grassland areas the svi showed a significant upward trend this means that in winter there was a decrease in precipitation variability in barren or sparsely vegetated areas whereas grassland areas showed increasing uneven seasonal precipitation in the future some changes may occur in the coverage of these vegetation types because their coverage tends to be uniform or opposite however this trend has only been observed for winter during the other seasons the svi for grasslands still showed a decreasing trend however for all seasons the seasonal svi of barren or sparsely vegetated areas showed a decreasing trend which may be due to the melting of glaciers and the change in the local water vapour cycle under global warming conditions plant phenology is one of the most sensitive indicators of ecosystem response to climate change in the past decade studies on changes in plant phenology and their response to climate change in the qtp have become a popular international frontier sun et al 2020b found that the phenological changes in plants in the qtp during spring were not significant the phenology in autumn was significantly delayed and the length of the growing season was significantly prolonged summer and autumn are the main growing seasons of crops in the plateau in cultivated lands in the southwest of the qtp the svi shows a downward trend in summer and its constituent months fig a1 which is favourable for crop growth in autumn the svi in some cultivated areas show an increasing trend which is detrimental to the growth of water intensive crops therefore it is critical that efforts are made to construct water storage facilities to store excess precipitation in summer for the irrigation of water intensive crops during autumn 4 3 persistence of svi changing trend hurst indices were used to investigate if the areas bordering grasslands and barren or sparse vegetation will continue to experience a decreasing svi trend the results are shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that sporadic areas maintain the changing trend of precipitation variability including those with an increasing trend indicated by red and those with decreasing trend indicated by orange the area without black dots indicates that the change of svi trend is not significant it is worth noting that for all seasons the precipitation variability tended to increase from a decrease along the southwestern edge of the himalayas and the border between grassland and barren land that is the original uniform precipitation trend changed to uneven precipitation which may result in more extreme precipitation this trend is detrimental to either the western himalayas or the grassland barren land junction uneven precipitation may lead to natural disasters in the southwestern foothills of the himalayas such as mudslides and low precipitation in grassland areas is unfavourable for grassland restoration li et al 2022 studied the influence of precipitation structures on vegetation growth in the qtp and illustrated that both precipitation and the precipitation svi affect vegetation as precipitation in low vegetation areas had higher seasonal and monthly variability water allocation should be reconsidered 5 influencing factors on the precipitation variability in the qtp 5 1 thermal difference between qtp and the indian ocean the thermal difference between the qtp and tropical indian ocean in the middle and upper troposphere is closely related to the onset of the indian summer monsoon and its interannual and interdecadal changes the temperature over the qtp and the tropical eastern indian ocean is the two regions most sensitive to changes during the indian summer monsoon dai et al 2013 based on this the thermal contrast index tci is defined as the standardization of the temperature difference between the tibetan plateau and the tropical eastern indian ocean in the 500 200 hpa temperature field as shown in the dataset constructed by li et al 2019 the tci between the qtp and the indian ocean reflects the thermal difference between the plateau and northern indian ocean and its relationship with the later indian summer monsoon variability the tci has a better indication effect on the indian summer monsoon than the thermal conditions of the qtp or the indian ocean alone when the index is large the intensity of the indian summer monsoon in the later stages is often stronger li et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 a there is a significant negative correlation between the monthly svi and tci time series r 0 763 p 0 01 which reveals the impacts of thermal differences between the qtp and the indian ocean on precipitation variability the greater the thermal difference between the sea and land the smaller the variability of precipitation in the month the larger the thermal difference the stronger the monsoon monsoons provide relatively stable water vapour from the ocean thus bringing more stable precipitation that is lower precipitation variability in general svi and tci in the plateau and surrounding areas showed a strong negative correlation whereas in the pamir plateau in the northwest of the plateau svi and tci showed a strong positive correlation in fig 6b which means that when the summer monsoon is strong precipitation variability is high studies have shown that the change in the location of the westerlies is related to the strength of the summer monsoon over the plateau fang et al 2016 5 2 westerly the subtropical westerly jet stream over the northern hemisphere is a planetary scale atmospheric circulation system in the upper troposphere and its anomalies have important influence on the middle and lower atmospheric circulations lin and lu 2005 many studies have shown that the jet stream has a significant influence on the climate of asia especially for precipitation sampe and xie 2010 to quantitatively analyse the relationship between westerly jet and precipitation variability two jet indices were defined according to sun et al 2020a the position index of the jet is defined as the average latitude of the maximum westerly wind at 200 hpa at each longitude over the domain of 30 50 n and 80 120 n sun et al 2020a and the strength index of the jet is defined as the mean of the maximum westerly wind speed at 200 hpa at each longitude over the same domain fig 7 shows the calculation of the westerly jet indices and their relationship with precipitation variability the westerly jet was weaker and northerly from april to october as shown in fig 7a and 7c the results showed a strong negative correlation between the precipitation svi and the location of the westerly jet meaning the more northerly the centre of the westerly jet the higher the variability of monthly precipitation studies over the past 40 years have shown that global warming has caused westerly winds in the southern hemisphere to move towards the south pole and increase in intensity and this trend is also reflected in the northern hemisphere toward the north pole yang et al 2020a when the jet stream moves northward the daily precipitation variability within a month in the pamirs increases whereas it decreases in other regions as shown in fig 7b the precipitation svi has a strong positive correlation with the intensity of the westerly jet as shown in fig 7c meaning the greater the intensity of the westerly jet the more uneven the precipitation within that month this influence is distinct from that of the monsoons in terms of interannual variability precipitation over the qtp is negatively correlated with moisture transported by the westerlies and positively correlated with the indian summer monsoon and water vapour from nearby regions chen et al 2019 5 3 asian monsoon 5 3 1 south asian summer monsoon sasm the sasm index sasmi is defined as the area averaged seasonal jjas dynamical normalized seasonality dns at 850 hpa within the south asian domain 5 22 5 n 35 97 5 e li and zeng 2002 as shown in fig 8 the precipitation svi and sasmi in the pamirs and the eastern plateau showed a weak negative correlation whereas in most other regions they had a strong negative correlation recent studies have found that precipitation in may has been increasing over the southeast and central areas of the qtp thereby accelerating lake expansion wetting and greening of the qtp in recent decades chen and you 2017 furthermore the increasing precipitation trend in may for these two regions are mainly attributed to the early onset of the sasm which is connected to the thermodynamic and dynamic adjustments caused by the sst anomaly of the indian ocean xing et al 2016 the cyclones and anticyclones accompanying the anomalous activities of the sasm results in the convergence and divergence of water vapour together with the strong vertical motion and topographic effects this is conducive for the convergence and divergence of water vapour in the southeast and southwest of the plateau zhu et al 2020 sun et al 2019 reports that in the western qtp when the sasm is strong the anomalous upward movement intensifies the water vapour flux anomalously converges and the precipitation anomaly is greater while the opposite is true in the east in weak monsoon years an abnormally convergent area of water vapour fluxes appeared in the east as indicated by the blue area in fig 8a 5 3 2 east asian monsoon easm the eastern part of the qtp is particularly affected by the easm cherchi et al 2011 because of its high terrain during summer air in the qtp heats rapidly causing rising airflow and decreasing air pressure which accelerates the formation of low pressure on land and increases the force of the summer monsoon blowing from the ocean to land and even affecting the eastern and southern parts of the qtp interestingly the spatial pattern of the easm and the impact of the sasm on the precipitation svi are consistent as shown in fig 8b however this is opposite for the significance of the positive and negative correlations specifically the easm shows a strong positive correlation with the pamir plateau and the eastern plateau and thus has a greater impact on the yangtze river basin yellow river basin lancang river basin and salween river basin in general the easm and sasm have a coincident effect on the precipitation svi but the strong effect area is complementary furthermore increasing evidence suggests that the intensity of the easm is inversely correlated to the ism maher and hu 2006 5 4 sea surface temperature sst the indian meteorological department has observed and recorded monsoon patterns for several decades and has developed multiple stochastic models to forecast the initiation recession and strength of the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr of the many different factors affecting ismr the el niño southern oscillation enso is considered a significant large scale force that influences the behaviour of ismr ju and slingo 1995 during the development of an el niño summer the ctp central qtp dry anomaly tends to bridge the dry anomalies over india and northern china thereby forming a dry zone along the north western edge of the asian monsoon domain which implies that the northern edge of the asian monsoon domain tends to retreat equatorward expanding poleward during el niño la niña lei et al 2019 the numbers of the niño 1 2 3 and 4 regions correspond to the labels assigned to ship tracks that have crossed these regions data from these tracks enabled the historic records of el niño to be dated back to 1949 as discussed in a classic study by rasmusson and carpenter 1982 from the east to the west coast along the equatorial pacific it successively passes through the niño 1 2 niño 3 niño 3 4 and niño 4 subregions the impact of different niño subregions on precipitation variability in the qtp is spatially different fig 9 the closer the niño subregion is to the east coast of the equatorial pacific the greater the impact of the niño subregion on the variability of monthly precipitation in the plateau the abnormally high sst in the tropical eastern pacific niño 1 2 may be the cause of more uniform monthly precipitation in the pamirs plateau in the northwest of the qtp and simultaneously produce uneven precipitation in the central and eastern parts of the plateau which is similar to the effect of the strength of the westerly jet chen 1977 illustrated that for the southwest monsoon region of india the equatorial warm water period in the eastern pacific ocean is an anticyclonic anomalous current the southwest monsoon in india is weak or interrupted while the equatorial cold water period in the eastern pacific ocean is a cyclonic anomalous current and the southwest monsoon in india is strong which is conducive for precipitation the abnormally high sst in the central and western tropical pacific niño 4 leads to an opposite distribution of precipitation variability on the plateau compared with niño 1 2 the abnormally high sst in the niño 3 area makes the monthly precipitation distribution in the pamirs plateau and the upper reaches of the southeast outflow river basin more uniform the niño 3 4 area is negatively correlated with the svi in most areas which means that the abnormally high sst in this area makes the monthly precipitation distribution of the entire qtp more uniform ayesha et al 2021 also pointed out that the abnormal temperature increase in the tropical central and western pacific will lead to the formation of high pressure and easterly wind anomalies in the subtropical western pacific which will enhance the convergence and increase the precipitation in south asia 5 5 other climate factors to understand the possible teleconnection of the precipitation index with large scale circulations we correlated the svi with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo southern oscillation index soi pacific decadal oscillation pdo north pacific index npi and north atlantic oscillation nao as shown in fig 10 in which the npi had a higher correlation with the precipitation svi the npi is the area weighted sea level pressure over the region 30 n 65 n 160 e 140 w the npi measures interannual to decadal variations in atmospheric circulation trenberth and hurrell 1994 the main mode of the north pacific winter atmospheric circulation is the intensity change of the aleutian low pressure al npi is a sensitive index for this mode interestingly the npi index in the northern pacific ocean is inversely synchronized with the sst change in the tropical indian ocean on the interdecadal scale qian 2009 the correlation between soi pdo nao and svi was weak indicating that the three indexes contribute little to the variability of monthly precipitation over the plateau see fig 10 since the 1990s the amo has shifted to a warm phase and is closely related to more extreme precipitation events in non monsoon and monsoon regions ding et al 2019 moreover the amo has a greater influence on extreme precipitation than the enso and the asian monsoon index in non monsoon regions of china ding et al 2019 a survey of central asia conducted by yang et al 2020b shows that both the precipitation frequency entropy and precipitation entropy have a positive and significant correlation with the amo which was verified for the qtp in this study the warm phase of the amo provides more moisture flux and consequently enhanced precipitation piao et al 2005 moreover model simulations derived from the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl am2 1 provide direct evidence to demonstrate that the amo phase transition contributes to the unstable relationship between the summer nao and precipitation dipole pattern in the eastern qtp liu et al 2021 6 discussion 6 1 impact of human activities on precipitation variability human induced global warming is widely recognized wmo 2021 ipcc 2022 for instance anthropogenic aerosols have been detected in large scale changes in the water cycle since the mid 20th century ipcc 2022 continually increasing human activities are altering the global and regional terrestrial water balance directly e g water abstraction and infrastructure development and indirectly e g deforestation and increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases alter hydroclimate abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 abhishek et al 2021 observations and simulations have shown that land use can drive precipitation locally or remotely by changing surface energy balance water vapor advection and recirculation processes sea land thermal contrast and associated circulation modes alter et al 2015 wey et al 2015 large scale deforestation could result in reduced evaporation and precipitation devaraju et al 2015 urbanization increases local precipitation with medium reliability and runoff intensity with high reliability ipcc 2021 irrigation water also plays a regulating role in regional water cycle qin et al 2011 glacial meltwater may also contribute significantly to the water balance on the qtp zhang et al 2017 most glaciers on the qtp have experienced retreat of their termini and negative mass balance anomalies in the past two decades azam et al 2018 which is partly due to black carbon emissions south asia is recognized as a region with particularly acute air pollution when compared with the rest of the world ramanathan et al 2005 long range transport of black carbon from south asia to the qtp and its deposition on glaciers directly enhances glacier melt meanwhile south asian black carbon also has an indirect effect on the plateau s glaciers shrinkage by acting to reduce the water supply over the southern qtp yang et al 2022 since the beginning of the 21st century south asian black carbon emissions have been pivotal in altering summer precipitation over the southern qtp such emissions have reduced long range moisture advection and subsequent precipitation regimes to and within the southern qtp yang et al 2022 besides the weakening of the south asian monsoon illustrated in section 4 2 there is an additional explanation on the increase of precipitation variability in the southeast of the qtp i e the black carbon emissions led to the decrease of the water vapor transported from the indian ocean to the qtp as many large rivers originates from the qtp there have been a number of water storage projects in recent years especially in the indo gangetic plain many dams and floodgates have been built to control floods and mitigate droughts li et al 2022 however the lack of access to dam and gate regulation data makes it difficult to quantitatively analyze their impact on precipitation variability 6 2 comparison with other previous studies the collective average of the seven most advanced grid precipitation products shows that the annual precipitation of qtp from 1980 to 2018 increased slightly yao et al 2022 such statistically insignificant change in precipitation results from the average of spatially heterogeneous changes i e the precipitation in the north has increased significantly sun et al 2020a while that in the south has decreased significantly wang et al 2018a since 1979 the high resolution simulation using wrf model and gldas shows that the precipitation of inner qtp has increased significantly zhang et al 2017 this study shows that in the past 40 years the precipitation variability on the inner qtp has significantly decreased in almost all seasons and months especially in summer which may be resulted from the more frequent precipitation the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar6 states that annual precipitation in northern hemisphere mountains is expected to increase by 5 to 20 in the future while the regional and seasonal variation of extreme precipitation is quite different and the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall over the qtp will increase this study verifies that there will be an increasing trend of precipitation variability in the vicinity of the himalayas especially during the monsoon period which is often accompanied by an increase in extreme precipitation events 6 3 uncertainty analysis there inevitably exist outliers when analyzing time series in this study mmk test was used to analyze the changing trend of svi sequence and hurst test was used to evaluate the persistence of svi such trend both models are non parametric analysis methods which have certain robustness and can avoid the interference of a few outliers di giuseppe et al 2019 tatli 2015 sánche et al 2008 before using these two methods the pauta criterion also known as 3σ criterion was carried out for outlier detection on svi sequence and the results showed that only a few grids had 1 or 2 outliers as shown in fig a2 and table a5 these outliers are replaced with the mean value of the sequence uncertainty also exists when using hurst test which is related to data length although the main advantages of statistical models are their limited reliance on field calibration data zhao et al 2015 studies show that the longer the time series is the higher the accuracy of hurst estimation is peters 1994 hosking 1984 recommended at least 100 years of record to investigate long term persistence in hydrology instrumental records seldom exceed 100 years and therefore records do not generally satisfy the condition for a long term data khaliq et al 2009 in addition the hurst exponent is non deterministic because it is estimated from observations and expresses what is actually observed in nature khaliq et al 2009 while being more directly related to the records it is not capable of showing the longitudinal breakpoint in the precipitation dynamics brunsell 2010 when using r s analysis to calculate hurst exponent the fit goodness of the regression equation can be used to evaluate the quality of the equation fitting so as to estimate the reliability of hurst exponents the calculation results are shown in fig a3 and table a6 which indicate that in all seasons especially in summer the fit goodness is at a high level in the two areas emphasized in this study the southern foothill of the western himalayas and the bare land grass junction zone verifying the robustness of the conclusion many efforts have been made to estimate hurst index gómez águila et al 2022 zeinali and pourdarvish 2022 or improve the accuracy of the index zeinali and pourdarvish 2022 gómez águila et al 2022 antoniades et al 2021 for instance the use of what if analysis such as sensitivity analysis helps to calibrate the model and improve the robustness of the prediction model thus reducing uncertainty asheghi et al 2020 fragoulakis et al 2015 pichery 2014 in addition the continuous improvement of machine learning algorithms such as neural network and random forest also provides new methods for time series prediction the comparison of various methods improves the robustness of the results 6 4 issues need to be concerned in the future observational data on the qtp are relatively scarce owing to the limitations of the natural conditions lu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 this study uses a precipitation reanalysis data set cpc with resolution of one day although this data set has been proved to have good reliability and has been widely used chen et al 2008 xie et al 2007 lin et al 2022 li et al 2021a there are still inevitable errors since it is based on interpolation of station observation with the promotion of a series of major research projects such as the comprehensive scientific investigation plan of the qtp carried out by the qinghai tibet plateau institute of the chinese academy of sciences the ground monitoring network of the qtp has been further improved and a batch of high quality and high resolution precipitation data will be produced in the future besides developing the methods to generate reliable synthetic data shahri et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 zhang and gao 2021 is also desirable due to the high altitude and complex terrain bai et al 2004 the precipitation on the plateau can be characterized by sunny day and night rain and the mountain floods and geological disasters caused by heavy rainfall at night will result in greater damage zhai 2011 thus finer scale heavy precipitation with smaller time intervals may be the focus of future works zhao et al 2022 fowler et al 2021 in addition quantitative consideration of the human activity contribution to precipitation variability is also an important topic 7 conclusions svi measurement has great potential for disorder index because it allows for the comparison of precipitation variability at multiple time scales guntu et al 2020 previous studies on precipitation variability using svi have mainly focused on intra and interannual variability considering that smaller scale precipitation is more closely related to natural phenomena such as floods and waterlogging this study investigated the variability of daily precipitation on the qtp in seasonal and monthly periods estimated the possible change of vegetation cover in the plateau in the future and the potential natural disaster prone areas based on the persistence of svi change trend and systematically analyzed the influencing factors of svi further understanding of seasonal monthly precipitation variability in the qtp and its surrounding areas is provided more importantly the research framework is generally applicable the following are the main conclusions of the study the tarim basin in the north of the qtp showed high precipitation variability throughout the year when westerly winds prevail in winter and spring the pamirs plateau northwest of qtp show a low svi value area during the monsoon period the low svi value area in the pamirs disappeared while the low svi value area in the southeast of the qtp rapidly expanded to the west considering the whole study area winter season contributed the most to the annual variability and summer the least over the past 40 years daily precipitation variability at the border zone between the grassland and barren or sparsely vegetated areas and southwest of himalayas foothills have decreased significantly which means that precipitation has become more uniform this is beneficial for maintaining and even improving the growth and expansion of grassland in addition svi in several cultivated areas in the southwest of the plateau also decreased significantly during summer which is also beneficial to crop growth however especially in the monsoon period the hurst test showed that the decreasing svi trend in these regions is not sustainable and may reverse in the future which also means that more extreme precipitation may occur especially for southwest of himalayas foothills more precipitation is accompanied by high precipitation variability and combined with local terrain conditions it is easy to induce landslide debris flow and other natural disasters among many climate factors affecting svi tci and svi are most closely related specifically the greater the temperature difference over the qtp and the tropical east indian ocean the lower the variability of plateau precipitation except pamirs the effect of westerly jet on the precipitation variability in the northwest of the plateau is that the stronger the intensity of the westerly jet is and the more southward the westerly jet position is the smaller the precipitation variability will be in other regions the westerly jet has the opposite effect on svi although the effects of the east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon on the svi of the plateau in the summer months were consistent their high intensity action areas complemented each other the sst anomaly closer to the east coast of the equatorial pacific had a greater impact on the variability of precipitation over the plateau among the other climate factors such as amo soi pdo npi and nao npi had a greater impact on svi which corresponds to the finding in qian 2009 that there is teleconnection between the npi and indian ocean sst

2142,to fully understand the dynamic change characteristics of soil moisture in north china the spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture anomalies sma in the four active soil layers from january 1990 to december 2020 are analyzed based on the global land data assimilation system gldas model then the driving factors and corresponding contribution rates crs for sma change are determined together with the meteorological socioeconomic and land cover data the results show that the sma in the last three layers present decreasing trends and the trend magnitudes increase in multiples with the increase of soil depth the area with the most severe soil dry is clustered in the east central plain while the relatively wet areas are scattered in western shanxi and northern hebei the annual intra and inter annual cycles 1 0 0 5 4 3 and 7 3 yr are the dominant frequency of the sma time series which are driven jointly by 6 natural type factors and 6 human type factors especially the intensified evaporation and dramatically expanding urbanization by combining principal component analysis pca and grey absolute correlation degree the reintegrated human and natural factors respectively account for 49 46 and 50 54 of mean crs to sma in the four layers but the human factor dominates the change of the bottom sma on the other hand the determined mean crs by combining exploratory factor analysis efa and grey absolute correlation degree are 53 46 and 46 44 for reintegrated positive and negative factors but the negative factor has a greater effect on the bottom sma the results provide a clear clarification of the soil moisture dynamic change which is conducive to shedding new light on water resources management agricultural security and ecological sustainability keywords soil moisture north china spatiotemporal patterns driving factors contribution rates data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the terrestrial water cycle soil moisture is an intermediate bridge for the interconversion of surface water vegetation canopy water and groundwater which maintains the orderly running of many hydrological processes bi et al 2016 abowarda et al 2021 in the land atmosphere cycle soil moisture is a key physical quantity in driving the exchange between material and energy as it not only controls the partitioning of incoming energy between latent and sensible heat flux wang zeng 2011 jia et al 2018 but also determines the allocation of precipitation between runoff and infiltration qiu et al 2016 li et al 2022 tian et al 2022 moreover soil moisture is an indispensable initial parameter in constructing hydrological agricultural environmental and climatic models so it can help to improve the prediction of food production ecological security and extreme weather drusch 2007 bi et al 2016 zhu et al 2022 yan et al 2022 given the multi core role in the earth system the stability of soil moisture dynamic change is vitally important to the smooth running of cycle processes involved however recent studies have declared that global warming is accelerating water transport between the hydrological cycle piao et al 2010 dai 2013 li et al 2021 tian et al 2022 worse still in the past years soil moisture in the root zone layer has experienced extensive depletion at a non negligible rate nigatu et al 2022 for example cheng huang 2016 revealed that the global soil moisture from 1948 to 2010 was dominated by a downward trend with a mean rate of 0 0000284 m3 m3 10 yr the most pronounced dry occurred in east asia and the sahel gu et al 2019 compared global surface soil moisture changes from multiple models based data and satellite observations the multi source datasets consistently presented widespread drying trends during 1980 2005 in more than 50 of the areas furthermore soil moisture dries on a regional scale have also been investigated and studied such as iran rahmani et al 2016 china jia et al 2018 zhu et al 2022 california goulden bales 2019 southeastern europe hirschi et al 2011 north china fig 1 consisting of four provinces and municipalities of hebei shanxi beijing and tianjin is one of the seven geographical regions in china feng et al 2013 also known as the main grain production bases of china supplying about 30 of wheat and 20 of maize output per year cao et al 2013 feng et al 2022a however in the past decades the rapid economic development and increasing population have made the region highly dependent on water resources as a result severe water crises and environmental disasters have occurred which in turn have caused untold damage to the sustainable development of the ecological environment system cao et al 2013 feng et al 2022a b because of the severity of the water crisis a series of investigations on the storage and evolution of water resources in north china have been conducted e g feng et al 2013 cao et al 2013 huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 pang et al 2020 hao et al 2021 feng et al 2022a the results consistently demonstrated that water resources here are being depleted at an alarming rate nevertheless the present researches mainly focus on terrestrial water and groundwater although soil moisture has been verified to be sensitive in response to climate change in a global scale assessment gu et al 2019 it still has not drawn enough attention in north china only a few research papers can be referred to specifically qiu et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 respectively validated the reliability of the remotely sensed soil moisture dataset in north china plain over different periods the long term trends of the surface soil moisture were demonstrated to be discrepant in different sub regions especially the major irrigation region was carefully examined also the seasonal soil moisture dynamics were successfully captured li et al 2021 adopted the hydrological model and ground observations to detect surface soil moisture changes during 1961 1997 versus 1998 2017 the comparative results indicated that the regional warming slowdown over the past two decades has not prevented the decrease in soil moisture moreover cao et al 2022 monitored extreme drought in north china plain by constructing the soil water deficit index swdi and soil moisture condition index smci both indices could accurately detect the agricultural drought induced by soil moisture deficiency and smci showed a better agreement with the vegetation drought index in terms of drought characteristics according to the achievements some useful information can be drawn but the understanding of soil moisture dynamic change in north china is not in any way limited thereto the most intuitive point is that only the surface soil moisture change has been emphatically examined the deeper soil aquifers that can more profoundly reflect current water resources status have not yet been covered precisely because of this only several natural type factors directly related to surface soil moisture such as precipitation and evaporation qiu et al 2016 li et al 2021 have been preliminarily identified but more concealed factors remain to be further explored especially those associated with the human activities if some important factors are omitted when making decisions on water resources management and environmental governance it will inevitably lead to misjudgment moreover to the best of our knowledge the relative contributions of driving factors to water resources change regardless of terrestrial water soil moisture or groundwater are mostly quantified by establishing multiple linear regression models e g cheng huang 2016 jia et al 2018 li et al 2021 however due to the complex land atmosphere interaction and hydrological process the driving factors are not always mutually independent tian et al 2022 coupled with the fact that the actual situation is generally difficult to meet the linearity premise zhu et al 2022 which will bias the estimated contribution to some extent in summary current works have not thoroughly studied the soil moisture dynamic change in north china in order to bridge the knowledge gap and promote greater insight into the interactions between soil moisture environment and human society we aim to ⅰ analyze the temporal characteristics and spatial patterns of soil moisture change at four soil layers during the past 31 years in north china so as to highlight the similarities and differences between them ii examine the long term changes of the potential factors in the aspect of meteorological socioeconomic and land cover then quantitatively identify the driving factors and mechanism of soil moisture changes and iii further determine the contribution rate crs of the driving factors by combining the grey absolute correlation degree with two data driven approaches 2 data and methodology 2 1 data analysis 2 1 1 soil moisture data normally there exist three ways for obtaining soil moisture information the first is to measure soil moisture with ground based observation stations however the station networks in north china are too sparse and the observation periods are too short qiu et al 2016 li et al 2021 which can be only effective over an extremely limited spatiotemporal scale robock et al 2000 satellite based microwave remote sensing provides an alternative way to directly measure soil moisture with reliable accuracy at a large spatiotemporal scale dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 li et al 2022 which makes up for the deficiency of in situ measurement however the observations from satellite sensors only provide the upper few centimeters of soil water content nearly 0 5 cm due to the limitation of microwave penetration depth kerr et al 2012 zeng et al 2015a such satellite based observations cannot meet the requirement for a comprehensive assessment of the total water amount in the active soil layer top 0 200 cm nigatu et al 2022 to derive more complete soil moisture information some modeling methods and data assimilation techniques have been developed fan and dool 2004 rienecker et al 2011 which can not only meet the data requirement in spatiotemporal continuity but also estimate the soil moisture content in the deep vadose zone among them the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 developed jointly by nasa and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration is the most widely used to investigate the hydrological process pang et al 2020 extreme weather yan et al 2022 and land atmosphere interaction pan et al 2017 as a result the quality of soil moisture from the gldas model has been assessed against in situ measurements and remote sensing products in many representative regions zaitchik et al 2010 spennemann et al 2015 pan et al 2017 especially the applications in china have been proved with high accuracy bi et al 2016 qiu et al 2016 jia et al 2018 gu et al 2019 li et al 2021 therefore in this study the gldas noah model was employed to simulate the gridded soil moisture data from january 1990 to december 2020 in north china with monthly temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the weight unit kg m 2 of soil moisture was converted to the equivalent water height cm by 100 s d where s is soil moisture values from the gldas model and d is water density kg m 3 in particular soil thickness is divided into four vertical layers with depths of 0 10 cm the surface layer 10 40 cm the second layer 40 100 cm the third layer and 100 200 cm the bottom layer respectively which is very conducive to investigate the difference of soil moisture changes at different soil depths to validate the accuracy of gldas derived soil moisture we adopted a multi satellite microwave dataset for comparison namely esa cci soil moisture dorigo et al 2017 li et al 2022 including the passive active and combined products the combined product is generated by merging the first two products with considerations of the effects of vegetation gruber et al 2019 thus the recent version v06 1 of esa cci combined product with daily temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution was used in our comparison to keep comparability with the gldas model esa cci soil moisture was resampled to monthly temporal resolution and the volumetric water content m3 m 3 i e water content per cubic meter of soil was converted to equivalent water height cm by multiplying with the depth interval 2 cm dorigo et al 2011 gu et al 2019 2 1 2 meteorological data four meteorological elements involved in the land atmosphere cycle were collected from the gldas noah model including the gridded data of temperature wind speed specific humidity and net radiation flux from january 1990 to december 2020 and all of them were subjected to quality control rodell et al 2004 bi et al 2016 their temporal and spatial resolutions are the same as the soil moisture note that the monthly file of net radiation flux refers to the average of each 3 hour interval in a month which was transformed into the monthly accumulation here since the gldas model underestimates precipitation and evaporation pan et al 2017 the monthly precipitation data from the china metrological administration cma was used in this study this gridded data is generated by interpolating 2472 rain gauge records in china with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 pan et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 and then was bilinearly interpolated to 0 25 0 25 to be consistent with soil moisture data in addition the evaporation data was obtained from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 and has the same temporal and spatial resolutions as soil moisture data a prominent advantage of the gleam model is that it can maximally recover the soil moisture induced evaporation contained in the current satellite observations martens et al 2017 2 1 3 socioeconomic and land cover data the gridded data of population pop and gross domestic product gdp were downloaded from the resource and environmental science and data center resdc the spatialization of the two datasets is achieved by using the multi factor weight distribution method under the consideration of several closely related factors including the land use types nighttime light brightness and residential density pang et al 2020 however both datasets were only used to estimate the long term trends in spatial since their temporal resolution is very low just including six years 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2019 though with a high spatial resolution of 1 km to derive the continuous pop and gdp time series from 1990 to 2020 we collected the statistical data corresponding to four provinces and municipalities from the shanxi provincial bureau of statistics hebei provincial bureau of statistics beijing municipal bureau of statistics and tianjin municipal bureau of statistics and then calculated the total pop and gdp i e the arithmetic sum over entire north china the land cover data from 1992 to 2020 were acquired from the copernicus climate change service c3s the dataset is generated based on a unique baseline land cover map thus consistent over time c3s 2021 with yearly temporal resolution and 300 m spatial resolution the data quality is assessed on 1344 samples and the overall classification accuracy is better than 70 c3s 2020 which is attractive to the communities working on environmental monitoring agricultural management and hydrological modelling original land cover class is defined using the land cover classification system developed by the united nations food and agriculture organization to facilitate our work according to the correspondence between the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc land category and the original land cover class we reclassified the land cover data into six classes agriculture forest grassland water body urban land bare land and wetland 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 principal component analysis and exploratory factor analysis two data driven approaches including principal component analysis pca shen et al 2014 and exploratory factor analysis efa martinez and martinez 2005 were employed to analyze the possibly correlated driving factors for deriving new synthetic factors that retain as much useful information as possible under the significant reduction of correlation assuming that the original time series after being normalized are arranged in an m n matrix x x i k i 1 2 m k 1 2 n where m and n denote the time series epoch and the number of factors respectively the matrix x is firstly decomposed with pca 1 x m n p m n e n n t where p is the matrix of principal components pcs e is the eigenvector matrix derived from the covariance matrix b x t x 2 b n n e n n λ n n e n n t where λ is a diagonal eigenmatrix whose eigenvalues λk are sorted in descending order i e λ 1 λ 2 λ n in pca the most important and uncorrelated information is usually concentrated in relatively few components feng et al 2022a therefore the first r r n pcs explaining the maximum amount of variability in the original variables are exactly the required synthetic factors 3 p m r x m n e n r the number r can be identified by the cumulative variance percentages of dominant pcs and the f test shen et al 2014 feng et al 2022b any orthogonal transformation on eigenvector matrix e does not change the original ee t with the expectation of improving the distinguishability of decomposed components efa further rotates the pc and eigenvector matrix so that the absolute values of elements in each eigenvector toward 0 or 1 hence the rotated pcs can better reflect the importance of original variables unkel trendafilov 2010 to do that an orthogonal rotation matrix w w 1 w 2 w r is introduced in equation 1 to form the mathematical model of efa as 4 x m n p m r λ r r 1 2 w r r w r r t λ r r 1 2 e r n t f m r l r n where f p λ 1 2 w and the column of f represents an exploratory factor ef l w t λ 1 2 e t and its columns are called loading vectors once an appropriate rotation matrix w is given the efs and loading vectors can be uniquely determined to estimate the rotation matrix the varimax algorithm martinez and martinez 2005 unkel trendafllov 2010 was employed in this work consequently same as pcs efs are also a new set of uncorrelated synthetic factors finally what needs special explanation is that the purposes of using both pca and efa to process the driving factors are on the one hand to make the decomposed components as explainable as possible on the other hand to tap the multiple shared attributes of the driving factors from different perspectives 2 2 2 grey absolute correlation degree method given the unknown and usually complex functional form between the soil moisture and driving factors multivariate non parametric methods can be the better choice to deal with such a black box problem than multiple linear regression zhu et al 2022 therefore the grey absolute correlation degree method mei 1992 one of the representative algorithms in grey theory was used to estimate the crs of the synthetic factors to soil moisture change in this study we denote the time series of kth synthetic factor u k u k i i 1 2 m k 1 2 r and the time series of soil moisture in the hth layer y h y h i i 1 2 m h 1 2 4 where r and m are the numbers of synthetic factors and epochs respectively after the initialization and first order differential are performed for both time series of soil moisture and synthetic factor mei 1992 the correlation between them at each epoch is computed as 5 ε h k i 1 1 y h i u k i i 2 m note that the change rate of the first epoch is nonexistent so only m 1 epochs are considered then the absolute correlation degree can be derived as 6 r h k 1 m 1 j 2 m ε h k j therefore the cr of kth synthetic factor to the soil moisture change in the hth layer is computed with 7 c r h k r h k j 1 n r h j 100 2 2 3 lomb scargle periodogram the lomb scargle periodogram scargle 1982 a spectral analysis method applicable to both evenly and unevenly spaced data is employed to detect periodic signals in the time series of soil moisture denoting the time series of soil moisture as y the power spectra t y is then determined as 8 t y ω 1 2 i y i cos ω t i τ 2 i cos 2 ω t i τ i y i sin ω t i τ 2 i sin 2 ω t i τ where ω is frequency and τ is defined by 9 τ 1 2 ω tan 1 i sin 2 ω t i i cos 2 ω t i 2 2 4 correlation analysis pearson s correlation coefficient pr is used to quantitatively assess the correlation between the driving factor x and soil moisture y bi et al 2016 nagale et al 2022 which is defined as 10 pr i 1 m x i x y i y i 1 m x i x 2 i 1 m y i y 2 where x and y are the mean of two variables respectively m is the number of epochs the statistical significance level of pearson s correlation coefficient is assessed using student s t test qiu et al 2016 3 results and analysis 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristic analysis of soil moisture in the four layers four layers of shallow soil moisture from january 1990 to december 2020 were obtained from the gldas model and corresponding monthly average soil moisture contents are plotted in fig 2 as we can see from fig 2 a d the spatial patterns are basically consistent but the water content increases with the increase of soil depth for each layer the soil moisture contents in northern hebei and northern shanxi with poor precipitation and less agriculture are generally lower whereas they are higher in southern shanxi with abundant precipitation and the east central plain fig 1 with extensive agricultural activities which therefore highlights the unevenly spatial distribution of soil moisture in north china then the monthly average soil moisture content derived from esa cci is plotted in fig 2 e as a comparison clearly the surface soil moisture from two different sources matches well in terms of spatial distribution with a mean pr of 0 85 indicating that the gldas model is reliable in characterizing the soil moisture in north china to a large extent and can be used for subsequent analysis however limited by the penetration depth the soil moisture content derived from esa cci is much lower than that from gldas as expected in order to better characterize the dry and wet statuses of soil moisture the mean value of the whole study period was removed to derive the soil moisture anomaly sma where positive and negative values represent wetter and dryer than normal respectively pang et al 2020 feng et al 2022a by using the least squares harmonic analysis huang et al 2015 we estimated the long term trends of sma in the four layers from january 1990 to december 2020 respectively as shown in fig 3 the trends of the four layers are analogous in spatial distribution in which opposite change directions are presented in the northwest and southeast the soil drying area is located in the east central plain while the soil wetting areas are scattered in northern hebei northern beijing and western shanxi with varying upward trends comparing four layers the downward trend area extends from the east central plain to taihang mountains as the increase of soil depth correspondingly the upward trend area is continuously compressed suggesting that the deeper the soil the wider the range of soil moisture depletion subsequently the regional scale time series of sma is calculated as the weighted average of time series at all grid points within the region with the weight proportional to the area of the grid point sun et al 2010 huang et al 2015 as depicted in fig 4 a certain difference can be observed in the trends over different periods and thus we divided the whole study period into three stages and summarize corresponding trends in table 1 firstly the trends of sma in the last three layers increase from january 1990 to august 1996 and reach the peaks 3 03 cm 7 09 cm and 6 15 cm for the second third and bottom layers respectively in the final month which indicates this period is relatively wet then a sharp decrease occurs from september 1996 to july 2010 especially in the bottom layer whose downward rate reaches 0 226 0 018 cm yr indicating a climate shift from wet to dry during the last period from august 2010 to december 2020 four layers present upward trends with a mean rate of 0 080 0 020 cm yr which is consistent with the soil moisture change in the same latitude region of east asia kong et al 2019 and may benefit from the warming slowdown overall in the past three decades the surface sma manifests a subtle upward trend and is dominated by periodic oscillation which is contributed by some meteorological factors such as precipitation qiu et al 2016 li et al 2021 comparatively speaking sma in the last three layers present more sharp fluctuations coupled with long term trends and inter annual variations according to the power spectra calculated with the lomb scargle periodogram the surface sma is almost completely dominated by the annual cycle with a less obvious inter annual cycle of 4 3 yr which confirms the impact of meteorological factors such as precipitation and temperature on the surface sma as the soil depth increases the annual signal gradually weakens and the intra and inter annual cycles e g 0 5 4 3 and 7 3 yr become significant along with the long term trend the specific driving factors need further exploration but predictably more intra and inter annual variations suggest that sma in the last three layers are subject to more complex driving forces and the intensities acting on different layers by these driving factors must be different given the abundant annual intra and inter annual characteristics of sma fig 5 plots the time series of sma in the four layers at multiple time scales from fig 5 m p the monthly average time series roughly follow a horizontal s shaped curve except for the third layer this suggests that soil moisture depletes in the first half of the year namely before the onset of summer rain possibly because the evaporation enhances with the warming temperature during the first six months the variation ranges are 0 42 to 0 08 cm 0 59 to 0 02 cm 1 46 to 0 27 cm and 0 39 to 0 02 cm for the four layers respectively then the rainy season is arriving leading to the sharp increases of four layers until they reach the intra annual peaks 0 50 cm 0 66 cm 0 55 cm and 0 40 cm from the surface to bottom layers respectively in august or september then a reduction follows again but the reduction is relatively limited due to the accumulation of heavy rainfall it is worth noting that the rainy season in north china generally starts in june pang et al 2020 feng et al 2022a but due to the time delay of precipitation infiltration into each soil layer the transitions of soil moisture from the negative anomaly to positive anomaly are in june july august and august for the four layers from surface to bottom respectively accordingly the shallower soil moisture is more likely to benefit from precipitation while the deeper soil moisture is more difficult to be recharged from fig 5 q t four layers present negative anomalies in spring or spring and summer mainly because some crops in the mature stage from april to june require to absorb a lot of water and crop roots are more distributed in the deep soil at this stage yang et al 2010 jeong et al 2014 in addition four layers present a rapid decrease from autumn to winter which violate the normal condition that sma should be higher at this period due to the low temperature and weak solar radiation therefore sma change is inferred to be disturbed by human activities this inference can be further confirmed by fig 5 j k l where the maximums in the last three layers occurred in 1996 while the minimums occurred in different years indicating that the natural changes of soil moisture are destroyed by human activities in different time nodes 3 2 determination of the driving factors of sma change the above analysis reflects that sma change in north china is likely to be influenced by both natural and human type factors empirically the former can be briefly summarized as some climatic and environmental elements cheng huang 2016 li et al 2021 while the latter usually involves complex social activities such as agricultural irrigation industrial development domestic use etc qiu et al 2016 zhu et al 2022 which affect sma primarily by modifying the watershed hydrology processes moiwo tao 2014 sadeghi et al 2021 consequently twelve potential driving factors in terms of meteorological socioeconomic and land cover were selected to explore the cause of sma change including precipitation evaporation temperature wind speed specific humidity net radiation flux pop gdp agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land respectively firstly the spatial patterns of trends in the first eight potential factors were analyzed among which the wind speed and specific humidity decrease over most study areas while the rest of the factors are dominated by upward trends see more details in text s1 in the supporting information moreover changes in the last four potential factors were investigated through the land cover maps the results demonstrate that agricultural land and grassland are reduced from 1992 to 2020 while forest land presents a slightly increasing trend especially urban land expands dramatically with a growth rate of 343 17 and the water body therewith drops by 13 27 implying that land encroachment for urbanization accelerates the drying up of water resources the detailed land cover change in north china is described in text s2 in the supporting information subsequently we identified the driving factors by establishing the one to one correlation analysis with sma in the four layers bi et al 2016 gu et al 2019 feng et al 2022a during the study period the gridded data of pop and gdp are available for only several discrete years whereas the arithmetic sum time series over the region derived from the statistical yearbooks are complete considering the requirement for data continuity in the current analysis the correlation analysis was conducted from the perspective of time series to do that the area weighted average time series of the first six factors precipitation evaporation temperature wind speed specific humidity and net radiation flux and the arithmetic sum time series of the last four factors agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land over the entire region were calculated respectively meanwhile the missing data 1990 and 1991 in the time series of the last four factors were filled by the cubic spline interpolation method respectively huang et al 2015 feng et al 2022a in addition the monthly sma was resampled to yearly time series when performing correlation analysis with the last six factors eventually the prs were calculated and illustrated in fig 6 as we can see the prs range from 0 79 to 0 79 for the surface layer the prs with pop forest land and grassland pass the 90 confidence test while those with gdp agricultural land and urban land do not pass the confidence test the rest pass the 95 confidence test the high correlation levels with close magnitudes are concentrated in the first six factors indicating that the seasonal oscillation of the surface sma is mainly dominated by natural type factors for the second and third layers the prs are relatively uniform ranging from 0 32 to 0 44 all pass the 95 confidence test except that the prs with gdp agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land pass the 90 confidence test and 0 38 to 0 38 all pass the 95 confidence test respectively for the bottom layer the prs range from 0 52 to 0 54 with all passing the 95 confidence test except the pr with wind speed the correlation levels with human type factors are significantly improved suggesting the more intense response of bottom sma to human activities on the whole the factors positively correlated with sma change include precipitation specific humidity agricultural land forest land and grassland the remaining factors present negative correlations therefore we can conclude that the twelve selected factors are definitely the drivers of sma changes but with different impact degrees on the four layers furthermore we can see that the correlation levels between sma and natural type factors are gradually weakened as the increase of soil depth while the opposite correlation levels can be seen between sma and human type factors to explain this phenomenon we take precipitation and agricultural land as two examples precipitation can directly recharge surface soil moisture while it needs to undergo a complex infiltration process when recharging other layers since the rainwater will be partly absorbed by other hydrological exchange events such as the water closure from the vegetation root zone consequently the effective precipitation that actually flows to the deep soil is limited leading to a weak relationship with deep sma therefore the prs between precipitation and sma decrease from a significant level 0 79 in the surface layer to a weak level 0 22 in the bottom layer for the agricultural land in north china as well known crops require a lot of groundwater to be pumped for irrigation feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 and part of the irrigation water will flow back into the soil preferential flow down to 50 cm soil depth zheng et al 2019 and then pushing original stored water deeper down the soil profile where it is eventually discharged into the deep soil moisture or groundwater therefore there is a better correlation between agricultural land and the deep sma however it must be solemnly stated that the recharge at the expense of groundwater depletion is not a healthy way because as a result groundwater in north china is decreasing at an alarming rate cao et al 2013 feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 feng et al 2022a 3 3 contribution rates of the driving factors to sma change we determine twelve driving factors that are of good relevance to sma change however by conducting the one to one correlation assessments on every two factors the details are described in texts s3 in the supporting information we can clearly see that the absolute values of prs among the first six factors are mostly greater than 0 2 and those among the last six factors are all above 0 7 with all passing the 95 confidence test therefore to remove the redundant information produced by the interrelated driving factors pca and efa were respectively performed to derive the new uncorrelated synthetic factors i e pc and ef in pca the cumulative variance percentages of derived pcs are shown in fig 7 using the f test shen et al 2014 feng et al 2022b the first two pcs contain about 82 of the total variance which are dominant and sufficiently represent the required information we plot the time series of two pcs in fig 8 in which pc1 presents a significant long term trend while more periodic oscillations in pc2 besides both pc1 and pc2 present dramatic changes from 1998 to 2000 which are somewhat similar to the change in the sma time series subsequently in efa the first two pcs were used to further resolve two efs and the time series are also plotted in fig 8 from which we can see that ef1 and ef2 present completely opposite changes and without obvious periodic characteristics suggesting that efa reintegrates all factors into two competitively synthetic factors compared the pcs and efs the former emphasizes more on depicting the hidden periodic information of the original variables although the total variance of the two efs remains the same after a special orthogonal transformation their distinguishability is significantly enhanced theoretically pca efa establishes a linear relationship between the original factor and pc ef via the eigenvector loading vector that is to say the eigenvector loading vector reflects the contribution of the original factor to pc ef therefore we can attempt to explain the actual meaning of pc ef by dissecting the permutation features of elements within each column of the eigenvector loading vector according to the first two eigenvectors and loading vectors in table 2 the last six factors pop gdp agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land corresponding to the most significant contributions in the first eigenvector dominate the change of pc1 meanwhile an obvious attribute shared by the six factors is that they all belong to the category of human activities thus pc1 can be reasonably designated as the human factor similarly pc2 is designated as the natural factor for the loading vectors four factors including precipitation specific humidity forest land and grassland possess the maximum contributions in the first loading vector which undoubtedly dominate the change of ef1 considering that the four factors are all positively correlated with sma change we thus designate ef1 as the positive factor similarly ef2 is designated as the negative factor therefore reintegrating the driving factors into the uncorrelated synthetic factors is essentially the induction for their shared attributes and the shared attributes are clearly not unique finally the crs of pca based efa based synthetic factors to sma change were calculated and displayed in fig 9 from fig 9 a human factor respectively accounts for 44 87 48 54 48 58 and 55 85 of crs to the changes of sma in the four layers indicating an increasing impact from surface to bottom layer on the contrary the impacts of natural factors on the changes of four layers gradually weaken with the crs of 55 13 51 46 51 42 and 44 15 respectively it is worth mentioning that the allocations of crs in fig 9 a are consistent with the changes of prs in fig 6 both of which highlight the importance of the human driving force for deep sma and the natural driving force for the surface sma from fig 9 b the crs of positive factor to sma changes are 57 98 55 07 54 65 and 46 51 from the surface to bottom layer respectively while the crs of negative factor are 42 02 44 93 45 35 and 53 49 respectively therefore the driving forces of the positive factor to sma in the first three layers are stronger than that of the negative factor the former gradually weakens as the increase of soil depth but the latter gradually enlarges and eventually is larger than the former in the bottom layer also the results well confirmed the change of long term trends in sma table 1 that is the drying trend intensifies as the increase of soil depth 4 discussion 4 1 driving mechanism analysis for sma change from fig 3 and table s2 sma change in north china is heterogeneous both spatially and temporally which depends largely on the behaviors of driving factors therefore we expect to reveal the driving mechanism for sma change based on the long term trends of the driving factors firstly according to fig 3 the spatial pattern of sma can be characterized in three sub regions with the most significant variations in western shanxi although evaporation intensifies with the increase of net radiation flux and temperature fig s1 sma shows a weak upward trend due to the significant increase of precipitation indicating that precipitation dominates the final status of sma change in the east central plain the increased temperature and wind speed intensify the evaporation coupled with the reduced precipitation and specific humidity fig s1 cooperatively resulting in a significant decrease of sma over this sub region thus warming temperature amplifies the effect of reduced precipitation and specific humidity on sma by intensifying evaporation indicating that soil drying is induced by insufficient precipitation and exacerbated by warming temperature jia et al 2018 also drew a similar conclusion in analyzing the soil moisture in china however sma change is not solely driven by natural type factors in north china the rapidly expanding urbanization continuously compresses the agricultural land fig s2 and table s2 reducing the irrigation water that flows back into the soil which greatly affects the recharge of soil moisture in northern hebei although the temperature evaporation and net radiation flux increase and the precipitation reduces the sma trend is completely opposite to that in the east central plain which is attributed to the expansion of forest land in this sub region fig s2 as we all know dense vegetation can enhance soil moisture retention and thus accelerate the recovery of soil moisture moiwo tao 2014 therefore it demonstrates that more water efficient land uses can ensure the sustainability and availability of water resources subsequently according to the divided sub periods in table 1 we further estimated the trends of the time series of twelve factors table 3 comparing tables 1 and 3 sma increases from january 1990 to august 1996 which is mainly attributed to increased precipitation and forest land as well as weakened evaporation from september 1996 to july 2010 precipitation maintains an increasing trend even so sma decreases rapidly due to the sharp intensification of evaporation and reductions of specific humidity agricultural land and grassland squeezed by the expansion of urbanization confirming that the intensified evaporation largely suppresses the impact of precipitation in addition the increase of sma from august 2010 to december 2020 mainly benefits from the increasing specific humidity and decreasing wind speed and net radiation flux throughout the whole study period although the precipitation is relatively abundant the increase of solar radiation and temperature induces the intensification of evaporation meanwhile human activities drive the land cover toward a change direction that is unfavorable to the storage of soil moisture under such circumstances sma suffers the threat of severe depletion which undoubtedly increases the risk of potential agricultural drought nigatu et al 2022 cao et al 2022 to sum up the drying wetting trend of sma in north china matches well with the trend of driving factors both spatially and temporally indicating that the twelve factors jointly dominate the rise and fall of sma at different geographical locations and periods 4 2 similarities and discrepancies among sma in the four layers from figs 2 and 3 the water contents and long term trends of the four layers are similar in terms of spatial distribution pattern however the magnitudes are far different which increase in multiples from the surface to the bottom layer the reasons on the one hand are largely attributed to the different thicknesses of aquifers simulated by the gldas model on the other hand different soil properties also have a great impact such as the soil type and porosity that will directly determine the water storage capacity drusch et al 2007 zheng et al 2019 last but not least the intensities of driving factors acting on four layers are distinct figs 6 and 9 which ultimately leads to differences in trend magnitude and periodic information 4 3 implications for future soil moisture management the current development of soil moisture in north china is clearly unsustainable due to the negative effects of climate change and unreasonable human activities and its full recovery undoubtedly requires a prolonged process nevertheless improving water conditions to achieve a new balance over a relatively short period can be considered sufficiently sustainable cao et al 2013 zhu et al 2022 based on the research results we can draw some important implications on the one hand the contribution rates can be estimated more accurately when more comprehensive driving factors are considered meanwhile the newly derived driving factors especially the human type factors such as pop and gdp can be added as the input parameters in the establishment of future hydrological models which is conducive to improving the accuracy however it is hard to consider all human activities at once further investigations are required to thoroughly reveal the impact of human activities on soil moisture change on the other hand targeted regulation strategies can be established to alleviate soil moisture depletion firstly inspired by figs 2 3 and s1 increasing input ways for water resources to alleviate the stress on precipitation such as augmenting the route and water volume of the south to north water diversion project especially the dry center i e the east central plain should be given priority in water allocation next inspired by fig 5 soil moisture shows negative anomalies in spring and summer which is closely related to the water requirements of crops substantial reduction in crop area is impractical and conflicts with the current status in china cao et al 2013 also a subversive adjustment in agricultural crop rotation is very difficult jeong et al 2014 therefore improving the efficiency of water use is a relatively simple and feasible method for example loose soil in autumn to store the heavy rainfall in the deep soil so as to get more supply in spring and summer finally inspired by figs s1 and s2 employing effective cultivation techniques to inhibit evaporation such as greenhouse farming on the other hand adjusting the land cover structure and promoting afforestation and grass planting in addition promoting the recycling of domestic water except drinking water 5 conclusions in this study the gldas model is used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of sma in the four layers in north china over the period from january 1990 to december 2020 the driving factors of sma change and mechanisms are determined together with meteorological socioeconomic and land cover data on the whole sma in the last three layers shows downward trends and the magnitudes are aggravated by the increasing soil depth a significant soil drying center is concentrated in the east central plain while relatively wet areas are scattered in western shanxi and northern hebei annual intra and inter annual cycles 1 0 0 5 4 3 and 7 3 yr jointly dominate the frequency domains of four layers implying a combined impact of natural and human activities on sma change subsequently twelve driving factors that certainly correlated with sma change are identified including six natural type factors precipitation evaporation temperature wind speed specific humidity net radiation flux and six human type factors pop gdp agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land as the soil depth increases the correlation levels between sma and natural type factors are gradually weakened while the opposite scene is for the human type factors indicating the more intense impact of human activities on deep layers furthermore the drying and wetting trends of sma respond well to the trends of driving factors both spatially and temporally indicating that twelve factors jointly dominate the rise and fall of sma at different geographical locations and periods especially the intensified evaporation induced by warming temperatures and other causes largely suppresses the recharge of precipitation on sma urban land increases dramatically with a growth rate of 343 17 which is the ringleader that accelerates the drying up of sma in north china to remove the redundant information among the driving factors pca and efa are respectively used to extract shared attributes of the factors to derive the uncorrelated synthetic factors and their crs are further determined in conjunction with the grey absolute correlation degree according to pca based synthetic factors crs to sma changes from human factor account for 44 87 48 54 48 58 and 55 85 from surface to bottom layer while those from natural factor account for 55 13 51 46 51 42 and 44 15 indicating that human factor outperforms natural factor in controlling the change of bottom sma according to efa based synthetic factors crs to sma changes from positive factor are 57 98 55 07 54 65 and 46 51 from surface to bottom layer while those from negative factor are 42 02 44 93 45 35 and 53 49 demonstrating that the deep soil moisture depletion is more serious as well as more difficult to recharge it is worth emphasizing that our sma change investigation with considering four soil aquifers separately can capture the otherness more accurately and further make up for the cognitive deviation of water resources in north china in contrast to studies that only focus on the surface layer or regard all layers as a whole especially we clearly recognize that soil moisture depletion at the depth of 100 200 cm is more severe and harder to be recharged furthermore we pioneer the combination of several data analysis methods to accurately identify the hidden driving factors and contributions so as to excavate much valuable information particularly important human activities and evaporation are respectively mainly responsible for the depletion of bottom and shallower aquifers the current situation of soil moisture especially the deep layers in north china is less optimistic consequently to alleviate soil moisture depletion it is highly recommended to attach more attention to human type driving factors this study provides a scientific reference for establishing targeted regulation policies and finally

2142,to fully understand the dynamic change characteristics of soil moisture in north china the spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture anomalies sma in the four active soil layers from january 1990 to december 2020 are analyzed based on the global land data assimilation system gldas model then the driving factors and corresponding contribution rates crs for sma change are determined together with the meteorological socioeconomic and land cover data the results show that the sma in the last three layers present decreasing trends and the trend magnitudes increase in multiples with the increase of soil depth the area with the most severe soil dry is clustered in the east central plain while the relatively wet areas are scattered in western shanxi and northern hebei the annual intra and inter annual cycles 1 0 0 5 4 3 and 7 3 yr are the dominant frequency of the sma time series which are driven jointly by 6 natural type factors and 6 human type factors especially the intensified evaporation and dramatically expanding urbanization by combining principal component analysis pca and grey absolute correlation degree the reintegrated human and natural factors respectively account for 49 46 and 50 54 of mean crs to sma in the four layers but the human factor dominates the change of the bottom sma on the other hand the determined mean crs by combining exploratory factor analysis efa and grey absolute correlation degree are 53 46 and 46 44 for reintegrated positive and negative factors but the negative factor has a greater effect on the bottom sma the results provide a clear clarification of the soil moisture dynamic change which is conducive to shedding new light on water resources management agricultural security and ecological sustainability keywords soil moisture north china spatiotemporal patterns driving factors contribution rates data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the terrestrial water cycle soil moisture is an intermediate bridge for the interconversion of surface water vegetation canopy water and groundwater which maintains the orderly running of many hydrological processes bi et al 2016 abowarda et al 2021 in the land atmosphere cycle soil moisture is a key physical quantity in driving the exchange between material and energy as it not only controls the partitioning of incoming energy between latent and sensible heat flux wang zeng 2011 jia et al 2018 but also determines the allocation of precipitation between runoff and infiltration qiu et al 2016 li et al 2022 tian et al 2022 moreover soil moisture is an indispensable initial parameter in constructing hydrological agricultural environmental and climatic models so it can help to improve the prediction of food production ecological security and extreme weather drusch 2007 bi et al 2016 zhu et al 2022 yan et al 2022 given the multi core role in the earth system the stability of soil moisture dynamic change is vitally important to the smooth running of cycle processes involved however recent studies have declared that global warming is accelerating water transport between the hydrological cycle piao et al 2010 dai 2013 li et al 2021 tian et al 2022 worse still in the past years soil moisture in the root zone layer has experienced extensive depletion at a non negligible rate nigatu et al 2022 for example cheng huang 2016 revealed that the global soil moisture from 1948 to 2010 was dominated by a downward trend with a mean rate of 0 0000284 m3 m3 10 yr the most pronounced dry occurred in east asia and the sahel gu et al 2019 compared global surface soil moisture changes from multiple models based data and satellite observations the multi source datasets consistently presented widespread drying trends during 1980 2005 in more than 50 of the areas furthermore soil moisture dries on a regional scale have also been investigated and studied such as iran rahmani et al 2016 china jia et al 2018 zhu et al 2022 california goulden bales 2019 southeastern europe hirschi et al 2011 north china fig 1 consisting of four provinces and municipalities of hebei shanxi beijing and tianjin is one of the seven geographical regions in china feng et al 2013 also known as the main grain production bases of china supplying about 30 of wheat and 20 of maize output per year cao et al 2013 feng et al 2022a however in the past decades the rapid economic development and increasing population have made the region highly dependent on water resources as a result severe water crises and environmental disasters have occurred which in turn have caused untold damage to the sustainable development of the ecological environment system cao et al 2013 feng et al 2022a b because of the severity of the water crisis a series of investigations on the storage and evolution of water resources in north china have been conducted e g feng et al 2013 cao et al 2013 huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 pang et al 2020 hao et al 2021 feng et al 2022a the results consistently demonstrated that water resources here are being depleted at an alarming rate nevertheless the present researches mainly focus on terrestrial water and groundwater although soil moisture has been verified to be sensitive in response to climate change in a global scale assessment gu et al 2019 it still has not drawn enough attention in north china only a few research papers can be referred to specifically qiu et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 respectively validated the reliability of the remotely sensed soil moisture dataset in north china plain over different periods the long term trends of the surface soil moisture were demonstrated to be discrepant in different sub regions especially the major irrigation region was carefully examined also the seasonal soil moisture dynamics were successfully captured li et al 2021 adopted the hydrological model and ground observations to detect surface soil moisture changes during 1961 1997 versus 1998 2017 the comparative results indicated that the regional warming slowdown over the past two decades has not prevented the decrease in soil moisture moreover cao et al 2022 monitored extreme drought in north china plain by constructing the soil water deficit index swdi and soil moisture condition index smci both indices could accurately detect the agricultural drought induced by soil moisture deficiency and smci showed a better agreement with the vegetation drought index in terms of drought characteristics according to the achievements some useful information can be drawn but the understanding of soil moisture dynamic change in north china is not in any way limited thereto the most intuitive point is that only the surface soil moisture change has been emphatically examined the deeper soil aquifers that can more profoundly reflect current water resources status have not yet been covered precisely because of this only several natural type factors directly related to surface soil moisture such as precipitation and evaporation qiu et al 2016 li et al 2021 have been preliminarily identified but more concealed factors remain to be further explored especially those associated with the human activities if some important factors are omitted when making decisions on water resources management and environmental governance it will inevitably lead to misjudgment moreover to the best of our knowledge the relative contributions of driving factors to water resources change regardless of terrestrial water soil moisture or groundwater are mostly quantified by establishing multiple linear regression models e g cheng huang 2016 jia et al 2018 li et al 2021 however due to the complex land atmosphere interaction and hydrological process the driving factors are not always mutually independent tian et al 2022 coupled with the fact that the actual situation is generally difficult to meet the linearity premise zhu et al 2022 which will bias the estimated contribution to some extent in summary current works have not thoroughly studied the soil moisture dynamic change in north china in order to bridge the knowledge gap and promote greater insight into the interactions between soil moisture environment and human society we aim to ⅰ analyze the temporal characteristics and spatial patterns of soil moisture change at four soil layers during the past 31 years in north china so as to highlight the similarities and differences between them ii examine the long term changes of the potential factors in the aspect of meteorological socioeconomic and land cover then quantitatively identify the driving factors and mechanism of soil moisture changes and iii further determine the contribution rate crs of the driving factors by combining the grey absolute correlation degree with two data driven approaches 2 data and methodology 2 1 data analysis 2 1 1 soil moisture data normally there exist three ways for obtaining soil moisture information the first is to measure soil moisture with ground based observation stations however the station networks in north china are too sparse and the observation periods are too short qiu et al 2016 li et al 2021 which can be only effective over an extremely limited spatiotemporal scale robock et al 2000 satellite based microwave remote sensing provides an alternative way to directly measure soil moisture with reliable accuracy at a large spatiotemporal scale dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 li et al 2022 which makes up for the deficiency of in situ measurement however the observations from satellite sensors only provide the upper few centimeters of soil water content nearly 0 5 cm due to the limitation of microwave penetration depth kerr et al 2012 zeng et al 2015a such satellite based observations cannot meet the requirement for a comprehensive assessment of the total water amount in the active soil layer top 0 200 cm nigatu et al 2022 to derive more complete soil moisture information some modeling methods and data assimilation techniques have been developed fan and dool 2004 rienecker et al 2011 which can not only meet the data requirement in spatiotemporal continuity but also estimate the soil moisture content in the deep vadose zone among them the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 developed jointly by nasa and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration is the most widely used to investigate the hydrological process pang et al 2020 extreme weather yan et al 2022 and land atmosphere interaction pan et al 2017 as a result the quality of soil moisture from the gldas model has been assessed against in situ measurements and remote sensing products in many representative regions zaitchik et al 2010 spennemann et al 2015 pan et al 2017 especially the applications in china have been proved with high accuracy bi et al 2016 qiu et al 2016 jia et al 2018 gu et al 2019 li et al 2021 therefore in this study the gldas noah model was employed to simulate the gridded soil moisture data from january 1990 to december 2020 in north china with monthly temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the weight unit kg m 2 of soil moisture was converted to the equivalent water height cm by 100 s d where s is soil moisture values from the gldas model and d is water density kg m 3 in particular soil thickness is divided into four vertical layers with depths of 0 10 cm the surface layer 10 40 cm the second layer 40 100 cm the third layer and 100 200 cm the bottom layer respectively which is very conducive to investigate the difference of soil moisture changes at different soil depths to validate the accuracy of gldas derived soil moisture we adopted a multi satellite microwave dataset for comparison namely esa cci soil moisture dorigo et al 2017 li et al 2022 including the passive active and combined products the combined product is generated by merging the first two products with considerations of the effects of vegetation gruber et al 2019 thus the recent version v06 1 of esa cci combined product with daily temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution was used in our comparison to keep comparability with the gldas model esa cci soil moisture was resampled to monthly temporal resolution and the volumetric water content m3 m 3 i e water content per cubic meter of soil was converted to equivalent water height cm by multiplying with the depth interval 2 cm dorigo et al 2011 gu et al 2019 2 1 2 meteorological data four meteorological elements involved in the land atmosphere cycle were collected from the gldas noah model including the gridded data of temperature wind speed specific humidity and net radiation flux from january 1990 to december 2020 and all of them were subjected to quality control rodell et al 2004 bi et al 2016 their temporal and spatial resolutions are the same as the soil moisture note that the monthly file of net radiation flux refers to the average of each 3 hour interval in a month which was transformed into the monthly accumulation here since the gldas model underestimates precipitation and evaporation pan et al 2017 the monthly precipitation data from the china metrological administration cma was used in this study this gridded data is generated by interpolating 2472 rain gauge records in china with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 pan et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 and then was bilinearly interpolated to 0 25 0 25 to be consistent with soil moisture data in addition the evaporation data was obtained from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 and has the same temporal and spatial resolutions as soil moisture data a prominent advantage of the gleam model is that it can maximally recover the soil moisture induced evaporation contained in the current satellite observations martens et al 2017 2 1 3 socioeconomic and land cover data the gridded data of population pop and gross domestic product gdp were downloaded from the resource and environmental science and data center resdc the spatialization of the two datasets is achieved by using the multi factor weight distribution method under the consideration of several closely related factors including the land use types nighttime light brightness and residential density pang et al 2020 however both datasets were only used to estimate the long term trends in spatial since their temporal resolution is very low just including six years 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2019 though with a high spatial resolution of 1 km to derive the continuous pop and gdp time series from 1990 to 2020 we collected the statistical data corresponding to four provinces and municipalities from the shanxi provincial bureau of statistics hebei provincial bureau of statistics beijing municipal bureau of statistics and tianjin municipal bureau of statistics and then calculated the total pop and gdp i e the arithmetic sum over entire north china the land cover data from 1992 to 2020 were acquired from the copernicus climate change service c3s the dataset is generated based on a unique baseline land cover map thus consistent over time c3s 2021 with yearly temporal resolution and 300 m spatial resolution the data quality is assessed on 1344 samples and the overall classification accuracy is better than 70 c3s 2020 which is attractive to the communities working on environmental monitoring agricultural management and hydrological modelling original land cover class is defined using the land cover classification system developed by the united nations food and agriculture organization to facilitate our work according to the correspondence between the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc land category and the original land cover class we reclassified the land cover data into six classes agriculture forest grassland water body urban land bare land and wetland 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 principal component analysis and exploratory factor analysis two data driven approaches including principal component analysis pca shen et al 2014 and exploratory factor analysis efa martinez and martinez 2005 were employed to analyze the possibly correlated driving factors for deriving new synthetic factors that retain as much useful information as possible under the significant reduction of correlation assuming that the original time series after being normalized are arranged in an m n matrix x x i k i 1 2 m k 1 2 n where m and n denote the time series epoch and the number of factors respectively the matrix x is firstly decomposed with pca 1 x m n p m n e n n t where p is the matrix of principal components pcs e is the eigenvector matrix derived from the covariance matrix b x t x 2 b n n e n n λ n n e n n t where λ is a diagonal eigenmatrix whose eigenvalues λk are sorted in descending order i e λ 1 λ 2 λ n in pca the most important and uncorrelated information is usually concentrated in relatively few components feng et al 2022a therefore the first r r n pcs explaining the maximum amount of variability in the original variables are exactly the required synthetic factors 3 p m r x m n e n r the number r can be identified by the cumulative variance percentages of dominant pcs and the f test shen et al 2014 feng et al 2022b any orthogonal transformation on eigenvector matrix e does not change the original ee t with the expectation of improving the distinguishability of decomposed components efa further rotates the pc and eigenvector matrix so that the absolute values of elements in each eigenvector toward 0 or 1 hence the rotated pcs can better reflect the importance of original variables unkel trendafilov 2010 to do that an orthogonal rotation matrix w w 1 w 2 w r is introduced in equation 1 to form the mathematical model of efa as 4 x m n p m r λ r r 1 2 w r r w r r t λ r r 1 2 e r n t f m r l r n where f p λ 1 2 w and the column of f represents an exploratory factor ef l w t λ 1 2 e t and its columns are called loading vectors once an appropriate rotation matrix w is given the efs and loading vectors can be uniquely determined to estimate the rotation matrix the varimax algorithm martinez and martinez 2005 unkel trendafllov 2010 was employed in this work consequently same as pcs efs are also a new set of uncorrelated synthetic factors finally what needs special explanation is that the purposes of using both pca and efa to process the driving factors are on the one hand to make the decomposed components as explainable as possible on the other hand to tap the multiple shared attributes of the driving factors from different perspectives 2 2 2 grey absolute correlation degree method given the unknown and usually complex functional form between the soil moisture and driving factors multivariate non parametric methods can be the better choice to deal with such a black box problem than multiple linear regression zhu et al 2022 therefore the grey absolute correlation degree method mei 1992 one of the representative algorithms in grey theory was used to estimate the crs of the synthetic factors to soil moisture change in this study we denote the time series of kth synthetic factor u k u k i i 1 2 m k 1 2 r and the time series of soil moisture in the hth layer y h y h i i 1 2 m h 1 2 4 where r and m are the numbers of synthetic factors and epochs respectively after the initialization and first order differential are performed for both time series of soil moisture and synthetic factor mei 1992 the correlation between them at each epoch is computed as 5 ε h k i 1 1 y h i u k i i 2 m note that the change rate of the first epoch is nonexistent so only m 1 epochs are considered then the absolute correlation degree can be derived as 6 r h k 1 m 1 j 2 m ε h k j therefore the cr of kth synthetic factor to the soil moisture change in the hth layer is computed with 7 c r h k r h k j 1 n r h j 100 2 2 3 lomb scargle periodogram the lomb scargle periodogram scargle 1982 a spectral analysis method applicable to both evenly and unevenly spaced data is employed to detect periodic signals in the time series of soil moisture denoting the time series of soil moisture as y the power spectra t y is then determined as 8 t y ω 1 2 i y i cos ω t i τ 2 i cos 2 ω t i τ i y i sin ω t i τ 2 i sin 2 ω t i τ where ω is frequency and τ is defined by 9 τ 1 2 ω tan 1 i sin 2 ω t i i cos 2 ω t i 2 2 4 correlation analysis pearson s correlation coefficient pr is used to quantitatively assess the correlation between the driving factor x and soil moisture y bi et al 2016 nagale et al 2022 which is defined as 10 pr i 1 m x i x y i y i 1 m x i x 2 i 1 m y i y 2 where x and y are the mean of two variables respectively m is the number of epochs the statistical significance level of pearson s correlation coefficient is assessed using student s t test qiu et al 2016 3 results and analysis 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristic analysis of soil moisture in the four layers four layers of shallow soil moisture from january 1990 to december 2020 were obtained from the gldas model and corresponding monthly average soil moisture contents are plotted in fig 2 as we can see from fig 2 a d the spatial patterns are basically consistent but the water content increases with the increase of soil depth for each layer the soil moisture contents in northern hebei and northern shanxi with poor precipitation and less agriculture are generally lower whereas they are higher in southern shanxi with abundant precipitation and the east central plain fig 1 with extensive agricultural activities which therefore highlights the unevenly spatial distribution of soil moisture in north china then the monthly average soil moisture content derived from esa cci is plotted in fig 2 e as a comparison clearly the surface soil moisture from two different sources matches well in terms of spatial distribution with a mean pr of 0 85 indicating that the gldas model is reliable in characterizing the soil moisture in north china to a large extent and can be used for subsequent analysis however limited by the penetration depth the soil moisture content derived from esa cci is much lower than that from gldas as expected in order to better characterize the dry and wet statuses of soil moisture the mean value of the whole study period was removed to derive the soil moisture anomaly sma where positive and negative values represent wetter and dryer than normal respectively pang et al 2020 feng et al 2022a by using the least squares harmonic analysis huang et al 2015 we estimated the long term trends of sma in the four layers from january 1990 to december 2020 respectively as shown in fig 3 the trends of the four layers are analogous in spatial distribution in which opposite change directions are presented in the northwest and southeast the soil drying area is located in the east central plain while the soil wetting areas are scattered in northern hebei northern beijing and western shanxi with varying upward trends comparing four layers the downward trend area extends from the east central plain to taihang mountains as the increase of soil depth correspondingly the upward trend area is continuously compressed suggesting that the deeper the soil the wider the range of soil moisture depletion subsequently the regional scale time series of sma is calculated as the weighted average of time series at all grid points within the region with the weight proportional to the area of the grid point sun et al 2010 huang et al 2015 as depicted in fig 4 a certain difference can be observed in the trends over different periods and thus we divided the whole study period into three stages and summarize corresponding trends in table 1 firstly the trends of sma in the last three layers increase from january 1990 to august 1996 and reach the peaks 3 03 cm 7 09 cm and 6 15 cm for the second third and bottom layers respectively in the final month which indicates this period is relatively wet then a sharp decrease occurs from september 1996 to july 2010 especially in the bottom layer whose downward rate reaches 0 226 0 018 cm yr indicating a climate shift from wet to dry during the last period from august 2010 to december 2020 four layers present upward trends with a mean rate of 0 080 0 020 cm yr which is consistent with the soil moisture change in the same latitude region of east asia kong et al 2019 and may benefit from the warming slowdown overall in the past three decades the surface sma manifests a subtle upward trend and is dominated by periodic oscillation which is contributed by some meteorological factors such as precipitation qiu et al 2016 li et al 2021 comparatively speaking sma in the last three layers present more sharp fluctuations coupled with long term trends and inter annual variations according to the power spectra calculated with the lomb scargle periodogram the surface sma is almost completely dominated by the annual cycle with a less obvious inter annual cycle of 4 3 yr which confirms the impact of meteorological factors such as precipitation and temperature on the surface sma as the soil depth increases the annual signal gradually weakens and the intra and inter annual cycles e g 0 5 4 3 and 7 3 yr become significant along with the long term trend the specific driving factors need further exploration but predictably more intra and inter annual variations suggest that sma in the last three layers are subject to more complex driving forces and the intensities acting on different layers by these driving factors must be different given the abundant annual intra and inter annual characteristics of sma fig 5 plots the time series of sma in the four layers at multiple time scales from fig 5 m p the monthly average time series roughly follow a horizontal s shaped curve except for the third layer this suggests that soil moisture depletes in the first half of the year namely before the onset of summer rain possibly because the evaporation enhances with the warming temperature during the first six months the variation ranges are 0 42 to 0 08 cm 0 59 to 0 02 cm 1 46 to 0 27 cm and 0 39 to 0 02 cm for the four layers respectively then the rainy season is arriving leading to the sharp increases of four layers until they reach the intra annual peaks 0 50 cm 0 66 cm 0 55 cm and 0 40 cm from the surface to bottom layers respectively in august or september then a reduction follows again but the reduction is relatively limited due to the accumulation of heavy rainfall it is worth noting that the rainy season in north china generally starts in june pang et al 2020 feng et al 2022a but due to the time delay of precipitation infiltration into each soil layer the transitions of soil moisture from the negative anomaly to positive anomaly are in june july august and august for the four layers from surface to bottom respectively accordingly the shallower soil moisture is more likely to benefit from precipitation while the deeper soil moisture is more difficult to be recharged from fig 5 q t four layers present negative anomalies in spring or spring and summer mainly because some crops in the mature stage from april to june require to absorb a lot of water and crop roots are more distributed in the deep soil at this stage yang et al 2010 jeong et al 2014 in addition four layers present a rapid decrease from autumn to winter which violate the normal condition that sma should be higher at this period due to the low temperature and weak solar radiation therefore sma change is inferred to be disturbed by human activities this inference can be further confirmed by fig 5 j k l where the maximums in the last three layers occurred in 1996 while the minimums occurred in different years indicating that the natural changes of soil moisture are destroyed by human activities in different time nodes 3 2 determination of the driving factors of sma change the above analysis reflects that sma change in north china is likely to be influenced by both natural and human type factors empirically the former can be briefly summarized as some climatic and environmental elements cheng huang 2016 li et al 2021 while the latter usually involves complex social activities such as agricultural irrigation industrial development domestic use etc qiu et al 2016 zhu et al 2022 which affect sma primarily by modifying the watershed hydrology processes moiwo tao 2014 sadeghi et al 2021 consequently twelve potential driving factors in terms of meteorological socioeconomic and land cover were selected to explore the cause of sma change including precipitation evaporation temperature wind speed specific humidity net radiation flux pop gdp agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land respectively firstly the spatial patterns of trends in the first eight potential factors were analyzed among which the wind speed and specific humidity decrease over most study areas while the rest of the factors are dominated by upward trends see more details in text s1 in the supporting information moreover changes in the last four potential factors were investigated through the land cover maps the results demonstrate that agricultural land and grassland are reduced from 1992 to 2020 while forest land presents a slightly increasing trend especially urban land expands dramatically with a growth rate of 343 17 and the water body therewith drops by 13 27 implying that land encroachment for urbanization accelerates the drying up of water resources the detailed land cover change in north china is described in text s2 in the supporting information subsequently we identified the driving factors by establishing the one to one correlation analysis with sma in the four layers bi et al 2016 gu et al 2019 feng et al 2022a during the study period the gridded data of pop and gdp are available for only several discrete years whereas the arithmetic sum time series over the region derived from the statistical yearbooks are complete considering the requirement for data continuity in the current analysis the correlation analysis was conducted from the perspective of time series to do that the area weighted average time series of the first six factors precipitation evaporation temperature wind speed specific humidity and net radiation flux and the arithmetic sum time series of the last four factors agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land over the entire region were calculated respectively meanwhile the missing data 1990 and 1991 in the time series of the last four factors were filled by the cubic spline interpolation method respectively huang et al 2015 feng et al 2022a in addition the monthly sma was resampled to yearly time series when performing correlation analysis with the last six factors eventually the prs were calculated and illustrated in fig 6 as we can see the prs range from 0 79 to 0 79 for the surface layer the prs with pop forest land and grassland pass the 90 confidence test while those with gdp agricultural land and urban land do not pass the confidence test the rest pass the 95 confidence test the high correlation levels with close magnitudes are concentrated in the first six factors indicating that the seasonal oscillation of the surface sma is mainly dominated by natural type factors for the second and third layers the prs are relatively uniform ranging from 0 32 to 0 44 all pass the 95 confidence test except that the prs with gdp agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land pass the 90 confidence test and 0 38 to 0 38 all pass the 95 confidence test respectively for the bottom layer the prs range from 0 52 to 0 54 with all passing the 95 confidence test except the pr with wind speed the correlation levels with human type factors are significantly improved suggesting the more intense response of bottom sma to human activities on the whole the factors positively correlated with sma change include precipitation specific humidity agricultural land forest land and grassland the remaining factors present negative correlations therefore we can conclude that the twelve selected factors are definitely the drivers of sma changes but with different impact degrees on the four layers furthermore we can see that the correlation levels between sma and natural type factors are gradually weakened as the increase of soil depth while the opposite correlation levels can be seen between sma and human type factors to explain this phenomenon we take precipitation and agricultural land as two examples precipitation can directly recharge surface soil moisture while it needs to undergo a complex infiltration process when recharging other layers since the rainwater will be partly absorbed by other hydrological exchange events such as the water closure from the vegetation root zone consequently the effective precipitation that actually flows to the deep soil is limited leading to a weak relationship with deep sma therefore the prs between precipitation and sma decrease from a significant level 0 79 in the surface layer to a weak level 0 22 in the bottom layer for the agricultural land in north china as well known crops require a lot of groundwater to be pumped for irrigation feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 and part of the irrigation water will flow back into the soil preferential flow down to 50 cm soil depth zheng et al 2019 and then pushing original stored water deeper down the soil profile where it is eventually discharged into the deep soil moisture or groundwater therefore there is a better correlation between agricultural land and the deep sma however it must be solemnly stated that the recharge at the expense of groundwater depletion is not a healthy way because as a result groundwater in north china is decreasing at an alarming rate cao et al 2013 feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 feng et al 2022a 3 3 contribution rates of the driving factors to sma change we determine twelve driving factors that are of good relevance to sma change however by conducting the one to one correlation assessments on every two factors the details are described in texts s3 in the supporting information we can clearly see that the absolute values of prs among the first six factors are mostly greater than 0 2 and those among the last six factors are all above 0 7 with all passing the 95 confidence test therefore to remove the redundant information produced by the interrelated driving factors pca and efa were respectively performed to derive the new uncorrelated synthetic factors i e pc and ef in pca the cumulative variance percentages of derived pcs are shown in fig 7 using the f test shen et al 2014 feng et al 2022b the first two pcs contain about 82 of the total variance which are dominant and sufficiently represent the required information we plot the time series of two pcs in fig 8 in which pc1 presents a significant long term trend while more periodic oscillations in pc2 besides both pc1 and pc2 present dramatic changes from 1998 to 2000 which are somewhat similar to the change in the sma time series subsequently in efa the first two pcs were used to further resolve two efs and the time series are also plotted in fig 8 from which we can see that ef1 and ef2 present completely opposite changes and without obvious periodic characteristics suggesting that efa reintegrates all factors into two competitively synthetic factors compared the pcs and efs the former emphasizes more on depicting the hidden periodic information of the original variables although the total variance of the two efs remains the same after a special orthogonal transformation their distinguishability is significantly enhanced theoretically pca efa establishes a linear relationship between the original factor and pc ef via the eigenvector loading vector that is to say the eigenvector loading vector reflects the contribution of the original factor to pc ef therefore we can attempt to explain the actual meaning of pc ef by dissecting the permutation features of elements within each column of the eigenvector loading vector according to the first two eigenvectors and loading vectors in table 2 the last six factors pop gdp agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land corresponding to the most significant contributions in the first eigenvector dominate the change of pc1 meanwhile an obvious attribute shared by the six factors is that they all belong to the category of human activities thus pc1 can be reasonably designated as the human factor similarly pc2 is designated as the natural factor for the loading vectors four factors including precipitation specific humidity forest land and grassland possess the maximum contributions in the first loading vector which undoubtedly dominate the change of ef1 considering that the four factors are all positively correlated with sma change we thus designate ef1 as the positive factor similarly ef2 is designated as the negative factor therefore reintegrating the driving factors into the uncorrelated synthetic factors is essentially the induction for their shared attributes and the shared attributes are clearly not unique finally the crs of pca based efa based synthetic factors to sma change were calculated and displayed in fig 9 from fig 9 a human factor respectively accounts for 44 87 48 54 48 58 and 55 85 of crs to the changes of sma in the four layers indicating an increasing impact from surface to bottom layer on the contrary the impacts of natural factors on the changes of four layers gradually weaken with the crs of 55 13 51 46 51 42 and 44 15 respectively it is worth mentioning that the allocations of crs in fig 9 a are consistent with the changes of prs in fig 6 both of which highlight the importance of the human driving force for deep sma and the natural driving force for the surface sma from fig 9 b the crs of positive factor to sma changes are 57 98 55 07 54 65 and 46 51 from the surface to bottom layer respectively while the crs of negative factor are 42 02 44 93 45 35 and 53 49 respectively therefore the driving forces of the positive factor to sma in the first three layers are stronger than that of the negative factor the former gradually weakens as the increase of soil depth but the latter gradually enlarges and eventually is larger than the former in the bottom layer also the results well confirmed the change of long term trends in sma table 1 that is the drying trend intensifies as the increase of soil depth 4 discussion 4 1 driving mechanism analysis for sma change from fig 3 and table s2 sma change in north china is heterogeneous both spatially and temporally which depends largely on the behaviors of driving factors therefore we expect to reveal the driving mechanism for sma change based on the long term trends of the driving factors firstly according to fig 3 the spatial pattern of sma can be characterized in three sub regions with the most significant variations in western shanxi although evaporation intensifies with the increase of net radiation flux and temperature fig s1 sma shows a weak upward trend due to the significant increase of precipitation indicating that precipitation dominates the final status of sma change in the east central plain the increased temperature and wind speed intensify the evaporation coupled with the reduced precipitation and specific humidity fig s1 cooperatively resulting in a significant decrease of sma over this sub region thus warming temperature amplifies the effect of reduced precipitation and specific humidity on sma by intensifying evaporation indicating that soil drying is induced by insufficient precipitation and exacerbated by warming temperature jia et al 2018 also drew a similar conclusion in analyzing the soil moisture in china however sma change is not solely driven by natural type factors in north china the rapidly expanding urbanization continuously compresses the agricultural land fig s2 and table s2 reducing the irrigation water that flows back into the soil which greatly affects the recharge of soil moisture in northern hebei although the temperature evaporation and net radiation flux increase and the precipitation reduces the sma trend is completely opposite to that in the east central plain which is attributed to the expansion of forest land in this sub region fig s2 as we all know dense vegetation can enhance soil moisture retention and thus accelerate the recovery of soil moisture moiwo tao 2014 therefore it demonstrates that more water efficient land uses can ensure the sustainability and availability of water resources subsequently according to the divided sub periods in table 1 we further estimated the trends of the time series of twelve factors table 3 comparing tables 1 and 3 sma increases from january 1990 to august 1996 which is mainly attributed to increased precipitation and forest land as well as weakened evaporation from september 1996 to july 2010 precipitation maintains an increasing trend even so sma decreases rapidly due to the sharp intensification of evaporation and reductions of specific humidity agricultural land and grassland squeezed by the expansion of urbanization confirming that the intensified evaporation largely suppresses the impact of precipitation in addition the increase of sma from august 2010 to december 2020 mainly benefits from the increasing specific humidity and decreasing wind speed and net radiation flux throughout the whole study period although the precipitation is relatively abundant the increase of solar radiation and temperature induces the intensification of evaporation meanwhile human activities drive the land cover toward a change direction that is unfavorable to the storage of soil moisture under such circumstances sma suffers the threat of severe depletion which undoubtedly increases the risk of potential agricultural drought nigatu et al 2022 cao et al 2022 to sum up the drying wetting trend of sma in north china matches well with the trend of driving factors both spatially and temporally indicating that the twelve factors jointly dominate the rise and fall of sma at different geographical locations and periods 4 2 similarities and discrepancies among sma in the four layers from figs 2 and 3 the water contents and long term trends of the four layers are similar in terms of spatial distribution pattern however the magnitudes are far different which increase in multiples from the surface to the bottom layer the reasons on the one hand are largely attributed to the different thicknesses of aquifers simulated by the gldas model on the other hand different soil properties also have a great impact such as the soil type and porosity that will directly determine the water storage capacity drusch et al 2007 zheng et al 2019 last but not least the intensities of driving factors acting on four layers are distinct figs 6 and 9 which ultimately leads to differences in trend magnitude and periodic information 4 3 implications for future soil moisture management the current development of soil moisture in north china is clearly unsustainable due to the negative effects of climate change and unreasonable human activities and its full recovery undoubtedly requires a prolonged process nevertheless improving water conditions to achieve a new balance over a relatively short period can be considered sufficiently sustainable cao et al 2013 zhu et al 2022 based on the research results we can draw some important implications on the one hand the contribution rates can be estimated more accurately when more comprehensive driving factors are considered meanwhile the newly derived driving factors especially the human type factors such as pop and gdp can be added as the input parameters in the establishment of future hydrological models which is conducive to improving the accuracy however it is hard to consider all human activities at once further investigations are required to thoroughly reveal the impact of human activities on soil moisture change on the other hand targeted regulation strategies can be established to alleviate soil moisture depletion firstly inspired by figs 2 3 and s1 increasing input ways for water resources to alleviate the stress on precipitation such as augmenting the route and water volume of the south to north water diversion project especially the dry center i e the east central plain should be given priority in water allocation next inspired by fig 5 soil moisture shows negative anomalies in spring and summer which is closely related to the water requirements of crops substantial reduction in crop area is impractical and conflicts with the current status in china cao et al 2013 also a subversive adjustment in agricultural crop rotation is very difficult jeong et al 2014 therefore improving the efficiency of water use is a relatively simple and feasible method for example loose soil in autumn to store the heavy rainfall in the deep soil so as to get more supply in spring and summer finally inspired by figs s1 and s2 employing effective cultivation techniques to inhibit evaporation such as greenhouse farming on the other hand adjusting the land cover structure and promoting afforestation and grass planting in addition promoting the recycling of domestic water except drinking water 5 conclusions in this study the gldas model is used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of sma in the four layers in north china over the period from january 1990 to december 2020 the driving factors of sma change and mechanisms are determined together with meteorological socioeconomic and land cover data on the whole sma in the last three layers shows downward trends and the magnitudes are aggravated by the increasing soil depth a significant soil drying center is concentrated in the east central plain while relatively wet areas are scattered in western shanxi and northern hebei annual intra and inter annual cycles 1 0 0 5 4 3 and 7 3 yr jointly dominate the frequency domains of four layers implying a combined impact of natural and human activities on sma change subsequently twelve driving factors that certainly correlated with sma change are identified including six natural type factors precipitation evaporation temperature wind speed specific humidity net radiation flux and six human type factors pop gdp agricultural land forest land grassland and urban land as the soil depth increases the correlation levels between sma and natural type factors are gradually weakened while the opposite scene is for the human type factors indicating the more intense impact of human activities on deep layers furthermore the drying and wetting trends of sma respond well to the trends of driving factors both spatially and temporally indicating that twelve factors jointly dominate the rise and fall of sma at different geographical locations and periods especially the intensified evaporation induced by warming temperatures and other causes largely suppresses the recharge of precipitation on sma urban land increases dramatically with a growth rate of 343 17 which is the ringleader that accelerates the drying up of sma in north china to remove the redundant information among the driving factors pca and efa are respectively used to extract shared attributes of the factors to derive the uncorrelated synthetic factors and their crs are further determined in conjunction with the grey absolute correlation degree according to pca based synthetic factors crs to sma changes from human factor account for 44 87 48 54 48 58 and 55 85 from surface to bottom layer while those from natural factor account for 55 13 51 46 51 42 and 44 15 indicating that human factor outperforms natural factor in controlling the change of bottom sma according to efa based synthetic factors crs to sma changes from positive factor are 57 98 55 07 54 65 and 46 51 from surface to bottom layer while those from negative factor are 42 02 44 93 45 35 and 53 49 demonstrating that the deep soil moisture depletion is more serious as well as more difficult to recharge it is worth emphasizing that our sma change investigation with considering four soil aquifers separately can capture the otherness more accurately and further make up for the cognitive deviation of water resources in north china in contrast to studies that only focus on the surface layer or regard all layers as a whole especially we clearly recognize that soil moisture depletion at the depth of 100 200 cm is more severe and harder to be recharged furthermore we pioneer the combination of several data analysis methods to accurately identify the hidden driving factors and contributions so as to excavate much valuable information particularly important human activities and evaporation are respectively mainly responsible for the depletion of bottom and shallower aquifers the current situation of soil moisture especially the deep layers in north china is less optimistic consequently to alleviate soil moisture depletion it is highly recommended to attach more attention to human type driving factors this study provides a scientific reference for establishing targeted regulation policies and finally

2143,since the launch of soil moisture active passive smap mission in 2015 several advanced global surface soil moisture sm products derived from different retrieval schemes have been released however the factors contributing to the performance differences of these smap products have not been fully investigated this study tries to fill the gap by assessing and intercomparing five smap products namely the single channel algorithm v h pol sca v h dual channel algorithm dca multi temporal dual channel algorithm mt dca and the new smap inrae bordeaux smap ib using the international soil moisture network ismn ground measurements worldwide during 2016 2020 after reviewing the retrieval algorithms the impact of five potential perturbing factors on the skills of all products is reported these factors including mean surface soil temperature msst surface roughness log sr vegetation density characterized by vegetation optical depth vod mean surface soil wetness mssm and soil organic matter som results shows that the smap ib product has the highest overall r value of 0 75 with ismn ground sm and the smallest unbiased root mean square difference ubrmsd values same as sca v and dca 0 058 m3 m3 the performance of all five products in terms of r and ubrmsd rapidly degrades over the regions with high vod rough surface and low msst in contradiction with the fact that product performance degrades with increasing roughness the ubrmsd of all five products increases with decreasing log sr on a relatively smooth surface log sr 6 with larger growth rates for smap ib sca h and mt dca regarding characterizing the temporal variations of in situ sm anomalies r anom r anom increases as the ground becomes wet for all products within a certain range mssm 0 3 m3 m3 in particular smap ib and mt dca present higher r anom values than the other three products under wet soil surfaces mssm 0 3 m3 m3 the two metrics r and r anom decrease significantly with increasing som for smap ib compared to the other products and smap ib obtains the lowest values for both metrics when som 20 these findings are expected to provide useful information for appropriate product selection and improvement keywords smap soil moisture assessment dca sca v h mt dca smap ib data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture sm which represents the water content in the upper soil layer is a key state variable in the climate system and the terrestrial hydrologic cycle koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 sm directly controls the balance of water and energy on the earth miralles et al 2014 li et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2020 thus accurate global sm mapping is essential to better understand the variability of climate change e g the occurrence of rainfall events tuttle and salvucci 2016 and the variability of air temperature wigneron et al 2017 schwingshackl et al 2017 in addition it will also promote the applications of these environment variables in agriculture li et al 2020 weather predictions wigneron et al 2021 and drought monitoring carrao et al 2016 passive microwave remote sensing at l band 1 4 ghz is regarded as the most promising tool for monitoring sm at both regional and global scales entekhabi et al 2010 wigneron et al 2017 due to its capability of all weather sensing and penetrating moderate vegetation high sensitivity to soil dielectric constant and frequent revisiting time kerr et al 2012 kurum 2013 the soil moisture active passive smap mission launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa on january 31 2015 is the latest space borne l band mission entekhabi et al 2010 smap was designed to provide global high resolution sm and freeze thaw state using a radar and a radiometer every two or three days chan et al 2016 derksen et al 2017 however the radar stopped working after 11 weeks of operation due to unrecoverable hardware failure despite this setback the remaining smap radiometer functioned well as expected collecting high quality brightness temperature tb data which has been used to produce a variety of sm products including swath based the standard level 2 and daily composite level 3 version initially these official smap passive sm products were retrieved based on the single channel algorithm at the vertical polarization sca v which was selected as the baseline algorithm of smap o neill et al 2021a chan et al 2016 sca v only retrieves sm while vegetation optical depth vod a parameter characterizing vegetation extinction effects is used as an auxiliary input for sm inversions and estimated from climatological data of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi since vod is regarded as a good proxy for monitoring aboveground biomass feng et al 2023 frappart et al 2020 li et al 2021 qin et al 2021 tong et al 2020 and direct vod inversion can mitigate the propagation of uncertainty to the sm retrievals due to the introduction of additional auxiliary data li et al 2022 chaubell et al 2020 the dual channel algorithm dca seems to be a more ideal approach gao et al 2021 compared to 1 parameter retrieval of sca v the dca which requires both h pol and v pol tbs as input can achieve 2 parameter retrieval of both sm and vod by a nonlinear least squares iteration to date several improved dca algorithms have been developed for obtaining sm and vod from the smap data for instance by assuming that vod remains relatively constant over a time window 7 days konings et al 2016 konings et al 2017 proposes a multi temporal dual channel algorithm mt dca that can retrieve single scattering albedo sm and vod simultaneously differently a modified dca mdca algorithm has also been developed to enhance the cost function by adding a regularization term with respect to vod o neill et al 2021a chaubell et al 2020 in addition a new parameterization scheme with updated parameters of surface roughness and single scattering albedo is also implemented in the mdca algorithm chaubell et al 2020 this new version of dca hereafter we use dca to refer to mdca to be consistent with smap atbd algorithm theoretical basis documents which replaces sca v has now been used as the baseline algorithm to routinely generate official smap sm products o neill et al 2021a the validation and assessment activities have been ongoing since the first release of the smap sm products these activities are of great importance for the refinement and promotion of the smap sm data and their potential use in the domain of natural disasters climate and hydrology chan et al 2016 fan et al 2022 wang et al 2022 currently several approaches including field campaigns colliander et al 2015 sparse and dense networks chan et al 2018 ayres et al 2021 ma et al 2019 colliander et al 2022 core validation sites cvss colliander et al 2017 and intercomparisons among satellites and land surface model lsm simulations bai et al 2019 dong et al 2018 have been used for evaluation of smap sm products for instance chan et al 2016 have evaluated the smap l2 sm products using in situ data from cvss and sparse networks over six months and found that sca v delivered the lowest ubrmse unbiased root mean square error value of 0 038 m3 m3 reaching the smap mission requirement of 0 04 m3 m3 colliander et al 2017 have validated the performance of the smap enhanced l2 morning product based on cvss and confirmed the practicality of the smap cal val program based on lsm outputs and tca triple collocation analysis method dong et al 2018 have found the vod values obtained in smap sca based on vegetation water content data from modis ndvi climatology may fail to capture the real time dynamics of vod which in turn introduces uncertainty to sm retrievals this signature of the smap sca is also evidenced by gao et al 2020a b and zwieback et al 2018 more recently improved or comparable performance of the modified dca sm product relative to sca v has also been demonstrated colliander et al 2022 gao et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 li et al 2022 however most of the existing assessment efforts are generally limited to examining the inherent skill scores of various sm products with little attention paid to analyzing how the performance of different products varies with environmental factors for example ma et al 2019 has evaluated the effects of several perturbing factors on sm products from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos smap the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 and the climate change initiative cci but they have ignored the possible impact of different sensor footprints and overpass times on this investigation fan et al 2022 al yaari et al 2019 considering that assessing the impact of these environmental factors is undoubtedly paramount to improving sm retrieval algorithms and thus promoting relevant products it further raises the question which aspects of the performance of each product are more relevant to these environmental factors for example to capture temporal variations of surface sm or absolute value etc given that the underlying microwave emission observations are the same for the aforementioned smap algorithms an exciting opportunity is now available to evaluate the impact of algorithms on the resulting smap sm products after excluding different sensor effects moreover since the rapid development of sm retrieval algorithms some newly released sm products e g new versions or new retrieval schemes have not been fully evaluated and intercompared one such new product is the smap ib sm product which was recently developed by inrae bordeaux li et al 2022 in addition its product in ascending orbit 06 00 pm local time has only recently been released and thus its performance has never been evaluated to fill these gaps the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of different environmental factors on the performance of the five smap products including sca v sca h sca with h pol tb as input dca mt dca and smap ib and try to answer above questions this is achieved by providing an intercomparison between smap l3 radiometer global daily sm products mt dca as well as the smap ib sm products in both ascending and descending 06 00 am between 2016 and 2020 using ground based surface sm measurements from ismn international soil moisture network dorigo et al 2021 while the retrieval algorithms for these smap sm products are all based on the 0th order radiative transfer equation gao et al 2021 o neill et al 2021a they apply different approaches to determine the physical soil temperature surface roughness effects and vegetation parameters see also table 1 for details considering these we accordingly investigate the impact of potential perturbing factors related to them on the sm retrievals which are mean surface soil temperature msst surface roughness log sr and vod in addition given the documented significant impact of soil organic matter som content on sm retrieval li et al 2022 manns et al 2017 wigneron et al 2021 and the high sensitivity of soil dielectric constant to soil moisture zhang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 the effects regarding these two aspects are also included in the analysis this paper is structured as follows a brief introduction to materials and methods are presented in sections 2 and 3 respectively sections 4 shows the results and discussion finally conclusions are described in section 5 2 datasets 2 1 smap sm products five sm products derived from sca v sca h dca mt dca and smap ib covering the period from 2016 to 2020 are collected in this study among them the first three are extracted directly from the smap l3 radiometer daily sm product spl3smp version 8 o neill et al 2021 while the smap ib version 1 and mt dca products version 5 are obtained from https ib remote sensing inrae fr and https afeldman mit edu mt dca data respectively all five sm products are projected on a global equal area scalable earth grid version 2 ease grid 2 0 with a spatial resolution of 36 km spl3smp and smap ib are available from both ascending pm and descending am orbits while mt dca currently only has data from descending orbit all five algorithms products are based on the 0th order radiative transfer equation τ ω model to simulate microwave tb emission from the land surfaces mo et al 1982 with a similar dielectric mixing model table 1 the main differences among these sm retrieval algorithms are i the retrieval method and ii the parameterization scheme considering effective soil and vegetation temperatures soil roughness effects and vegetation parameters i e τ and ω for instance both sca v and sca h are 1 parameter retrieval algorithms only sm with single channel input while dca mt dca and smap ib are 2 parameter retrievals i e sm and vod with dual polarized or and multi temporal tb information as input while most other smap products sca v sca h dca and mt dca apply geos 5 goddard earth observing system model version 5 soil temperature outputs smap ib uses soil temperatures from era5 ecmwf reanalysis version 5 in addition although all five retrieval algorithms apply h q n to account for roughness effects dca and smap ib adopt roughness parameter i e hr calibrated by chaubell et al 2020 and fernandez moran et al 2017 respectively while the sca algorithm is preset based on igbp full details about these retrieval algorithms can be found in o neill et al 2021a and chaubell et al 2020 for sca v sca h and dca koning et al 2016 2017 for mt dca and li et al 2022 for smap ib 2 2 ismn ground based sm in situ observations from the ismn are used to assess the five smap products we select this dataset as a reference because it has been widely utilized to evaluate satellite sm products bai et al 2019 ma et al 2019 li et al 2020 gao et al 2021 the ismn is an international collaboration to establish a global database of in situ sm observations which is an important means of calibrating evaluating as well as improving satellite and land surface modelling sm products dorigo et al 2021 the ismn now hosts about 72 networks mainly distributed over the united states canada europe and china and is freely available at https ismn geo tuwien ac at notably ismn provides not only in situ sm data but also surface soil temperature sst measurements in present study only ground sm data observed in the 0 5 cm layer between 2016 and 2020 are applied it should be realized that there is an unavoidable spatial resolution mismatch between point scale in situ observations and grid scale satellite footprints especially when the number of field stations within a pixel footprint is small al yaari et al 2019 li et al 2022 gruber et al 2020 to alleviate the spatial mismatch between them we spatially average the high quality field measurements from the same network within a pixel according to the flags provided by the ismn and then compared them with the satellite retrievals of the corresponding pixel li et al 2022 gao et al 2021 crow et al 2012 as a results 412 sites from 19 networks table s1 are kept and their sst measurements are also collected which is shown in fig 1 with an igbp land cover classification map as the background 2 3 additional datasets the 25 km smos vod fig s1 retrieved from the smos ic version 2 algorithm wigneron et al 2021 is used to assess the skill of the five smap sm retrievals under different vegetation conditions li et al 2022 we select this data because it is independent of the smap products evaluated in this study the global multi resolution terrain elevation data gmted dem is applied to assess the impact of relative surface roughness on the sm inversion at the satellite grid scale as done in kim et al 2015 and li et al 2022 the surface roughness at coarse resolution 36 km is calculated based on the variance of all 1296 1 km dem cells within the satellite pixel li et al 2022 choudhury et al 1979 furthermore the global percentage of soil organic matter som converted from the soil organic carbon content provided by the soilgrid250m project hengl et al 2017 is used to investigate the effect of som on the skill scores of the five smap sm retrievals the global precipitation measurement gpm l3 product provides the daily rainfall data for this study huffman et al 2019 all these auxiliary data are finally aggregated to 36 km to be consistent with the spatial resolution of smap 3 methodology four conventional statistical metrics are used to evaluate the sm products entekhabi et al 2010 including pearson correlation coefficient r eq 1 bias m3 m3 eq 2 root mean square difference rmsd m3 m3 eq 3 and unbiased rmsd ubrmsd m3 m3 eq 4 due to the spatial mismatch between in situ measurements and satellite retrievals the two bias insensitive metrics r and ubrmsd which are less impacted by representativeness errors than rmsd and bias al yaari et al 2014 xing et al 2021 are considered as the first order criteria in this study 1 r 1 θ est θ ref 2 θ est e θ ref 2 2 bias e θ est e θ ref 3 rmsd e θ est θ ref 2 4 ubrmsd rmsd 2 bias 2 where θ est is the smap sm estimates θ ref is the in situ measurements used as reference e denotes the arithmetic mean of the data considering that seasonal effects can invisibly increase the correlation between two time series we also compute monthly anomalous time series as done in al yaari et al 2014 to explore the ability of these smap sm products in capturing the variability of short term in situ data therefore the above metrics are calculated not only for the original sm values expressed in volumetric units m3 m3 but also the sm anomalies for the r metric only it is important to note that while the representativeness errors in field measurements may affect the absolute values of the metrics al yaari et al 2019 gruber et al 2020 and decay the ability to detect differences between the products to some extent the analysis in this study is comparative in nature and tends to convey information about relative pros and cons of each algorithmic product to obtain reliable evaluation results several criteria are considered i all products undergo strict data filtering according to their respective flags to remove spurious retrievals caused by frozen soil and water fraction etc zhang et al 2019 ii only in situ data within a maximum time lag of 1 h matching the smap am and pm overpass times are retained li et al 2022 iii only stations with at least 31 1 month valid observations from 2016 to 2020 are kept to ensure robust statistics zeng et al 2022 iv only the same stations that have valid calculated scores for all sm products are retained for fair comparison to investigate the differences between the scores obtained for the five products or between that of the am and pm retrievals from the same algorithm we also show p values from paired samples t tests to check the statistical significance of rejecting the null hypothesis that the means of the two groups of indicators are the same finally five potential environmental factors e g msst vod mean surface soil moisture mssm log sr and som affecting the sm retrievals are investigated by plotting the above error scores as a function of these factors respectively moreover for ease of interpretation a robust local regression approach is used to smooth the data see section 4 2 which relies on weighted linear least squares li et al 2022 with a span of 50 4 results and discussion in this section we first focus on the evaluation of the overall performance of the five products which involves a comparison between am and pm of the same product and between different retrieval products for the former case no study has yet evaluated the latest smap ib pm products li et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 then the impacts of five potential perturbing factors on these smap sm products and the sensitivity of the validated error metrics to them are investigated separately 4 1 overall performances 4 1 1 am products vs pm products fig 2 illustrates the overall performance i e r ranom ubrmsd bias and rmsd of each product in terms of both am and pm observations in general am products exhibit better performance than pm products due to better soil canopy thermal equilibrium conditions as revealed by chan et al 2018 however for the smap official products i e sca v sca h and dca all the indicator values obtained by pm observations are similar to those obtained by am observations except for ranom the skill of am observations is better than that of pm the former case is in line with the recent evaluation study of fan et al 2022 using in situ data from smap cvss which found that high version v7 of official smap sm products have comparable or even better performance in the pm orbit than in the am orbit the possible reason for this conflicting expectation is that vegetation is more transparent i e lower vegetation water content due to stronger water stress during the daytime wang et al 2023 resulting in less effect of vegetation on emission attenuation from soils which has yielded similar results in some previous work brocca et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 regarding the smap ib its sm retrievals obtained during the am orbit always perform better than those obtained during the pm orbit for all metrics except for ubrmsd which has close values between am and pm fig 2 note that large p value of the t test means that the null hypothesis i e the mean of the two sets of scores is the same is difficult to reject the results in table 2 also confirm these findings the t test p values for most indicators between the pm and am retrievals of smap ib are less than the 5 level of significance whereas the official smap products all exceed this level nevertheless smap ib pm sm products are found to obtain higher r values compared to sca v dca and sca h as there are no pm products available for mt dca we focus only on the analysis of am observation in the following intercomparisons 4 1 2 assessment results between different retrieval algorithms as conducted in previous evaluation studies bai et al 2019 xing et al 2021 the median and standard deviation std values of all error statistics are calculated in table 2 to compare the statistical significance between the indicators obtained for the different products we perform t test between each two of them fig 3 with respect to capturing the temporal trends of in situ sm by presenting the highest overall r of 0 75 smap ib outperforms the four other sm retrievals followed by mt dca sca v and dca which has close non significant difference r values of 0 68 among these five smap sm products sca h shows the lowest r of 0 62 the same r value between dca and sca v verifies the performance of the modified version of dca ayres et al 2021 colliander et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 however the correlation values obtained by sm anomaly i e ranom decrease for all five products with the ranom value of smap ib being imperceptibly better than that of other products regarding catching the absolute value of ground sm the first tier better performance fig 3 products are sca v dca and smap ib with ubrmsd values ranging from 0 057 to 0 060 m3 m3 among which dca is the lowest it is then followed by sca h with an ubrmsd of 0 062 m3 m3 which is better than mt dca ubrmsd 0 069 m3 m3 in terms of bias sca v dca and smap ib are found to have smaller bias values than the other smap sm retrievals with absolute values 0 01 m3 m3 although both mt dca and sca h show the same signs of underestimation of in situ sm data sca h is found to be more pronounced with a median bias of 0 045 m3 m3 dca sca v and smap ib are found to have similar performance in the rmsd metric with values between 0 076 and 0 081 m3 m3 which are all smaller than sca h and mt dca with similar rmsd values 0 091 m3 m3 fig 4 shows the temporal series of the five smap sm retrievals over several sites with contrasting land cover types in general all five products can track very well the dry down variations of the ground sm measurements even over mixed forest sites in europe fig 4c this suggests the potential for smap to obtain sm retrievals in forested areas which is in line with the evaluation efforts of ayres et al 2021 and li et al 2022 all products are found to perform better in dry periods than in wet periods both in terms of capturing temporal changes and absolutes value of in situ sm data and they all tend to overestimate in situ observations during the rainy season fig 4b e large differences between the five smap sm products can be found over the evergreen needleleaf forest site in the usa where sca h is closer to in situ observations while the other products are more discrete fig 4b at the cropland natural vegetation mosaic station in africa smap ib and mt dca are found to overlap very well with in situ observations while the official smap products i e sca v and dca slightly overestimate field measurements even during the dry season fig 4f our evaluation results show that different products have inconsistent performance both from the overall scores obtained over the ismn sites table 2 and from the local site analysis fig 4 considering the main differences between the retrieval algorithms of these five smap sm products listed in table 1 we analyze below the impact of the five environmental factors associated with them which are msst vod log sr som and mssm 4 2 impact of different environmental factors 4 2 1 vegetation density fig 5 shows the statistical scores between the five smap sm products and in situ measurements as a function of vod similar patterns are found in the performance of the five smap sm retrievals for ranom ubrmsd bias and rmsd scores although with different absolute values and sensitivities fig 5 for instance the ranom of all five sm retrievals increase first and then decreases sharply with increasing vod and they all have maximum ranom values around vod 0 15 differently their ubrmsd increases strongly with vod with the steepest increase occurring at vod 0 05 0 15 regarding correlation smap ib presents obviously higher r values than other products especially at moderate vod levels 0 2 0 5 but this lead diminishes gradually with increasing vod mt dca performs better than the official smap products mainly in vod 0 3 while dca leads when vod is beyond this range interestingly it is found that dca obtains improved r values compared to sca v when vod 0 4 which may be due to the direct retrieval of vod by dca mitigating the uncertainty of obtaining vod from auxiliary data gao et al 2022 correspondingly its ranom value is also higher in this vod range but it has the lowest ranom among the five products in terms of low vod level the rate of decrease in the smap ib ranom vod relationship is the highest when vod increases above 0 4 however when it comes to ubrmsd smap ib is almost similar to sca v while dca is found to have the highest rate of increase at this vod level vod 0 4 although its ubrmsd value is still lower than that of mt dca fig 5c the r and ubrmsd indicators for dca fig 5a c compared to sca v have the opposite signature when vod 0 4 suggesting that different metrics have different sensitivities to individual environmental factors wigneron et al 2021 xing et al 2021 see section 4 3 while fig 5 in fact shows the total result for the effects of all factors categorized by vod the absolute bias in the sca h is greater than that for the other four retrievals especially at the lower vod range vod 0 3 however this signature is obtained by dca at high vod values where all products tend to overestimate the in situ measurements all of these are also generally found in the rmsd indicator 4 2 2 surface roughness with respect to log sr the best r skill for all five smap sm retrievals is found near log sr 6 which is generally the case for ranmo and ubrmsd fig 6 a b c all three of these indicators i e r ranom and ubrmsd degrade dramatically as the surface becomes rougher this may be due to the fact that increasing the surface roughness leads to an increase in the measured tb and reduces the sensitivity of l band observations to sm wigneron et al 2001 it is found that the r differences between mt dca dca and sca v caused by log sr changes are not significant although mt dca has a slight advantage when log sr 6 moreover the r values of these three products are sandwiched between sca h with a low r value and smap ib with a high r value fig 6a surprisingly the ubrmsd values of all the five smap sm products are found to be higher on relatively smooth surfaces log sr 6 and smap ib sca h and mt dca have a larger increase rate vs log sr compared to dca and sca v the former result may be due to the fact that all the five sm products do not currently consider temporal changes in surface roughness especially for agricultural areas o neill et al 2021a parrens et al 2016 fernandez moran et al 2017 since sites with log sr 6 are mainly covered by croplands figs s1 and s2 the calibration of the smap algorithms in agricultural sites has been a key focus of smap s field campaigns for example the south fork iowa and carman manitoba sites in the 2016 smap validation experiment smapvex16 mcnairn et al 2017 based on these studies the improvements in the official smap products i e dca and sac v compared to the other three can be partially explained by the updated roughness parameters chaubell et al 2020 o neill et al 2021a sca v and dca present lower ubrmsd values than the other three products when log sr 10 while mt dca has the highest ubrmsd values for different log sr ranges accordingly dca and sca v mt dca also have the lowest highest rmsd values followed by smap ib fig 6e the bias of sca v dca and smap ib hover around bias 0 m3 m3 as the surface became rougher while sca h consistently underestimates the in situ observations 4 2 3 soil wetness interestingly all five smap sm retrievals show higher r values on moderately wet soil surfaces mssm 0 25 m3 m3 than on relatively dry soil surfaces mssm 0 1 m3 m3 and their r values are all decreasing sharply on wetter soil surfaces mssm 0 25 m3 m3 with smap ib having the highest r values fig 7 a these sites are generally covered by deciduous broadleaf forest mixed forests croplands or cropland natural vegetation mosaics fig s3 dca has lower r values than sca v under dry conditions which are both lower than mt dca but when the surface becomes wet dca can reach comparable r values to mt dca there are clear different patterns in ranom score between the five products especially on wet soil surfaces mssm 0 3 m3 m3 where smap ib has the highest ranom values followed by mt dca fig 7b this may be due to the fact that both smap ib li et al 2022 and mt dca konings et al 2017 apply time constrained regularization methods for vod in their cost functions which can reduce both short term sm and vod retrieval errors as revealed by feldman et al 2021 except for mt dca which has a higher ubrmsd value it is difficult to find differences in the ubrmsd mssm relationship between the other four products when sm 0 15 m3 m3 corresponding mainly to grasslands shrublands and barren lands in addition the performance of the five smap products under different vegetation types fig s3 show that smap ib has the lowest ubrmsd values mainly in forested types compared to the other products namely evergreen needleleaf forest evergreen broadleaf forest and mixed forests however the rate of increase in ubrmsd vs mssm for sca h and smap ib is largest in wet conditions where the ubrmsd value of sca h has exceeded that of mt dca this implies that the sm retrievals in forested areas will not necessarily have a lower accuracy than in non forested areas as revealed by ayres et al 2021 these results show it is interesting to combine surface dry wet conditions and land cover types for sm assessment all five smap products tend to underestimate the ground sm data as soil surfaces become wetter with mt dca obtaining the largest bias values and drop rates correspondingly mt dca also has the largest rmsd values and growth rates when mssm 0 25 m3 m3 dca and sca v are found to exhibit the lowest rmsd values on relatively wetter soil surfaces fig 7e 4 2 4 soil organic matter regarding som the skills of all five smap sm retrievals in terms of r ranom and ubrmsd degrade to some extent with increasing som fig 8 a c this may be due to the fact that none of the five smap algorithms currently considers the special soil dielectric properties due to the presence of som and they all use the clay based mironov soil dielectric model table 1 li et al 2022 o neill et al 2021a this is in line with the previous assessment results of older version of official smap sm products zhang et al 2019 but we show that this is the case for all five smap sm products evaluated in this study this implies that it is worth testing the som based soil dielectric model in all five sm retrieval algorithms as such a model has been released mironov et al 2019 by presenting the largest drop rate smap ib shows the lowest r values at som 20 while the difference between the official smap sm products is not significant correspondingly the r value obtained for its sm anomaly i e ranom in this som range is also lower than that of other products followed by sca h the degraded performance of smap ib in this respect compared to other products can be partly explained by the fact that the multi temporal retrieval scheme it applies is susceptible to disruptions during freezing periods in northern hemisphere regions li et al 2022 wigneron et al 2021 where som values are generally high fig s1 the ranom of mt dca has a lower decrease rate compared to other products when som increases but its absolute value is still lower than that of dca and sca v all five products show a sharp increase in ubrmsd in the range of som of 0 5 while the ubrmsd of all products does not appear to increase significantly when som exceeds 10 it is found that the ubrmsd values of mt dca are obviously larger than those of other products with increasing som regarding bias all five products tend to overestimate in situ observations when som 15 with sca h generally having the smallest absolute bias values fig 8d in terms of rmsd the differences between the five products are mainly found when som 20 where sca h shows the lowest rmsd followed by mt dca while dca and smap ib consistently maintain a large rmsd increase rate with som 4 2 5 mean surface soil temperature when plotted against ground based msst the r ranom ubrmsd and rmsd of all five products degrade as the temperature decreases and r and ubrmsd degrade sharply when msst drops below 280 k this is in line with the validation of amsr2 sm by kim et al 2015 however this feature is not surprising since field stations with low mean surface soil temperatures are generally located in high mountainous areas with complex topography or in northern hemisphere regions with high som hypothesis that can be confirmed by the increase in log sr and som with decreasing temperature fig s4a b this may also partly explain why the r ubrmsd temperature relationship for mt dca is found to decline increase at a higher rate compared to the other four products as it only uses a global constant root mean square height of 0 13 for the roughness parameter table 1 whereas the other products apply a dedicated calibration process to estimate this parameter e g chaubell et al 2020 and o neill et al 2021a for official smap products and fernandez moran et al 2017 for smap ib in addition the r and ubrmsd scores for all the five products seem to have a clear inflection point when msst is around 280 k this is due to the fact that the vegetation density parameterized by vod is favorable for sm retrieval in this temperature range fig s4c and fig 5 which is consistent with the recent evaluation work of ma et al 2023 based on the tca method however when msst 280 k all other environmental factors involved in this study especially for log sr som and vod increase obviously in a direction unfavorable to the sm retrievals fig s4a b c smap ib exhibits higher r values in different msst ranges while the slight advantage of mt dca over sca v and dca is found in the range of msst 280 k fig 9 a unlike the pattern of r obtained from the original sm time series which decreases slowly and then sharply as the msst decreases the rate of ranom reduction is high for the sm anomaly of all products fig 9b this can be partly explained by the fact that ranom is more sensitive to increases in log sr fig 6 and section 4 3 mt dca shows a higher ranom value than other products when msst 285 k but is the opposite at lower msst the ranking of the ubrmsd of the five sm retrievals with respect to different temperature ranges is mt dca sca h other products for the other products smap ib is found to have a similar ubrmsd value as dca and sca v when msst is lower while its ubrmsd is slightly higher at higher msst fig 9c there is a distinctly different pattern in the bias and rmsd scores for the five products but as these two scores are susceptible to the representativeness errors of ground based observations we do not analyze them in detail in general as revealed by the overall assessment above sca h and mt dca show an underestimation of in situ sm even in the different msst ranges 4 3 sensitivity of different metrics to different environmental factors for the five products comparing figs 5 9 it is found that the r ranom and ubrmsd scores of these five smap sm products are influenced by these environmental factors to varying degrees for example the r and ranom values obtained for all five products are generally more affected by surface roughness and temperature while their ubrmsd values are more sensitive to the degree of dryness wetness of the soil surface vegetation density and temperature which is consistent with the conclusions obtained by li et al 2022 and wigneron et al 2021 these results are also confirmed by the correlation values between these environmental factors and the first order error statistic scores of the five sm products table 3 in addition the sensitivity of different metrics to the perturbing factors analyzed is product dependent for example the r of sca h has only a significant p 0 05 relationship with log sr and msst while that of sca v mt dca and smap ib are sensitive not only to these two factors but also to the presence of som followed by vod moreover unlike sca v and mt dca the absolute value of the correlation between r of smap ib and som is the highest among these four factors suggesting that future improvements in r skill for smap ib may be in the high som region in terms of ranom the results obtained for all products are sensitive to the five factors analyzed except for dca which has a non significant ranom value with respect to vod interestingly although the r scores of the original sm time series of most products are not significantly correlated with the mssm their anomalous versions all show a positive and significant correlation with the mssm confirming the results in fig 7 that the ranom of the five products is relatively increasing with the mssm in a certain range 0 3 m3 m3 however considering that a reasonable inversion range for a satellite based sm should be 0 1 gao et al 2021 o neill et al 2021a wigneron et al 2017 a further study on this point is still needed once more ground based networks covering a wider range of dry and wet soil conditions have been collected regarding ubrmsd in addition to the abovementioned three factors i e mssm vod and msst som and log sr also affect the performance of each product to some extent it should be noted that there are complex interdependencies among the five environmental factors investigated here fig s4 and there may be other important perturbing factors e g soil texture land surface heterogeneity water fraction etc influencing the sm inversions that are not considered in our study xing et al 2021 li et al 2020 this is the reason why the correlation between a specific environmental factor and the first order error statistics scores of different products is statistically significant considering p 0 05 in most cases but has a low value table 3 moreover many other complex environmental classifications cannot be considered due to the very limited in situ observations available for example there are very few sites available in boreal regions where a large percentage of high som values are found in addition the distribution of the ismn in situ sites is uneven across the globe mainly located in the usa and europe as shown in fig 1 making it difficult to perform analyses under different climatic zones zhang et al 2019 however the reliability of the main general patterns we identified in the present study is supported by the tca based r results specific results concerning som are given in fig s5 in addition the overall good performance of smap ib here is also consistent with the recent evaluation study by ma et al 2023 using a combined tca ivd double instrumental variable approach nothing these this study investigates the evolution and sensitivity of the performance of five smap sm products to a given environmental conditions selected by reviewing the retrieval algorithms table 1 rather than distinguishing between actual complex combinations of different factors considering the difficulty of fully investigating the interdependencies among all possible factors associated with sm retrieval the current study provides some useful information for improving different smap sm retrieval algorithms 5 conclusions to better understand the perturbing factors that lead to performance discrepancies between the different smap sm products the evaluation and intercomparison of five smap sm products against the ismn in situ measurements across five external conditions i e msst vod log sr soil wetness and som over 2016 2020 are investigated the performances of the five products are characterized using the pearson correlation coefficient r anomalies ranom ubrmsd bias and rmsd several conclusions can be drawn as follows i overall smap ib presents the highest scores for r and similar scores to sca v and dca for ubrmsd while mt dca shows the highest ubrmsd under different environmental factors ii skills in different aspects of the five smap products have different sensitivities to these five factors the r and ranom scores are generally more sensitive to log sr and msst while the ubrmsd values are more affected by soil wetness and vod iii the skills of all five smap sm retrievals degrade in r ranom and ubrmsd with low msst high vod and high log sr surprisingly the ubrmsd of all five products increases with decreasing log sr for relatively smooth surfaces log sr 6 with larger growth rates for smap ib sca h and mt dca iv ranom increases with increasing mssm for all five products within a certain range mssm 0 3 m3 m3 in particular smap ib shows the highest ranom values under wet soil surfaces mssm 0 3 m3 m3 followed by mt dca v the r ranom and ubrmsd scores of all five products are degraded as som increases and smap ib obtains the lowest values for both r and ranom when som 20 all these results suggest that all the five smap sm products have room for refinement and the analysis of the performance of the relevant smap products with respect to different external factors also provides information for appropriate algorithm selection and possible areas for future improvement for example testing som based dielectric constant models in relevant sm retrieval algorithms especially in regions with high som distribution mironov et al 2019 since accurate soil moisture information is essential important for hydrological modelling and natural hazards e g landslides and debris flows our results can also help potential users to select the most suitable satellite sm products for hydrological applications for example to improve the prediction accuracy of rainfall runoff models alvarez garreton et al 2014 zhuo and han 2016 or to calibrate the streamflow forecasting models together with sparse gauged sites li et al 2018 etc the performance of the five smap sm products cannot be thoroughly assessed due to the limited environmental conditions covered by the current in situ observation network future works will consider gathering more ground based sm data and or combining quantified methods e g tca or ivd to extend the analysis in current study gruber et al 2020 fan et al 2022 ma et al 2023 credit authorship contribution statement

2143,since the launch of soil moisture active passive smap mission in 2015 several advanced global surface soil moisture sm products derived from different retrieval schemes have been released however the factors contributing to the performance differences of these smap products have not been fully investigated this study tries to fill the gap by assessing and intercomparing five smap products namely the single channel algorithm v h pol sca v h dual channel algorithm dca multi temporal dual channel algorithm mt dca and the new smap inrae bordeaux smap ib using the international soil moisture network ismn ground measurements worldwide during 2016 2020 after reviewing the retrieval algorithms the impact of five potential perturbing factors on the skills of all products is reported these factors including mean surface soil temperature msst surface roughness log sr vegetation density characterized by vegetation optical depth vod mean surface soil wetness mssm and soil organic matter som results shows that the smap ib product has the highest overall r value of 0 75 with ismn ground sm and the smallest unbiased root mean square difference ubrmsd values same as sca v and dca 0 058 m3 m3 the performance of all five products in terms of r and ubrmsd rapidly degrades over the regions with high vod rough surface and low msst in contradiction with the fact that product performance degrades with increasing roughness the ubrmsd of all five products increases with decreasing log sr on a relatively smooth surface log sr 6 with larger growth rates for smap ib sca h and mt dca regarding characterizing the temporal variations of in situ sm anomalies r anom r anom increases as the ground becomes wet for all products within a certain range mssm 0 3 m3 m3 in particular smap ib and mt dca present higher r anom values than the other three products under wet soil surfaces mssm 0 3 m3 m3 the two metrics r and r anom decrease significantly with increasing som for smap ib compared to the other products and smap ib obtains the lowest values for both metrics when som 20 these findings are expected to provide useful information for appropriate product selection and improvement keywords smap soil moisture assessment dca sca v h mt dca smap ib data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture sm which represents the water content in the upper soil layer is a key state variable in the climate system and the terrestrial hydrologic cycle koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 sm directly controls the balance of water and energy on the earth miralles et al 2014 li et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2020 thus accurate global sm mapping is essential to better understand the variability of climate change e g the occurrence of rainfall events tuttle and salvucci 2016 and the variability of air temperature wigneron et al 2017 schwingshackl et al 2017 in addition it will also promote the applications of these environment variables in agriculture li et al 2020 weather predictions wigneron et al 2021 and drought monitoring carrao et al 2016 passive microwave remote sensing at l band 1 4 ghz is regarded as the most promising tool for monitoring sm at both regional and global scales entekhabi et al 2010 wigneron et al 2017 due to its capability of all weather sensing and penetrating moderate vegetation high sensitivity to soil dielectric constant and frequent revisiting time kerr et al 2012 kurum 2013 the soil moisture active passive smap mission launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa on january 31 2015 is the latest space borne l band mission entekhabi et al 2010 smap was designed to provide global high resolution sm and freeze thaw state using a radar and a radiometer every two or three days chan et al 2016 derksen et al 2017 however the radar stopped working after 11 weeks of operation due to unrecoverable hardware failure despite this setback the remaining smap radiometer functioned well as expected collecting high quality brightness temperature tb data which has been used to produce a variety of sm products including swath based the standard level 2 and daily composite level 3 version initially these official smap passive sm products were retrieved based on the single channel algorithm at the vertical polarization sca v which was selected as the baseline algorithm of smap o neill et al 2021a chan et al 2016 sca v only retrieves sm while vegetation optical depth vod a parameter characterizing vegetation extinction effects is used as an auxiliary input for sm inversions and estimated from climatological data of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi since vod is regarded as a good proxy for monitoring aboveground biomass feng et al 2023 frappart et al 2020 li et al 2021 qin et al 2021 tong et al 2020 and direct vod inversion can mitigate the propagation of uncertainty to the sm retrievals due to the introduction of additional auxiliary data li et al 2022 chaubell et al 2020 the dual channel algorithm dca seems to be a more ideal approach gao et al 2021 compared to 1 parameter retrieval of sca v the dca which requires both h pol and v pol tbs as input can achieve 2 parameter retrieval of both sm and vod by a nonlinear least squares iteration to date several improved dca algorithms have been developed for obtaining sm and vod from the smap data for instance by assuming that vod remains relatively constant over a time window 7 days konings et al 2016 konings et al 2017 proposes a multi temporal dual channel algorithm mt dca that can retrieve single scattering albedo sm and vod simultaneously differently a modified dca mdca algorithm has also been developed to enhance the cost function by adding a regularization term with respect to vod o neill et al 2021a chaubell et al 2020 in addition a new parameterization scheme with updated parameters of surface roughness and single scattering albedo is also implemented in the mdca algorithm chaubell et al 2020 this new version of dca hereafter we use dca to refer to mdca to be consistent with smap atbd algorithm theoretical basis documents which replaces sca v has now been used as the baseline algorithm to routinely generate official smap sm products o neill et al 2021a the validation and assessment activities have been ongoing since the first release of the smap sm products these activities are of great importance for the refinement and promotion of the smap sm data and their potential use in the domain of natural disasters climate and hydrology chan et al 2016 fan et al 2022 wang et al 2022 currently several approaches including field campaigns colliander et al 2015 sparse and dense networks chan et al 2018 ayres et al 2021 ma et al 2019 colliander et al 2022 core validation sites cvss colliander et al 2017 and intercomparisons among satellites and land surface model lsm simulations bai et al 2019 dong et al 2018 have been used for evaluation of smap sm products for instance chan et al 2016 have evaluated the smap l2 sm products using in situ data from cvss and sparse networks over six months and found that sca v delivered the lowest ubrmse unbiased root mean square error value of 0 038 m3 m3 reaching the smap mission requirement of 0 04 m3 m3 colliander et al 2017 have validated the performance of the smap enhanced l2 morning product based on cvss and confirmed the practicality of the smap cal val program based on lsm outputs and tca triple collocation analysis method dong et al 2018 have found the vod values obtained in smap sca based on vegetation water content data from modis ndvi climatology may fail to capture the real time dynamics of vod which in turn introduces uncertainty to sm retrievals this signature of the smap sca is also evidenced by gao et al 2020a b and zwieback et al 2018 more recently improved or comparable performance of the modified dca sm product relative to sca v has also been demonstrated colliander et al 2022 gao et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 li et al 2022 however most of the existing assessment efforts are generally limited to examining the inherent skill scores of various sm products with little attention paid to analyzing how the performance of different products varies with environmental factors for example ma et al 2019 has evaluated the effects of several perturbing factors on sm products from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos smap the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 and the climate change initiative cci but they have ignored the possible impact of different sensor footprints and overpass times on this investigation fan et al 2022 al yaari et al 2019 considering that assessing the impact of these environmental factors is undoubtedly paramount to improving sm retrieval algorithms and thus promoting relevant products it further raises the question which aspects of the performance of each product are more relevant to these environmental factors for example to capture temporal variations of surface sm or absolute value etc given that the underlying microwave emission observations are the same for the aforementioned smap algorithms an exciting opportunity is now available to evaluate the impact of algorithms on the resulting smap sm products after excluding different sensor effects moreover since the rapid development of sm retrieval algorithms some newly released sm products e g new versions or new retrieval schemes have not been fully evaluated and intercompared one such new product is the smap ib sm product which was recently developed by inrae bordeaux li et al 2022 in addition its product in ascending orbit 06 00 pm local time has only recently been released and thus its performance has never been evaluated to fill these gaps the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of different environmental factors on the performance of the five smap products including sca v sca h sca with h pol tb as input dca mt dca and smap ib and try to answer above questions this is achieved by providing an intercomparison between smap l3 radiometer global daily sm products mt dca as well as the smap ib sm products in both ascending and descending 06 00 am between 2016 and 2020 using ground based surface sm measurements from ismn international soil moisture network dorigo et al 2021 while the retrieval algorithms for these smap sm products are all based on the 0th order radiative transfer equation gao et al 2021 o neill et al 2021a they apply different approaches to determine the physical soil temperature surface roughness effects and vegetation parameters see also table 1 for details considering these we accordingly investigate the impact of potential perturbing factors related to them on the sm retrievals which are mean surface soil temperature msst surface roughness log sr and vod in addition given the documented significant impact of soil organic matter som content on sm retrieval li et al 2022 manns et al 2017 wigneron et al 2021 and the high sensitivity of soil dielectric constant to soil moisture zhang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 the effects regarding these two aspects are also included in the analysis this paper is structured as follows a brief introduction to materials and methods are presented in sections 2 and 3 respectively sections 4 shows the results and discussion finally conclusions are described in section 5 2 datasets 2 1 smap sm products five sm products derived from sca v sca h dca mt dca and smap ib covering the period from 2016 to 2020 are collected in this study among them the first three are extracted directly from the smap l3 radiometer daily sm product spl3smp version 8 o neill et al 2021 while the smap ib version 1 and mt dca products version 5 are obtained from https ib remote sensing inrae fr and https afeldman mit edu mt dca data respectively all five sm products are projected on a global equal area scalable earth grid version 2 ease grid 2 0 with a spatial resolution of 36 km spl3smp and smap ib are available from both ascending pm and descending am orbits while mt dca currently only has data from descending orbit all five algorithms products are based on the 0th order radiative transfer equation τ ω model to simulate microwave tb emission from the land surfaces mo et al 1982 with a similar dielectric mixing model table 1 the main differences among these sm retrieval algorithms are i the retrieval method and ii the parameterization scheme considering effective soil and vegetation temperatures soil roughness effects and vegetation parameters i e τ and ω for instance both sca v and sca h are 1 parameter retrieval algorithms only sm with single channel input while dca mt dca and smap ib are 2 parameter retrievals i e sm and vod with dual polarized or and multi temporal tb information as input while most other smap products sca v sca h dca and mt dca apply geos 5 goddard earth observing system model version 5 soil temperature outputs smap ib uses soil temperatures from era5 ecmwf reanalysis version 5 in addition although all five retrieval algorithms apply h q n to account for roughness effects dca and smap ib adopt roughness parameter i e hr calibrated by chaubell et al 2020 and fernandez moran et al 2017 respectively while the sca algorithm is preset based on igbp full details about these retrieval algorithms can be found in o neill et al 2021a and chaubell et al 2020 for sca v sca h and dca koning et al 2016 2017 for mt dca and li et al 2022 for smap ib 2 2 ismn ground based sm in situ observations from the ismn are used to assess the five smap products we select this dataset as a reference because it has been widely utilized to evaluate satellite sm products bai et al 2019 ma et al 2019 li et al 2020 gao et al 2021 the ismn is an international collaboration to establish a global database of in situ sm observations which is an important means of calibrating evaluating as well as improving satellite and land surface modelling sm products dorigo et al 2021 the ismn now hosts about 72 networks mainly distributed over the united states canada europe and china and is freely available at https ismn geo tuwien ac at notably ismn provides not only in situ sm data but also surface soil temperature sst measurements in present study only ground sm data observed in the 0 5 cm layer between 2016 and 2020 are applied it should be realized that there is an unavoidable spatial resolution mismatch between point scale in situ observations and grid scale satellite footprints especially when the number of field stations within a pixel footprint is small al yaari et al 2019 li et al 2022 gruber et al 2020 to alleviate the spatial mismatch between them we spatially average the high quality field measurements from the same network within a pixel according to the flags provided by the ismn and then compared them with the satellite retrievals of the corresponding pixel li et al 2022 gao et al 2021 crow et al 2012 as a results 412 sites from 19 networks table s1 are kept and their sst measurements are also collected which is shown in fig 1 with an igbp land cover classification map as the background 2 3 additional datasets the 25 km smos vod fig s1 retrieved from the smos ic version 2 algorithm wigneron et al 2021 is used to assess the skill of the five smap sm retrievals under different vegetation conditions li et al 2022 we select this data because it is independent of the smap products evaluated in this study the global multi resolution terrain elevation data gmted dem is applied to assess the impact of relative surface roughness on the sm inversion at the satellite grid scale as done in kim et al 2015 and li et al 2022 the surface roughness at coarse resolution 36 km is calculated based on the variance of all 1296 1 km dem cells within the satellite pixel li et al 2022 choudhury et al 1979 furthermore the global percentage of soil organic matter som converted from the soil organic carbon content provided by the soilgrid250m project hengl et al 2017 is used to investigate the effect of som on the skill scores of the five smap sm retrievals the global precipitation measurement gpm l3 product provides the daily rainfall data for this study huffman et al 2019 all these auxiliary data are finally aggregated to 36 km to be consistent with the spatial resolution of smap 3 methodology four conventional statistical metrics are used to evaluate the sm products entekhabi et al 2010 including pearson correlation coefficient r eq 1 bias m3 m3 eq 2 root mean square difference rmsd m3 m3 eq 3 and unbiased rmsd ubrmsd m3 m3 eq 4 due to the spatial mismatch between in situ measurements and satellite retrievals the two bias insensitive metrics r and ubrmsd which are less impacted by representativeness errors than rmsd and bias al yaari et al 2014 xing et al 2021 are considered as the first order criteria in this study 1 r 1 θ est θ ref 2 θ est e θ ref 2 2 bias e θ est e θ ref 3 rmsd e θ est θ ref 2 4 ubrmsd rmsd 2 bias 2 where θ est is the smap sm estimates θ ref is the in situ measurements used as reference e denotes the arithmetic mean of the data considering that seasonal effects can invisibly increase the correlation between two time series we also compute monthly anomalous time series as done in al yaari et al 2014 to explore the ability of these smap sm products in capturing the variability of short term in situ data therefore the above metrics are calculated not only for the original sm values expressed in volumetric units m3 m3 but also the sm anomalies for the r metric only it is important to note that while the representativeness errors in field measurements may affect the absolute values of the metrics al yaari et al 2019 gruber et al 2020 and decay the ability to detect differences between the products to some extent the analysis in this study is comparative in nature and tends to convey information about relative pros and cons of each algorithmic product to obtain reliable evaluation results several criteria are considered i all products undergo strict data filtering according to their respective flags to remove spurious retrievals caused by frozen soil and water fraction etc zhang et al 2019 ii only in situ data within a maximum time lag of 1 h matching the smap am and pm overpass times are retained li et al 2022 iii only stations with at least 31 1 month valid observations from 2016 to 2020 are kept to ensure robust statistics zeng et al 2022 iv only the same stations that have valid calculated scores for all sm products are retained for fair comparison to investigate the differences between the scores obtained for the five products or between that of the am and pm retrievals from the same algorithm we also show p values from paired samples t tests to check the statistical significance of rejecting the null hypothesis that the means of the two groups of indicators are the same finally five potential environmental factors e g msst vod mean surface soil moisture mssm log sr and som affecting the sm retrievals are investigated by plotting the above error scores as a function of these factors respectively moreover for ease of interpretation a robust local regression approach is used to smooth the data see section 4 2 which relies on weighted linear least squares li et al 2022 with a span of 50 4 results and discussion in this section we first focus on the evaluation of the overall performance of the five products which involves a comparison between am and pm of the same product and between different retrieval products for the former case no study has yet evaluated the latest smap ib pm products li et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 then the impacts of five potential perturbing factors on these smap sm products and the sensitivity of the validated error metrics to them are investigated separately 4 1 overall performances 4 1 1 am products vs pm products fig 2 illustrates the overall performance i e r ranom ubrmsd bias and rmsd of each product in terms of both am and pm observations in general am products exhibit better performance than pm products due to better soil canopy thermal equilibrium conditions as revealed by chan et al 2018 however for the smap official products i e sca v sca h and dca all the indicator values obtained by pm observations are similar to those obtained by am observations except for ranom the skill of am observations is better than that of pm the former case is in line with the recent evaluation study of fan et al 2022 using in situ data from smap cvss which found that high version v7 of official smap sm products have comparable or even better performance in the pm orbit than in the am orbit the possible reason for this conflicting expectation is that vegetation is more transparent i e lower vegetation water content due to stronger water stress during the daytime wang et al 2023 resulting in less effect of vegetation on emission attenuation from soils which has yielded similar results in some previous work brocca et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 regarding the smap ib its sm retrievals obtained during the am orbit always perform better than those obtained during the pm orbit for all metrics except for ubrmsd which has close values between am and pm fig 2 note that large p value of the t test means that the null hypothesis i e the mean of the two sets of scores is the same is difficult to reject the results in table 2 also confirm these findings the t test p values for most indicators between the pm and am retrievals of smap ib are less than the 5 level of significance whereas the official smap products all exceed this level nevertheless smap ib pm sm products are found to obtain higher r values compared to sca v dca and sca h as there are no pm products available for mt dca we focus only on the analysis of am observation in the following intercomparisons 4 1 2 assessment results between different retrieval algorithms as conducted in previous evaluation studies bai et al 2019 xing et al 2021 the median and standard deviation std values of all error statistics are calculated in table 2 to compare the statistical significance between the indicators obtained for the different products we perform t test between each two of them fig 3 with respect to capturing the temporal trends of in situ sm by presenting the highest overall r of 0 75 smap ib outperforms the four other sm retrievals followed by mt dca sca v and dca which has close non significant difference r values of 0 68 among these five smap sm products sca h shows the lowest r of 0 62 the same r value between dca and sca v verifies the performance of the modified version of dca ayres et al 2021 colliander et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 however the correlation values obtained by sm anomaly i e ranom decrease for all five products with the ranom value of smap ib being imperceptibly better than that of other products regarding catching the absolute value of ground sm the first tier better performance fig 3 products are sca v dca and smap ib with ubrmsd values ranging from 0 057 to 0 060 m3 m3 among which dca is the lowest it is then followed by sca h with an ubrmsd of 0 062 m3 m3 which is better than mt dca ubrmsd 0 069 m3 m3 in terms of bias sca v dca and smap ib are found to have smaller bias values than the other smap sm retrievals with absolute values 0 01 m3 m3 although both mt dca and sca h show the same signs of underestimation of in situ sm data sca h is found to be more pronounced with a median bias of 0 045 m3 m3 dca sca v and smap ib are found to have similar performance in the rmsd metric with values between 0 076 and 0 081 m3 m3 which are all smaller than sca h and mt dca with similar rmsd values 0 091 m3 m3 fig 4 shows the temporal series of the five smap sm retrievals over several sites with contrasting land cover types in general all five products can track very well the dry down variations of the ground sm measurements even over mixed forest sites in europe fig 4c this suggests the potential for smap to obtain sm retrievals in forested areas which is in line with the evaluation efforts of ayres et al 2021 and li et al 2022 all products are found to perform better in dry periods than in wet periods both in terms of capturing temporal changes and absolutes value of in situ sm data and they all tend to overestimate in situ observations during the rainy season fig 4b e large differences between the five smap sm products can be found over the evergreen needleleaf forest site in the usa where sca h is closer to in situ observations while the other products are more discrete fig 4b at the cropland natural vegetation mosaic station in africa smap ib and mt dca are found to overlap very well with in situ observations while the official smap products i e sca v and dca slightly overestimate field measurements even during the dry season fig 4f our evaluation results show that different products have inconsistent performance both from the overall scores obtained over the ismn sites table 2 and from the local site analysis fig 4 considering the main differences between the retrieval algorithms of these five smap sm products listed in table 1 we analyze below the impact of the five environmental factors associated with them which are msst vod log sr som and mssm 4 2 impact of different environmental factors 4 2 1 vegetation density fig 5 shows the statistical scores between the five smap sm products and in situ measurements as a function of vod similar patterns are found in the performance of the five smap sm retrievals for ranom ubrmsd bias and rmsd scores although with different absolute values and sensitivities fig 5 for instance the ranom of all five sm retrievals increase first and then decreases sharply with increasing vod and they all have maximum ranom values around vod 0 15 differently their ubrmsd increases strongly with vod with the steepest increase occurring at vod 0 05 0 15 regarding correlation smap ib presents obviously higher r values than other products especially at moderate vod levels 0 2 0 5 but this lead diminishes gradually with increasing vod mt dca performs better than the official smap products mainly in vod 0 3 while dca leads when vod is beyond this range interestingly it is found that dca obtains improved r values compared to sca v when vod 0 4 which may be due to the direct retrieval of vod by dca mitigating the uncertainty of obtaining vod from auxiliary data gao et al 2022 correspondingly its ranom value is also higher in this vod range but it has the lowest ranom among the five products in terms of low vod level the rate of decrease in the smap ib ranom vod relationship is the highest when vod increases above 0 4 however when it comes to ubrmsd smap ib is almost similar to sca v while dca is found to have the highest rate of increase at this vod level vod 0 4 although its ubrmsd value is still lower than that of mt dca fig 5c the r and ubrmsd indicators for dca fig 5a c compared to sca v have the opposite signature when vod 0 4 suggesting that different metrics have different sensitivities to individual environmental factors wigneron et al 2021 xing et al 2021 see section 4 3 while fig 5 in fact shows the total result for the effects of all factors categorized by vod the absolute bias in the sca h is greater than that for the other four retrievals especially at the lower vod range vod 0 3 however this signature is obtained by dca at high vod values where all products tend to overestimate the in situ measurements all of these are also generally found in the rmsd indicator 4 2 2 surface roughness with respect to log sr the best r skill for all five smap sm retrievals is found near log sr 6 which is generally the case for ranmo and ubrmsd fig 6 a b c all three of these indicators i e r ranom and ubrmsd degrade dramatically as the surface becomes rougher this may be due to the fact that increasing the surface roughness leads to an increase in the measured tb and reduces the sensitivity of l band observations to sm wigneron et al 2001 it is found that the r differences between mt dca dca and sca v caused by log sr changes are not significant although mt dca has a slight advantage when log sr 6 moreover the r values of these three products are sandwiched between sca h with a low r value and smap ib with a high r value fig 6a surprisingly the ubrmsd values of all the five smap sm products are found to be higher on relatively smooth surfaces log sr 6 and smap ib sca h and mt dca have a larger increase rate vs log sr compared to dca and sca v the former result may be due to the fact that all the five sm products do not currently consider temporal changes in surface roughness especially for agricultural areas o neill et al 2021a parrens et al 2016 fernandez moran et al 2017 since sites with log sr 6 are mainly covered by croplands figs s1 and s2 the calibration of the smap algorithms in agricultural sites has been a key focus of smap s field campaigns for example the south fork iowa and carman manitoba sites in the 2016 smap validation experiment smapvex16 mcnairn et al 2017 based on these studies the improvements in the official smap products i e dca and sac v compared to the other three can be partially explained by the updated roughness parameters chaubell et al 2020 o neill et al 2021a sca v and dca present lower ubrmsd values than the other three products when log sr 10 while mt dca has the highest ubrmsd values for different log sr ranges accordingly dca and sca v mt dca also have the lowest highest rmsd values followed by smap ib fig 6e the bias of sca v dca and smap ib hover around bias 0 m3 m3 as the surface became rougher while sca h consistently underestimates the in situ observations 4 2 3 soil wetness interestingly all five smap sm retrievals show higher r values on moderately wet soil surfaces mssm 0 25 m3 m3 than on relatively dry soil surfaces mssm 0 1 m3 m3 and their r values are all decreasing sharply on wetter soil surfaces mssm 0 25 m3 m3 with smap ib having the highest r values fig 7 a these sites are generally covered by deciduous broadleaf forest mixed forests croplands or cropland natural vegetation mosaics fig s3 dca has lower r values than sca v under dry conditions which are both lower than mt dca but when the surface becomes wet dca can reach comparable r values to mt dca there are clear different patterns in ranom score between the five products especially on wet soil surfaces mssm 0 3 m3 m3 where smap ib has the highest ranom values followed by mt dca fig 7b this may be due to the fact that both smap ib li et al 2022 and mt dca konings et al 2017 apply time constrained regularization methods for vod in their cost functions which can reduce both short term sm and vod retrieval errors as revealed by feldman et al 2021 except for mt dca which has a higher ubrmsd value it is difficult to find differences in the ubrmsd mssm relationship between the other four products when sm 0 15 m3 m3 corresponding mainly to grasslands shrublands and barren lands in addition the performance of the five smap products under different vegetation types fig s3 show that smap ib has the lowest ubrmsd values mainly in forested types compared to the other products namely evergreen needleleaf forest evergreen broadleaf forest and mixed forests however the rate of increase in ubrmsd vs mssm for sca h and smap ib is largest in wet conditions where the ubrmsd value of sca h has exceeded that of mt dca this implies that the sm retrievals in forested areas will not necessarily have a lower accuracy than in non forested areas as revealed by ayres et al 2021 these results show it is interesting to combine surface dry wet conditions and land cover types for sm assessment all five smap products tend to underestimate the ground sm data as soil surfaces become wetter with mt dca obtaining the largest bias values and drop rates correspondingly mt dca also has the largest rmsd values and growth rates when mssm 0 25 m3 m3 dca and sca v are found to exhibit the lowest rmsd values on relatively wetter soil surfaces fig 7e 4 2 4 soil organic matter regarding som the skills of all five smap sm retrievals in terms of r ranom and ubrmsd degrade to some extent with increasing som fig 8 a c this may be due to the fact that none of the five smap algorithms currently considers the special soil dielectric properties due to the presence of som and they all use the clay based mironov soil dielectric model table 1 li et al 2022 o neill et al 2021a this is in line with the previous assessment results of older version of official smap sm products zhang et al 2019 but we show that this is the case for all five smap sm products evaluated in this study this implies that it is worth testing the som based soil dielectric model in all five sm retrieval algorithms as such a model has been released mironov et al 2019 by presenting the largest drop rate smap ib shows the lowest r values at som 20 while the difference between the official smap sm products is not significant correspondingly the r value obtained for its sm anomaly i e ranom in this som range is also lower than that of other products followed by sca h the degraded performance of smap ib in this respect compared to other products can be partly explained by the fact that the multi temporal retrieval scheme it applies is susceptible to disruptions during freezing periods in northern hemisphere regions li et al 2022 wigneron et al 2021 where som values are generally high fig s1 the ranom of mt dca has a lower decrease rate compared to other products when som increases but its absolute value is still lower than that of dca and sca v all five products show a sharp increase in ubrmsd in the range of som of 0 5 while the ubrmsd of all products does not appear to increase significantly when som exceeds 10 it is found that the ubrmsd values of mt dca are obviously larger than those of other products with increasing som regarding bias all five products tend to overestimate in situ observations when som 15 with sca h generally having the smallest absolute bias values fig 8d in terms of rmsd the differences between the five products are mainly found when som 20 where sca h shows the lowest rmsd followed by mt dca while dca and smap ib consistently maintain a large rmsd increase rate with som 4 2 5 mean surface soil temperature when plotted against ground based msst the r ranom ubrmsd and rmsd of all five products degrade as the temperature decreases and r and ubrmsd degrade sharply when msst drops below 280 k this is in line with the validation of amsr2 sm by kim et al 2015 however this feature is not surprising since field stations with low mean surface soil temperatures are generally located in high mountainous areas with complex topography or in northern hemisphere regions with high som hypothesis that can be confirmed by the increase in log sr and som with decreasing temperature fig s4a b this may also partly explain why the r ubrmsd temperature relationship for mt dca is found to decline increase at a higher rate compared to the other four products as it only uses a global constant root mean square height of 0 13 for the roughness parameter table 1 whereas the other products apply a dedicated calibration process to estimate this parameter e g chaubell et al 2020 and o neill et al 2021a for official smap products and fernandez moran et al 2017 for smap ib in addition the r and ubrmsd scores for all the five products seem to have a clear inflection point when msst is around 280 k this is due to the fact that the vegetation density parameterized by vod is favorable for sm retrieval in this temperature range fig s4c and fig 5 which is consistent with the recent evaluation work of ma et al 2023 based on the tca method however when msst 280 k all other environmental factors involved in this study especially for log sr som and vod increase obviously in a direction unfavorable to the sm retrievals fig s4a b c smap ib exhibits higher r values in different msst ranges while the slight advantage of mt dca over sca v and dca is found in the range of msst 280 k fig 9 a unlike the pattern of r obtained from the original sm time series which decreases slowly and then sharply as the msst decreases the rate of ranom reduction is high for the sm anomaly of all products fig 9b this can be partly explained by the fact that ranom is more sensitive to increases in log sr fig 6 and section 4 3 mt dca shows a higher ranom value than other products when msst 285 k but is the opposite at lower msst the ranking of the ubrmsd of the five sm retrievals with respect to different temperature ranges is mt dca sca h other products for the other products smap ib is found to have a similar ubrmsd value as dca and sca v when msst is lower while its ubrmsd is slightly higher at higher msst fig 9c there is a distinctly different pattern in the bias and rmsd scores for the five products but as these two scores are susceptible to the representativeness errors of ground based observations we do not analyze them in detail in general as revealed by the overall assessment above sca h and mt dca show an underestimation of in situ sm even in the different msst ranges 4 3 sensitivity of different metrics to different environmental factors for the five products comparing figs 5 9 it is found that the r ranom and ubrmsd scores of these five smap sm products are influenced by these environmental factors to varying degrees for example the r and ranom values obtained for all five products are generally more affected by surface roughness and temperature while their ubrmsd values are more sensitive to the degree of dryness wetness of the soil surface vegetation density and temperature which is consistent with the conclusions obtained by li et al 2022 and wigneron et al 2021 these results are also confirmed by the correlation values between these environmental factors and the first order error statistic scores of the five sm products table 3 in addition the sensitivity of different metrics to the perturbing factors analyzed is product dependent for example the r of sca h has only a significant p 0 05 relationship with log sr and msst while that of sca v mt dca and smap ib are sensitive not only to these two factors but also to the presence of som followed by vod moreover unlike sca v and mt dca the absolute value of the correlation between r of smap ib and som is the highest among these four factors suggesting that future improvements in r skill for smap ib may be in the high som region in terms of ranom the results obtained for all products are sensitive to the five factors analyzed except for dca which has a non significant ranom value with respect to vod interestingly although the r scores of the original sm time series of most products are not significantly correlated with the mssm their anomalous versions all show a positive and significant correlation with the mssm confirming the results in fig 7 that the ranom of the five products is relatively increasing with the mssm in a certain range 0 3 m3 m3 however considering that a reasonable inversion range for a satellite based sm should be 0 1 gao et al 2021 o neill et al 2021a wigneron et al 2017 a further study on this point is still needed once more ground based networks covering a wider range of dry and wet soil conditions have been collected regarding ubrmsd in addition to the abovementioned three factors i e mssm vod and msst som and log sr also affect the performance of each product to some extent it should be noted that there are complex interdependencies among the five environmental factors investigated here fig s4 and there may be other important perturbing factors e g soil texture land surface heterogeneity water fraction etc influencing the sm inversions that are not considered in our study xing et al 2021 li et al 2020 this is the reason why the correlation between a specific environmental factor and the first order error statistics scores of different products is statistically significant considering p 0 05 in most cases but has a low value table 3 moreover many other complex environmental classifications cannot be considered due to the very limited in situ observations available for example there are very few sites available in boreal regions where a large percentage of high som values are found in addition the distribution of the ismn in situ sites is uneven across the globe mainly located in the usa and europe as shown in fig 1 making it difficult to perform analyses under different climatic zones zhang et al 2019 however the reliability of the main general patterns we identified in the present study is supported by the tca based r results specific results concerning som are given in fig s5 in addition the overall good performance of smap ib here is also consistent with the recent evaluation study by ma et al 2023 using a combined tca ivd double instrumental variable approach nothing these this study investigates the evolution and sensitivity of the performance of five smap sm products to a given environmental conditions selected by reviewing the retrieval algorithms table 1 rather than distinguishing between actual complex combinations of different factors considering the difficulty of fully investigating the interdependencies among all possible factors associated with sm retrieval the current study provides some useful information for improving different smap sm retrieval algorithms 5 conclusions to better understand the perturbing factors that lead to performance discrepancies between the different smap sm products the evaluation and intercomparison of five smap sm products against the ismn in situ measurements across five external conditions i e msst vod log sr soil wetness and som over 2016 2020 are investigated the performances of the five products are characterized using the pearson correlation coefficient r anomalies ranom ubrmsd bias and rmsd several conclusions can be drawn as follows i overall smap ib presents the highest scores for r and similar scores to sca v and dca for ubrmsd while mt dca shows the highest ubrmsd under different environmental factors ii skills in different aspects of the five smap products have different sensitivities to these five factors the r and ranom scores are generally more sensitive to log sr and msst while the ubrmsd values are more affected by soil wetness and vod iii the skills of all five smap sm retrievals degrade in r ranom and ubrmsd with low msst high vod and high log sr surprisingly the ubrmsd of all five products increases with decreasing log sr for relatively smooth surfaces log sr 6 with larger growth rates for smap ib sca h and mt dca iv ranom increases with increasing mssm for all five products within a certain range mssm 0 3 m3 m3 in particular smap ib shows the highest ranom values under wet soil surfaces mssm 0 3 m3 m3 followed by mt dca v the r ranom and ubrmsd scores of all five products are degraded as som increases and smap ib obtains the lowest values for both r and ranom when som 20 all these results suggest that all the five smap sm products have room for refinement and the analysis of the performance of the relevant smap products with respect to different external factors also provides information for appropriate algorithm selection and possible areas for future improvement for example testing som based dielectric constant models in relevant sm retrieval algorithms especially in regions with high som distribution mironov et al 2019 since accurate soil moisture information is essential important for hydrological modelling and natural hazards e g landslides and debris flows our results can also help potential users to select the most suitable satellite sm products for hydrological applications for example to improve the prediction accuracy of rainfall runoff models alvarez garreton et al 2014 zhuo and han 2016 or to calibrate the streamflow forecasting models together with sparse gauged sites li et al 2018 etc the performance of the five smap sm products cannot be thoroughly assessed due to the limited environmental conditions covered by the current in situ observation network future works will consider gathering more ground based sm data and or combining quantified methods e g tca or ivd to extend the analysis in current study gruber et al 2020 fan et al 2022 ma et al 2023 credit authorship contribution statement

2144,large scale anthropogenic revegetation brings new challenges by enhancing water consumptions in non humid regions even if it improves ecosystems water resources in water stressed areas are primarily provided by precipitation and excessive afforestation can potentially lead to severe imbalance between water supply and demand due to limited rainwater resources therefore it is essential to evaluate the maximum vegetation coverage and productivity capacity supported by rainwater resources in this study the sustainability of revegetation was characterized by calculating the upper limit of vegetation leaf area index lai supported by rainwater resources the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency of the maximum and the actual vegetation scenario were compared over the loess plateau lp which is well known as a region experiencing both large scale vegetation restoration and severe water shortages the upper limit on lai was calculated based on evapotranspiration et supported by rainwater resources using the shuttleworth wallace s w model optimized in this study by adding dynamic vegetation and carbon dioxide components the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency of vegetation under different restoration scenarios were estimated in an analytical water use efficiency wue model both the models perform well and are consistent with observations the results show that the lai of the maximum vegetation scenario is 11 5 higher than the actual scenario if vegetation on the lp is restored to its maximum level the average gross primary productivity under the maximum vegetation scenario is 25 0 higher than the actual scenario while the ecosystem wue will increase by 17 9 it should be noticed that the maximum scenario is a theoretical upper limit based on ideal assumptions our findings reveal that improving rainwater utilization efficiency can further develop the potential of sustainable vegetation restoration while improve its efficiency and will provide guidance and theoretical support for vegetation restoration planning on water scarce regions keywords evapotranspiration maximum vegetation capacity rainwater use ecosystem water use efficiency water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the main measures for soil and water conservation large scale anthropogenic revegetation can restore ecological processes and improve local ecosystems its numerous benefits include bio conservation reduction of soil erosion and regulation of hydro climatic conditions bryan et al 2018 gao et al 2018 neuenkamp et al 2019 large scale revegetation can lead to an increase in regional evaporative water consumption thereby decreasing water availability jia et al 2019 macreadie et al 2019 murray et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 in turn this can exacerbate tensions between water supply and demand in water scarce regions and challenge the sustainability of vegetation restoration su fu 2013 also revegetation increases the carbon sequestration capacity of an ecosystem by increasing its strength as a carbon sink thus mitigating the effect of climate change and plays an important role in carbon neutrality feng et al 2016 menz et al 2013 anthropogenic revegetation can be considered as a trade off between carbon sequestration and water usage consequently the water shortages affecting arid and semi arid region are making the study of this trade off increasingly urgent wu et al 2018 to maintain the sustainability of vegetation restoration in these regions it is important to provide an estimate of the maximum level of vegetation cover supported by rainwater resources as a reference upper limit of revegetation this requires estimates of the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency associated with the maximum level of vegetation cover and the actual vegetation cover from these two aspects the sustainability and benefits of vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid areas can be evaluated feng et al 2016 the loess plateau lp is one of the regions with the greatest restoration of vegetation since the implementation of the grain for green project gfgp in 1999 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the vegetation coverage increased approximately 45 from 1970s to 2010 demonstrating the effectiveness of the vegetation restoration effort wang et al 2012 on this basis the lp was chosen as a typical area to explore the effect of anthropogenic revegetation in this study as a consequence of large scale vegetation restoration the rapid increase in vegetation water consumption has created challenges for sustainable vegetation restoration fu et al 2017 li et al 2018 the limited precipitation is the main source of water resources on the lp shi et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 leading to ecological fragility and high sensitivity to climate change and to human activities zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 previous studies have addressed the impact of vegetation changes on the water balance of this area but several questions associated with these challenges remain unanswered such as whether the intensity of vegetation restoration on the lp has reached the limit of water resources whether the current vegetation restoration rate is sustainable and how will continued vegetation restoration affect carbon sequestration and its efficiency cao et al 2009 chen et al 2015a chen et al 2015b therefore there is an urgent need to 1 accurately estimate vegetation water consumption under different vegetation conditions and to find the maximum vegetation coverage that can be supported by rainwater resources and 2 evaluate how this level of coverage could affect the water and carbon cycle on the lp in this study we explore these two issues by investigating the maximum leaf area index lai supported by rainwater resources and analyzing the carbon sequestration capacity and its efficiency of vegetation under different vegetation scenarios the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources is defined in this study as the lai when all of the precipitation is used for evapotranspiration in which case the amount of precipitation p is equal to the amount of evapotranspiration et in the calculation of maximum lai p does not change and because the change of vegetation exerts strong and complicated impacts on the hydrological cycle a model that can accurately reflect the impact of vegetation changes on et changes is necessary wei et al 2017 among the commonly used et models which fully consider both canopy and substrate et process the shuttleworth wallace s w model has been well validated hu et al 2009 ortega farias et al 2010 stannard 1993 the calculation of the resistance parameters is a critical part of the model enabling accurate simulations of the evaporation process daamen simmonds 1996 dolman 1993 however since its development limitations of the resistance parameter calculation method have generally restricted the s w model to small scale applications hu et al 2009 ortega farias et al 2010 subsequently the improved s w model has been applied on the regional scale providing resistance parameters for different land cover use types and reliable results have been obtained following improvement to the resistance calculation method zhou et al 2006 meanwhile changes in carbon dioxide concentration due to climate change affect bulk stomatal resistance and thus et niu et al 2013 yang et al 2019 in this study the performance of the s w model was improved by adding a limiting function of carbon dioxide concentration to the jarvis model which is used to calculate the bulk stomatal resistance of the canopy li et al 2019a li et al 2019b with p data from near surface datasets and et calculated the maximum vegetation coverage scenario considering the limitation of rainwater resources was obtained the gfgp has played an important role in minimizing soil erosion reducing flood risks and conserving water resources on the lp since its launch fu et al 2017 at the same time since the forest is the largest carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems afforestation has also had a profound impact on the carbon cycle of the lp fatichi et al 2019 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b to explore changes in the carbon cycle we adopted gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem water use efficiency wue as indicators of carbon sequestration and production efficiency gpp is the most important component of carbon exchange in the land atmosphere system representing the production level of terrestrial ecosystems in the natural environment and has an important impact on atmospheric co2 concentration and climate change sun et al 2018 since there is a strong coupling between the terrestrial carbon cycle and the water cycle then ecosystem wue which is calculated by dividing gpp by et is widely used to characterize the hydrological efficiency of ecosystem productivity yang et al 2016 similar to the acquisition of et data models are usually used for obtaining ecosystem gpp over long time series on a global or regional scale anav et al 2015 yuan et al 2014a yuan et al 2014b a new model developed by cheng et al 2017 was used in this study to estimate gpp constrained by hydrological measurements by upscaling leaf wue from leaf to ecosystem scale directly because the distribution of et components was already calculated in the improved s w model the upscaling process was simplified and gpp was readily obtained by multiplying wue and et in this study the optimized s w model was used to estimate et in different vegetation scenes and the output et was compared with p data under different scenarios next an inversion approach was used to calculate the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources and the carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation under different vegetation scenarios was then analyzed by the analytical wue model based on the surface water balance and on the improved s w model and analytical wue model in this study we evaluated the vegetation restoration status and carbon and water cycles on the lp the objectives focus on two aspects as follows 1 to calculate et using the optimized s w model in the study area and then to adjust lai to obtain the maximum vegetation coverage that can be supported by the available water resources and 2 to investigate changes in the carbon cycle caused by lai changes by calculating the gpp and wue before and after optimization using the analytical wue model 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the study area is the lp located in an arid and semi arid region of northern china and covering an area of 6 2 105 km2 34 45 5 n 101 114 33 e fig 1 the region contains most of the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river for a long time the vegetation and ecological environment have been poor and fragile on the lp the lp is often considered as one of the places with most severe water shortages in the world vegetation coverage on the lp has gradually improved since the launch of the grain for green project gfgp in 1999 for example the spatial average lai increased by 0 017 m2 m 2 yr 1 during 2001 2015 shao et al 2019 the annual average precipitation increases from northwest to southeast ranging from 150 to 820 mm over the lp the main vegetation types are farmland forest and grassland and the vegetation generally changes from desert to forest from northwest to southeast consistent with changes in precipitation the agriculture on the lp is primarily rainfed however there is also a substantial number of irrigation districts ids on the lp fig 1 2 2 datasets the data used to drive the models are as follows monthly moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lai https

atmospheric pressure air temperature humidity and radiation to evaluate the performance of the modified s w model across different land covers data from eight flux tower sites in china were used liu et al 2011 and the on site observational data come from field experiments of 7 sites table 1 provides details of the sites also gpp data from fluxnet table 2 was used to validate the analytical wue model pastorello et al 2020 3 methods 3 1 the maximum lai calculation the s w model can reflect the effect of lai changes on evapotranspiration because the resistance calculation is closely related to lai therefore the s w model was used in an inversion approach to calculate the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources this calculation was done separately on each grid multi year average lai of every month was first calculated and were used to normalize the intra annual distribution this normalized lai is then multiplied by a parameter increasing in steps of 0 01 from zero until the annual average reaches the historical maximum the lai calculated were input into the s w model although meteorological and soil factors did not change the value of lai when p was equal to et was then defined as the maximum lai supported by the rainwater resources for the year therefore the maximum lai is calculated on each grid for each year we excluded major irrigation districts on the loess plateau from the calculation as irrigation rather than precipitation is the main source of water resources in these areas in order to obtain the distribution of rainwater resources under typical scenarios the p iii frequency distribution curve was used to analyze the rainfall frequency of each grid according to the precipitation data from 1982 to 2015 the year where the rainfall frequency is 50 p 50 was classified as the typical normal year for the final maximum vegetation plan in this research and the year where the rainfall frequency is 25 p 25 and 75 p 75 was classified as the typical wet year and the typical dry year 3 2 the modified s w model the total evapotranspiration from the vegetation λ e t was calculated as the sum of evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from the canopy

12 sites with different land cover types across china the modified s w model performed well at 9 stations but less well at selva wetland and ice achieving relative coefficient r values ranging between 0 78 and 0 94 the performance of the s w model is acceptable at the wetland and selva sites and despite the poor performance on the ice due to the extremely small coverage of this type of land cover in the study area the model can be considered to perform well in the region as a whole with a slight underestimate the performance of the optimized s w model on the lp is shown in fig 3 where the six sites on the lp are used in the study including the four most representative land uses on the lp forest farmland shrub and grassland the model performed well in the study area but the underestimation of the result was greater than that of the entire china the analytical wue model outputs were compared and evaluated against the flux tower gpp from fluxnet fig 4 the results of the analytical wue model performed well at each site with r values ranging between 0 73 and 0 95 the results indicated that the s w and the analytical wue model can accurately simulate the et and gpp over the lp 4 2 maximum lai supported by rainwater resources on the lp fig 5 shows the spatial distribution and temporal variation of p a et b and p et c during 1982 2015 on the lp the annual average precipitation in the study area increased by 5 14 mm yr 1 during 2001 2015 compared with precipitation the rate of change of evapotranspiration was lower mainly due to the rapid increase of p during this period the annual average p et of the lp showed an increasing trend during 2001 2015 4 39 mm yr 1 fig 5c although the inter annual fluctuations of p et mainly caused by p were large the spatially averaged p remained generally higher than et on the lp the multi year average precipitation and evapotranspiration both showed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest in the study area p et in the upper reaches of the yellow river ranged from 331 mm to 255 mm and was significantly lower than that in other regions most of the areas with negative p et were also in this region however in most parts of the study area the multi year average precipitation is higher than evapotranspiration and the multi year average p et value is 109 48 mm on the entire lp the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources and p et show strong spatial consistency thus creating a gap with the actual lai fig 6 shows the actual lai laiact maximum lai laimax and their difference laidif in three typical years p 25 p 50 and p 75 during the study period in the normal year with 50 precipitation frequency p et was negative in most areas of the upper reaches of the yellow river therefore the maximum lai is less than the actual value in these places furthermore even if these areas are set as bare soil lai 0 there are some areas on the lp where the values of et were still higher than p indicated by red shading in fig 6 in other parts of the study area mostly the middle reaches of the yellow river p et is positive so the maximum lai is higher than the actual lai changes in annual precipitation do not show much effect on the actual lai but have a significant effect on the maximum lai the spatial average values of the actual lai are 0 67 m2 m 2 p 75 0 69 m2 m 2 p 50 and 0 71 m2 m 2 p 25 in the three typical years which do not change much but the spatial average of the maximum lai varies drastically from 0 67 m2 m 2 in the dry year to 0 92 m2 m 2 in the wet year however the spatial distribution of the maximum lai does not change much although change in precipitation shifts the average value considerably and in the three typical years the distribution of the maximum lai is very similar therefore the spatial distribution of the difference between the maximum lai and the actual lai laidif in fig 6 also does not change much fig 7 shows the spatially averaged actual and maximum lai on the lp and its two parts the upper reach of the yellow river ur and the middle reach of the yellow river mr the interannual variation of the maximum lai is larger than the actual lai across the entire study area and its parts on the upper reaches of the yellow river in the study area the multi year average maximum lai 0 38 m2 m 2 is slightly smaller approximately 2 than the actual lai on the middle reaches of the yellow river the multi year average maximum lai is 0 90 m2 m 2 15 1 higher than the actual lai 0 78 m2 m 2 although its fluctuation range is larger overall the spatio temporal heterogeneity of maximum lai was more obvious when compared with the actual lai and the maximum lai with an average value of 0 75 m2 m 2 was 14 3 higher than the actual lai 4 3 difference between simulated gpp and wue of maximum and actual scenarios fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the actual gpp gppact maximum gpp gppmax and their difference gppdif in three typical years p 25 p 50 and p 75 during the study period this reveals that the spatial distribution of gpp also gradually decreases from southeast to northwest consistent with lai however unlike lai the difference between gpp of different vegetation types is more obvious because the parameter g1 in the analytical wue model varies with vegetation type forest farmland and grassland gpps are the main contributor to total gpp in the entire study area and the annual average value of forest gpp is 1613 g c m 2 which is much higher than the farmland average of 911 g c m 2 and the grassland average of 400 g c m 2 fig s1 in the normal year with 50 precipitation frequency the areas where the maximum gpp is lower than the actual gpp are concentrated in the upper reaches of the yellow river in most areas of the study area the maximum gpp has improved similar to the lai forest has the greatest vegetation coverage and largest gpp therefore the increase in gpp caused by the increase in lai is most obvious in forest and is much higher than that in grassland and farmland on the entire lp the multi year average of maximum gpp is 718 84 g c m 2 which is 24 98 higher than the actual situation similar to lai changes in precipitation have little effect on the actual gpp but the average value of the maximum gpp varies with precipitation the maximum gpp increased by 38 in the typical wet year compared to 9 4 in the typical dry year fig 9 shows the spatially averaged actual and maximum gpp on the lp and its two parts ur and mr similar to lai the interannual variation of the maximum gpp is larger than the actual gpp across the entire study area however unlike lai the maximum gpp is higher than the actual gpp on both ur and mr by 8 and 19 respectively therefore on the entire lp the gpp improvement under the maximum scenario is larger than that of the lai reaching 18 5 the spatial distribution of wue calculated by the analytical wue model at different situations is shown in fig 10 and is also similar to that of gpp and lai the average of wuedif increases with precipitation the average actual wue on the lp in the typical wet normal and dry years in the actual scenario is 0 97 0 95 and 0 95 g c mm 1 h2o and the change caused by precipitation is very small the average of the maximum wue are 1 22 1 12 and 1 04 g c mm 1 h2o with an increase of 25 8 17 9 and 9 5 respectively fig 11 shows the spatially averaged actual and maximum wue on the lp and its two parts on the ur the multi year average maximum wue 0 54 g c mm 1 h2o is slightly smaller than the actual wue 0 55 g c mm 1 h2o like lai on the mr the multi year average maximum wue is much higher than the actual wue by 14 5 over the entire study area the maximum wue was 0 16 g c mm 1 h2o higher than the actual wue because gpp and et both changed in the same direction during the improvement of lai the change of wue before and after optimization was about 14 5 of the actual wue thus wue was found to be more robust 5 discussion in the lp precipitation is the major source of water resources for agricultural productivity li et al 2001 at the same time the yellow river whose basin covers most of the lp area does not show a significant increase in discharge after passing through the lp even shows a decreasing trend shi et al 2019 therefore in this study we only considered p and et in the calculation of maximum lai and did not simulate surface runoff also the precipitation characteristics of the lp mean the efficient use of water resources is important for both ecological restoration and production such that more careful consideration is needed for the final maximum vegetation plan in this study the normal year p 50 in the study period was selected for the typical scenario and the spatial distributions of lai in the wet year p 25 and the dry year p 75 were found to be similar to those in the normal year we finally explored the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources in each grid and estimated the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency of this maximum scenario changes in vegetation will have complex effects on evapotranspiration and precipitation through changes in their various components jian et al 2015 therefore this study developed an approach to estimate the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources using an optimized s w model this model was verified with observational data at 12 sites with different land cover types across china and then 6 representative sites on the lp figs 2 3 the s w model optimized by adding a carbon dioxide factor performs better than the original model however the improvement is very limited as fig 2 shows this is mainly because the carbon dioxide is only one of the five limiting functions and its concentration change is limited within the test time although the model performs well there is a slight underestimation of et on the lp which may lead to a larger estimated available water resources leading to a higher maximum lai and corresponding gpp wue overestimation then the optimized s w model was applied to the lp to obtain the evapotranspiration of the study area and compared with p to analyze the current utilization of rainwater resources on the lp the p et showed distinct characteristics in different regions fig 5c without considering irrigation p is generally lower than et in the upper reaches of the yellow river indicating that water resources in this area are already overstretched in other areas of the lp precipitation is mostly much greater than evapotranspiration indicating surplus water resources in these areas consistent with previous studies shao et al 2021 the multi year average p et on the entire lp is 109 48 mm indicating that the rainwater resource still has potential for utilization on the lp in this study p et represents the current rainwater resource utilization potential so the distribution of lai gpp and wue difference between the maximum scenario and the actual scenario is similar to that of p et as shown in fig 6 in the typical normal year the maximum lai is higher than the observed lai in most areas indicating that if the water resources can be fully utilized by vegetation then more vegetation can be supported however in most areas of the upper reaches of the yellow river laidif is negative and even if the lai is set to 0 in some areas the evaporation is still greater than the precipitation indicated by red shading in fig 6 indicating that the water resources in these areas have been overstretched as shown in fig 7 the lai on ur does not increase in the maximum scenario during the entire study period and is even lower than the observed value but it increases significantly on mr and the entire lp laiact does not change much in different typical years but laimax decreases sharply in the dry year and increases sharply in the wet year compared with the typical normal year the inter annual variability of the maximum lai is greater than the observations and the spatial average is also higher most of the time but the maximum lai will be lower than the observed values when there is little precipitation fig 7 this is because the vegetation in the ecosystem has some temporal stability persistence which is not accounted for in vegetation simulations based only on annual precipitation hautier et al 2015 loreau de mazancourt 2013 in summary across most areas of the lp except for the upper reach of the yellow river the maximum lai that the available rainwater resources can support is higher than the observed lai and in the typical normal year laimax is 11 5 higher than laiact the above discussion excludes irrigated districts in which the volume of available water is actually positive due to a large volume of irrigation water therefore irrigation districts located in this area typically have greater lai than the maximum scenario owing to ample irrigation nevertheless there is a wastage of water resources here due to an inadequate drainage system leading to a poor water resources utilization even with sufficient irrigation xiong et al 1996 while strongly affecting et and the water cycle revegetation also has a profound impact on the carbon cycle of the entire lp by affecting vegetation carbon sequestration du et al 2021 marbà et al 2015 therefore it is important to understand the state of the carbon cycle under the scenario of maximum lai supported by rainwater resources this question was addressed with an analytical wue model applied to the ecosystem wue calculation in the lp which was then combined with the previously calculated et to obtain the gpp similar to the s w model this study applied the analytical wue model to all of china and verified it at 9 flux sites across china fig 3 the verification results show that the model accurately simulates gpp here gpp is closely related to vegetation transpiration cheng et al 2017 generally a higher lai corresponds to denser vegetation and an increase in transpiration therefore the distributions of gpp and lai are consistent among the three main vegetation types forest farmland and grassland on the lp forest shows the highest gpp and also the greatest change during 1982 2015 fig s1 forest is thus the most important land use type affecting the overall gpp in the study area under the influence of the gfgp large scale vegetation restoration during the study period rapidly improved the vegetation conditions fu et al 2017 li et al 2018 and the gpp of the lp has also greatly increased in recent years which is consistent with previous studies cao et al 2020 similar to the distribution of vegetation on the lp the spatial distribution of gpp on the lp shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest areas with sufficient water resources and greater vegetation coverage mostly forest make the dominant contribution to the gpp in the study area compared with the actual gpp the gpp under the maximum vegetation scenario is significantly greater because the maximum lai was generally higher than the actual however compared to lai the improvement of gpp from the actual scenario to the maximum scenario is larger in the typical dry year gppmax is still 9 higher than gppact while gppmax is also higher on ur than gppact throughout the study period this is because in the maximum scenario the gpp contribution of areas with reduced lai is smaller while the gpp increase of areas with increased lai is greater which shows that the carbon sequestration of vegetation can be effectively increased through appropriate spatial allocation of water resources the maximum spatial average gpp on the lp is 143 7 g c m 2 year 1 higher than the actual in the typical normal year which means more carbon could be sequestrated on the entire lp if the maximum lai scenario is reached the distribution of wue in the study area is very similar to that of gpp and lai as fig 10 shows the wue of the maximum scenarios showed less improvement from the actual scenarios than that of gpp only increases by 17 9 in the normal year while wuemax is even smaller than wueact in the dry year this is because the increase in lai induces increases in both the gpp and et components of wue of which gpp increases faster similar to lai the wue in the maximum scenario is lower than the actual scenario on the ur and higher than the actual scenario on the mr and the whole lp fig 11 in general the average canopy transpiration increased markedly and although the increase in lai also resulted in a decrease in soil evaporation total evapotranspiration still increased after the increase in lai et gpp and wue are all positively correlated with the lai but the change in wue was smaller also with the increase of lai although ecosystem wue is increasing the marginal cost gradually increases since maximum lai was generally higher than the actual gpp and wue also showed a growth trend after the increase of lai fig s5 there are two main limitations to our study firstly the maximum lai above was obtained under multiple ideal conditions and will have a deviation from the actual situation for example streamflow was not considered in the calculation all the precipitation was used for ecological restoration so the social water use was not considered previous studies have pointed out that vegetation restoration on lp will lead to a decrease in soil moisture feng et al 2016 which was not considered in this study both of these restrictions will reduce the amount of water available for vegetation making it difficult for the maximum sustainable recovery of actual vegetation to reach the level calculated in this study therefore it is necessary to consider the hydrological effects of social water use and vegetation restoration in future studies to make the simulation result closer to the actual vegetation restoration situation secondly the calculation of et does not take into account the efficiency of the use of water resources indeed not all water resources can be effectively used by vegetation therefore to achieve the optimal state of vegetation restoration it is necessary to establish a strategy for utilizing precipitation water zhang et al 2014 this will require more detailed research therefore the maximum lai obtained by this study is in an extreme ideal case to initially explore the maximum supporting capacity of current precipitation in vegetation restoration the lai gpp and wue under the maximum scenario in the study are theoretical upper limits which should only be approached but not reached in practice furthermore in this study the maximum scenario was calculated year by year which assumes that annual precipitation can ideally be redistributed for vegetation growth therefore to approach the maximum scenario in addition to directly increasing vegetation coverage through vegetation restoration the most important thing is to improve the ability of vegetation to utilize rainwater resources and scholars have made many effective attempts on the lp gan et al 2013 li et al 2013 first in order to ensure the water supply of vegetation the spatial and temporal allocation of rainwater resources is necessary mutiga et al 2010 terencio et al 2017 the second is the need to improve the water use efficiency of vegetation modern agricultural measures such as optimizing planting structure regulating runoff and increasing soil infiltration can help to achieve this goal song et al 2020 wu 2007 new methods of saving water and utilizing rainwater need to be further researched in addition to these existing technologies in summary the models used in this study have shown good reliability enabling accurate assessment of the water and carbon cycles in the study area thus demonstrating that the approach of obtaining the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources is appropriate although the maximum vegetation scenarios can be further improved due to the limitation of the models employed here the estimates of maximum lai supported by rainwater resources and the corresponding carbon cycle assessment in this study are still instructive for vegetation restoration in the study area here the et on the lp calculated in this study indicate that the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources is generally greater than the observations and there is still room for improvement in carbon sequestration capacity in further research it will be necessary to study the interaction between vegetation and water changes to more accurately assess the effect of vegetation restoration and to evaluate the effect of vegetation restoration on the lp and on other large scale vegetation restoration processes 6 conclusions in this study the s w model was applied to the lp to calculate evapotranspiration this was then used with precipitation data to estimate the maximum lai that can be supported by the available rainwater resources the analytical wue model was used to evaluate the corresponding carbon cycle situations the lai on the lp has increased significantly since the launch of the gfgp resulting in an increase of canopy transpiration and a decrease of soil evaporation meanwhile p et remained generally positive and showed little increase therefore the results show that the spatial average maximum lai supported by rainwater resources is 11 5 higher than the observed lai indeed the maximum scenario showed higher lai than the observed lai across most areas of the lp a notable exception was the upper reach of the yellow river the evapotranspiration in these areas are much larger than the precipitation making the lai under the maximum scenario lower than the actual value over the lp higher lai i e greater vegetation cover than the maximum scenario led to an increase in both et and wue inducing an increase of ecosystem gpp and reduced improvement of wue the maximum scenario would enable the ecosystem to absorb 25 0 more carbon with 17 9 better wue our study provides the theoretical upper limit of vegetation restoration on the lp in terms of water resources and also indicates that discussion about the optimization of water resources is necessary to ensure maximum water use benefits the research topics in future can be estimation of runoff and other social water use which helps to accurately estimate available water resources and studying impacts of modern agricultural measures on water and carbon cycle by saving water and increasing productivity the restoration of vegetation on the lp is still a complex subject which requires more in depth

2144,large scale anthropogenic revegetation brings new challenges by enhancing water consumptions in non humid regions even if it improves ecosystems water resources in water stressed areas are primarily provided by precipitation and excessive afforestation can potentially lead to severe imbalance between water supply and demand due to limited rainwater resources therefore it is essential to evaluate the maximum vegetation coverage and productivity capacity supported by rainwater resources in this study the sustainability of revegetation was characterized by calculating the upper limit of vegetation leaf area index lai supported by rainwater resources the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency of the maximum and the actual vegetation scenario were compared over the loess plateau lp which is well known as a region experiencing both large scale vegetation restoration and severe water shortages the upper limit on lai was calculated based on evapotranspiration et supported by rainwater resources using the shuttleworth wallace s w model optimized in this study by adding dynamic vegetation and carbon dioxide components the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency of vegetation under different restoration scenarios were estimated in an analytical water use efficiency wue model both the models perform well and are consistent with observations the results show that the lai of the maximum vegetation scenario is 11 5 higher than the actual scenario if vegetation on the lp is restored to its maximum level the average gross primary productivity under the maximum vegetation scenario is 25 0 higher than the actual scenario while the ecosystem wue will increase by 17 9 it should be noticed that the maximum scenario is a theoretical upper limit based on ideal assumptions our findings reveal that improving rainwater utilization efficiency can further develop the potential of sustainable vegetation restoration while improve its efficiency and will provide guidance and theoretical support for vegetation restoration planning on water scarce regions keywords evapotranspiration maximum vegetation capacity rainwater use ecosystem water use efficiency water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the main measures for soil and water conservation large scale anthropogenic revegetation can restore ecological processes and improve local ecosystems its numerous benefits include bio conservation reduction of soil erosion and regulation of hydro climatic conditions bryan et al 2018 gao et al 2018 neuenkamp et al 2019 large scale revegetation can lead to an increase in regional evaporative water consumption thereby decreasing water availability jia et al 2019 macreadie et al 2019 murray et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 in turn this can exacerbate tensions between water supply and demand in water scarce regions and challenge the sustainability of vegetation restoration su fu 2013 also revegetation increases the carbon sequestration capacity of an ecosystem by increasing its strength as a carbon sink thus mitigating the effect of climate change and plays an important role in carbon neutrality feng et al 2016 menz et al 2013 anthropogenic revegetation can be considered as a trade off between carbon sequestration and water usage consequently the water shortages affecting arid and semi arid region are making the study of this trade off increasingly urgent wu et al 2018 to maintain the sustainability of vegetation restoration in these regions it is important to provide an estimate of the maximum level of vegetation cover supported by rainwater resources as a reference upper limit of revegetation this requires estimates of the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency associated with the maximum level of vegetation cover and the actual vegetation cover from these two aspects the sustainability and benefits of vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid areas can be evaluated feng et al 2016 the loess plateau lp is one of the regions with the greatest restoration of vegetation since the implementation of the grain for green project gfgp in 1999 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the vegetation coverage increased approximately 45 from 1970s to 2010 demonstrating the effectiveness of the vegetation restoration effort wang et al 2012 on this basis the lp was chosen as a typical area to explore the effect of anthropogenic revegetation in this study as a consequence of large scale vegetation restoration the rapid increase in vegetation water consumption has created challenges for sustainable vegetation restoration fu et al 2017 li et al 2018 the limited precipitation is the main source of water resources on the lp shi et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 leading to ecological fragility and high sensitivity to climate change and to human activities zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 previous studies have addressed the impact of vegetation changes on the water balance of this area but several questions associated with these challenges remain unanswered such as whether the intensity of vegetation restoration on the lp has reached the limit of water resources whether the current vegetation restoration rate is sustainable and how will continued vegetation restoration affect carbon sequestration and its efficiency cao et al 2009 chen et al 2015a chen et al 2015b therefore there is an urgent need to 1 accurately estimate vegetation water consumption under different vegetation conditions and to find the maximum vegetation coverage that can be supported by rainwater resources and 2 evaluate how this level of coverage could affect the water and carbon cycle on the lp in this study we explore these two issues by investigating the maximum leaf area index lai supported by rainwater resources and analyzing the carbon sequestration capacity and its efficiency of vegetation under different vegetation scenarios the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources is defined in this study as the lai when all of the precipitation is used for evapotranspiration in which case the amount of precipitation p is equal to the amount of evapotranspiration et in the calculation of maximum lai p does not change and because the change of vegetation exerts strong and complicated impacts on the hydrological cycle a model that can accurately reflect the impact of vegetation changes on et changes is necessary wei et al 2017 among the commonly used et models which fully consider both canopy and substrate et process the shuttleworth wallace s w model has been well validated hu et al 2009 ortega farias et al 2010 stannard 1993 the calculation of the resistance parameters is a critical part of the model enabling accurate simulations of the evaporation process daamen simmonds 1996 dolman 1993 however since its development limitations of the resistance parameter calculation method have generally restricted the s w model to small scale applications hu et al 2009 ortega farias et al 2010 subsequently the improved s w model has been applied on the regional scale providing resistance parameters for different land cover use types and reliable results have been obtained following improvement to the resistance calculation method zhou et al 2006 meanwhile changes in carbon dioxide concentration due to climate change affect bulk stomatal resistance and thus et niu et al 2013 yang et al 2019 in this study the performance of the s w model was improved by adding a limiting function of carbon dioxide concentration to the jarvis model which is used to calculate the bulk stomatal resistance of the canopy li et al 2019a li et al 2019b with p data from near surface datasets and et calculated the maximum vegetation coverage scenario considering the limitation of rainwater resources was obtained the gfgp has played an important role in minimizing soil erosion reducing flood risks and conserving water resources on the lp since its launch fu et al 2017 at the same time since the forest is the largest carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems afforestation has also had a profound impact on the carbon cycle of the lp fatichi et al 2019 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b to explore changes in the carbon cycle we adopted gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem water use efficiency wue as indicators of carbon sequestration and production efficiency gpp is the most important component of carbon exchange in the land atmosphere system representing the production level of terrestrial ecosystems in the natural environment and has an important impact on atmospheric co2 concentration and climate change sun et al 2018 since there is a strong coupling between the terrestrial carbon cycle and the water cycle then ecosystem wue which is calculated by dividing gpp by et is widely used to characterize the hydrological efficiency of ecosystem productivity yang et al 2016 similar to the acquisition of et data models are usually used for obtaining ecosystem gpp over long time series on a global or regional scale anav et al 2015 yuan et al 2014a yuan et al 2014b a new model developed by cheng et al 2017 was used in this study to estimate gpp constrained by hydrological measurements by upscaling leaf wue from leaf to ecosystem scale directly because the distribution of et components was already calculated in the improved s w model the upscaling process was simplified and gpp was readily obtained by multiplying wue and et in this study the optimized s w model was used to estimate et in different vegetation scenes and the output et was compared with p data under different scenarios next an inversion approach was used to calculate the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources and the carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation under different vegetation scenarios was then analyzed by the analytical wue model based on the surface water balance and on the improved s w model and analytical wue model in this study we evaluated the vegetation restoration status and carbon and water cycles on the lp the objectives focus on two aspects as follows 1 to calculate et using the optimized s w model in the study area and then to adjust lai to obtain the maximum vegetation coverage that can be supported by the available water resources and 2 to investigate changes in the carbon cycle caused by lai changes by calculating the gpp and wue before and after optimization using the analytical wue model 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the

of the yellow river for a long time the vegetation and ecological environment have been poor and fragile on the lp the lp is often considered as one of the places with most severe water shortages in the world vegetation coverage on the lp has gradually improved since the launch of the grain for green project gfgp in 1999 for example the spatial average lai increased by 0 017 m2 m 2 yr 1 during 2001 2015 shao et al 2019 the annual average precipitation increases from northwest to southeast ranging from 150 to 820 mm over the lp the main vegetation types are farmland forest and grassland and

atmospheric pressure air temperature humidity and radiation to evaluate the performance of the modified s w model across different land covers data from eight flux tower sites in china were used liu et al 2011 and the on site observational data come from field experiments of 7 sites table 1 provides details of the sites also gpp data from fluxnet table 2 was used to validate the analytical wue model pastorello et al 2020 3 methods 3 1 the maximum lai calculation the s w model can reflect the effect of lai changes on evapotranspiration because the resistance calculation is closely related to lai therefore the s w model was used in an inversion approach to calculate the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources this calculation was done separately on each grid multi year average lai of every month was first calculated and were used to normalize the intra annual distribution this normalized lai is then multiplied by a parameter increasing in steps of 0 01 from zero until the annual average reaches the historical maximum the lai calculated were input into the s w model although meteorological and soil factors did not change the value of lai when p was equal to et was then defined as the maximum lai supported by the rainwater resources for the year therefore the maximum lai is calculated on each grid for each year we excluded major irrigation districts on the loess plateau from the calculation as irrigation rather than precipitation is the main source of water resources in these areas in order to obtain the distribution of rainwater resources under typical scenarios the p iii frequency distribution curve was used to analyze the rainfall frequency of each grid according to the precipitation data from 1982 to 2015 the year where the rainfall frequency is 50 p 50 was classified as the typical normal year for the final maximum vegetation plan in this research and the year where the rainfall frequency is 25 p 25 and 75 p 75 was classified as the typical wet year and the typical dry year 3 2 the modified s w model the total evapotranspiration from the vegetation λ e t was calculated as the sum of evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from the canopy

leaf wue to canopy scale ecosystem transpiration wue can be approximated by leaf wue wue l since previous studies have shown that leaf wue is reasonably independent of the growth environment cheng et

this unit to the commonly used g c mm 1 h2o a factor of 0 667 10 3 was used in this study 4 results 4 1 model validation fig 2 shows the performance of the original and optimized s w model applied at 12 sites with different land cover types across china the modified s w model performed well at 9 stations but less well at selva wetland and ice achieving relative coefficient r values ranging between 0 78 and 0 94 the performance of the s w model is acceptable at the wetland and selva sites and despite the poor performance on the ice due to the extremely small coverage of this type of land cover in the study area the model can be considered to perform well in the region as a whole with a slight underestimate the performance of the optimized s w model on the lp is shown in fig 3 where the six sites on the lp are used in the study including the four most representative land uses on the lp forest farmland shrub and grassland the model performed well in the study area but the underestimation of the result was greater than that of the entire china the analytical wue model outputs were compared and evaluated against the flux tower gpp from fluxnet fig 4 the results of the analytical wue model performed well at each site with r values ranging between 0 73 and 0 95 the results indicated that the s w and the analytical wue model can accurately simulate the et and gpp over the lp 4 2 maximum lai supported by rainwater resources on the lp fig 5 shows the spatial distribution and temporal variation of p a et b and p et c during 1982 2015 on the lp the annual average precipitation in the study area increased by 5 14 mm yr 1 during 2001 2015 compared with precipitation the rate of change of evapotranspiration was lower mainly due to the rapid increase of p during this period the annual average p et of the lp showed an increasing trend during 2001 2015 4 39 mm yr 1 fig 5c although the inter annual fluctuations of p et mainly caused by p were large the spatially averaged p remained generally higher than et on the lp the multi year average precipitation and evapotranspiration both showed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest in the study area p et in the upper reaches of the yellow river ranged from 331 mm to 255 mm and was significantly lower than that in other regions most of the areas with negative p et were also in this region however in most parts of the study area the multi year average precipitation is higher than evapotranspiration and the multi year average p et value is 109 48 mm on the entire lp the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources and p et show strong spatial consistency thus creating a gap with the actual lai fig 6 shows the actual lai laiact maximum lai laimax and their difference laidif in three typical years p 25 p 50 and p 75 during the study period in the normal year with 50 precipitation frequency p et was negative in most areas of the upper reaches of the yellow river therefore the maximum lai is less than the actual value in these places furthermore even if these areas are set as bare soil lai 0 there are some areas on the lp where the values of et were still higher than p indicated by red shading in fig 6 in other parts of the study area mostly the middle reaches of the yellow river p et is positive so the maximum lai is higher than the actual lai changes in annual precipitation do not show much effect on the actual lai but have a significant effect on the maximum lai the spatial average values of the actual lai are 0 67 m2 m 2 p 75 0 69 m2 m 2 p 50 and 0 71 m2 m 2 p 25 in the three typical years which do not change much but the spatial average of the maximum lai varies drastically from 0 67 m2 m 2 in the dry year to 0 92 m2 m 2 in the wet year however the spatial distribution of the maximum lai does not change much although change in precipitation shifts the average value considerably and in the three typical years the distribution of the maximum lai is very similar therefore the spatial distribution of the difference between the maximum lai and the actual lai laidif in fig 6 also does not change much fig 7 shows the spatially averaged actual and maximum lai on the lp and its two parts the upper reach of the yellow river ur and the middle reach of the yellow river mr the interannual variation of the maximum lai is larger than the actual lai across the entire study area and its parts on the upper reaches of the yellow river in the study area the multi year average maximum lai 0 38 m2 m 2 is slightly smaller approximately 2 than the actual lai on the middle reaches of the yellow river the multi year average maximum lai is 0 90 m2 m 2 15 1 higher than the actual lai 0 78 m2 m 2 although its fluctuation range is larger overall the spatio temporal heterogeneity of maximum lai was more obvious when compared with the actual lai and the maximum lai with an average value of 0 75 m2 m 2 was 14 3 higher than the actual lai 4 3 difference between simulated gpp and wue of maximum and actual scenarios fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the actual gpp gppact maximum gpp gppmax and their difference gppdif in three typical years p 25 p 50 and p 75 during the study period this reveals that the spatial distribution of gpp also gradually decreases from southeast to northwest consistent with lai however unlike lai the difference between gpp of different vegetation types is more obvious because the parameter g1 in the analytical wue model varies with vegetation type forest farmland and grassland gpps are the main contributor to total gpp in the entire study area and the annual average value of forest gpp is 1613 g c m 2 which is much higher than the farmland average of 911 g c m 2 and the grassland average of 400 g c m 2 fig s1 in the normal year with 50 precipitation frequency the areas where the maximum gpp is lower than the actual gpp are concentrated in the upper reaches of the yellow river in most areas of the study area the maximum gpp has improved similar to the lai forest has the greatest vegetation coverage and largest gpp therefore the increase in gpp caused by the increase in lai is most obvious in forest and is much higher than that in grassland and farmland on the entire lp the multi year average of maximum gpp is 718 84 g c m 2 which is 24 98 higher than the actual situation similar to lai changes in precipitation have little effect on the actual gpp but the average value of the maximum gpp varies with precipitation the maximum gpp increased by 38 in the typical wet year compared to 9 4 in the typical dry year fig 9 shows the spatially averaged actual and maximum gpp on the lp and its two parts ur and mr similar to lai the interannual variation of the maximum gpp is larger than the actual gpp across the entire study area however unlike lai the maximum gpp is higher than the actual gpp on both ur and mr by 8 and 19 respectively therefore on the entire lp the gpp improvement under the maximum scenario is larger than that of the lai reaching 18 5 the spatial distribution of wue calculated by the analytical wue model at different situations is shown in fig 10 and is also similar to that of gpp and lai the average of wuedif increases with precipitation the average actual wue on the lp in the typical wet normal and dry years in the actual scenario is 0 97 0 95 and 0 95 g c mm 1 h2o and the change caused by precipitation is very small the average of the maximum wue are 1 22 1 12 and 1 04 g c mm 1 h2o with an increase of 25 8 17 9 and 9 5 respectively fig 11 shows the spatially averaged actual and maximum wue on the lp and its two parts on the ur the multi year average maximum wue 0 54 g c mm 1 h2o is slightly smaller than the actual wue 0 55 g c mm 1 h2o like lai on the mr the multi year average maximum wue is much higher than the actual wue by 14 5 over the entire study area the maximum wue was 0 16 g c mm 1 h2o higher than the actual wue because gpp and et both changed in the same direction during the improvement of lai the change of wue before and after optimization was about 14 5 of the actual wue thus wue was found to be more robust 5 discussion in the lp precipitation is the major source of water resources for agricultural productivity li et al 2001 at the same time the yellow river whose basin covers most of the lp area does not show a significant increase in discharge after passing through the lp even shows a decreasing trend shi et al 2019 therefore in this study we only considered p and et in the calculation of maximum lai and did not simulate surface runoff also the precipitation characteristics of the lp mean the efficient use of water resources is important for both ecological restoration and production such that more careful consideration is needed for the final maximum vegetation plan in this study the normal year p 50 in the study period was selected for the typical scenario and the spatial distributions of lai in the wet year p 25 and the dry year p 75 were found to be similar to those in the normal year we finally explored the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources in each grid and estimated the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency of this maximum scenario changes in vegetation will have complex effects on evapotranspiration and precipitation through changes in their various components jian et al 2015 therefore this study developed an approach to estimate the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources using an optimized s w model this model was verified with observational data at 12 sites with different land cover types across china and then 6 representative sites on the lp figs 2 3 the s w model optimized by adding a carbon dioxide factor performs better than the original model however the improvement is very limited as fig 2 shows this is mainly because the carbon dioxide is only one of the five limiting functions and its concentration change is limited within the test time although the model performs well there is a slight underestimation of et on the lp which may lead to a larger estimated available water resources leading to a higher maximum lai and corresponding gpp wue overestimation then the optimized s w model was applied to the lp to obtain the evapotranspiration of the study area and compared with p to analyze the current utilization of rainwater resources on the lp the p et showed distinct characteristics in different regions fig 5c without considering irrigation p is generally lower than et in the upper reaches of the yellow river indicating that water resources in this area are already overstretched in other areas of the lp precipitation is mostly much greater than evapotranspiration indicating surplus water resources in these areas consistent with previous studies shao et al 2021 the multi year average p et on the entire lp is 109 48 mm indicating that the rainwater resource still has potential for utilization on the lp in this study p et represents the current rainwater resource utilization potential so the distribution of lai gpp and wue difference between the maximum scenario and the actual scenario is similar to that of p et as shown in fig 6 in the typical normal year the maximum lai is higher than the observed lai in most areas indicating that if the water resources can be fully utilized by vegetation then more vegetation can be supported however in most areas of the upper reaches of the yellow river laidif is negative and even if the lai is set to 0 in some areas the evaporation is still greater than the precipitation indicated by red shading in fig 6 indicating that the water resources in these areas have been overstretched as shown in fig 7 the lai on ur does not increase in the maximum scenario during the entire study period and is even lower than the observed value but it increases significantly on mr and the entire lp laiact does not change much in different typical years but laimax decreases sharply in the dry year and increases sharply in the wet year compared with the typical normal year the inter annual variability of the maximum lai is greater than the observations and the spatial average is also higher most of the time but the maximum lai will be lower than the observed values when there is little precipitation fig 7 this is because the vegetation in the ecosystem has some temporal stability persistence which is not accounted for in vegetation simulations based only on annual precipitation hautier et al 2015 loreau de mazancourt 2013 in summary across most areas of the lp except for the upper reach of the yellow river the maximum lai that the available rainwater resources can support is higher than the observed lai and in the typical normal year laimax is 11 5 higher than laiact the above discussion excludes irrigated districts in which the volume of available water is actually positive due to a large volume of irrigation water therefore irrigation districts located in this area typically have greater lai than the maximum scenario owing to ample irrigation nevertheless there is a wastage of water resources here due to an inadequate drainage system leading to a poor water resources utilization even with sufficient irrigation xiong et al 1996 while strongly affecting et and the water cycle revegetation also has a profound impact on the carbon cycle of the entire lp by affecting vegetation carbon sequestration du et al 2021 marbà et al 2015 therefore it is important to understand the state of the carbon cycle under the scenario of maximum lai supported by rainwater resources this question was addressed with an analytical wue model applied to the ecosystem wue calculation in the lp which was then combined with the previously calculated et to obtain the gpp similar to the s w model this study applied the analytical wue model to all of china and verified it at 9 flux sites across china fig 3 the verification results show that the model accurately simulates gpp here gpp is closely related to vegetation transpiration cheng et al 2017 generally a higher lai corresponds to denser vegetation and an increase in transpiration therefore the distributions of gpp and lai are consistent among the three main vegetation types forest farmland and grassland on the lp forest shows the highest gpp and also the greatest change during 1982 2015 fig s1 forest is thus the most important land use type affecting the overall gpp in the study area under the influence of the gfgp large scale vegetation restoration during the study period rapidly improved the vegetation conditions fu et al 2017 li et al 2018 and the gpp of the lp has also greatly increased in recent years which is consistent with previous studies cao et al 2020 similar to the distribution of vegetation on the lp the spatial distribution of gpp on the lp shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest areas with sufficient water resources and greater vegetation coverage mostly forest make the dominant contribution to the gpp in the study area compared with the actual gpp the gpp under the maximum vegetation scenario is significantly greater because the maximum lai was generally higher than the actual however compared to lai the improvement of gpp from the actual scenario to the maximum scenario is larger in the typical dry year gppmax is still 9 higher than gppact while gppmax is also higher on ur than gppact throughout the study period this is because in the maximum scenario the gpp contribution of areas with reduced lai is smaller while the gpp increase of areas with increased lai is greater which shows that the carbon sequestration of vegetation can be effectively increased through appropriate spatial allocation of water resources the maximum spatial average gpp on the lp is 143 7 g c m 2 year 1 higher than the actual in the typical normal year which means more carbon could be sequestrated on the entire lp if the maximum lai scenario is reached the distribution of wue in the study area is very similar to that of gpp and lai as fig 10 shows the wue of the maximum scenarios showed less improvement from the actual scenarios than that of gpp only increases by 17 9 in the normal year while wuemax is even smaller than wueact in the dry year this is because the increase in lai induces increases in both the gpp and et components of wue of which gpp increases faster similar to lai the wue in the maximum scenario is lower than the actual scenario on the ur and higher than the actual scenario on the mr and the whole lp fig 11 in general the average canopy transpiration increased markedly and although the increase in lai also resulted in a decrease in soil evaporation total evapotranspiration still increased after the increase in lai et gpp and wue are all positively correlated with the lai but the change in wue was smaller also with the increase of lai although ecosystem wue is increasing the marginal cost gradually increases since maximum lai was generally higher than the actual gpp and wue also showed a growth trend after the increase of lai fig s5 there are two main limitations to our study firstly the maximum lai above was obtained under multiple ideal conditions and will have a deviation from the actual situation for example streamflow was not considered in the calculation all the precipitation was used for ecological restoration so the social water use was not considered previous studies have pointed out that vegetation restoration on lp will lead to a decrease in soil moisture feng et al 2016 which was not considered in this study both of these restrictions will reduce the amount of water available for vegetation making it difficult for the maximum sustainable recovery of actual vegetation to reach the level calculated in this study therefore it is necessary to consider the hydrological effects of social water use and vegetation restoration in future studies to make the simulation result closer to the actual vegetation restoration situation secondly the calculation of et does not take into account the efficiency of the use of water resources indeed not all water resources can be effectively used by vegetation therefore to achieve the optimal state of vegetation restoration it is necessary to establish a strategy for utilizing precipitation water zhang et al 2014 this will require more detailed research therefore the maximum lai obtained by this study is in an extreme ideal case to initially explore the maximum supporting capacity of current precipitation in vegetation restoration the lai gpp and wue under the maximum scenario in the study are theoretical upper limits which should only be approached but not reached in practice furthermore in this study the maximum scenario was calculated year by year which assumes that annual precipitation can ideally be redistributed for vegetation growth therefore to approach the maximum scenario in addition to directly increasing vegetation coverage through vegetation restoration the most important thing is to improve the ability of vegetation to utilize rainwater resources and scholars have made many effective attempts on the lp gan et al 2013 li et al 2013 first in order to ensure the water supply of vegetation the spatial and temporal allocation of rainwater resources is necessary mutiga et al 2010 terencio et al 2017 the second is the need to improve the water use efficiency of vegetation modern agricultural measures such as optimizing planting structure regulating runoff and increasing soil infiltration can help to achieve this goal song et al 2020 wu 2007 new methods of saving water and utilizing rainwater need to be further researched in addition to these existing technologies in summary the models used in this study have shown good reliability enabling accurate assessment of the water and carbon cycles in the study area thus demonstrating that the approach of obtaining the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources is appropriate although the maximum vegetation scenarios can be further improved due to the limitation of the models employed here the estimates of maximum lai supported by rainwater resources and the corresponding carbon cycle assessment in this study are still instructive for vegetation restoration in the study area here the et on the lp calculated in this study indicate that the maximum lai supported by rainwater resources is generally greater than the observations and there is still room for improvement in carbon sequestration capacity in further research it will be necessary to study the interaction between vegetation and water changes to more accurately assess the effect of vegetation restoration and to evaluate the effect of vegetation restoration on the lp and on other large scale vegetation restoration processes 6 conclusions in this study the s w model was applied to the lp to calculate evapotranspiration this was then used with precipitation data to estimate the maximum lai that can be supported by the available rainwater resources the analytical wue model was used to evaluate the corresponding carbon cycle situations the lai on the lp has increased significantly since the launch of the gfgp resulting in an increase of canopy transpiration and a decrease of soil evaporation meanwhile p et remained generally positive and showed little increase therefore the results show that the spatial average maximum lai supported by rainwater resources is 11 5 higher than the observed lai indeed the maximum scenario showed higher lai than the observed lai across most areas of the lp a notable exception was the upper reach of the yellow river the evapotranspiration in these areas are much larger than the precipitation making the lai under the maximum scenario lower than the actual value over the lp higher lai i e greater vegetation cover than the maximum scenario led to an increase in both et and wue inducing an increase of ecosystem gpp and reduced improvement of wue the maximum scenario would enable the ecosystem to absorb 25 0 more carbon with 17 9 better wue our study provides the theoretical upper limit of vegetation restoration on the lp in terms of water resources and also indicates that discussion about the optimization of water resources is necessary to ensure maximum water use benefits the research topics in future can be estimation of runoff and other social water use which helps to accurately estimate available water resources and studying impacts of modern agricultural measures on water and carbon cycle by saving water and increasing productivity the restoration of vegetation on the lp is still a complex subject which requires more in depth
