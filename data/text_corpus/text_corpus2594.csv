water composes more than two thirds of the earth s surface and is a critical resource for living organisms however despite its abundance the consumable form of water is limited 1 moreover numerous ailments transmit through water hence real time monitoring of water quality wq is essential 2 commonly assessing wq entails collecting water samples from various sites at different time intervals and evaluating them in laboratories however manual sampling and laboratory analysis of wq for any given water body or process can be inefficient expensive and time consuming as a result intelligent systems are increasingly used to monitor wq especially when real time data are needed 3 4 machine learning ml is a crucial part of artificial intelligence ai that allows a system to automatically learn and improve from experience without having to be explicitly programmed 5 the techniques used in ml are based on a thorough examination of data to spot trends and update themselves accordingly 6 7 ml offers great opportunities for assessing classifying and predicting wq indicators in water studies for example ml models can effectively simulate hydrological processes and contaminants transport subject to the availability of adequate sets data 8 detecting wq parameters benefits from the availability of sensors such as photosensors that rely on determining the wavelength for a specific color 9 for example phosphorus detection can be achieved colorimetrically with color resulting from a chemical reaction between a particular reagent and phosphorus other sensors rely on fluctuations in capacitance values which can be used to detect various dissolved water contaminants 10 outputs of such techniques can generate a good amount of data processed using ai quickly accurately reliable and

possibilities 2 methodology classification predictive modelling is the task of approximating a mapping function type of classifier from input variables data to discrete output variables classification before employing ml models to analyze the data prior actions were taken to prepare the data as input to the model this included dividing the data into training and testing sets to train the 7 model

used to predict water quality classification wqc using the identified factors see section 2 2 for all classifier details the suggested technique for the current study is shown in fig 1 the following subsections explain each part of the framework of the proposed system and how it has been used 2 1 dataset description and processing 2 1 1 dataset this drinking water quality data was collected from various indian states 25 between 2005 and 2014 a total of 1679 samples were collected and analyzed for dissolved oxygen do ph conductivity biochemical oxygen demand bod nitrate fecal coliform and total coliform more information about the dataset can be obtained from the link mentioned in the data availability section in addition the data were subjected to a preprocessing step to improve data quality data preprocessing encompasses all steps required to avoid irrelevant entries by cleaning i e removing outliers and labeling the data 2 1 2 determination of water quality index the water quality index wqi is calculated by averaging the individual index values of some or all the parameters used 26 in this study the wqi scores were used to categorize the water samples and the following relation was used to compute the wqi 1 wqi i 1 n q i w i i 1 n w i 2 q i 100 v i v ideal s i v ideal 3 w i k s i 4 k 1 i 1 n s i where n denotes the number of the total parameter q i denotes the quality estimate scale for each parameter i calculated by eq 2 w i denotes each parameter s unit weight v i is a measured value that refers to the water samples tested v ideal is an outstanding reference value and indicates pure water 0 for all parameters except do 14 6 mg l and ph 7 0 s i is an expected value suggested for parameter i as tabulated in table 1 26 and k in eq 4 denotes the proportionality constant water quality classification wqc is also a factor to consider wqc may be calculated using the criteria shown in table 2 28 in addition table 3 shows various statistical values count mean standard deviation min 25 50 75 and max for the dataset s input variables e g do ph dissolved oxygen conductivity bod nitrate and fecal and total coliform 27 2 1 3 data analysis smote the synthetic minority oversampling technique smote algorithm is an oversampling technique used for class imbalance it adopts a subset of data from the minority classes and then produces related new synthetic examples the synthetic instances are then added to the original data set in this procedure smote creates a sample from the line between the minority class samples and their neighbors the additional dataset may be utilized to train the classification model thus overcoming overfitting produced by simple random oversampling 30 the schematic diagram of the synthetic instances of the smote algorithm is shown in fig 2 repeated stratified k fold cross validation was used to evaluate the model after defining the algorithm with any required hyperparameters i e by using the defaults moreover the three 10 fold cross validation repeats were applied which means the model can fit and evaluate 30 models on the dataset three times with 10 fold cross validation the dataset is stratified which means that each fold of the cross validation split has the same class distribution as the original dataset with a 1 100 ratio in this case on the other hand the roc area under curve auc metric has been used to evaluate the model this may be overly optimistic for severely imbalanced datasets but it still shows a relative change with better performing models 2 2 classifiers for these simulations jupyter via anaconda navigator was used with python programming language the machine used had an intel i7 core 7th generation processor and 16gb ram this section presents brief descriptions of all the classifiers used in the model 2 2 1 support vector machine svm the support vector machine svm is a discriminative approach based on creating a hyper plane to minimize errors that may be used for both classification and regression problems 31 the observation dataset can be represented as follows 5 d s x i y i i 1 n where x i represents the inputs and y i defines the outputs with a linear function as illustrated in eq 5 for modelling system s with observation dataset d s that is calculated in eq 5 for numbers of variables n 6 f x ω ϕ x b the maximum of eq 7 is the optimum function subject to eq 8 as svm uses a new type of loss function this means that the loss function can be employed in the form of an insensitive loss function 7 min ω b ξ ξ 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξi ξi 8 s t y i ω t ϕ x b ε ξi y i ω t ϕ x b ε ξi ξi ξi 0 i 1 2 n where ϕ x denotes a kernel function k as in a polynomial radial basis or linear function b denote represents weigh and basis vectors c denotes a pre specified value to penalize the training error ξ i and ξ i denote the lower and upper output constraints respectively support vector machine is highly efficient in many cases such as handling higher dimensional data when features are more than training examples and for inseparable classes when the almost negligible effect of outliers as hyperplane is impacted only by the support vectors on the other hand though svm consumes more time and is unsuitable for a more extensive dataset its performance gets low in case of overlapped classes picking the proper kernel function can be tricky 32 moreover the values of svm used in the code are shown in table 4 2 2 2 random forest regression and classification are conducted by the random forest rf technique that operates by constructing an ensemble of decision trees in training by swapping and changing the covariates to improve the prediction performance the weighted average of tree outputs is used to achieve the goal as rf has many potential features generated from different nodes this model requires many trained trees and a certain amount of the variable in each tree the rf classifier is a reliable algorithm that surpasses several other classification algorithms in terms of accuracy the parameters that were utilized were as follows estimators 300 maximum depth 100 and minimum sample split 3 33 the first step for the rf classification technique is to randomly select k features from a list of m characteristics where k m followed by finding d using an ideal rift point the node between the k features afterward the node may be divided into two daughter nodes by using the most excellent rift then repeat steps until the desired number of nodes has been reached lastly repetition of all steps results in the growth of n trees 34 additionally the rf prediction process steps initially take the test characteristics and predict the outcome using the rules of each randomly generated decision tree then save the expected result target after that evaluate the votes for each potential target take the rf algorithm final forecast as the highest chosen expected objective the values of rf used in code are shown in table 5 2 2 3 multi layer perceptron mlp in water modelling the mlp is a popular ml model an mlp model comprises three layers input hidden and output neurons link these layers with weight and bias weighted and biased 35 using an activation function f the weighted variables are summed with the bias of the layer which are converted from the jth layer to the jth 1 layer and so on until the target layer the training procedure is performed iteratively adjusting the layer weights and biases until excellent preliminary performance coefficient of correlation the models will be used with three mlp layers to make things easier the outputs y k will be provided by the following flowing equation 9 y k f k i 1 m w jk f j i 1 n x i w ij w o the feature number is n the hidden layer neuron numbers are m the target layer neuron numbers are p and the bias is w 0 the weights between the jth neuron and the kth target neuron and between the ith neuron and the jth neuron are w jk accordingly whereas f k and f j are the transfer functions of the output and hidden layer neurons k and j accordingly in addition the values of mlp used in code shown in table 6 2 2 4 logistic regression the logistic regression model lrm is the relation between a categorical dependent variable and a collection of independent explanatory factors which can be used to estimate the probability of the occurrence of an event 36 a mathematical model of a set of explanatory factors is used to predict the mean of a continuous dependent variable in multiple regression the logit transformation is written mathematically where p is the probability and the corresponding odds as shown in eq 10 however the values of lr used in the code are shown in table 7 10 l logit p ln p 1 p 2 2 5 xgboost gradient boost machines gbm are among the top performing algorithms for supervised learning and xgboost is one of the implementations of this method in addition it may be used to solve problems involving regression and classification 37 xgboost is desired by data scientists as it has a high execution speed out of core computation the xgboost operates as follows assume a dataset ds with m features and n examplesds x i y i i 1 n x i ℝ m y i ℝ let y i be the predicted output of an ensemble tree model derived from the eq 11 11 å i ϕ x i k k f k x i when k is the number of trees in the model and f k is the kth tree we must determine the optimum collection of functions by minimizing the loss and regulation to resolve the above equation fig 3 illustrates the xgboost trees also table 8 shows the values of xgboost used in code 2 2 6 decision tree the decision tree dt algorithm has been widely utilized in several sectors since its debut as one of the most regularly used methods for data mining a decision tree is a recursive top down division that employs a top down divide and conquer strategy its core algorithm is essentially greedy the construction of a decision tree is separated into two stages tree building and tree pruning the tree building stage is the initial phase in which a part of the training data is selected and a decision tree is built using the breadth first recursive method until each leaf node belongs to the same class the second phase is the pruning stage which utilizes the remaining data to evaluate the created decision tree and rectify any problems prunes and adds nodes until a proper decision tree is constructed pruning decreases the influence of noisy data on classification accuracy in the decision tree building method which is a cyclical process that finally results in a decision tree gini index and entropy can be calculated to check the impurity of nodes 38 additionally the values of lr used in code are shown in table 9 2 2 7 catboost boost is a gradient boosted decision tree gbdt and category feature based algorithm under the context of the gbdt algorithm this method is better at implementation the critical issue is dealing with categorical characteristics efficiently and reasonably boost is made up of two elements category variables and boost this method also addresses gradient bias and prediction shift issues enhancing the algorithm generalization ability and resilience 39 nonnumerical characteristics may be processed fast using boost when the boost algorithm analyzes categorical features it includes all sample data sets in the learning process then boost organizes all these sample data sets at random and filters out samples from all characteristics with the same category when numerically converting the features of each instance the sample s goal value is computed first followed by the weight and priority corresponding to the model 40 mathematically it can be framed as follows 12 x k i j 1 n x j i x k i y i ap j 1 n x j i x k i a where a is the weight coefficient p is a prior probability distribution yi is the target value of the ith observation x k i the original value of the kth feature for ith observation n is the no of observation the training set and x is the new value of the categorical feature an initial value is included to reduce noise points generated by low frequency features to avoid overfitting the model and enhance generalization capacity the values of catboost used in code are shown in table 10 2 3 performance measurements each confusion matrix describes the functioning of a classification model on a set of test data for which the actual values are well known the confusion matrix has been used to compute the following parameters listed in table 11 2 3 1 precision it is the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations to the total number of expected positive observations the high accuracy is connected to the low false positive rate eq 13 demonstrates precision 13 precision true positive true positive fa l se positive precision can be improved by modifying the model parameters however when adjusting it is worth noting that increasing the precision will reduce the recall and higher recall will lead to lower accuracy 2 3 2 recall sensitivity relatively how many correctly predicted positives there are compared to all eq 14 shows the way of calculating the recall 14 recall true positive true positive false negative the recall value of any ml model can be changed by altering various parameters or hyperparameters by changing such parameters it can either increase or decrease recall most positive occurrences tp fn will be recognized if the recall is high tp therefore there will be more fp measurements and less accuracy however there are more fns positives that should have been labeled negatives when the recall is poor which implies that when the findings discover a positive example it may be surer that this is indeed a positive 2 3 3 f1 score the precision and recall weighted average is utilized to determine the f1 score it is therefore necessary to include in the calculation of this score both false positives and false negatives not as intuitive as accuracy f1 tends to be more useful in most cases especially if the class distribution is uneven correctness is enhanced by ensuring that positive and negative results cost the same amount if the cost of false positives and false negatives are significantly different it is preferable to look at precision and recall 15 f 1 score 2 recall precision recall precision 2 3 4 accuracy the most basic and straightforward performance statistic is accuracy just the proportion of correctly predicted observations to all observations false positive and false negative rates are virtually the same in symmetrical datasets making it a suitable quality measure a model s performance must be evaluated in the context of other parameters 16 accuracy true negative true positive total 3 results the data has been split into 75 for training and 25 for testing fig 4 illustrates the 4 4 confusion matrix for each classifier refer to table 2 with their color coded values all the performance metrics have been calculated using confusion matrices of each classifier as mentioned in table 11 according to the estimates catboost and rf performed better than other classifiers with a slight margin of 1 followed by mlp xgboost decision tree svm and logistic regression receiver operating characteristic roc curves have been manifested in fig 5 declaring all the curve areas and average micro macro average labels the roc curve is a familiar figure for demonstrating the trade off between true positive and false positive rates for a binary classifier at various classification levels 41 the area under the roc curve represents the performance of a classifiers overall classification thresholds for example when cuddled the upper left corner of an ideal roc curve suggests a high actual positive rate and a low false positive rate roc curves help compare various classifiers as an essential classification performance metric since they consider all potential thresholds in addition the roc curve initial slope reveals how rapidly performance decreases as one moves down the data set of predictions 42 moreover precision recall curves have been implemented for all classifiers as shown in fig 6 similarly it states different thresholds of all classifiers it is a valuable measure of prediction success when the classes are significantly unbalanced precision measures result in relevancy in information retrieval whereas recall measures how many relevant results are returned the precision recall curve depicts the trade off between precision and recall 43 a large area under the curve indicates good recall and precision with high accuracy corresponding to a low false positive rate and high recall corresponding to a low false negative rate therefore the area under the curves for both roc and precision recall curves is summarized and mentioned in table 12 high scores for both indicate that the classifier produces accurate high precision results and a majority of all positive outcomes high recall average accuracy is the average precision ap of overall potential thresholds equivalent to the area under the precision recall curve it is a helpful statistic for comparing how effectively models organize predictions without taking any specific decision thresholds into account 44 the roc curves which show the overlap between the classes are constructed for each of the seven classification techniques the roc curves of all methods are near the upper left corner suggesting excellent sensitivity and specificity and classifier accuracy the ideal area under the roc curve is constructed using the truth values of 1 and 0 resulting in the roc curve angle shaped elbow moreover fig 7 demonstrates the average precision curves for all the classifiers used also table 12 contains the score values of ap 3 1 model stacking model stacking is a technique for improving model predictions by combining the outputs of multiple models and running them through a meta learner which is an ml model stacking models work by passing the output of multiple models through a meta learner typically a linear regressor classifier but other models such as decision trees can also be used all individual model s weaknesses are minimized while the meta learner maximizes their strengths the result is a robust model that generalizes well to new data in most cases fig 8 depicts the architecture of a stacked model however fig 9 shows the meta learner confusion matrix also table 13 demonstrates the results of the stacked model for various classifiers 4 discussion and future outlook the quality of the data utilized in the learning phase impacts the outcome hence in this section we will discuss the positive and negative aspects of each classifier and stacking model random forests can be used for classification as well as regression both categorical and numerical data perform well with rf in most cases no scaling or change of variables is required random forests produce uncorrelated decision trees by performing feature selection implicitly 45 they accomplish this by constructing each decision tree using a random collection of characteristics this makes it an excellent model for dealing with data with many features however random forests are challenging to realize they give a sense of how vital a characteristic is however it does not provide visibility as much into the coefficients as linear regression in addition for big datasets rf can be computationally demanding 46 on the other hand svm can work well when there is a distinct separating margin in high dimensional areas when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples it is also memory efficient as it employs a subset of training points called support vectors in the decision function 47 however it does not perform well when a huge data collection is found since the necessary training time is longer furthermore it does not perform well when the data set contains additional noise such as overlapping target classes 48 a decision tree can work with numerical and categorical features and requires minimal data preprocessing it is fast for inference and has a non parametric model its feature selection happens automatically nevertheless a minute variation in data can lead to huge structure change affecting stability in most cases dt takes time to process and train the model making it expensive moreover dt is insufficient for employing regression and predicting continuous values 49 lrm is more straightforward to apply understand and train it makes no assumptions about how classes are distributed in feature space besides it is simple to expand to many classes multinomial regression and a probabilistic view of class predictions quickly 50 although lrm should not be used if the number of observations is fewer than the number of features otherwise it may result in overfitting it establishes linear boundaries as a result the discrete number set is linked to the dependent variable of logistic regression 51 the boost methods are simple to read and understand making prediction interpretations simple to manage the prediction capability is effective by employing clone methods like bagging random forest and decision trees boost is a stable way to reduce over fitting however because every classifier is required to repair the faults in the predecessors boost is sensitive to outliers as a result the approach is overly reliant on outliers another problem is that scaling up the approach is tricky 52 each estimate is based on the accuracy of preceding predictors making the method difficult to simplify boost does not require dataset conversion to any specific format like xgboost moreover catboost is much faster than xgboost mlp can be used for complex non linear problems and handle substantial efficient data after training provides quick predictions on the contrary its computation is complex as all independent variables are affected by dependent variables therefore the training phase is crucial for its fast performance 53 table 14 summarizes the pros and cons of each classifier used to handle the data while processing it stacked generalization also known as stacking is an ensemble ml algorithm it learns how to combine the predictions from two or more base ml algorithms using a meta learning algorithm the advantage of stacking is that it can combine the capabilities of several high performing models to make predictions that outperform any single model in the ensemble on a classification or regression task using stacking models can easily extract every bit of performance from models stacking models can be a quick and convenient way to achieve this in some data science problems where all kinds of performance matter however stacking models typically take longer to train and have much slower latencies than other models this work can help all the researchers worldwide decide the type of classifier to be used in determining the most fitting algorithm in their study and prove the use of the stacking ensemble model the future scope for this research cannot be limited to hardware implementation besides more classifiers neural networks and other ai techniques can be used on the same or different datasets to enhance water monitoring 59 table 15 summarizes and compares the various studies related to artificial intelligence it is seen that the proposed work performed better than other studies due to the use of the stacking ensemble model 5 conclusions this research focused on classifying water quality using machine learning techniques and proposed an intelligent real time water quality monitoring approach various standards and stacked ensemble models were used to provide detailed analysis to serve this purpose the dataset included 1600 samples collected between 2005 and 2014 from various sites in india the dataset s metadata consisted of dissolved oxygen ph conductivity biochemical oxygen demand nitrate fecal coliform and total coliform the ml classifiers used in the study were support vector machine random forest logistic regression catboost xgboost decision tree and multi layer perceptron performance metrics such as precision sensitivity f1 score and accuracy were estimated using the confusion matrix of each classifier moreover precision recall roc and average precision curves were studied in terms of precision the order of the classifiers was as follows catboost 94 51 random forest 94 followed by mlp 88 6 xgboost 88 1 decision tree 81 6 svm 80 7 and logistic regression 72 9 however for stacking ensemble models 100 accuracy was delivered by multiple meta classifiers including decision tree catboost etc hence catboost was assessed as the best performing classifier and stacking model to enhance accuracy with high performance metrics catboost classifier can be used in a wide range of datasets researchers with a good understanding of ml

algorithm is shown in fig 2 repeated stratified k fold cross validation was used to evaluate the model after defining the algorithm with any required hyperparameters i e by using the defaults moreover the three 10 fold cross validation repeats were applied which means the model can fit and evaluate 30 models on the dataset three times with 10 fold cross validation the dataset is stratified which means that each fold of the cross validation split has the same class distribution as the original dataset with a 1 100 ratio in this case on the other hand the roc area under curve auc metric has been used to evaluate the model this may be overly optimistic for severely imbalanced datasets but it still shows a relative change with better performing models 2 2 classifiers for these simulations jupyter via anaconda navigator was used with python programming language the machine used had an intel i7 core 7th generation processor and 16gb ram this section presents brief descriptions of all the classifiers used in the model 2 2 1 support vector machine svm the support vector machine svm is a discriminative approach based on creating a hyper plane to minimize errors that may be used for both classification and regression problems 31 the observation dataset can be represented as follows 5 d s x i y i i 1 n where x i represents the inputs and y i defines the outputs with a linear function as illustrated in eq 5 for modelling system s with observation dataset d s that is calculated in eq 5 for numbers of variables n 6 f x ω ϕ x b the maximum of eq 7 is the optimum function subject to eq 8 as svm uses a new type of loss function this means that the loss function can be employed in the form of an insensitive loss function 7 min ω b ξ ξ 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξi ξi 8 s t y i ω t ϕ x b ε ξi y i ω t ϕ x b ε ξi ξi ξi 0 i 1 2 n where ϕ x denotes a kernel function k as in a polynomial radial basis or linear function b denote represents weigh and basis vectors c denotes a pre specified value to penalize the training error ξ i and ξ i denote the lower and upper output constraints respectively support vector machine is highly efficient in many cases such as handling higher dimensional data when features are more than training examples and for inseparable classes when the almost negligible effect of outliers as hyperplane is impacted only by the support vectors on the other hand though svm consumes more time and is unsuitable for a more extensive dataset its performance gets low in case of overlapped classes picking the proper kernel function can be tricky 32 moreover the values of svm used in the code are shown in table 4 2 2 2 random forest regression and classification are conducted by the random forest rf technique that operates by constructing an ensemble of decision trees in training by swapping and changing the covariates to improve the prediction performance the weighted average of tree outputs is used to achieve the goal as rf has many potential features generated from different nodes this model requires many trained trees and a certain amount of the variable in each tree the rf classifier is a reliable algorithm that surpasses several other classification algorithms in terms of accuracy the parameters that were utilized were as follows estimators 300 maximum depth 100 and minimum sample split 3 33 the first step for the rf classification technique is to randomly select k features from a list of m characteristics where k m followed by finding d using an ideal rift point the node between the k features afterward the node may be divided into two daughter nodes by using the most excellent rift then repeat steps until the desired number of nodes has been reached lastly repetition of all steps results in the growth of n trees 34 additionally the rf prediction process steps initially take the test characteristics and predict the outcome using the rules of each randomly generated decision tree then save the expected result target after that evaluate the votes for each potential target take the rf algorithm final forecast as the highest chosen expected objective the values of rf used in code are shown in table 5 2 2 3 multi layer perceptron mlp in water modelling the mlp is a popular ml model an mlp model comprises three layers input hidden and output neurons link these layers with weight and bias weighted and biased 35 using an activation function f the weighted variables are summed with the bias of the layer which are converted from the jth layer to the jth 1 layer and so on until the target layer the training procedure is performed iteratively adjusting the layer weights and biases until excellent preliminary performance coefficient of correlation the models will be used with three mlp layers to make things easier the outputs y k will be provided by the following flowing equation 9 y k f k i 1 m w jk f j i 1 n x i w ij w o the feature number is n the hidden layer neuron numbers are m the target layer neuron numbers are p and the bias is w 0 the weights between the jth neuron and the kth target neuron and between the ith neuron and the jth neuron are w jk accordingly whereas f k and f j are the transfer functions of the output and hidden layer neurons k and j accordingly in addition the values of mlp used in code shown in table 6 2 2 4 logistic regression the logistic regression model lrm is the relation between a categorical dependent variable and a collection of independent explanatory factors which can be used to estimate the probability of the occurrence of an event 36 a mathematical model of a set of explanatory factors is used to predict the mean of a continuous dependent variable in multiple regression the logit transformation is written mathematically where p is the probability and the corresponding odds as shown in eq 10 however the values of lr used in the code are shown in table 7 10 l logit p ln p 1 p 2 2 5 xgboost gradient boost machines gbm are among the top performing algorithms for supervised learning and xgboost is one of the implementations of this method in addition it may be used to solve problems involving regression and classification 37 xgboost is desired by data scientists as it has a high execution speed out of core computation the xgboost operates as follows assume a dataset ds with m features and n examplesds x i y i i 1 n x i ℝ m y i ℝ let y i be the predicted output of an ensemble tree model derived from the eq 11 11 å i ϕ x i k k f k x i when k is the number of trees in the model and f k is the kth tree we must determine the optimum collection of functions by minimizing the loss and regulation to resolve the above equation fig 3 illustrates the xgboost trees also table 8 shows the values of xgboost used in code 2 2 6 decision tree the decision tree dt algorithm has been widely utilized in several sectors since its debut as one of the most regularly used methods for data mining a decision tree is a recursive top down division that employs a top down divide and conquer strategy its core algorithm is essentially greedy the construction of a decision tree is separated into two stages tree building and tree pruning the tree building stage is the initial phase in which a part of the training data is selected and a decision tree is built using the breadth first recursive method until each leaf node belongs to the same class the second phase is the pruning stage which utilizes the remaining data to evaluate the created decision tree and rectify any problems prunes and adds nodes until a proper decision tree is constructed pruning decreases the influence of noisy data on classification accuracy in the decision tree building method which is a cyclical process that finally results in a decision tree gini index and entropy can be calculated to check the impurity of nodes 38 additionally the values of lr used in code are shown in table 9 2 2 7 catboost boost is a gradient boosted decision tree gbdt and category feature based algorithm under the context of the gbdt algorithm this method is better at implementation the critical issue is dealing with categorical characteristics efficiently and reasonably boost is made up of two elements category variables and boost this method also addresses gradient bias and prediction shift issues enhancing the algorithm generalization ability and resilience 39 nonnumerical characteristics may be processed fast using boost when the boost algorithm analyzes categorical features it includes all sample data sets in the learning process then boost organizes all these sample data sets at random and filters out samples from all characteristics with the same category when numerically converting the features of each instance the sample s goal value is computed first followed by the weight and priority corresponding to the model 40 mathematically it can be framed as follows 12 x k i j 1 n x j i x k i y i ap j 1 n x j i x k i a where a is the weight coefficient p is a prior probability distribution yi is the target value of the ith observation x k i the original value of the kth feature for ith observation n is the no of observation the training set and x is the new value of the categorical feature an initial value is included to reduce noise points generated by low frequency features to avoid overfitting the model and enhance generalization capacity the values of catboost used in code are shown in table 10 2 3 performance measurements each confusion matrix describes the functioning of a classification model on a set of test data for which the actual values are well known the confusion matrix has been used to compute the following parameters listed in table 11 2 3 1 precision it is the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations to the total number of expected positive observations the high accuracy is connected to the low false positive rate eq 13 demonstrates precision 13 precision true positive true positive fa l se positive precision can be improved by modifying the model parameters however when adjusting it is worth noting that increasing the precision will reduce the recall and higher recall will lead to lower accuracy 2 3 2 recall sensitivity relatively how many correctly predicted positives there are compared to all eq 14 shows the way of calculating the recall 14 recall true positive true positive false negative the recall value of any ml model can be changed by altering various parameters or hyperparameters by changing such parameters it can either increase or decrease recall most positive occurrences tp fn will be recognized if the recall is high tp therefore there will be more fp measurements and less accuracy however there are more fns positives that should have been labeled negatives when the recall is poor which implies that when the findings discover a positive example it may be surer that this is indeed a positive 2 3 3 f1 score the precision and recall weighted average is utilized to determine the f1 score it is therefore necessary to include in the calculation of this score both false positives and false negatives not as intuitive as accuracy f1 tends to be more useful in most cases especially if the class distribution is uneven correctness is enhanced by ensuring that positive and negative results cost the same amount if the cost of false positives and false negatives are significantly different it is preferable to look at precision and recall 15 f 1 score 2 recall precision recall precision 2 3 4 accuracy the most basic and straightforward performance statistic is accuracy just the proportion of correctly predicted observations to all observations false positive and false negative rates are virtually the same in symmetrical datasets making it a suitable quality measure a model s performance must be evaluated in the context of other parameters 16 accuracy true negative true positive total 3 results the data has been split into 75 for training and 25 for testing fig 4 illustrates the 4 4 confusion matrix for each classifier refer to table 2 with their color coded values all the performance metrics have been calculated using confusion matrices of each classifier as mentioned in table 11 according to the estimates catboost and rf performed better than other classifiers with a slight margin of 1 followed by mlp xgboost decision tree svm and logistic regression receiver operating characteristic roc curves have been manifested in fig 5 declaring all the curve areas and average micro macro average labels the roc curve is a familiar figure for demonstrating the trade off between true positive and false positive rates for a binary classifier at various classification levels 41 the area under the roc curve represents the performance of a classifiers overall classification thresholds for example when cuddled the upper left corner of an ideal roc curve suggests a high actual positive rate and a low false positive rate roc curves help compare various classifiers as an essential classification performance metric since they consider all potential thresholds in addition the roc curve initial slope reveals how rapidly performance decreases as one moves down the data set of predictions 42 moreover precision recall curves have been implemented for all classifiers as shown in fig 6 similarly it states different thresholds of all classifiers it is a valuable measure of prediction success when the classes are significantly unbalanced precision measures result in relevancy in information retrieval whereas recall measures how many relevant results are returned the precision recall curve depicts the trade off between precision and recall 43 a large area under the curve indicates good recall and precision with high accuracy corresponding to a low false positive rate and high recall corresponding to a low false negative rate therefore the area under the curves for both roc and precision recall curves is summarized and mentioned in table 12 high scores for both indicate that the classifier produces accurate high precision results and a majority of all positive outcomes high recall average accuracy is the average precision ap of overall potential thresholds equivalent to the area under the precision recall curve it is a helpful statistic for comparing how effectively models organize predictions without taking any specific decision thresholds into account 44 the roc curves which show the overlap between the classes are constructed for each of the seven classification techniques the roc curves of all methods are near the upper left corner suggesting excellent sensitivity and specificity and classifier accuracy the ideal area under the roc curve is constructed using the truth values of 1 and 0 resulting in the roc curve angle shaped elbow moreover fig 7 demonstrates the average precision curves for all the classifiers used also table 12 contains the score values of ap 3 1 model stacking model stacking is a technique for improving model predictions by combining the outputs of multiple models and running them through a meta learner which is an ml model stacking models work by passing the output of multiple models through a meta learner typically a linear regressor classifier but other models such as decision trees can also be used all individual model s weaknesses are minimized while the meta learner maximizes their strengths the result is a robust model that generalizes well to new data in most cases fig 8 depicts the architecture of a stacked model however fig 9 shows the meta learner confusion matrix also table 13 demonstrates the results of the stacked model for various classifiers 4 discussion and future outlook the quality of the data utilized in the learning phase impacts the outcome hence in this section we will discuss the positive and negative aspects of each classifier and stacking model random forests can be used for classification as well as regression both categorical and numerical data perform well with rf in most cases no scaling or change of variables is required random forests produce uncorrelated decision trees by performing feature selection implicitly 45 they accomplish this by constructing each decision tree using a random collection of characteristics this makes it an excellent model for dealing with data with many features however random forests are challenging to realize they give a sense of how vital a characteristic is however it does not provide visibility as much into the coefficients as linear regression in addition for big datasets rf can be computationally demanding 46 on the other hand svm can work well when there is a distinct separating margin in high dimensional areas when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples it is also memory efficient as it employs a subset of training points called support vectors in the decision function 47 however it does not perform well when a huge data collection is found since the necessary training time is longer furthermore it does not perform well when the data set contains additional noise such as overlapping target classes 48 a decision tree can work with numerical and categorical features and requires minimal data preprocessing it is fast for inference and has a non parametric model its feature selection happens automatically nevertheless a minute variation in data can lead to huge structure change affecting stability in most cases dt takes time to process and train the model making it expensive moreover dt is insufficient for employing regression and predicting continuous values 49 lrm is more straightforward to apply understand and train it makes no assumptions about how classes are distributed in feature space besides it is simple to expand to many classes multinomial regression and a probabilistic view of class predictions quickly 50 although lrm should not be used if the number of observations is fewer than the number of features otherwise it may result in overfitting it establishes linear boundaries as a result the discrete number set is linked to the dependent variable of logistic regression 51 the boost methods are simple to read and understand making prediction interpretations simple to manage the prediction capability is effective by employing clone methods like bagging random forest and decision trees boost is a stable way to reduce over fitting however because every classifier is required to repair the faults in the predecessors boost is sensitive to outliers as a result the approach is overly reliant on outliers another problem is that scaling up the approach is tricky 52 each estimate is based on the accuracy of preceding predictors making the method difficult to simplify boost does not require dataset conversion to any specific format like xgboost moreover catboost is much faster than xgboost mlp can be used for complex non linear problems and handle substantial efficient data after training provides quick predictions on the contrary its computation is complex as all independent variables are affected by dependent variables therefore the training phase is crucial for its fast performance 53 table 14 summarizes the pros and cons of each classifier used to handle the data while processing it stacked generalization also known as stacking is an ensemble ml algorithm it learns how to combine the predictions from two or more base ml algorithms using a meta learning algorithm the advantage of stacking is that it can combine the capabilities of several high performing models to make predictions that outperform any single model in the ensemble on a classification or regression task using stacking models can easily extract every bit of performance from models stacking models can be a quick and convenient way to achieve this in some data science problems where all kinds of performance matter however stacking models typically take longer to train and have much slower latencies than other models this work can help all the researchers worldwide decide the type of classifier to be used in determining the most fitting algorithm in their study and prove the use of the stacking ensemble model the future scope for this research cannot be limited to hardware implementation besides more classifiers neural networks and other ai techniques can be used on the same or different datasets to enhance water monitoring 59 table 15 summarizes and compares the various studies related to artificial intelligence it is seen that the proposed work performed better than other studies due to the use of the stacking ensemble model 5 conclusions this research focused on classifying water quality using machine learning techniques and proposed an intelligent real time water quality monitoring approach various standards and stacked ensemble models were used to provide detailed analysis to serve this purpose the dataset included 1600 samples collected between 2005 and 2014 from various sites in india the dataset s metadata consisted of dissolved oxygen ph conductivity biochemical oxygen demand nitrate fecal coliform and total coliform the ml classifiers used in the study were support vector machine random forest logistic regression catboost xgboost decision tree and multi layer perceptron performance metrics such as precision sensitivity f1 score and accuracy were estimated using the confusion matrix of each classifier moreover precision recall roc and average precision curves were studied in terms of precision the order of the classifiers was as follows catboost 94 51 random forest 94 followed by mlp 88 6 xgboost 88 1 decision tree 81 6 svm 80 7 and logistic regression 72 9 however for stacking ensemble models 100 accuracy was delivered by multiple meta classifiers including decision tree catboost etc hence catboost was assessed as the best performing classifier and stacking model to enhance accuracy with high performance metrics catboost classifier can be used in a wide range of datasets researchers with a good understanding of ml implementation can collaborate with experts in other fields interdisciplinary manner the analysis can also be expanded into multiple directions such as hardware implementation internet of things iot

12971,the olive oil industry although among the most important sectors in the mediterranean basin causes huge environmental problems due to the discharge of polluting wastewater the treatment of olive oil mill wastewater is therefore at the crossroads of many concerns and is a major challenge for sustainable development this study focuses on the exploitation of a parabolic trough solar collector as a clean source of energy for sustainable olive oil mill wastewater treatment a conical coil heat exchanger immersed in an olive oil mill wastewater distillation reservoir is coupled with a parabolic trough solar collector the productivity environmental impact and profitability of the proposed prototype are experimentally evaluated a comparative study and a physico chemical characterization of filtered and unfiltered olive oil mill wastewater are conducted to assess their potential reuse a simulation using a spray type falling film evaporation approach is realized to achieve numerical optimization the obtained results show that the use of a parabolic trough solar collector allows more heat gain to be transferred into the distiller enhancing system productivity and decreasing temperature fluctuation compared to the traditional solar distiller a significant reduction of 95 to 97 of phenolic compounds is observed for the distillate the overall analysis reveals that the 26 6 m2 parabolic trough solar collector aperture area has generated 19 mwh of thermal energy throughout the olive oil post production phase which led to the avoidance of about 12 660 kg eq of co2 emissions while the levelized cost of heat was 0 3 kwhth graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords parabolic trough solar collector olive mill wastewater distillation internal heat exchanger spray evaporation 1 introduction olive growing is among the most important arboricultural products in the mediterranean basin where its main output olive oil has a huge impact on these countries environmental social and economic issues indeed the olive industry helps to achieve economic growth food security employment creation and enhanced export earnings goals the benefits and attributes associated with olive oil have boosted consumption whose production is continually growing on a global level according to the international olive council olive oil production has tripled in the last 60 years 1 it reached 3207 000 tons in the 2019 2020 season accounting for 93 8 of the global total output tunisia with the world s second biggest olive growing area of 1 825 000 ha about a third of the country s cultivated land ranks out among ioc member nations with a productivity of 350 000 tons 2 at the same time the olive oil industry generates a large amount of toxic waste known as olive mill wastewater omww that has a high organic content a predominance of phenolic compounds and different flavonoids one kilogram of olives is thought to yield 1 to 1 5 l of omww resulting in global yearly production in the order of 10 to 30 million m3 3 if rejected without prior treatment these effluents will have a dangerous impact on the environment due to their ability to inhibit the development of plants and certain micro organisms change soil properties and contaminate the aquatic ecosystem the groundwater the public network and sewage treatment plants 4 environmental protection is one of the pillars of sustainable development which is a major challenge for humanity s and the planet s future wastewater treatment is now a societal problem that is at the crossroads of many concerns 5 several approaches have been tested to find an environmentally friendly and economically effective approach these approaches include physico chemical treatments evaporation filtration sedimentation adsorption and centrifugation biological treatments anaerobic and aerobic and biophysical treatments combined ultrasonication irradiation and aerobic la scalia et al 6 have used the membrane filtration system to extract the polyphenols from the omww to reduce environmental impact and achieve economic advantages based on byproduct recovery the economic sustainability of their system depends on an increment in the oil price which is not profitable for the consumers azzam 7 has employed adsorption as an omww treatment technique the results of his work showed that using volcanic tuff and clay alone and in combination along with activated charcoal should not be recommended for employment as a possible practical adsorbent for treatment protocols he concluded that olive mill wastewater is still an unsolved environmental problem recently ciggin et al 8 have investigated the potential of using ultrasonic enhanced fenton based advanced oxidation to minimize toxicity total phenol and organic matter in olive mill wastewater they emphasized advanced oxidation as a critical step in the treatment of olive mill wastewaters the significant reduction in omww toxicity was the study s highlight however due to the short term seasonal generation of omww and the reliance on several parameters that are not constant for all omww such as particle size distribution an exclusive biological treatment scheme is not applicable there have also been a large number of studies on combining multiple treatment methods in a series to generate acceptable effluent that can be released into the environment vuppala et al 9 have studied a sequential process i e a biological method following the coagulation and flocculation steps to achieve cleaner waste production abu dalo et al 10 have examined successive combinations of coagulation flocculation sedimentation and adsorption treatment approaches to enhance organic and phenolic compound removal from olive mill wastewater karray et al 11 have produced biogas a valuable algae biomass and treated omww using a bioprocess combining anaerobic co digestion followed by ultra filtration and microalgae culture even though these various techniques combining several treatment methods have demonstrated a high level of efficiency they present the risk of producing harmful by products as well as significant operating expenses there is currently no viable treatment option for omww and their environmental concerns are growing solar energy applications might also be utilized to dewater olive mill wastewater to decrease the initial volume making the residual sludge easier to manipulate and treat solar distillation is the most suited approach for such dewatering since it increases the rate of evaporation while also isolating the majority of dissolved materials and biological pollutants 12 potoglou et al 13 succeeded in achieving efficient separation of solids and liquid from the olive mill wastewater using a traditional solar still sklavos et al 14 used a solar distiller to investigate the simultaneous solar drying of omww and the recovery of phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties in the distillate singh et al 15 overviewed active solar distillation technology and found that solar desalination using a solar still is a cost effective solution to water purification but that it is not suited in some circumstances owing to the solar still s poor productivity integrating a parabolic trough solar collector can increase their production kumar et al 16 have coupled a single slope solar still with a parabolic trough collector their results show that the productivity of the solar still can be enhanced by integrating a parabolic trough collector nonetheless in kumar s prototype the solar still and the parabolic trough collector s receiver tube are connected to form a closed loop thermosiphon system for preheating water in a direct circuit their system s maximum temperature in all parts does not exceed 90 c even more using a heat exchanger in the areas of falling film spray and bubble evaporation has shown great potential for dehumidification in vapor compression cooling systems and has been investigated by some researchers in the field of air conditioning 17 18 support for research and development in solar heat for industrial processes is growing rapidly at a global level due to the high potential for the outcomes to drive innovative economic growth and address major societal challenges such as climate change secure and affordable energy supplies and resource depletion concentrated solar thermal technologies to provide solar heat for industrial processes are key systems for lowering industrial co2 emissions and addressing energy and environmental issues 19 20 based on the attractive solar resources of mediterranean regions especially tunisia the focus of this study is the exploitation of the parabolic trough solar collector ptc as a clean source of energy for the development of a sustainable olive oil mill wastewater treatment system the novelty lies in the proposed design of the distiller and the coupling system which can be adapted to the needs of each olive oil mill a parabolic trough solar collector installed at the research and technology centre of energy crten at borj cedria tunisia was coupled with a conical coil heat exchanger immersed in an omww distillation reservoir in this paper numerical and experimental findings were elaborated on and discussed the experimental studies were undertaken between march and september 2021 during the post production campaign of olive oil when landfills of by products became increasingly saturated to determine the system s practicality environmental impact and profitability in a subsequent step the numerical simulation was focused on the impact of spray type falling film evaporation on system productivity to optimize the proposed prototype 2 material and methods the studied setup for a sustainable olive oil mills wastewater omww treatment consists mainly of an innovative distiller coupled to a parabolic trough solar collector ptc as shown in fig 1 the distiller is made of a galvanized sheet and formed essentially by a condenser a distillate extraction unit and a distillation reservoir to which a major modification has been made the novelty of this distiller was the incorporation of a conical coil heat exchanger cchex immersed in the omww distillation reservoir the coil shaped heat exchanger was constructed from a copper tube with a diameter of 2 2 cm and a length of 750 m for the development of a coil with a height of 30 cm to match the distillation reservoir dimensions the minimum diameter at the top was considered 5 6 cm and the maximum diameter at the bottom was considered 20 cm forming 13 turns a straight tube section was provided at the inlet and outlet of the conical coil to be connected to the solar collector the fully insulated distillation reservoir that can accommodate up to 18 l of omww has a diameter of 24 cm and a height of 40 cm it has two openings for the inlet and outlet of the extraction tubes these tubes allow either the emptying of the distillation reservoir or the omww recirculation it will also allow the re injection of omww through a spray nozzle on the distiller s top where omww will evaporate dropwise on the conical coil heat exchanger tubes the condenser consisted of an open cylindrical vessel with a conical base the condensing unit was connected to a cooling water tank to cool and facilitate condensation the parabolic trough solar collector was attached to a steel structure with a tracking mechanism that allows movement along the azimuth axis this reflects the incident solar energy onto a black coated absorber tube the linear concentrator solar system consists of two modules each had an opening of 5 8 m 2 3 m for an opening area of 13 34 m2 and a reception area of 0 68 m2 the heat transfer fluid htf of 2 875 kj kg k specific heat flowing through the receiving tube is sent to the distiller heat transfer system at a flow rate of 1 2 m3 h to allow the treatment of olive mill wastewater by evaporation and condensation the characteristics of the ptc the main properties of the htf and the sizing of the distiller are given in table 1 the concentrated solar radiation at the ptc horizontal tube heats the htf that will be used to transport the heat to the distiller through the conical coil heat exchanger immersed in an olive oil mill wastewater distillation reservoir fig 2 the water in the omww is then removed as vapor evaporation of water requires a large amount of energy so the use of a ptc makes the process environmentally friendly by significantly improving profitability 20 the vapor generated by the distillation reservoir will be condensed in contact with the condenser s cold surface and collected through the cooling tubes in a condensate tank a parabolic trough collector installed at the research and technology centre of energy crten at borj cedria tunisia was used the site is located in a sunny region on the north african mediterranean coast near tunis city tunisia latitude 36 43 n longitude 10 25 e tunisia benefits from a large solar potential that is perfectly suited to solar thermal technologies and that can contribute significantly to the fight against climate change and the strengthening of energy security the average daily solar radiation is more than 4 5 kwh m2 with a total sunshine period of 3700 h year and 350 days of sunshine per year ambient temperatures can exceed 40 c in the summer and more than 20 c in the winter 21 the experiments were done during the post production campaign of olive oil when landfills of by products became increasingly saturated between march and september 2021 however only typical day data was discussed in this study sunny days and partially sunny days two tests were conducted successively per day in the time interval between 10 am and 5 pm the first 2 h were typically used to prepare omww samples while preheating htf in a ptc closed loop meteorological conditions such as solar radiation ambient temperature and relative humidity were collected by the crten thermal process laboratory devices in borj cedria the relative humidity and ambient temperature were measured by an emc dt 8892 multifunction sensor global solar irradiation was measured using a licor pyranometer model li 200 sz5 while the incident normal solar irradiation was measured using a pyrheliometer chp1 kipp and zonen mounted on the solys 2 sun tracker the htf temperature at the inlet and outlet of the absorber pipe and the cchex was measured using k type thermocouples type k thermocouples were also used to monitor the temperatures of the omww the vapor released the distillate the cchex tubes inside the distillation reservoir the condenser cooling water and the distiller wall over time all sensors and thermocouples have been connected to a type 21 campbell acquisition chain allowing the recording of experimental data with a temperature accuracy of 0 1 c the distillate was collected in a graduated tank and weighed at two minute intervals using a compact mettler toledo scale with a capacity of 15 kg the olive mill wastewater used in this study was collected from an olive oil mill in the kairouan region of central tunisia during the 2020 2021 olive oil production campaign two filtration processes were performed on the omww before being used in the experiments fig 3 centrifugation to separate the largest solid particles from the liquid phase and subsequently a filtration with a fine filter with narrow mesh 50 μm to obtain a less dense almost homogeneous solution black water the centrifugation was done to isolate the biggest particles in the omww and to approach the natural degradation in the reception and stabilization ponds smaller particles were filtered through the filters it was observed that the filtered omww had a darker coloration than the unfiltered omww this dark coloration is in some ways attributed to a reaction of auto oxidation and polymerization of phenolic compounds 22 indeed the transformation of phenolic alcohols into phenolic acids intensifies with decantation 22 23 however despite the color match characterization is essential to ensure compliance the omww composition depends on several factors such as the method of extraction of olive oil the olive variety and maturity and the climatic and edaphic conditions to characterize the filtered and unfiltered omww the physico chemical parameters acidity ph electrical conductivity salinity phenolic compounds dry matter humidity density were determined using several measuring instruments the ph the electrical conductivity and the salinity were measured using a multi parameter analyzer kit consort c831 model this analysis kit includes all the components necessary for physicochemical measurements electrodes buffers standards adapters and accessories the acidity of the samples was measured after the calibration of the ph meter the electrode was immersed in a buffer solution of ph 7 while adjusting the measuring box to the value of 7 then the same procedure was carried out with a buffer solution of ph 4 after calibration we dive for a few seconds for better stability the measuring electrode in a beaker containing a volume of omww and the ph value is recorded rinsing the electrode with distilled water between each measurement is important for good accuracy the electrical conductivity ce was measured in alternating current using a ce probe for a good measurement it is necessary to agitate the solution of the omww with a magnetic stirrer the unit of measurement was used in siemens per meter s m to ensure that the results are reliable the electrical conductivity of each solution was measured several times and then the average of these measurements was calculated the various electrodes are only activated and stable if they are wet for this purpose they have to be immersed in a kcl solution for several hours to avoid the effect of temperature on ce reading the instrument automatically adjusts the readings to a standard value of 25 c the salinity was obtained using the relationship eq 1 between salt concentration sc and electrical conductivity 24 1 sc g l ec ms cm 0 6 the total dry matter and moisture were determined after drying at 105 c in an oven for 24 h density was measured using a radwag precision balance wlc20 a2 and volumetric flask the phenolic compounds were determined by the colorimetric method using the folin ciocalteu technique 25 26 a 10 ml sample was mixed with 1 5 ml of sodium carbonate solution and 0 5 ml of folin ciocalteu reagent the resulting solution was stored in the dark for 1 h at 20 c and stirred every 15 min the absorbance of the solution was then measured at a wavelength of 750 nm

assessed according to the data dispersion relative to the average the standard deviation σ can be determined using eq 1 2 σ i 1 n x i x m 2 n where x i denotes the direct sensor measurement x m the arithmetic means and n the number of iterations the maximum discrepancy between the two temperature measurements was 0 57 c while the standard deviation was 0 32 c the largest uncertainty of dni measurements was 12 w m2 while the standard deviation was 7 w m2 the same parameters and physical model as the experimental configuration were adopted in numerical simulation to study the influence of omww spraying on heat transfer system productivity and system efficiency due to the complexity of simulating realistic flow conditions some assumptions were made to properly assess the heat and mass transfer of the falling film evaporation process 27 29 thus the model was based on the following assumptions that have been adopted by different researchers the droplets resulting from the spray nozzle admit the same size the fluid is a continuous and incompressible newtonian fluid the thermo physical parameters of the fluid are constant the interface is smooth not wavy the liquid film is distributed symmetrically on both sides of the tube the dynamic tracking of the gas liquid interface was performed by using the volume of fluid vof model 30 in the vof model each cell is occupied by a distinct phase or a combination of the two phases this implies the following conditions the cell is fully occupied by liquid α l 1 the cell is fully occupied by vapor α v 1 the cell is at the interface between the liquid and vapor phases α l α v 1 where α v is the volume fraction of the vapor phase and α l is the volume fraction of the liquid phase the falling film flow and the heat transfer process were described through the navier stokes equations in the vof model the momentum and energy equations were solved in the whole computational domain due to the dependence on the volume fraction of all phases however a modified continuity equation was used to track the motion of each phase using the volume fraction for the n phase the continuity equation of the vof model can be expressed as follow 3 α n ρ n t α n ρ n v s α n the momentum equation 4 ρ v t ρ v v p μ v v t ρ g f vol the energy equation 5 ρ c p t t ρ c p t v k t q s where s αn v p g f vol c p and q s are the mass transport in the phase transition process the velocity vector the pressure the acceleration of gravity the surface tension force the specific heat at constant pressure and the energy source term

the circumferential angle respectively the thermal efficiency of the olive oil mills wastewater distiller using a parabolic trough solar collector can be obtained through the ratio of the achieved omww distillate energy to the solar irradiation received by the ptc 32 17 η th s d δh i x a x 100 where s d represent the omww distillate productivity δh the vaporization enthalpy i the incident solar radiation and a the ptc opening area to perform an effective simulation some boundary conditions were set the water properties have been used due to the lack of information on omww in the literature and the high omww moisture content about 94 33 the sprayer was defined at a height of 0 4 m with a diameter of 0 04 m a spray density of 0 168 kg m s and a spray temperature of 90 c the spray density was set as the velocity inlet boundary condition the htf temperature at the inlet of the conical coil heat exchanger was 120 c fig 4 shows the 3d geometrical representation of the modeled conical coil heat exchanger with the spray nozzle the discretization of the governing equations was done using the finite volume method fvm through the second order upwind scheme and the dynamical track of the gas liquid interface was done using the high precision geo reconstruct scheme to validate the computing simulation the geometry and physical parameters were adjusted to much the experimental setup of parken et al 34 the sprayer height spray density spray temperature tube diameter and heat flux were set at 6 3 mm 0 168 kg m s 82 c 25 4 mm and 47 3 kw m2 respectively as shown in fig 5 the variation of the local heat transfer coefficient with respect to the circumferential angle of the tube obtained by simulation had the same trend as that obtained experimentally the greatest difference between the two curves was 2 29 kw m2 k at the angle of 0 due to the impact of the sprayed liquid on the top of the tube indeed the impact of the liquid film greatly increases the heat transfer which will gradually decrease as the fluid spreads over the surface of the tube 28 the average difference calculated between the experimental and simulation values was 0 57 kw m2 k these deviations may be related to the simulation assumptions adopted and the accuracy of the experimental measurements the consistency between the numerical computation and the experimental results demonstrates the reliability of the generated models 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental interpretations the time variations of the direct normal solar irradiance dni the ambient temperature the heat transfer fluid temperature at the inlet and outlet of the solar collector and the unfiltered and filtered omww temperature under summer and autumn climates were given in fig 6 the highest dni value recorded in the summer test was 1012 w m2 at 12 30 pm and 845 w m2 at 1 08 pm in the autumn test the values increased gradually over time and then began to decrease after 2 30 pm the fluctuations in solar radiation observed in fig 6 b were caused by an intermittent cloud cover giving an average dni value during the test of 713 w m2 compared to 927 w m2 on a sunny day as shown in fig 6 a the average ambient temperature in the experiment in summer climate was 40 c with the highest value recorded of 43 c while the highest ambient temperature recorded in the experiment under autumn climate was 25 c for an average value of 23 c as was expected the ambient temperature was showed the least variation whereas the htf temperature was varied with solar radiation fluctuations the htf temperature was followed the same trends as the solar irradiation with a significant increase in temperature at the beginning of the day the htf temperature at the outlet of the collector has reached 100 c in 1 h and 30 min and remained above this value for 6 h on sunny days the large solar irradiation decrease caused by intermittent cloud cover resulted in an htf temperature decrease during the day the mean temperatures recorded during experiments in summer and autumn climates were 147 c and 104 c respectively likewise as can be seen in fig 6 the maximum temperature reached in summer was 161 c whereas in autumn it was only 116 c the htf variations which were occurred periodically have not affected significantly the omww temperature curve an increase in the omww temperature was observed at the beginning of each experiment followed by a stabilization around 100 c which means the evaporation process occurrence and eventually a gradual increase besides slightly higher evaporation temperatures were observed for unfiltered omww indeed during the evaporation phase the average temperature of the filtered and unfiltered omww was 101 c and 104 c respectively this temperature difference is explained by the presence of a larger quantity of particles in the unfiltered omww moreover the drop in the water percentage contained in the omww induced the temperature increase towards the end of the experiments this involved the stopping of the distillation to prevent the carbonization of the omww residual sludge the obtained results also showed that the useful heat provided by the parabolic trough solar collector was implicitly related to the solar radiation intensity and significantly affected the distiller s productivity fig 7 shows the water recovery ratio wrr curve for filtered and unfiltered olive oil mills wastewater under summer climate and autumn climate the wrr was defined as the amount of water recovered relative to the initial amount of water contained in the omww as a function of the distillation time in both experiments the distillations were done with the same initial volume of 12 6 l for filtered and unfiltered omww the final ratios of water recovered were around 93 for filtered and unfiltered omww the amount of distillate recovered during the distillation of the filtered omww was slightly higher than that of the unfiltered omww moreover a 20 reduction in distillation time was observed during the experiment in summer climate compared with the experiment in autumn climate the amount of distillate totaled 42 l which approximates 285 ml of distillate per 1 mj of heat gained from solar radiation nevertheless the total amount of solar radiation was less by 23 in autumn tests compared to summer tests resulting in a decrease in productivity during the cloud cover days 296 ml and 275 ml of distillate per 1 mj of heat gained from solar radiation during the experiment in summer and autumn respectively the use of a ptc allowed a better overall heat gain injected into the omww distillation reservoir improving the productivity of the system with more stability and fewer temperature fluctuations than traditional solar distillers the same trend was observed in some studies 16 20 35 36 indeed the results revealed a fairly high and relatively stable temperature level of the omww with high distillation productivity of the distillation device using a parabolic trough solar collector a comparison of the productivity results of this study with different units of olive mill wastewater distillation in the literature is given in table 3 several physico chemical parameters were measured and shown in table 4 both filtered and unfiltered omww had acidic ph a high moisture ratio and a predominance of toxic substances the phenolic compounds a slight decrease in ph value was observed for filtered omww compared to unfiltered omww these results are within the range cited in the studies on the evolution of omww during storage in receiving basins 23 38 in addition the filtration procedure reduced the overall amount of dry matter in the olive oil mill wastewater preventing adherence to internal walls and extending the longevity of the equipment the results in table 4 show that the ph of the recovered distillate has decreased significantly compared to the crude omww the ph values of the recovered distillates ranged from 3 46 to 3 5 while the ph values of the omww ranged from 4 39 to 4 46 these values are very low compared to the tunisian standards for landfill and reuse which are between 6 5 and 8 5 39 however several studies have shown that low cost ph neutralization has been possible in particular with the use of lime 40 marble powder 41 or sand 42 a drop in the ph values might also corrode the equipment some studies focused on this kind of problem and several anti corrosive techniques have been studied in recent years among them are galvanic coupling sacrificial electrode and the addition of an inhibitor or a thermal coating recently fadhil et al 43 have succeeded in reducing the corrosion rate of a distillation column with the application of thermal coating technology using ceramic materials in addition the distillation significantly decreased the electrical conductivity from 11 24 ms cm to 0 91 ms cm for distillates from filtered omww and from 14 64 ms cm to 1 02 ms cm for distillates from unfiltered omww this can be explained by the presence of a very little inorganic ionic compound in the evaporated waters similarly these values are closely related to the decrease in the level of salinity in the distillate indeed electrical conductivity depends on the concentrations of dissolved substances and their natures 37 a significant reduction of 95 to 97 was also observed for phenolic compounds following the distillation of unfiltered and filtered omww the results obtained by the prototype studied in line with the literature are very encouraging and give rise to a further valorization of the extracted water due to its high calorific power the paste residue from distillation might be used as a source of renewable energy reducing fossil fuel consumption and its associated environmental implications 37 to treat the paste residue from distillation a solar dryer using a parabolic trough solar collector developed by our team in previous work for olive mill sludge treatment was utilized 44 it was observed that the unpleasant odors had disappeared the paste residue from distillation was ground into a powder once dried for convenience of transport and valorization fig 8 shows the paste residue the powder from the dried paste residue and the distilled omww 3 2 numerical interpretations the wall temperature distribution of the conical coil heat exchanger tubes was studied under boiling conditions and spray type falling film fig 9 a shows the temperature behavior on the tube surface under boiling conditions when the conical coil heat exchanger was half immersed in the olive oil wastewater distillation reservoir fig 9 b shows the temperature behavior when adding the spray type falling film at the top of the cchex it can be seen from these figures that with the addition of spray type falling film the temperature gradient between the top and bottom of cchex gets larger indeed when the sprayed omww hits the cchex tubes it exchanges heat with the tube wall some of the pulverized omww evaporates when it falls onto the cchex tube the rest gradually envelops the tube s wall due to gravity viscous force and surface tension the falling film evaporation heat transfer process can be divided into three regions according to the variation in temperature of the tube s contour as shown in fig 10 the impact caused by the impingement of pulverized omww on the upper part of the tube wall strengthened the mixing of hot and cold fluid inside the liquid film resulting in increased heat transfer in the impingement region the temperature of the thin liquid film that had formed on the tube surface gradually increased in the circumferential flow in the thermal developing region the temperature disturbance inside the liquid film was weakened which may be explained by the heat transfer mechanism of thin film evaporation and nucleate boiling evaporation as the liquid film spreads in the departure region the temperature disturbance of the liquid film intensifies due to the increase in heat transfer again in this region a vortex was formed in the stagnation point at the lower part of the tube wall to escape from the tube wall under the action of gravity and fall to the outlet to complete the falling film flow process indeed thin film evaporation and nucleate boiling play an important role in spray type falling film evaporation these two factors can be roughly dependent on each other on the heat flux and the spray density 27 fig 11 shows the vapor behavior inside the distillation reservoir the formation and dynamics of vapor bubbles have an impact on falling film near the tube surface and hence have a significant impact on heat transfer properties 27 by evaporating liquid near the heat exchanger tubes the bubble swells to a given size then moves away from the heated surface leaves the liquid and migrates to the top of the tank the vapor concentrates at the top of the distillation reservoir and goes to the condenser orifice spray type falling film evaporation is an efficient heat transfer technology for energy saving and productivity improvement 27 the results revealed that the integration of spray type falling film evaporation has roughly improved the exploitation of the cchex exchange surface with a larger local temperature gradient and better heat transfer performance furthermore it was found that the heat transfer temperature difference rose by roughly 5 c which implies a 30 increase in system productivity 3 3 energy savings economic evaluation and environmental performance tunisia has significant renewable energy potential particularly solar which must be attempted to harness in order to assure a secure energy future similarly energy and waste are interrelated energy is needed for waste treatment and can also be extracted from waste direct normal irradiance is the most significant metric for concentrated solar thermal technology simulation and implementation 45 fig 12 illustrates an estimate of the number of hours per month with a direct normal irradiance of more than or equal to 600 w m2 made using transient system simulation software and a meteorological database as illustrated in fig 12 the monthly average sunshine duration with a dni greater than or equal to 600 w m2 varies from 3 to 4 h day in winter and 5 to 6 h day in summer in general olive oil is produced between october and mars and the dumps of by products become saturated at the end of this period adequate and specific dimensioning for the needs of each olive oil mill will allow them to treat their waste before the start of the following olive oil extraction season the results showed that tunisia is endowed with interesting solar radiation and the use of cst technologies allowed a better overall heat gain injected into the omww distillation reservoir resulting in high productivity that approximates 285 ml of distillate per 1 mj this implies that a parabolic trough solar installation with an aperture area of 100 m2 will be able to treat up to 46 kg of omww per hour tunisia relies on gas and oil to satisfy nearly all of its energy demands however the primary sources of co2 emissions are the combustion of natural gas and fuel oil with about 640 kg co2 eq mwh and about 690 kg co2 eq mwh respectively as a result some policies and steps were implemented to reduce reliance on fossil fuel reserves 46 the solar concentrator s incorporation into treatment systems also reduces the concerns associated with the usage of fossil energy in the waste treatment process allowing for ecologically responsible production fig 13 shows the monthly quantities of the avoided co2 emissions due to the useful energy gained by the ptc the monthly mean amount of thermal energy generated by the ptc was 1 99 mwh with a peak of 2 88 mwh in july the mean quantity of co2 released without utilizing a solar collector can reach 1375 kg eq of co2 with a high of 1982 kg eq of co2 in july throughout the olive oil post production period between march and september the thermal energy generated from the ptc was 19 mwh which led to the avoidance of about 12 660 kg eq of co2 emissions to predict the profitability at the industrial level an economic study was based on the levelized cost of heat lcoh to estimate the cost of the parabolic trough solar collector distillation system over its lifetime the lcoh is frequently calculated over a 20 year life period and represented in dollars or euros per kilowatt hour unit 47 it considers the initial capital cost the discount rate as well as the ongoing operating and maintenance costs 18 lcoh cc crf aomc e col where cc aomc ecol and crf represents the capital cost the annual operation and maintenance cost the annual energy produced by the collector and the capital recovery factor respectively the lcoh of the current solar installation for olive oil mills wastewater treatment by distillation using a parabolic trough solar collector was estimated using the installation components costs listed in table 5 based on a projected total solar system investment cost of 7 21 k the levelized cost of heat was 0 3 kwhth from an economic standpoint the suggested system s cost may be reduced by mass production design optimization and local manufacture of the system s components in tunisia the suggested design looks promising in terms of technological feasibility decreased carbon emissions and net benefits to the green economy the use of renewable energy for heat production has become a cost competitive solution due to the marginal cost of some existing conventional production technologies the levelized cost of thermal energy has been used as an economic indicator to conduct a comparison between different energy sources table 6 significant research remains to be done on the cost of industrial thermal processes as it accounts for more than half of the system s total cost 4 conclusion in this work a novel system for olive oil mill wastewater treatment by distillation using a parabolic trough solar collector was investigated an experimental campaign was conducted during the olive oil post production period to investigate the feasibility environmental impact and profitability of this system a distiller optimization was also proposed using a numerical cfd tool the following were the study s main findings in comparison to the traditional solar distiller the use of a parabolic trough solar collector has allowed more heat gain to be transferred into the olive oil mill wastewater omww basin enhancing system productivity and decreasing temperature fluctuation computed productivity during sunny days was 296 ml of distillate per mj of heat gained from solar radiation while there has been a 23 decrease in the total amount of solar radiation during cloud cover days productivity has decreased by only 7 a significant reduction of 95 to 97 was observed for phenolic compounds following the distillation of unfiltered and filtered omww furthermore in comparison to the crude omww the ph of the recovered distillate has dropped significantly however several investigations have demonstrated that ph neutralization may be done at a reasonable cost the thermal behavior of the conical coil heat exchanger tubes and the omww falling film was numerically simulated it was found that by including spray type falling film evaporation system productivity could be enhanced by 30 the parabolic trough solar collector with 26 6 m2 of aperture area has generated 19 mwh of thermal energy throughout the olive oil post production phase which resulted in the avoidance of about 12 660 kg eq of co2 emissions the suggested design looks promising in terms of technological feasibility

12971,the olive oil industry although among the most important sectors in the mediterranean basin causes huge environmental problems due to the discharge of polluting wastewater the treatment of olive oil mill wastewater is therefore at the crossroads of many concerns and is a major challenge for sustainable development this study focuses on the exploitation of a parabolic trough solar collector as a clean source of energy for sustainable olive oil mill wastewater treatment a conical coil heat exchanger immersed in an olive oil mill wastewater distillation reservoir is coupled with a parabolic trough solar collector the productivity environmental impact and profitability of the proposed prototype are experimentally evaluated a comparative study and a physico chemical characterization of filtered and unfiltered olive oil mill wastewater are conducted to assess their potential reuse a simulation using a spray type falling film evaporation approach is realized to achieve numerical optimization the obtained results show that the use of a parabolic trough solar collector allows more heat gain to be transferred into the distiller enhancing system productivity and decreasing temperature fluctuation compared to the traditional solar distiller a significant reduction of 95 to 97 of phenolic compounds is observed for the distillate the overall analysis reveals that the 26 6 m2 parabolic trough solar collector aperture area has generated 19 mwh of thermal energy throughout the olive oil post production phase which led to the avoidance of about 12 660 kg eq of co2 emissions while the levelized cost of heat was 0 3 kwhth graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords parabolic trough solar collector olive mill wastewater distillation internal heat exchanger spray evaporation 1 introduction olive growing is among the most important arboricultural products in the mediterranean basin where its main output olive oil has a huge impact on these countries environmental social and economic issues indeed the olive industry helps to achieve economic growth food security employment creation and enhanced export earnings goals the benefits and attributes associated with olive oil have boosted consumption whose production is continually growing on a global level according to the international olive council olive oil production has tripled in the last 60 years 1 it reached 3207 000 tons in the 2019 2020 season accounting for 93 8 of the global total output tunisia with the world s second biggest olive growing area of 1 825 000 ha about a third of the country s cultivated land ranks out among ioc member nations with a productivity of 350 000 tons 2 at the same time the olive oil industry generates a large amount of toxic waste known as olive mill wastewater omww that has a high organic content a predominance of phenolic compounds and different flavonoids one kilogram of olives is thought to yield 1 to 1 5 l of omww resulting in global yearly production in the order of 10 to 30 million m3 3 if rejected without prior treatment these effluents will have a dangerous impact on the environment due to their ability to inhibit the development of plants and certain micro organisms change soil properties and contaminate the aquatic ecosystem the groundwater the public network and sewage treatment plants 4 environmental protection is one of the pillars of sustainable development which is a major challenge for humanity s and the planet s future wastewater treatment is now a societal problem that is at the crossroads of many concerns 5 several approaches have been tested to find an environmentally friendly and economically effective approach these approaches include physico chemical treatments evaporation filtration sedimentation adsorption and centrifugation biological treatments anaerobic and aerobic and biophysical treatments combined ultrasonication irradiation and aerobic la scalia et al 6 have used the membrane filtration system to extract the polyphenols from the omww to reduce environmental impact and achieve economic advantages based on byproduct recovery the economic sustainability of their system depends on an increment in the oil price which is not profitable for the consumers azzam 7 has employed adsorption as an omww treatment technique the results of his work showed that using volcanic tuff and clay alone and in combination along with activated charcoal should not be recommended for employment as a possible practical adsorbent for treatment protocols he concluded that olive mill wastewater is still an unsolved environmental problem recently ciggin et al 8 have investigated the potential of using ultrasonic enhanced fenton based advanced oxidation to minimize toxicity total phenol and organic matter in olive mill wastewater they emphasized advanced oxidation as a critical step in the treatment of olive mill wastewaters the significant reduction in omww toxicity was the study s highlight however due to the short term seasonal generation of omww and the reliance on several parameters that are not constant for all omww such as particle size distribution an exclusive biological treatment scheme is not applicable there have also been a large number of studies on combining multiple treatment methods in a series to generate acceptable effluent that can be released into the environment vuppala et al 9 have studied a sequential process i e a biological method following the coagulation and flocculation steps to achieve cleaner waste production abu dalo et al 10 have examined successive combinations of coagulation flocculation sedimentation and adsorption treatment approaches to enhance organic and phenolic compound removal from olive mill wastewater karray et al 11 have produced biogas a valuable algae biomass and treated omww using a bioprocess combining anaerobic co digestion followed by ultra filtration and microalgae culture even though these various techniques combining several treatment methods have demonstrated a high level of efficiency they present the risk of producing harmful by products as well as significant operating expenses there is currently no viable treatment option for omww and their environmental concerns are growing solar energy applications might also be utilized to dewater olive mill wastewater to decrease the initial volume making the residual sludge easier to manipulate and treat solar distillation is the most suited approach for such dewatering since it increases the rate of evaporation while also isolating the majority of dissolved materials and biological pollutants 12 potoglou et al 13 succeeded in achieving efficient separation of solids and liquid from the olive mill wastewater using a traditional solar still sklavos et al 14 used a solar distiller to investigate the simultaneous solar drying of omww and the recovery of phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties in the distillate singh et al 15 overviewed active solar distillation technology and found that solar desalination using a solar still is a cost effective solution to water purification but that it is not suited in some circumstances owing to the solar still s poor productivity integrating a parabolic trough solar collector can increase their production kumar et al 16 have coupled a single slope solar still with a parabolic trough collector their results show that the productivity of the solar still can be enhanced by integrating a parabolic trough collector nonetheless in kumar s prototype the solar still and the parabolic trough collector s receiver tube are connected to form a closed loop thermosiphon system for preheating water in a direct circuit their system s maximum temperature in all parts does not exceed 90 c even more using a heat exchanger in the areas of falling film spray and bubble evaporation has shown great potential for dehumidification in vapor compression cooling systems and has been investigated by some researchers in the field of air conditioning 17 18 support for research and development in solar heat for industrial processes is growing rapidly at a global level due to the high potential for the outcomes to drive innovative economic growth and address major societal challenges such as climate change secure and affordable energy supplies and resource depletion concentrated solar thermal technologies to provide solar heat for industrial processes are key systems for lowering industrial co2 emissions and addressing energy and environmental issues 19 20 based on the attractive solar resources of mediterranean regions especially tunisia the focus of this study is the exploitation of the parabolic trough solar collector ptc as a clean source of energy for the development of a sustainable olive oil mill wastewater treatment system the novelty lies in the proposed design of the distiller and the coupling system which can be adapted to the needs of each olive oil mill a parabolic trough solar collector installed at the research and technology centre of energy crten at borj cedria tunisia was coupled with a conical coil heat exchanger immersed in an omww distillation reservoir in this paper numerical and experimental findings were elaborated on and discussed the experimental studies were undertaken between march and september 2021 during the post production campaign of olive oil when landfills of by products became increasingly saturated to determine the system s practicality environmental impact and profitability in a subsequent step the numerical simulation was focused on the impact of spray type falling film evaporation on system productivity to optimize the proposed prototype 2 material and methods the studied setup for a sustainable olive oil mills wastewater omww treatment consists mainly of an innovative distiller coupled to a parabolic trough solar collector ptc as shown in fig 1 the distiller is made of a galvanized sheet and formed essentially by a condenser a distillate extraction unit and a distillation reservoir to which a major modification has been made the novelty of this distiller was the incorporation of a conical coil heat exchanger cchex immersed in the omww distillation reservoir the coil shaped heat exchanger was constructed from a copper tube with a diameter of 2 2 cm and a length of 750 m for the development of a coil with a height of 30 cm to match the distillation reservoir dimensions the minimum diameter at the top was considered 5 6 cm and the maximum diameter at the bottom was considered 20 cm forming 13 turns a straight tube section was provided at the inlet and outlet of the conical coil to be connected to the solar collector the fully insulated distillation reservoir that can accommodate up to 18 l of omww has a diameter of 24 cm and a height of 40 cm it has two openings for the inlet and outlet of the extraction tubes these tubes allow either the emptying of the distillation reservoir or the omww recirculation it will also allow the re injection of omww through a spray nozzle on the distiller s top where omww will evaporate dropwise on the conical coil heat exchanger tubes the condenser consisted of an open cylindrical vessel with a conical base the condensing unit was connected to a cooling water tank to cool and facilitate condensation the parabolic trough solar collector was attached to a steel structure with a tracking mechanism that allows movement along the azimuth axis this reflects the incident solar energy onto a black coated absorber tube the linear concentrator solar system consists of two modules each had an opening of 5 8 m 2 3 m for an opening area of 13 34 m2 and a reception area of 0 68 m2 the heat transfer fluid htf of 2 875 kj kg k specific heat flowing through the receiving tube is sent to the distiller heat transfer system at a flow rate of 1 2 m3 h to allow the treatment of olive mill wastewater by evaporation and condensation the characteristics of the ptc the main properties of the htf and the sizing of the distiller are given in table 1 the concentrated solar radiation at the ptc horizontal tube heats the htf that will be used to transport the heat to the distiller through the conical coil heat exchanger immersed in an olive oil mill wastewater distillation reservoir fig 2 the water in the omww is then removed as vapor evaporation of water requires a large amount of energy so the use of a ptc makes the process environmentally friendly by significantly improving profitability 20 the vapor generated by the distillation reservoir will be condensed in contact with the condenser s cold surface and collected through the cooling tubes in a condensate tank a parabolic trough collector installed at the research and technology centre of energy crten at borj cedria tunisia was used the site is located in a sunny region on the north african mediterranean coast near tunis city tunisia latitude 36 43 n longitude 10 25 e tunisia benefits from a large solar potential that is perfectly suited to solar thermal technologies and that can contribute significantly to the fight against climate change and the strengthening of energy security the average daily solar radiation is more than 4 5 kwh m2 with a total sunshine period of 3700 h year and 350 days of sunshine per year ambient temperatures can exceed 40 c in the summer and more than 20 c in the winter 21 the experiments were done during the post production campaign of olive oil when landfills of by products became increasingly saturated between march and september 2021 however only typical day data was discussed in this study sunny days and partially sunny days two tests were conducted successively per day in the time interval between 10 am and 5 pm the first 2 h were typically used to prepare omww samples while preheating htf in a ptc closed loop meteorological conditions such as solar radiation ambient temperature and relative humidity were collected by the crten thermal process laboratory devices in borj cedria the relative humidity and ambient temperature were measured by an emc dt 8892 multifunction sensor global solar irradiation was measured using a licor pyranometer model li 200 sz5 while the incident normal solar irradiation was measured using a pyrheliometer chp1 kipp and zonen mounted on the solys 2 sun tracker the htf temperature at the inlet and outlet of the absorber pipe and the cchex was measured using k type thermocouples type k thermocouples were also used to monitor the temperatures of the omww the vapor released the distillate the cchex tubes inside the distillation reservoir the condenser cooling water and the distiller wall over time all sensors and thermocouples have been connected to a type 21 campbell acquisition chain allowing the recording of experimental data with a temperature accuracy of 0 1 c the distillate was collected in a graduated tank and weighed at two minute intervals using a compact mettler toledo scale with a capacity of 15 kg the olive mill wastewater used in this study was collected from an olive oil mill in the kairouan region of central tunisia during the 2020 2021 olive oil production campaign two filtration processes were performed on the omww before being used in the experiments fig 3 centrifugation to separate the largest solid particles from the liquid phase and subsequently a filtration with a fine filter with narrow mesh 50 μm to obtain a less dense almost homogeneous solution black water the centrifugation was done to isolate the biggest particles in the omww and to approach the natural degradation in the reception and stabilization ponds smaller particles were filtered through the filters it was observed that the filtered omww had a darker coloration than the unfiltered omww this dark coloration is in some ways attributed to a reaction of auto oxidation and polymerization of phenolic compounds 22 indeed the transformation of phenolic alcohols into phenolic acids intensifies with decantation 22 23 however despite the color match characterization is essential to ensure compliance the omww composition depends on several factors such as the method of extraction of olive oil the olive variety and maturity and the climatic and edaphic conditions to characterize the filtered and unfiltered omww the physico chemical parameters acidity ph electrical conductivity salinity phenolic compounds dry matter humidity density were determined using several measuring instruments the ph the electrical conductivity and the salinity were measured using a multi parameter analyzer kit consort c831 model this analysis kit includes all the components necessary for physicochemical measurements electrodes buffers standards adapters and accessories the acidity of the samples was measured after the calibration of the ph meter the electrode was immersed in a buffer solution of ph 7 while adjusting the measuring box to the value of 7 then the same procedure was carried out with a buffer solution of ph 4 after calibration we dive for a few seconds for better stability the measuring electrode in a beaker containing a volume of omww and the ph value is recorded rinsing the electrode with distilled water between each measurement is important for good accuracy the electrical conductivity ce was measured in alternating current using a ce probe for a good measurement it is necessary to agitate the solution of the omww with a magnetic stirrer the unit of measurement was used in siemens per meter s m to ensure that the results are reliable the electrical conductivity of each solution was measured several times and then the average of these measurements was calculated the various electrodes are only activated and stable if they are wet for this purpose they have to be immersed in a kcl solution for several hours to avoid the effect of temperature on ce reading the instrument automatically adjusts the readings to a standard value of 25 c the salinity was obtained using the relationship eq 1 between salt concentration sc and electrical conductivity 24 1 sc g l ec ms cm 0 6 the total dry matter and moisture were determined after drying at 105 c in an oven for 24 h density was measured using a radwag precision balance wlc20 a2 and volumetric flask the phenolic compounds were determined by the colorimetric method using the folin ciocalteu technique 25 26 a 10 ml sample was mixed with 1 5 ml of sodium carbonate solution and 0 5 ml of folin ciocalteu reagent the resulting solution was stored in the dark for 1 h at 20 c and stirred every 15 min the absorbance of the solution was then measured at a wavelength of 750 nm using a spectrophotometer with an accuracy of 1 nm 14 table 2 shows the instrumentation devices used their specifications and their relative precision the measurement uncertainty in this paper was assessed according to the data dispersion relative to the average the standard deviation σ can be determined using eq 1 2 σ i 1 n x i x m 2 n where x i denotes the direct sensor measurement x m the arithmetic means and n the number of iterations the maximum discrepancy between the two temperature measurements was 0 57 c while the standard deviation was 0 32 c the largest uncertainty of dni measurements was 12 w m2 while the standard deviation was 7 w m2 the same parameters and physical model as the experimental configuration were adopted in numerical simulation to study the influence of omww spraying on heat transfer system productivity and system efficiency due to the complexity of simulating realistic flow conditions some assumptions were made to properly assess the heat and mass transfer of the falling film evaporation process 27 29 thus the model was based on the following assumptions that have been adopted by different researchers the droplets resulting from the spray nozzle admit the same size the fluid is a continuous and incompressible newtonian fluid the thermo physical parameters of the fluid are constant the interface is smooth not wavy the liquid film is distributed symmetrically on both sides of the tube the dynamic tracking of the gas liquid interface was performed by using the volume of fluid vof model 30 in the vof model each cell is occupied by a distinct phase or a combination of the two phases this implies the following conditions the cell is fully occupied by liquid α l 1 the cell is fully occupied by vapor α v 1 the cell is at the interface between the liquid and vapor phases α l α v 1 where α v is the volume fraction of the vapor phase and α l is the volume fraction of the liquid phase the falling film flow and the heat transfer process were described through the navier stokes equations in the vof model the momentum and energy equations were solved in the whole computational domain due to the dependence on the volume fraction of all phases however a modified continuity equation was used to track the motion of each phase using the volume fraction for the n phase the continuity equation of the vof model can be expressed as follow 3 α n ρ n t α n ρ n v s α n the momentum equation 4 ρ v t ρ v v p μ v v t ρ g f vol the energy equation 5 ρ c p t t ρ c p t v k t q s where s αn v p g f vol c p and q s are the mass transport in the phase transition process the velocity vector the pressure the acceleration of gravity the surface tension force the specific heat at constant pressure and the energy source term respectively similarly the ρ μ and k are the density the dynamic viscosity and the thermal conductivity that are given as a function of the weighted sum of phases in the vof model 6 ρ α l ρ l α v ρ v

the circumferential angle respectively the thermal efficiency of the olive oil mills wastewater distiller using a parabolic trough solar collector can be obtained through the ratio of the achieved omww distillate energy to the solar irradiation received by the ptc 32 17 η th s d δh i x a x 100 where s d represent the omww distillate productivity δh the vaporization enthalpy i the incident solar radiation and a the ptc opening area to perform an effective simulation some boundary conditions were set the water properties have been used due to the lack of information on omww in the literature and the high omww moisture content about 94 33 the sprayer was defined at a height of 0 4 m with a diameter of 0 04 m a spray density of 0 168 kg m s and a spray temperature of 90 c the spray density was set as the velocity inlet boundary condition the htf temperature at the inlet of the conical coil heat exchanger was 120 c fig 4 shows the 3d geometrical representation of the modeled conical coil heat exchanger with the spray nozzle the discretization of the governing equations was done using the finite volume method fvm through the second order upwind scheme and the dynamical track of the gas liquid interface was done using the high precision geo reconstruct scheme to validate the computing simulation the geometry and physical parameters were adjusted to much the experimental setup of parken et al 34 the sprayer height spray density spray temperature tube diameter and heat flux were set at 6 3 mm 0 168 kg m s 82 c 25 4 mm and 47 3 kw m2 respectively as shown in fig 5 the variation of the local heat transfer coefficient with respect to the circumferential angle of the tube obtained by simulation had the same trend as that obtained experimentally the greatest difference between the two curves was 2 29 kw m2 k at the angle of 0 due to the impact of the sprayed liquid on the top of the tube indeed the impact of the liquid film greatly increases the heat transfer which will gradually decrease as the fluid spreads over the surface of the tube 28 the average difference calculated between the experimental and simulation values was 0 57 kw m2 k these deviations may be related to the simulation assumptions adopted and the accuracy of the experimental measurements the consistency between the numerical computation and the experimental results demonstrates the reliability of the generated models 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental interpretations the time variations of the direct normal solar irradiance dni the ambient temperature the heat transfer fluid temperature at the inlet and outlet of the solar collector and the unfiltered and filtered omww temperature under summer and autumn climates were given in fig 6 the highest dni value recorded in the summer test was 1012 w m2 at 12 30 pm and 845 w m2 at 1 08 pm in the autumn test the values increased gradually over time and then began to decrease after 2 30 pm the fluctuations in solar radiation observed in fig 6 b were caused by an intermittent cloud cover giving an average dni value during the test of 713 w m2 compared to 927 w m2 on a sunny day as shown in fig 6 a the average ambient temperature in the experiment in summer climate was 40 c with the highest value recorded of 43 c while the highest ambient temperature recorded in the experiment under autumn climate was 25 c for an average value of 23 c as was expected the ambient temperature was showed the least variation whereas the htf temperature was varied with solar radiation fluctuations the htf temperature was followed the same trends as the solar irradiation with a significant increase in temperature at the beginning of the day the htf temperature at the outlet of the collector has reached 100 c in 1 h and 30 min and remained above this value for 6 h on sunny days the large solar irradiation decrease caused by intermittent cloud cover resulted in an htf temperature decrease during the day the mean temperatures recorded during experiments in summer and autumn climates were 147 c and 104 c respectively likewise as can be seen in fig 6 the maximum temperature reached in summer was 161 c whereas in autumn it was only 116 c the htf variations which were occurred periodically have not affected significantly the omww temperature curve an increase in the omww temperature was observed at the beginning of each experiment followed by a stabilization around 100 c which means the evaporation process occurrence and eventually a gradual increase besides slightly higher evaporation temperatures were observed for unfiltered omww indeed during the evaporation phase the average temperature of the filtered and unfiltered omww was 101 c and 104 c respectively this temperature difference is explained by the presence of a larger quantity of particles in the unfiltered omww moreover the drop in the water percentage contained in the omww induced the temperature increase towards the end of the experiments this involved the stopping of the distillation to prevent the carbonization of the omww residual sludge the obtained results also showed that the useful heat provided by the parabolic trough solar collector was implicitly related to the solar radiation intensity and significantly affected the distiller s productivity fig 7 shows the water recovery ratio wrr curve for filtered and unfiltered olive oil mills wastewater under summer climate and autumn climate the wrr was defined as the amount of water recovered relative to the initial amount of water contained in the omww as a function of the distillation time in both experiments the distillations were done with the same initial volume of 12 6 l for filtered and unfiltered omww the final ratios of water recovered were around 93 for filtered and unfiltered omww the amount of distillate recovered during the distillation of the filtered omww was slightly higher than that of the unfiltered omww moreover a 20 reduction in distillation time was observed during the experiment in summer climate compared with the experiment in autumn climate the amount of distillate totaled 42 l which approximates 285 ml of distillate per 1 mj of heat gained from solar radiation nevertheless the total amount of solar radiation was less by 23 in autumn tests compared to summer tests resulting in a decrease in productivity during the cloud cover days 296 ml and 275 ml of distillate per 1 mj of heat gained from solar radiation during the experiment in summer and autumn respectively the use of a ptc allowed a better overall heat gain injected into the omww distillation reservoir improving the productivity of the system with more stability and fewer temperature fluctuations than traditional solar distillers the same trend was observed in some studies 16 20 35 36 indeed the results revealed a fairly high and relatively stable temperature level of the omww with high distillation productivity of the distillation device using a parabolic trough solar collector a comparison of the productivity results of this study with different units of olive mill wastewater distillation in the literature is given in table 3 several physico chemical parameters were measured and shown in table 4 both filtered and unfiltered omww had acidic ph a high moisture ratio and a predominance of toxic substances the phenolic compounds a slight decrease in ph value was observed for filtered omww compared to unfiltered omww these results are within the range cited in the studies on the evolution of omww during storage in receiving basins 23 38 in addition the filtration procedure reduced the overall amount of dry matter in the olive oil mill wastewater preventing adherence to internal walls and extending the longevity of the equipment the results in table 4 show that the ph of the recovered distillate has decreased significantly compared to the crude omww the ph values of the recovered distillates ranged from 3 46 to 3 5 while the ph values of the omww ranged from 4 39 to 4 46 these values are very low compared to the tunisian standards for landfill and reuse which are between 6 5 and 8 5 39 however several studies have shown that low cost ph neutralization has been possible in particular with the use of lime 40 marble powder 41 or sand 42 a drop in the ph values might also corrode the equipment some studies focused on this kind of problem and several anti corrosive techniques have been studied in recent years among them are galvanic coupling sacrificial electrode and the addition of an inhibitor or a thermal coating recently fadhil et al 43 have succeeded in reducing the corrosion rate of a distillation column with the application of thermal coating technology using ceramic materials in addition the distillation significantly decreased the electrical conductivity from 11 24 ms cm to 0 91 ms cm for distillates from filtered omww and from 14 64 ms cm to 1 02 ms cm for distillates from unfiltered omww this can be explained by the presence of a very little inorganic ionic compound in the evaporated waters similarly these values are closely related to the decrease in the level of salinity in the distillate indeed electrical conductivity depends on the concentrations of dissolved substances and their natures 37 a significant reduction of 95 to 97 was also observed for phenolic compounds following the distillation of unfiltered and filtered omww the results obtained by the prototype studied in line with the literature are very encouraging and give rise to a further valorization of the extracted water due to its high calorific power the paste residue from distillation might be used as a source of renewable energy reducing fossil fuel consumption and its associated environmental implications 37 to treat the paste residue from distillation a solar dryer using a parabolic trough solar collector developed by our team in previous work for olive mill sludge treatment was utilized 44 it was observed that the unpleasant odors had disappeared the paste residue from distillation was ground into a powder once dried for convenience of transport and valorization fig 8 shows the paste residue the powder from the dried paste residue and the distilled omww 3 2 numerical interpretations the wall temperature distribution of the conical coil heat exchanger tubes was studied under boiling conditions and spray type falling film fig 9 a shows the temperature behavior on the tube surface under boiling conditions when the conical coil heat exchanger was half immersed in the olive oil wastewater distillation reservoir fig 9 b shows the temperature behavior when adding the spray type falling film at the top of the cchex it can be seen from these figures that with the addition of spray type falling film the temperature gradient between the top and bottom of cchex gets larger indeed when the sprayed omww hits the cchex tubes it exchanges heat with the tube wall some of the pulverized omww evaporates when it falls onto the cchex tube the rest gradually envelops the tube s wall due to gravity viscous force and surface tension the falling film evaporation heat transfer process can be divided into three regions according to the variation in temperature of the tube s contour as shown in fig 10 the impact caused by the impingement of pulverized omww on the upper part of the tube wall strengthened the mixing of hot and cold fluid inside the liquid film resulting in increased heat transfer in the impingement region the temperature of the thin liquid film that had formed on the tube surface gradually increased in the circumferential flow in the thermal developing region the temperature disturbance inside the liquid film was weakened which may be explained by the heat transfer mechanism of thin film evaporation and nucleate boiling evaporation as the liquid film spreads in the departure region the temperature disturbance of the liquid film intensifies due to the increase in heat transfer again in this region a vortex was formed in the stagnation point at the lower part of the tube wall to escape from the tube wall under the action of gravity and fall to the outlet to complete the falling film flow process indeed thin film evaporation and nucleate boiling play an important role in spray type falling film evaporation these two factors can be roughly dependent on each other on the heat flux and the spray density 27 fig 11 shows the vapor behavior inside the distillation reservoir the formation and dynamics of vapor bubbles have an impact on falling film near the tube surface and hence have a significant impact on heat transfer properties 27 by evaporating liquid near the heat exchanger tubes the bubble swells to a given size then moves away from the heated surface leaves the liquid and migrates to the top of the tank the vapor concentrates at the top of the distillation reservoir and goes to the condenser orifice spray type falling film evaporation is an efficient heat transfer technology for energy saving and productivity improvement 27 the results revealed that the integration of spray type falling film evaporation has roughly improved the exploitation of the cchex exchange surface with a larger local temperature gradient and better heat transfer performance furthermore it was found that the heat transfer temperature difference rose by roughly 5 c which implies a 30 increase in system productivity 3 3 energy savings economic evaluation and environmental performance tunisia has significant renewable energy potential particularly solar which must be attempted to harness in order to assure a secure energy future similarly energy and waste are interrelated energy is needed for waste treatment and can also be extracted from waste direct normal irradiance is the most significant metric for concentrated solar thermal technology simulation and implementation 45 fig 12 illustrates an estimate of the number of hours per month with a direct normal irradiance of more than or equal to 600 w m2 made using transient system simulation software and a meteorological database as illustrated in fig 12 the monthly average sunshine duration with a dni greater than or equal to 600 w m2 varies from 3 to 4 h day in winter and 5 to 6 h day in summer in general olive oil is produced between october and mars and the dumps of by products become saturated at the end of this period adequate and specific dimensioning for the needs of each olive oil mill will allow them to treat their waste before the start of the following olive oil extraction season the results showed that tunisia is endowed with interesting solar radiation and the use of cst technologies allowed a better overall heat gain injected into the omww distillation reservoir resulting in high productivity that approximates 285 ml of distillate per 1 mj this implies that a parabolic trough solar installation with an aperture area of 100 m2 will be able to treat up to 46 kg of omww per hour tunisia relies on gas and oil to satisfy nearly all of its energy demands however the primary sources of co2 emissions are the combustion of natural gas and fuel oil with about 640 kg co2 eq mwh and about 690 kg co2 eq mwh respectively as a result some policies and steps were implemented to reduce reliance on fossil fuel reserves 46 the solar concentrator s incorporation into treatment systems also reduces the concerns associated with the usage of fossil energy in the waste treatment process allowing for ecologically responsible production fig 13 shows the monthly quantities of the avoided co2 emissions due to the useful energy gained by the ptc the monthly mean amount of thermal energy generated by the ptc was 1 99 mwh with a peak of 2 88 mwh in july the mean quantity of co2 released without utilizing a solar collector can reach 1375 kg eq of co2 with a high of 1982 kg eq of co2 in july throughout the olive oil post production period between march and september the thermal energy generated from the ptc was 19 mwh which led to the avoidance of about 12 660 kg eq of co2 emissions to predict the profitability at the industrial level an economic study was based on the levelized cost of heat lcoh to estimate the cost of the parabolic trough solar collector distillation system over its lifetime the lcoh is frequently calculated over a 20 year life period and represented in dollars or euros per kilowatt hour unit 47 it considers the initial capital cost the discount rate as well as the ongoing operating and maintenance costs 18 lcoh cc crf aomc e col where cc aomc ecol and crf represents the capital cost the annual operation and maintenance cost the annual energy produced by the collector and the capital recovery factor respectively the lcoh of the current solar installation for olive oil mills wastewater treatment by distillation using a parabolic trough solar collector was estimated using the installation components costs listed in table 5 based on a projected total solar system investment cost of 7 21 k the levelized cost of heat was 0 3 kwhth from an economic standpoint the suggested system s cost may be reduced by mass production design optimization and local manufacture of the system s components in tunisia the suggested design looks promising in terms of technological feasibility decreased carbon emissions and net benefits to the green economy the use of renewable energy for heat production has become a cost competitive solution due to the marginal cost of some existing conventional production technologies the levelized cost of thermal energy has been used as an economic indicator to conduct a comparison between different energy sources table 6 significant research remains to be done on the cost of industrial thermal processes as it accounts for more than half of the system s total cost 4 conclusion in this work a novel system for olive oil mill wastewater treatment by distillation using a parabolic trough solar collector was investigated an experimental campaign was conducted during the olive oil post production period to investigate the feasibility environmental impact and profitability of this system a distiller optimization was also proposed using a numerical cfd tool the following were the study s main findings in comparison to the traditional solar distiller the use of a parabolic trough solar collector has allowed more heat gain to be transferred into the olive oil mill wastewater omww basin enhancing system productivity and decreasing temperature fluctuation computed productivity during sunny days was 296 ml of distillate per mj of heat gained from solar radiation while there has been a 23 decrease in the total amount of solar radiation during cloud cover days productivity has decreased by only 7 a significant reduction of 95 to 97 was observed for phenolic compounds following the distillation of unfiltered and filtered omww furthermore in comparison to the crude omww the ph of the recovered distillate has dropped significantly however several investigations have demonstrated that ph neutralization may be done at a reasonable cost the thermal behavior of the conical coil heat exchanger tubes and the omww falling film was numerically simulated it was found that by including spray type falling film evaporation system productivity could be enhanced by 30 the parabolic trough solar collector with 26 6 m2 of aperture area has generated 19 mwh of thermal energy throughout the olive oil post production phase which resulted in the avoidance of about 12 660 kg eq of co2 emissions the suggested design looks promising in terms of technological feasibility

12972,piezoelectric materials are used to degrade organic pollutants in water under ultrasonic vibration however in particulate form it limits recyclability and reuse on the other hand a polymer based device suffers from low piezo catalytic performance this work reports a free standing non toxic retrievable and reusable polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 0 67bifeo3 0 33batio3 bf33bt composite mold for fast degradation of complex organic dyes bf33bt nanoparticles and pvdf bf33bt composite mold were synthesized using the sol gel and solvent casting methods the optimized composite mold degrades 5 mg l 1 of methylene blue rhodamine b and crystal violet up to 98 91 and 88 respectively in 40 min the superior performance is attributed to the combined piezoelectric property of pvdf and bf33bt which enhances the production of reactive oxygen species the mold can be used up to 10 times with negligible loss in efficiency hence presenting a low cost strategy for the degradation of complex dyes found in industrial effluents for remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pvdf bf33bt piezo catalysis composite mold dye degradation wastewater treatment 1 introduction rapid industrialization has led to an ever increasing threat from chemical dyes present in industrial wastes thus causing water pollution among the various dyes methylene blue mb rhodamine b rhb and crystal violet cv are widely used in textile paper leather and pharmaceutical industries and have adverse effects on the human body such as breathing hazards kidney failure and carcinogenic impact 1 these synthetic dyes are highly stable and non biodegradable due to their complex structures many approaches such as the activated sludge process adsorption coagulation and ozonation have been used to treat the effluents containing dyes still the methods are expensive slow or ineffective ways to degrade the dyes completely 2 3 advanced oxidation processes aops like electrocatalysis photocatalysis and piezo catalysis have been developed for efficient and complete degradation 4 5 in these processes electron hole pairs are generated when the catalyst material is subjected to specific stimuli and the electron hole pairs create superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which degrade the cationic dyes 6 7 electrical energy light and mechanical vibrations are the stimuli for electrocatalysis photocatalysis and piezo catalysis processes respectively in electrocatalysis specific electrodes and solutions must maintain ph level 4 8 while photocatalysis depends on the wavelength intensity and exposure of light 9 11 in sharp contrast the piezo catalysis process uses a mechanical vibration to produce electrons and holes on the surface of the piezo catalyst for the dye degradation process thereby making it a simple cost effective and highly efficient strategy for environmental remediation 12 13 various piezoelectric materials like pb zr ti o3 linbo3 znsno3 batio3 bifeo3 bi na tio3 and na k nbo3 have been studied for piezo catalytic activity 11 12 14 15 however the toxic nature of pb based materials low piezoelectricity and requirement of high voltage poling restrict the practical applicability and has led to the exploration of better alternative materials 16 among lead free piezoelectric materials batio3 bt has good piezoelectricity wide bandgap 3 19 ev and favorable band alignment 0 5 v vs reversible hydrogen electrode rhe but requires high energy stimulus 17 on the other hand bifeo3 bf has lower piezoelectricity narrow bandgap 2 2 ev and misaligned conduction band with a redox potential of 0 33 v vs rhe 17 therefore the combination of bf and bt may give reasonable piezoelectricity and narrower bandgap than bt and appropriate redox potential for electron hole pair generation in this aspect the solid solution 0 67bifeo3 0 33batio3 bf33bt has been reported with morphotropic phase boundary mpb and high piezoelectricity even without high voltage poling 250 pc n 1 at 25 c 18 and a bandgap of 2 6 ev for 0 7bifeo3 0 3batio3 17 usually the piezo catalysis process uses the piezoelectric materials in powder form making them difficult to retrieve from the water after degradation for reusability methods like centrifugation and vacuum filtration are generally used to separate the powder from treated water 19 so a better strategy is to use the piezoceramic powder as a mold of polymeric composite 4 in this aspect polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is a piezoelectric polymer that is widely studied in piezoelectric composites for piezo catalytic applications 20 22 pvdf shows maximum piezoelectricity in its electroactive β phase and the fraction of β phase can be improved by using polar solvent and proper filler 23 25 similarly bf33bt shows excellent piezoelectric property and has been reported for dye degradation in particulate form 0 7bifeo3 0 3batio3 17 though there are some reports on composite based reusable piezo catalysts the limitations such as the tedious synthesis process 17 low reaction kinetics 16 and the strenuous retrieving process 19 are still a matter of concern addressing the issues here a novel lead free pvdf bf33bt composite is reported sol gel route was followed to synthesize bf33bt and pvdf bf33bt composite was molded by solvent casting the piezo catalytic composite mold with 30 wt of bf33bt and 81 of the fraction of β phase was able to degrade mb rhb and cv solutions up to 98 91 and 88 respectively in 40 min with ultrasonic vibration scavengers were used to verify the vital role of hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 species in decomposing the dyes the easily retrievable mold was reused ten times with minimal loss in catalytic efficiency to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first report on using a facile non toxic pvdf bf33bt piezo catalytic mold for fast degradation of industrial effluents having stable piezo catalytic activity over multiple reuses the study provides an efficient and promising

solutions with a concentration of 5 mg l 1 the beakers containing dye solutions with the molds were placed undisturbed under dark conditions for 1 h to establish adsorption desorption equilibrium ade then piezo catalysis experiment was performed by placing the setups in the bath sonicator unit to provide the mechanical vibration as shown in fig 1c ice bags were used to avoid thermal influence and the whole experiments were conducted under dark conditions the degradation of the dyes was investigated by measuring the concentration of the dyes after a regular interval of sonication using the uv visible spectrophotometer 2 6 scavenger test three different scavengers were added to the dye solutions separately to investigate the role of free radicals during the piezo catalysis process in this method 1 mmol l 1 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta benzoquinone bq and tert butyl alcohol tba were added to the dye solutions and piezo catalytic performance was studied 3 result and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural analysis morphology of the bf33bt powder and the composite mold was investigated by scanning electron microscope fig 2a shows the fe sem image of the as synthesized bf33bt nanoparticles from which the shape of the nanoparticles was found to be spherical the histogram of the diameter distribution is given in fig 2c the statistics confirm that the maximum number of particles has a diameter between 40 nm to 50 nm with an average diameter of 49 nm fig 2b shows the sem micrograph of the cross section pb30 composite mold it can be observed that the spherical bf33bt nanoparticles are held together by the pvdf matrix the magnified image of the nanoparticles tightly held by pvdf is given in the inset of fig 2b the phase study of bf33bt and the piezo catalytic composite mold was done by xrd fig 2d depicts the xrd pattern of bf33bt nanoparticles the peak patterns can be assigned to perovskite structures of bt and bf with c symmetry pm 3 m pdf 31 0174 and r symmetry r3m pdf 72 2112 respectively 18 the bifurcation of the peaks at around 2θ of 39o and 54 4o inset of fig 2d represents the coexistence of both rhombohedral and pseudo cubic phases at room temperature 26 27 debye scherrer equation was used to calculate the cell parameters of the bf 33bt crystal structures the equation relates the wavelength λ inter planner distance d and bragg s diffraction angle θ as n λ 2 d sin θ where n 1 28 considering the highest intensity peak at 2θ value of 31 65 and the cubic structure a b c the inter planner distance cell parameter and the crystalline size were calculated to be 2 824 å 3 993 å and 63 66 å3 respectively well matched with reported values 29 30 fig 2e represents the xrd patterns of pure pvdf mold and pb30 composite mold the xrd pattern of pvdf has one significant peak at 2θ of 20 4o which corresponds to the electroactive β phase and the shoulder peak at 18 5o represents the α phase 31 the characteristic peaks of both β phase of pvdf and bf33bt can be observed in the xrd pattern of the pb30 composite mold the intensity of the β phase peak is lesser than the ceramic peaks due to the semi crystalline nature of pvdf further room temperature raman spectroscopy was studied to investigate the existence of β phase of pvdf in the composite molds with different concentrations of bf33bt raman spectra of the composite molds are shown in fig 2f the peaks corresponding to bf33bt are marked with and the β phase peak of pvdf is marked with β the broad peaks at around 260 cm 1 and 515 cm 1 correspond to a1 to1 and a1 to4 vibration modes of batio3 whereas the sharp peak at the raman shift of 80 cm 1 corresponds to the dominant a site vibration of bifeo3 32 33 the small and sharp peaks at 790 cm 1 and 836 cm 1 correspond to α phase and β phase respectively according to symmetric cf2 stretching characteristics 31 34 in all the composite spectra the peak at 836 cm 1 represents a prominent β phase of pvdf in the composite molds the intensity of the pvdf peaks decreases compared to those of bf33bt when the concentration of bf33bt is increased this is attributed to the higher raman sensitive bonds of the ceramic compared to vibrations of cf and ch bonds of pvdf though raman spectra can identify β phase ftir spectra were used to investigate the effect of bf33bt concentration on the β phase of pvdf in the composite molds fig 2g represents the ftir spectra of pvdf bf33bt composite molds within the measured range 700 cm 1 to 1400 cm 1 only pvdf peaks are prominent the peaks at around 839 cm 1 and 1274 cm 1 correspond to the electroactive β phase whereas at 762 cm 1 represents α phase of pvdf 31 the fraction of β phase fβ in pvdf is estimated using eq 1 1 f β i 840 1 262 i 763 i 840 100 i 840 and i 763 are the absorbance intensities of the peaks at wavenumber 839 cm 1 and 762 cm 1 respectively 35 f β of pvdf pb10 pb20 pb30 and pb40 was found to be 61 69 76 81 and 79 respectively formation of β phase of pvdf in pristine pvdf is due to the polar solvent dmf 23 whereas the improvement in fraction of β phase in pvdf bf33bt may be due to the rotation of ch2 bond of pvdf as a result of hydrogen bond formation in between oxygen atoms of bf33bt and hydrogen atoms of pvdf 36 the decrement of the fraction of β phase of pb40 may be attributed to the aggregation of bf33bt nanoparticles in the pvdf matrix 37 3 2 piezo catalytic activity the concentration of bf33bt in the pvdf matrix was first optimized based on the piezo catalytic performance of the composites pvdf pb10 pb20 pb30 pb40 using methylene blue mb dye as explained in section 2 5 the order of the reaction kinetics was investigated the zero order kinetics reaction does not depend on the reactant concentration 38 39 for the same the number of the piezo catalytic mold was doubled both are pb30 and of the same dimension and weight as a result the total degradation time for the methylene blue was reduced to half from 40 min to 20 min 39 hence the reaction is not of zero order and the proportionality of the rate with the reactant suggests the reaction to be first order 4 for the testing of the adaptation for the second order reaction kinetics the curves square of the relative concentration vs time do not fit perfectly with the shape of the second order reaction 40 the degradation of the dye can be observed by decoloration of the solution and measured in terms of relative concentration c c 0 c concentration after a particular duration c 0 initial concentration fig 3a represents the variation of relative concentration with respect to the duration of ultrasonication after ade for each mold furthermore the natural logarithm of relative concentration exhibits a pseudo first order kinetic model in terms of the rate constant of the degradation reaction k and time of ultrasonication t which is given in eq 2 4 20 21 2 ln c c 0 kt fig s1 of supplementary information si represents the linear fittings of ln c 0 c versus t curves for each mold to find out the rate constant of the degradation reaction or reaction constant k as the slope 20 the reaction rate constant for pvdf pb10 pb20 pb30 and pb40 was found to be 0 00681 min 1 0 0261 min 1 0 0498 min 1 0 0927 min 1and 0 0653 min 1 with fitting accuracy of more than 95 fig s2 it can be observed that with an increment of bf33bt concentration in the piezo catalytic mold the degradation reaction rate increases up to 30 wt this proves that piezo catalytic performance depends on the piezoelectric property of the catalyst and here in this case the fraction of β phase of pvdf 21 the lower reaction rate constant of pb40 than pb30 is due to the lesser fraction of β phase of pvdf as estimated from ftir spectra for better understanding fig s3 represents the percentage degradation d 1 relative concentration 100 of mb with each mold at different intervals of ultrasonication in 40 min of ultrasonication pvdf pb10 pb20 pb30 and pb40 can achieve degradation up to 23 64 86 98 and 93 respectively this indicates that the piezoceramic bf33bt acts as a nucleating agent to enhance the piezo catalytic property of pvdf by improving the fraction of the β phase 36 further to verify the optimized concentration of bf33bt in the pvdf matrix the piezoelectric potential was measured for each composite mold under the ultrasonic bath as explained in 41 the measured piezoelectric potential of the molds with different bf33bt concentrations is given in fig s4 and it is clear that pb30 shows the maximum piezoelectric potential well supported by our previous work 27 hence the optimized pb30 composite mold was used for further degradation studies further rhb and cv were degraded using pb30 and the image of the dye solutions at different intervals of the process is depicted in fig 3b degradation of the dye due to piezo catalysis can be easily observed from the decoloration of the solutions uv visible absorbance spectra of mb rhb and cv during degradation using pb30 in different time intervals are shown in fig 3c d and e respectively mb rhb and cv have the characteristic absorption peaks at a wavelength of 660 nm 550 nm and 590 nm respectively after 40 min of ultrasonication with pb30 piezo catalyst the relative concentration was in the order of cv rhb mb fig 3f to compare the degradation reaction kinetics for each dye reaction rate constants were estimated by linear fitting of ln c 0 c curves with respect to time as shown in fig 3g the reaction rate constant k for each dye was 0 0927 min 1 0 0614 min 1 and 0 0557 min 1 with an r 2 value of more than 0 97 as depicted in fig 3h this indicates that for the same piezo catalyst pb30 the degradation rate of the dyes is in the order of mb rhb cv for this very reason with 40 min of ultrasonication with pb30 mb rhb and cv were degraded up to 98 91 and 88 respectively fig 3i this unequal degradation of each dye is attributed to the respective degradation process complexities explained elsewhere 42 44 the degradation is caused by reactive oxygen species oh and o2 produced by free electrons and holes segregated by the piezo potential of the mold during ultrasonic vibration 4 12 to investigate the role of these free radicals in the degradation process the scavenger test was performed with some reaction quenching agents scavengers 3 3 piezo catalysis with scavengers edta tba and bq are the quenchers of holes h hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 reactive species respectively 4 20 45 fig 4a shows the relative concentration of rhb dye solution in the presence of these scavengers during the degradation process using pb30 piezo catalytic mold due to the addition of scavengers the degradation reaction was somewhat inhibited the reactions still exhibit linearity in the presence of scavengers but possess lesser slopes as shown in fig 4b the reaction rate constant was found to be 0 0614 min 1 0 0215 min 1 0 01 min 1and 0 0079 min 1 for degradation of rhb without scavenger with edta tba and bq respectively so reaction kinetics is reduced by 65 83 and 87 by edta tba and bq respectively fig 4c depicts the percentage degradation of rhb dye solution in the presence of different scavengers it is clear that after 40 min of ultrasonication rhb was degraded by 91 56 36 and 28 in the presence of no scavenger edta tba and bq respectively thus it is confirmed that the piezo catalyst causes the formation of hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 species when subjected to ultrasonic vibration all three dyes were studied for the scavenger test however because the rate constant of the rhb is nearly equivalent to the average of all three dyes the performance of the rhb has been reported 3 4 mechanism of piezo catalytic degradation of dyes based on the physics of piezoelectric energy conversion a possible mechanism for the process of piezo catalysis is given in fig 5 both pvdf and bf33bt have spontaneous polarization due to non centrosymmetric atomic arrangement in the unit cell but they remain electrically neutral until subjected to some external deformation force when an external force is applied an electromotive force is generated on the opposite surfaces of the composite mold if an external circuit connects both the surfaces of the mold it causes a current in the circuit rather than an accumulation of the electrons and holes at the material s surface in the piezo catalysis process the mold is submerged in the dye solution and subjected to ultrasonic vibration electrons and holes are accumulated at the surface of the piezo catalytic mold during ultrasonic vibration 11 as no external circuit connects the mold s opposite surfaces the charged particles split the adsorbed water molecule to form h and oh ions as shown in fig 5a 17 during the alteration of the charged particles in the piezo catalytic mold from opposite surfaces some of the electrons and holes react with adsorbed o2 and oh to form superoxide o2 and hydroxyl oh ions as depicted in fig 5 b 12 17 20 46 the reaction of the electrons and holes may be facilitated by the bending of the conduction band cb and valence band vb of the bf33bt respectively electrons from the cb react with o2 to form o2 0 33 v vs normal hydrogen electrode or nhe and holes from vb react with oh to form oh 1 9 v vs nhe 17 47 a detailed explanation of energy band gap estimation and band bending mechanism of bf33bt is given in section s2 and fig s5 of si the reactive oxygen species ros o2 and oh react with complex dye molecules to break them into non toxic components such as h2o co2 nh4 no3 in multiple steps fig 5c 4 the generation of reactive species and their role in redox reactions in the piezo catalytic process are given in reactions 1 to 5 17 48 49 1 pvdf bf 3 3bt mold vibration pvdf bf 3 3bt mold e h 2 h 2 o e oh 3 o 2 e o 2 4 oh h oh 5 o 2 oh dye degradation products of the dyes the breakdown of the dye molecules was identified from the decolorization of the solution and the relative concentration of the dye during the degradation process was measured considering the absorbance spectra of the uv vis spectrum the contribution of the holes and the reactive oxygen species were verified using scavengers which inhibit the degradation process by trapping the reactive species the effect of the ph of the dye solution on the piezo catalysis was studied and the catalytic performance is the highest in the near neutral ph range 6 8 and is shown in fig s6 a similar result has also been reported in the literature 50 51 with the addition of bf33bt nanoparticles to the pvdf matrix the piezoelectric β phase improves and being a piezoelectric ceramic bf33bt also contributes to the piezo catalysis process thus the combined effect of pvdf and bf33bt leads to a higher percentage of degradation of the dyes than pristine pvdf during ultrasonic vibration the resultant polarization induced in the pvdf bf33bt composite is higher compared to pristine pvdf mold and this is schematically depicted in fig 5d and e 3 5 reusability the optimum condition for removing the piezo catalytic mold from the dye solution is the 100 degradation of the dye or full decoloration for methylene blue rhodamine b and crystal violet the mold removal time was found to be 47 min 99 9 60 min 99 and 65 min 99 3 respectively for the above measurement and the reusability test pb30 mold was used the mold was washed with di water and dried at 50 c overnight after every use to investigate the reusability of the mold the relative concentration of the mb solution with respect to time for each reuse is shown in fig 6a fig 6b represents the percentage degradation of mb solution by pb30 in 40 min the percentage degradation of mb for 1st use 4th 7th and 10th reuse of pb30 in 40 min was 98 95 91 and 85 respectively this decrement in the efficiency of the mold for dye degradation is due to the loss of adsorption capability of the mold with the number of recycling the adsorption capability of the mold can be realized from the relative concentration of dye solution after ade without ultrasonication during the 1st use due to the submerged mold 2 4 of the dye is degraded after ade but the same is reduced to 1 5 during the 9th reuse this is depicted in fig 6c in terms of the relative concentration of mb solution after ade though there is a slight reduction in the efficiency of the piezo catalytic mold after several recycles it makes the retrieval process of piezo catalyst easier than earlier reported piezo catalytic semiconductor materials retrieved from the dye solution after centrifugation or filtration process 19 the stability of the piezo catalytic mold was investigated by analyzing the change in chemical composition and catalytic performance after multiple reuses 52 53 the xrd patterns and the ftir spectra of the mold before use and after the 10th reuse are compared in fig 6 d and e respectively no spectacular change is observed in either xrd or ftir patterns after the 10th reuse indicating the chemical stability of the piezo catalyst even after multiple reuses the root cause of the water molecule splitting is the piezoelectric emf due to the mechanical vibration no leaching of the metal ions from the catalyst is involved in the process of formation of the hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 species as no chemical process is involved in emf generation 16 20 this is also evidenced by the xrd and ftir spectra shown in fig 6 d and e table 1 gives an overview of comparing similar types of reports with pvdf bf33bt composite mold the retrievable composite piezo catalysts reported are in different forms such as porous foam 50 54 film 20 and nanofibers 21 which require sophisticated instruments like electrospinning unlike the facile pvdf bf33bt mold synthesis further similar reports have shown a degradation time of 120 min or higher which is three times more than the degradation time of this work 20 54 the works in which the direct use of the piezoelectric ceramic powders have been reported suffer from non reusability 55 56 some reports claimed the retrievability of the piezo catalytic powder from the solution however those are difficult and time consuming processes such as centrifugation filtration 17 19 on the contrary the piezo catalytic composite mold demonstrated in this work is free standing can be retrieved easily and reutilized with negligible loss of efficiency up to 10 times the synthesis process of the pvdf bf33bt composite mold is simple and does not require any sophisticated instrumentation this offers a potential approach for the fast degradation of complex dye molecules in wastewater 4 conclusion this work explored the synthesis of pvdf bf33bt composite piezo catalytic mold and its utilization to degrade complex dye molecules the sol gel route synthesized bf33bt nanoparticles and pvdf bf33bt composite molds with different bf33bt concentrations were prepared using the solvent casting method the study of ftir spectra reveals the enhancement of piezoelectric β phase of pvdf due to bf33bt inclusion up to 30 wt pb30 composite mold was used to degrade mb rhb and cv dyes by ultrasonic vibration up to 98 91 and 88 respectively in 40 min the concept proposes a non toxic piezo catalyst that can be easily retrieved and reused multiple times the fast performing pvdf bf33bt composite is better than prior reports thus the free standing retrievable pvdf bf33bt composite can be used for efficient piezo catalytic remediation of

12972,piezoelectric materials are used to degrade organic pollutants in water under ultrasonic vibration however in particulate form it limits recyclability and reuse on the other hand a polymer based device suffers from low piezo catalytic performance this work reports a free standing non toxic retrievable and reusable polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 0 67bifeo3 0 33batio3 bf33bt composite mold for fast degradation of complex organic dyes bf33bt nanoparticles and pvdf bf33bt composite mold were synthesized using the sol gel and solvent casting methods the optimized composite mold degrades 5 mg l 1 of methylene blue rhodamine b and crystal violet up to 98 91 and 88 respectively in 40 min the superior performance is attributed to the combined piezoelectric property of pvdf and bf33bt which enhances the production of reactive oxygen species the mold can be used up to 10 times with negligible loss in efficiency hence presenting a low cost strategy for the degradation of complex dyes found in industrial effluents for remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pvdf bf33bt piezo catalysis composite mold dye degradation wastewater treatment 1 introduction rapid industrialization has led to an ever increasing threat from chemical dyes present in industrial wastes thus causing water pollution among the various dyes methylene blue mb rhodamine b rhb and crystal violet cv are widely used in textile paper leather and pharmaceutical industries and have adverse effects on the human body such as breathing hazards kidney failure and carcinogenic impact 1 these synthetic dyes are highly stable and non biodegradable due to their complex structures many approaches such as the activated sludge process adsorption coagulation and ozonation have been used to treat the effluents containing dyes still the methods are expensive slow or ineffective ways to degrade the dyes completely 2 3 advanced oxidation processes aops like electrocatalysis photocatalysis and piezo catalysis have been developed for efficient and complete degradation 4 5 in these processes electron hole pairs are generated when the catalyst material is subjected to specific stimuli and the electron hole pairs create superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which degrade the cationic dyes 6 7 electrical energy light and mechanical vibrations are the stimuli for electrocatalysis photocatalysis and piezo catalysis processes respectively in electrocatalysis specific electrodes and solutions must maintain ph level 4 8 while photocatalysis depends on the wavelength intensity and exposure of light 9 11 in sharp contrast the piezo catalysis process uses a mechanical vibration to produce electrons and holes on the surface of the piezo catalyst for the dye degradation process thereby making it a simple cost effective and highly efficient strategy for environmental remediation 12 13 various piezoelectric materials like pb zr ti o3 linbo3 znsno3 batio3 bifeo3 bi na tio3 and na k nbo3 have been studied for piezo catalytic activity 11 12 14 15 however the toxic nature of pb based materials low piezoelectricity and requirement of high voltage poling restrict the practical applicability and has led to the exploration of better alternative materials 16 among lead free piezoelectric materials batio3 bt has good piezoelectricity wide bandgap 3 19 ev and favorable band alignment 0 5 v vs reversible hydrogen electrode rhe but requires high energy stimulus 17 on the other hand bifeo3 bf has lower piezoelectricity narrow bandgap 2 2 ev and misaligned conduction band with a redox potential of 0 33 v vs rhe 17 therefore the combination of bf and bt may give reasonable piezoelectricity and narrower bandgap than bt and appropriate redox potential for electron hole pair generation in this aspect the solid solution 0 67bifeo3 0 33batio3 bf33bt has been reported with morphotropic phase boundary mpb and high piezoelectricity even without high voltage poling 250 pc n 1 at 25 c 18 and a bandgap of 2 6 ev for 0 7bifeo3 0 3batio3 17 usually the piezo catalysis process uses the piezoelectric materials in powder form making them difficult to retrieve from the water after degradation for reusability methods like centrifugation and vacuum filtration are generally used to separate the powder from treated water 19 so a better strategy is to use the piezoceramic powder as a mold of polymeric composite 4 in this aspect polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is a piezoelectric polymer that is widely studied in piezoelectric composites for piezo catalytic applications 20 22 pvdf shows maximum piezoelectricity in its electroactive β phase and the fraction of β phase can be improved by using polar solvent and proper filler 23 25 similarly bf33bt shows excellent piezoelectric property and has been reported for dye degradation in particulate form 0 7bifeo3 0 3batio3 17 though there are some reports on composite based reusable piezo catalysts the limitations such as the tedious synthesis process 17 low reaction kinetics 16 and the strenuous retrieving process 19 are still a matter of concern addressing the issues here a novel lead free pvdf bf33bt composite is reported sol gel route was followed to synthesize bf33bt and pvdf bf33bt composite was molded by solvent casting the piezo catalytic composite mold with 30 wt of bf33bt and 81 of the fraction of β phase was able to degrade mb rhb and cv solutions up to 98 91 and 88 respectively in 40 min with ultrasonic vibration scavengers were used to verify the vital role of hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 species in decomposing the dyes the easily retrievable mold was reused ten times with minimal loss in catalytic efficiency to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first report on using a facile non toxic pvdf bf33bt piezo catalytic mold for fast degradation of industrial effluents having stable piezo catalytic activity over multiple reuses the study provides an efficient and promising

piezoelectric potential of the fabricated molds under the ultrasonic bath 2 3 synthesis of 0 67 bifeo3 0 33 batio3 0 67 bifeo3 0 33 batio3 ceramic was synthesized via the sol gel route 2 0114 g of

4026 g were added to the same solution after the dissolution of all the materials the calculated amount of ethylene glycol 5 554 ml was added and stirred for 2 h the solution was dried overnight at 220 c and obtained xerogel was ground and calcined at 650 c for 6 h with a slow heating rate finally the obtained powder was appropriately ground for further use the schematic is represented in fig 1a 2 4 synthesis of pvdf bf33bt composite mold a mixture of 4 ml of dmf and 2 ml of acetone was taken with this mixture two different solutions were prepared one with 0 25 g of pvdf and another with bf33bt x wt the bf33bt solution was ultrasonicated for 1 5 h and the pvdf solution was stirred at 70 c until the complete dissolution of pellets then both the solutions were mixed and stirred at 70 c for 6 h the solution was cast into a petri dish and dried in a hot air oven at 100 c for 6 h to completely evaporate the solvent the concentration of the bf33bt was varied as x 10 wt pb10 20 wt pb20 30 wt pb30 and 40 wt pb40 the molding process is depicted in fig 1b 2 5 piezo catalytic experiment the as synthesized molds were washed multiple times with di water and dipped inside 50 ml of dye solutions with a concentration of 5 mg l 1 the beakers containing dye solutions with the molds were placed undisturbed under dark conditions for 1 h to establish adsorption desorption equilibrium ade then piezo catalysis experiment was performed by placing the setups in the bath sonicator unit to provide the mechanical vibration as shown in fig 1c ice bags were used to avoid thermal influence and the whole experiments were conducted under dark conditions the degradation of the dyes was investigated by measuring the concentration of the dyes after a regular interval of sonication using the uv visible spectrophotometer 2 6 scavenger test three different scavengers were added to the dye solutions separately to investigate the role of free radicals during the piezo catalysis process in this method 1 mmol l 1 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta benzoquinone bq and tert butyl alcohol tba were added to the dye solutions and piezo catalytic performance was studied 3 result and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural analysis morphology of the bf33bt powder and the composite mold was investigated by scanning electron microscope fig 2a shows the fe sem image of the as synthesized bf33bt nanoparticles from which the shape of the nanoparticles was found to be spherical the histogram of the diameter distribution is given in fig 2c the statistics confirm that the maximum number of particles has a diameter between 40 nm to 50 nm with an average diameter of 49 nm fig 2b shows the sem micrograph of the cross section pb30 composite mold it can be observed that the spherical bf33bt nanoparticles are held together by the pvdf matrix the magnified image of the nanoparticles tightly held by pvdf is given in the inset of fig 2b the phase study of bf33bt and the piezo catalytic composite mold was done by xrd fig 2d depicts the xrd pattern of bf33bt nanoparticles the peak patterns can be assigned to perovskite structures of bt and bf with c symmetry pm 3 m pdf 31 0174 and r symmetry r3m pdf 72 2112 respectively 18 the bifurcation of the peaks at around 2θ of 39o and 54 4o inset of fig 2d represents the coexistence of both rhombohedral and pseudo cubic phases at room temperature 26 27 debye scherrer equation was used to calculate the cell parameters of the bf 33bt crystal structures the equation relates the wavelength λ inter planner distance d and bragg s diffraction angle θ as n λ 2 d sin θ where n 1 28 considering the highest intensity peak at 2θ value of 31 65 and the cubic structure a b c the inter planner distance cell parameter and the crystalline size were calculated to be 2 824 å 3 993 å and 63 66 å3 respectively well matched with reported values 29 30 fig 2e represents the xrd patterns of pure pvdf mold and pb30 composite mold the xrd pattern of pvdf has one significant peak at 2θ of 20 4o which corresponds to the electroactive β phase and the shoulder peak at 18 5o represents the α phase 31 the characteristic peaks of both β phase of pvdf and bf33bt can be observed in the xrd pattern of the pb30 composite mold the intensity of the β phase peak is lesser than the ceramic peaks due to the semi crystalline nature of pvdf further room temperature raman spectroscopy was studied to investigate the existence of β phase of pvdf in the composite molds with different concentrations of bf33bt raman spectra of the composite molds are shown in fig 2f the peaks corresponding to bf33bt are marked with and the β phase peak of pvdf is marked with β the broad peaks at around 260 cm 1 and 515 cm 1 correspond to a1 to1 and a1 to4 vibration modes of batio3 whereas the sharp peak at the raman shift of 80 cm 1 corresponds to the dominant a site vibration of bifeo3 32 33 the small and sharp peaks at 790 cm 1 and 836 cm 1 correspond to α phase and β phase respectively according to symmetric cf2 stretching characteristics 31 34 in all the composite spectra the peak at 836 cm 1 represents a prominent β phase of pvdf in the composite molds the intensity of the pvdf peaks decreases compared to those of bf33bt when the concentration of bf33bt is increased this is attributed to the higher raman sensitive bonds of the ceramic compared to vibrations of cf and ch bonds of pvdf though raman spectra can identify β phase ftir spectra were used to investigate the effect of bf33bt concentration on the β phase of pvdf in the composite molds fig 2g represents the ftir spectra of pvdf bf33bt composite molds within the measured range 700 cm 1 to 1400 cm 1 only pvdf peaks are prominent the peaks at around 839 cm 1 and 1274 cm 1 correspond to the electroactive β phase whereas at 762 cm 1 represents α phase of pvdf 31 the fraction of β phase fβ in pvdf is estimated using eq 1 1 f β i 840 1 262 i 763 i 840 100 i 840 and i 763 are the absorbance intensities of the peaks at wavenumber 839 cm 1 and 762 cm 1 respectively 35 f β of pvdf pb10 pb20 pb30 and pb40 was found to be 61 69 76 81 and 79 respectively formation of β phase of pvdf in pristine pvdf is due to the polar solvent dmf 23 whereas the improvement in fraction of β phase in pvdf bf33bt may be due to the rotation of ch2 bond of pvdf as a result of hydrogen bond formation in between oxygen atoms of bf33bt and hydrogen atoms of pvdf 36 the decrement of the fraction of β phase of pb40 may be attributed to the aggregation of bf33bt nanoparticles in the pvdf matrix 37 3 2 piezo catalytic activity the concentration of bf33bt in the pvdf matrix was first optimized based on the piezo catalytic performance of the composites pvdf pb10 pb20 pb30 pb40 using methylene blue mb dye as explained in section 2 5 the order of the reaction kinetics was investigated the zero order kinetics reaction does not depend on the reactant concentration 38 39 for the same the number of the piezo catalytic mold was doubled both are pb30 and of the same dimension and weight as a result the total degradation time for the methylene blue was reduced to half from 40 min to 20 min 39 hence the reaction is not of zero order and the proportionality of the rate with the reactant suggests the reaction to be first order 4 for the testing of the adaptation for the second order reaction kinetics the curves square of the relative concentration vs time do not fit perfectly with the shape of the second order reaction 40 the degradation of the dye can be observed by decoloration of the solution and measured in terms of relative concentration c c 0 c concentration after a particular duration c 0 initial concentration fig 3a represents the variation of relative concentration with respect to the duration of ultrasonication after ade for each mold furthermore the natural logarithm of relative concentration exhibits a pseudo first order kinetic model in terms of the rate constant of the degradation reaction k and time of ultrasonication t which is given in eq 2 4 20 21 2 ln c c 0 kt fig s1 of supplementary information si represents the linear fittings of ln c 0 c versus t curves for each mold to find out the rate constant of the degradation reaction or reaction constant k as the slope 20 the reaction rate constant for pvdf pb10 pb20 pb30 and pb40 was found to be 0 00681 min 1 0 0261 min 1 0 0498 min 1 0 0927 min 1and 0 0653 min 1 with fitting accuracy of more than 95 fig s2 it can be observed that with an increment of bf33bt concentration in the piezo catalytic mold the degradation reaction rate increases up to 30 wt this proves that piezo catalytic performance depends on the piezoelectric property of the catalyst and here in this case the fraction of β phase of pvdf 21 the lower reaction rate constant of pb40 than pb30 is due to the lesser fraction of β phase of pvdf as estimated from ftir spectra for better understanding fig s3 represents the percentage degradation d 1 relative concentration 100 of mb with each mold at different intervals of ultrasonication in 40 min of ultrasonication pvdf pb10 pb20 pb30 and pb40 can achieve degradation up to 23 64 86 98 and 93 respectively this indicates that the piezoceramic bf33bt acts as a nucleating agent to enhance the piezo catalytic property of pvdf by improving the fraction of the β phase 36 further to verify the optimized concentration of bf33bt in the pvdf matrix the piezoelectric potential was measured for each composite mold under the ultrasonic bath as explained in 41 the measured piezoelectric potential of the molds with different bf33bt concentrations is given in fig s4 and it is clear that pb30 shows the maximum piezoelectric potential well supported by our previous work 27 hence the optimized pb30 composite mold was used for further degradation studies further rhb and cv were degraded using pb30 and the image of the dye solutions at different intervals of the process is depicted in fig 3b degradation of the dye due to piezo catalysis can be easily observed from the decoloration of the solutions uv visible absorbance spectra of mb rhb and cv during degradation using pb30 in different time intervals are shown in fig 3c d and e respectively mb rhb and cv have the characteristic absorption peaks at a wavelength of 660 nm 550 nm and 590 nm respectively after 40 min of ultrasonication with pb30 piezo catalyst the relative concentration was in the order of cv rhb mb fig 3f to compare the degradation reaction kinetics for each dye reaction rate constants were estimated by linear fitting of ln c 0 c curves with respect to time as shown in fig 3g the reaction rate constant k for each dye was 0 0927 min 1 0 0614 min 1 and 0 0557 min 1 with an r 2 value of more than 0 97 as depicted in fig 3h this indicates that for the same piezo catalyst pb30 the degradation rate of the dyes is in the order of mb rhb cv for this very reason with 40 min of ultrasonication with pb30 mb rhb and cv were degraded up to 98 91 and 88 respectively fig 3i this unequal degradation of each dye is attributed to the respective degradation process complexities explained elsewhere 42 44 the degradation is caused by reactive oxygen species oh and o2 produced by free electrons and holes segregated by the piezo potential of the mold during ultrasonic vibration 4 12 to investigate the role of these free radicals in the degradation process the scavenger test was performed with some reaction quenching agents scavengers 3 3 piezo catalysis with scavengers edta tba and bq are the quenchers of holes h hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 reactive species respectively 4 20 45 fig 4a shows the relative concentration of rhb dye solution in the presence of these scavengers during the degradation process using pb30 piezo catalytic mold due to the addition of scavengers the degradation reaction was somewhat inhibited the reactions still exhibit linearity in the presence of scavengers but possess lesser slopes as shown in fig 4b the reaction rate constant was found to be 0 0614 min 1 0 0215 min 1 0 01 min 1and 0 0079 min 1 for degradation of rhb without scavenger with edta tba and bq respectively so reaction kinetics is reduced by 65 83 and 87 by edta tba and bq respectively fig 4c depicts the percentage degradation of rhb dye solution in the presence of different scavengers it is clear that after 40 min of ultrasonication rhb was degraded by 91 56 36 and 28 in the presence of no scavenger edta tba and bq respectively thus it is confirmed that the piezo catalyst causes the formation of hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 species when subjected to ultrasonic vibration all three dyes were studied for the scavenger test however because the rate constant of the rhb is nearly equivalent to the average of all three dyes the performance of the rhb has been reported 3 4 mechanism of piezo catalytic degradation of dyes based on the physics of piezoelectric energy conversion a possible mechanism for the process of piezo catalysis is given in fig 5 both pvdf and bf33bt have spontaneous polarization due to non centrosymmetric atomic arrangement in the unit cell but they remain electrically neutral until subjected to some external deformation force when an external force is applied an electromotive force is generated on the opposite surfaces of the composite mold if an external circuit connects both the surfaces of the mold it causes a current in the circuit rather than an accumulation of the electrons and holes at the material s surface in the piezo catalysis process the mold is submerged in the dye solution and subjected to ultrasonic vibration electrons and holes are accumulated at the surface of the piezo catalytic mold during ultrasonic vibration 11 as no external circuit connects the mold s opposite surfaces the charged particles split the adsorbed water molecule to form h and oh ions as shown in fig 5a 17 during the alteration of the charged particles in the piezo catalytic mold from opposite surfaces some of the electrons and holes react with adsorbed o2 and oh to form superoxide o2 and hydroxyl oh ions as depicted in fig 5 b 12 17 20 46 the reaction of the electrons and holes may be facilitated by the bending of the conduction band cb and valence band vb of the bf33bt respectively electrons from the cb react with o2 to form o2 0 33 v vs normal hydrogen electrode or nhe and holes from vb react with oh to form oh 1 9 v vs nhe 17 47 a detailed explanation of energy band gap estimation and band bending mechanism of bf33bt is given in section s2 and fig s5 of si the reactive oxygen species ros o2 and oh react with complex dye molecules to break them into non toxic components such as h2o co2 nh4 no3 in multiple steps fig 5c 4 the generation of reactive species and their role in redox reactions in the piezo catalytic process are given in reactions 1 to 5 17 48 49 1 pvdf bf 3 3bt mold vibration pvdf bf 3 3bt mold e h 2 h 2 o e oh 3 o 2 e o 2 4 oh h oh 5 o 2 oh dye degradation products of the dyes the breakdown of the dye molecules was identified from the decolorization of the solution and the relative concentration of the dye during the degradation process was measured considering the absorbance spectra of the uv vis spectrum the contribution of the holes and the reactive oxygen species were verified using scavengers which inhibit the degradation process by trapping the reactive species the effect of the ph of the dye solution on the piezo catalysis was studied and the catalytic performance is the highest in the near neutral ph range 6 8 and is shown in fig s6 a similar result has also been reported in the literature 50 51 with the addition of bf33bt nanoparticles to the pvdf matrix the piezoelectric β phase improves and being a piezoelectric ceramic bf33bt also contributes to the piezo catalysis process thus the combined effect of pvdf and bf33bt leads to a higher percentage of degradation of the dyes than pristine pvdf during ultrasonic vibration the resultant polarization induced in the pvdf bf33bt composite is higher compared to pristine pvdf mold and this is schematically depicted in fig 5d and e 3 5 reusability the optimum condition for removing the piezo catalytic mold from the dye solution is the 100 degradation of the dye or full decoloration for methylene blue rhodamine b and crystal violet the mold removal time was found to be 47 min 99 9 60 min 99 and 65 min 99 3 respectively for the above measurement and the reusability test pb30 mold was used the mold was washed with di water and dried at 50 c overnight after every use to investigate the reusability of the mold the relative concentration of the mb solution with respect to time for each reuse is shown in fig 6a fig 6b represents the percentage degradation of mb solution by pb30 in 40 min the percentage degradation of mb for 1st use 4th 7th and 10th reuse of pb30 in 40 min was 98 95 91 and 85 respectively this decrement in the efficiency of the mold for dye degradation is due to the loss of adsorption capability of the mold with the number of recycling the adsorption capability of the mold can be realized from the relative concentration of dye solution after ade without ultrasonication during the 1st use due to the submerged mold 2 4 of the dye is degraded after ade but the same is reduced to 1 5 during the 9th reuse this is depicted in fig 6c in terms of the relative concentration of mb solution after ade though there is a slight reduction in the efficiency of the piezo catalytic mold after several recycles it makes the retrieval process of piezo catalyst easier than earlier reported piezo catalytic semiconductor materials retrieved from the dye solution after centrifugation or filtration process 19 the stability of the piezo catalytic mold was investigated by analyzing the change in chemical composition and catalytic performance after multiple reuses 52 53 the xrd patterns and the ftir spectra of the mold before use and after the 10th reuse are compared in fig 6 d and e respectively no spectacular change is observed in either xrd or ftir patterns after the 10th reuse indicating the chemical stability of the piezo catalyst even after multiple reuses the root cause of the water molecule splitting is the piezoelectric emf due to the mechanical vibration no leaching of the metal ions from the catalyst is involved in the process of formation of the hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 species as no chemical process is involved in emf generation 16 20 this is also evidenced by the xrd and ftir spectra shown in fig 6 d and e table 1 gives an overview of comparing similar types of reports with pvdf bf33bt composite mold the retrievable composite piezo catalysts reported are in different forms such as porous foam 50 54 film 20 and nanofibers 21 which require sophisticated instruments like electrospinning unlike the facile pvdf bf33bt mold synthesis further similar reports have shown a degradation time of 120 min or higher which is three times more than the degradation time of this work 20 54 the works in which the direct use of the piezoelectric ceramic powders have been reported suffer from non reusability 55 56 some reports claimed the retrievability of the piezo catalytic powder from the solution however those are difficult and time consuming processes such as centrifugation filtration 17 19 on the contrary the piezo catalytic composite mold demonstrated in this work is free standing can be retrieved easily and reutilized with negligible loss of efficiency up to 10 times the synthesis process of the pvdf bf33bt composite mold is simple and does not require any sophisticated instrumentation this offers a potential approach for the fast degradation of complex dye molecules in wastewater 4 conclusion this work explored the synthesis of pvdf bf33bt composite piezo catalytic mold and its utilization to degrade complex dye molecules the sol gel route synthesized bf33bt nanoparticles and pvdf bf33bt composite molds with different bf33bt concentrations were prepared using the solvent casting method the study of ftir spectra reveals the enhancement of piezoelectric β phase of pvdf due to bf33bt inclusion up to 30 wt pb30 composite mold was used to degrade mb rhb and cv dyes by ultrasonic vibration up to 98 91 and 88 respectively in 40 min the concept proposes a non toxic piezo catalyst that can be easily retrieved and reused multiple times the fast performing pvdf bf33bt composite is better than prior reports thus the free standing retrievable pvdf bf33bt composite can be used for efficient piezo catalytic remediation of

12973,cassava is industrially processed to produce several food items e g flour and starch but the processing methods generate liquid residues that can be highly polluting this study seeks to conduct a literature review on the characteristics of cassava processing wastewaters cpww generated in brazil which is one of the world s leading producers of cassava this was done to suggest more adequate ways for treating the effluent and to obtain predictive models that can aid professionals in characterizing this effluent the results show that cpww contain high concentrations of organic matter besides nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous solids and cyanide based on its characteristics cpww has been evaluated as an alternative feedstock for obtaining biofuels fertilizers pesticides etc in addition the results show that flour production results in effluents with higher concentrations of pollutants than starch production this is because starch production uses more water per ton of processed cassava the average bod5 cod ratios for flour production 0 49 and for starch extraction effluents 0 47 show that they are highly biodegradable furthermore after analyzing the relationship between organic matter and nutrient concentrations c n p the results indicate that anaerobic biological processes are more suitable for treating this waste to corroborate this stabilization ponds covered or not have been the most used treatments in brazil there was a significant linear correlation between cod and bod5 r2 0 8 suggesting that bod5 can be estimated from cod in cpww generated through different factories graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords manipueira wastewater treatment biodegradability cod bod anaerobic digestion 1 introduction cassava manihot esculenta crantz also known as manioc or yucca is a perennial woody shrub from the euphorbiaceous family of plants 1 2 it is a tuberous root that can be cultivated in dry and nutrient poor soils and that does not require regular maintenance to grow well 1 3 cassava is usually planted in subtropical and tropical regions 3 brazil is one of the world s largest producers of cassava having produced 18 9 million tons in 2019 4 the root of the plant has the greatest commercial value being mainly composed of starch 80 on a dry basis 5 it is an excellent source of energy and a large portion of the cassava produced worldwide is marketed for human or animal consumption over 90 in addition to the application in textile and pulp and paper industries 3 flour and starch are the two main cassava derived foods 2 3 fig 1 shows the steps involved in producing cassava flour and starch regardless of the product several residues are generated like fibers peel bagasse and wastewaters cassava is crushed and then pressed to separate the solid material and the liquid residue the latter is commonly called manipueira the solids are then roasted to produce the flour to obtain starch the crushed cassava mass is washed with water to extract the starch which is then passed on to the concentration steps the liquid effluent generated in the starch extraction process is less concentrated than the manipueira 3 6 7 the amount of effluent often varies according to industrial type for example approximately 280 l of manipueira are generated from one ton of cassava at a flour producing plant in paraíba state 6 another flour producing plant in alagoas state generates about 400 l manipueira ton 1 8 volumes of starch extraction effluent generated per ton of processed cassava are greater 6100 l because water is added to extract starch 7 cassava processing effluents from industries may also contain wastewater coming from the initial steps of washing the root 6 9 in starch extraction industries most of the water used in the washing step is generated during the starch separation process 7 it is common to use the term cassava processing wastewater cpww when referring to effluents generated from various cassava processing methods 3 cpww is comprised mostly of water and a high level of organic matter like starch and soluble carbohydrates besides mineral salts 3 7 this effluent has a light yellow milky appearance 6 similar to other liquid wastes cpww must first be treated to comply with existing environmental legislation although there are reports in literature stating that raw effluent has been improperly disposed of thereby polluting surface water and groundwater sources 6 7 one common way of disposing of effluent is into the soil without conducting any type of treatment this can contaminate groundwater and negatively affect local vegetation 10 if discharged into water bodies the high concentration of organic matter in cpww can promote bacterial growth consume available oxygen and consequently kill fish and other aerobic life forms the color and turbidity of cpww blocks sunlight hindering photosynthesis and consequently dissolved oxygen levels 3 11 furthermore cpww can aggravate eutrophication processes due to its nutrient content n and p 12 in brazil starch extraction industries store effluent in stabilization ponds covered or not which are effective in removing above 90 of organic matter 9 13 the problem with the treatment through ponds is that they require large areas of land can emit an unpleasant odor and are poorly efficient in removing nutrients 14 cpww can be used to feed animals without having to treat it although cyanide must first be removed through spontaneous volatilization during a few days 15 16 promising results have been reported for fertigation processes with manipueira 17 20 although excessive amounts of effluent can negatively imbalance nutrient and salt concentrations and decrease the ph of the soil 21 manipueira is also commonly used to produce tucupi in the northern region of brazil which is a condiment prepared by fermenting the effluent for 72 h then cooking it for 10 min 22 manipueira has shown promise as a nematicide 23 insecticide 24 and fungicide 25 due to the cyanogenic glycosides and free cyanide contained in it another way of using cpww that is still being studied is using it as a feedstock to generate various biotechnological products like organic acids biosurfactants and especially biofuels 26 29 fig 2 shows some of the ways that cpww has been either practically applied or studied on a laboratory scale several parameters for characterizing effluents have been established by legislation so that effluents can be discharged into water bodies these parameters may be physical chemical or biological 30 they must also be applied to cpww since it is not usually reused the main parameter for the concentration of organic matter is the biochemical oxygen demand bod this parameter is present in all existing environmental legislations in brazil 31 however it only represents the concentration of biodegradable organic matter the bod determination involves an incubation period with bacteria taking at least 5 days bod5 under aerobic conditions another more practical parameter is the chemical oxygen demand cod which represents the concentration of biodegradable and non biodegradable organic matter within 3 h 32 predictive models can estimate bod5 using cod unlike bod5 cod is more practical and faster to obtain this can make monitoring and decision making more practical for operational corrections at treatment plants for any given liquid waste 33 some review articles about cpww have been recently published they have addressed general aspects and use of cpww as a feedstock in biorefinery 3 7 12 34 cpww treatment through anaerobic digestion 7 35 and its use as a pesticide 36 or fertilizer in agriculture 21 37 as a novelty the present review focuses on the main characteristics of cpww generated in brazil several characterization parameters were compared with the maximum allowable concentrations according to federal and state legislations regarding the disposal of effluents into water bodies relationships among the main parameters bod5 cod bod5 n p cod n p were evaluated to point out more adequate processes for treating this effluent furthermore an attempt to linearly correlate some parameters was made to find predictive models that make characterizing and monitoring cpww easier in treatment plants 2 analysis of the physicochemical characteristics of cpww table s1 shows the physicochemical characteristics of real effluents as reported in the literature the data were published between 2011 and 2020 in scientific articles theses dissertations and some papers from congresses were also consulted and google scholar scopus and the web of science were used to conduct the literature review different expressions and keywords were used like cassava processing wastewater manipueira cod bod cassava starch extraction effluent according to the sources surveyed samples of manipueira were collected from flour houses or industries and starch effluents were taken from starch factories some samples were acquired from industries that did not specify their products obtained from cassava effluent data that had been obtained in laboratory experiments were disregarded some studies did not specify whether they had collected effluents at specific processing stages or whether the effluent samples were coming from the entire industrial process the expression cassava processing wastewater cpww was used in this study to refer to all effluents from the literature review cassava processing was taken into account when classifying data in tables some authors referred to the same effluent in separate publications and care was taken so that no data was repeated when a study characterized more than one sample of effluent the data were reported separately regardless of whether the samples were obtained from the same cassava processing plant or not if the source reported only average values from several effluent samples at the same industry this information was used except for the data on ph which is a parameter represented in a logarithmic scale and so its average cannot be calculated by contrast if studies reported maximum and minimum ph values these data were considered here most manipueira samples were collected from flour producers in cities in the northeast of brazil while starch extraction effluents were collected from são paulo and paraná states effluents come from different states and regions all over brazil as shown in fig 3 most studies reported ph which is a practical measuring parameter fundamental for adopting both physicochemical and biological treatment processes and for disposing of treated effluents in water bodies 30 31 brazilian 161 legislation from the national environmental council conama establishes a ph range from 5 to 9 for discharging effluents into water bodies 38 more than half of the cpww samples had ph values below 5 while none exceeded 9 ph values generally below 7 are common since there are many organic acids generally reported as volatile acids va alkalinity is another parameter that is often measured in studies alkalinity refers to the number of ions in a solution that neutralizes hydrogen ions bicarbonates carbonates and hydroxides result in wastewater alkalinity 32 39 conama does not set any limits both for acids and alkalinity although these parameters are relevant for treating effluents through anaerobic biological processes 40 41 the concentration of organic matter in effluents was reported to be very high especially for flour production effluents organic matter in these effluents was approximately 150 times more concentrated than sewage in brazil in terms of bod5 which on average is 300 mg l 1 39 bod5 is an indicator of the concentration of biodegradable organic matter this parameter was reported in less than 30 of all samples conama requires that a minimum of 60 bod5 be removed for the effluent to be released into water bodies this value can be reduced if a self depuration study proves compliance with the requirements of the water body which the effluent will be released 38 state environmental agencies require that a minimum of 30 to 95 bod5 be removed or allow for a maximum concentration of 30 to 180 mg l 1 depending on the state 31 cod was reported in almost all consulted studies federal legislation does not set maximum concentrations much less a minimum cod removal requirement for releasing effluents into water bodies 38 by contrast state agencies require maximum cod concentrations of 60 to 600 mg l 1 or a minimum cod removal of 60 to 90 depending on the state 31 it was verified that the concentration of organic matter in terms of both bod5 and cod was well above the established legislative limits meaning that this effluent must be treated before it can be discharged into water bodies or disposed of in the soil in function of the consulted data it was observed that a flour production effluent had its bod5 level approximately 250 times greater than the limit established in the corresponding state legislation while a starch production effluent had cod level 100 times higher than the legislative limit total organic carbon toc can also be used to determine organic matter concentration 30 toc was evaluated by relatively few studies unlike bod5 and cod total sugar or total carbohydrate content was also reported by some studies there are no environmental agencies that limit carbohydrate concentration however these are probably responsible for the high concentrations of organic matter in these effluents turbidity measures the degree to which light can pass through a solution although turbidity is not legislated for effluent discharge it is an important parameter since suspended solids can interfere with the metabolisms of photosynthetic organisms 39 although a few studies have reported turbidity data cpww is a turbid effluent the color parameter was only reported by santos 42 for starch extraction effluents who gave values ranging from 6128 to 11 675 mg ptco l 1 phosphorus was evaluated in about half of all consulted studies and concentrations varied greatly conama resolution 430 states that the environmental agency may define specific standards for phosphorus in effluents that are released into water bodies that are prone to cyanobacterial blooms or stretches that have public supply catchments conama stipulates that the maximum value for the ammoniacal nitrogen parameter is 20 mg l 1 38 one study reported cpww with 3200 mg nh4 l 1 i e 160 times greater than the acceptable level six of nine effluents showed values below the permitted level total nitrogen tn content is not legislated although high concentrations have been reported mainly for manipueira the highest reported value was 5100 mg n l 1 some studies mistakenly reported total nitrogen measurements as they were measuring the concentration of total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn which consists of ammoniacal and organic n forms excluding other inorganic forms like nitrite and nitrate 30 cyanide is a highly toxic compound much more than ammonia and any effluent that will be discharged must have total cyanide levels below 1 0 mg l 1 and free cyanide levels below 0 2 mg l 1 38 virtually all studies that evaluated free or total cyanide found concentrations above the allowable limits cyanide is formed via the hydrolysis of cyanogenic glycosides linamarin and lotaustralin acting as a natural defense for cassava this high concentration of cyanide is important for using this effluent as a pesticide 36 but for animal food or discharge into water bodies it is problematic only settleable suspended solids sss are addressed in resolution 430 from conama 38 sss in effluents settle out within 1 h in an imhoff cone 30 the concentration of sss must be up to 1 ml l 1 if effluents are to be released into circulating water bodies no sss should be present if effluents are to be discharged into lakes and lagoons where circulation speeds are practically nonexistent 38 this parameter was analyzed in only 6 samples and all reported concentrations were above the maximum allowable level except for the sss as reported in table s1 the series for cpww solids can be found in table s2 they are classified into total solids ts total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds total volatile solids tvs or total fixed solids tfs ts refer to all the components in the sample that remain after evaporation 30 ts concentrations varied significantly among the samples when comparing effluents of different types one can see that samples from flour production have higher concentrations of solids than from starch production tfs refers to the dry inorganic matter present in wastewater while the tvs refer to the concentration of dry organic matter on the other hand tss are retained after filtration opposed to tds that remain in solution 39 tds were reported in a few cases but only for starch extraction effluents making it difficult to analyze the samples although the concentration of solids was generally higher for manipueira other relevant aspects were verified using the data in the table the tds ts ratio was calculated for some starch extraction effluent samples all ratios were above 0 87 showing that the fraction of dissolved solids is much greater than suspended solids regarding the tvs ts ratio all calculated values were much higher than the minimum value of 0 53 showing that most solids are organic compounds furthermore the average tvs ts ratio calculated for the two effluent types was equal to 0 8 tvs must mainly refer to carbohydrates in cpww the higher fraction of organic compounds indicates that this effluent can serve as an energy source in animal feed or as a substrate for producing organic acids and fuels via biotechnological routes 3 34 inorganic components are also important regardless of the way cpww is used since they are essentially macronutrients and micronutrients 43 as shown in table s3 cpww contains different metal cations electrical conductivity is linked to the total concentration of anions and cations mobility valence and relative concentrations federal legislation does not mention electrical conductivity but establishes maximum concentrations of various metals for discharging treated effluents into water bodies also shown in table s3 only one effluent sample had concentrations above the allowable level for zinc the values were above the allowable limits for less than half of the samples where iron and manganese were measured cadmium and nickel were rarely measured and concentrations were below the maximum allowable limits and only two samples had cu concentrations above the allowable limit flour production effluents were more concentrated than starch extraction effluents for most of these components except for fe mn and s unlike cations there were very few anions reported in the studies chloride ranged from 12 3 to 795 mg l 1 and it was analyzed in six samples sulfate was measured by four sources ranging from 18 04 to 2205 mg l 1 nitrate was analyzed in three studies and the reported values were very different from each other 4 mg l 1 28 19 mg l 1 18 and 407 mg l 1 44 nitrite was only measured by andrade 44 who reported 0 58 mg l 1 given these characteristics and the presence of n and p some studies have shown that flour production effluents can be used as fertilizers if applied in adequate amounts 20 45 46 the composition of this effluent complies with normative no 39 that defines the parameters for mineral fertilizers used in agriculture 47 this effluent contains primary macronutrients for fertilizers i e nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk furthermore some secondary macronutrients like calcium magnesium and sulfur and micronutrients like chlorine copper iron manganese nickel and zinc were also present however it is important to emphasize that higher effluent levels can harm plant development because of the high concentration of some nutrients like potassium 20 45 3 relationship between the analyzed parameters for cpww according to effluent characteristics it is possible to direct what treatments may be appropriate to allow its discharge in nature or reuse this takes the type degree of treatment and compliance with legislation into account 32 the bod5 cod ratio also known as the biodegradability index indicates the biodegradable fraction of organic matter in effluents when this ratio is 0 4 at least 40 of the organic matter is biodegradable and the effluent can be treated biologically by contrast a ratio 0 15 shows that there is a very low fraction of biodegradable organic matter and the effluent can be better treated using physicochemical processes ratios between 0 15 and 0 4 mean that effluent can be treated either biologically and or using physicochemical processes and other characteristics need to be evaluated 39 of all the reviewed studies here 21 cpww samples had both parameters quantified 13 had a bod5 cod ratio 0 4 table 1 showing that biological treatments are preferred due to their low cost and high efficiency given the favorable climatic conditions in brazil six samples had mid ranged ratios while only two had ratios 0 15 when calculating the average ratios for effluents from flour production and starch extraction the values obtained were 0 49 and 0 47 respectively this suggests that biological processes are best suited for treating these effluents n and p are nutrients present in many effluents including cpww this effluent can be used as a culture media for microalgae which will treat it 77 78 and algae biomass that accumulates can serve as raw material for generating value added products 12 62 78 79 evaluating these nutrients is important since maintaining microorganisms in biological treatments depends on the minimal amounts of n and p in addition to removing organic matter solids and cyanide nutrient removal is also necessary to avoid eutrophication problems in receiving water bodies 39 if the raw effluent has a low concentration of nutrients relative to the organic matter content supplementation is necessary if the effluent is to be biologically treated this is commonly applied to effluents coming from textile 80 82 and pulp and paper industries 83 85 the relationship between organic matter and nutrients can indicate the best suited biological treatment i e aerobic or anaerobic treatment and can indicate whether supplementation is needed or not if the bod5 n p proportion is around 100 5 1 aerobic processes are recommended sant anna jr 43 suggests a cod n p proportion of 250 5 1 for anaerobically treating effluents recently gao et al 86 used a cod n p proportion of 250 6 5 1 to anaerobically treat effluent from a thermomechanical pulping industry these proportions could not be calculated for all the samples consulted in this review since not all presented results for these parameters for some studies only one proportion was calculated here and in some cases using only one nutrient the results show that most samples had the minimum required nutrient concentrations relative to organic matter concentrations both for aerobic and anaerobic processes thus supplementation can be disregarded for biologically treating cpww even for tkn some samples still contained minimal n concentrations while others did not on the other hand concentrations well above the minimum levels are also concerning since the biological treatment applied may not properly remove nutrients 39 the type of biological treatment chosen either aerobic or anaerobic depends on efficiency energy costs and waste by product generation aerobic processes are more effective and generally comply with current legislation however they require a lot of energy due to the artificial aeration procedure needed to oxidize the organic matter they also generate a lot of sludge which must be treated and disposed of properly despite anaerobic processes being less efficient in removing organic matter they require less work and do not require aeration they do not generate much sludge besides it is already stabilized 39 43 in addition digestate treated effluent can be also used as a fertilizer 7 35 biogas is one by product from treatment that can be used as an energy source or must be burned since it is rich in methane a more potent greenhouse gas than co2 35 87 burning biogas generates thermal energy that is even used by some starch producers in brazil 88 however biogas used as an alternative energy source depends on the methane concentration implying that it may need to first be purified to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide 87 89 the degree of purity of biogas will determine its applicability e g as a heating source as a combined heat and energy generation source as vehicle fuel 90 for steam production or to serve as a base feedstock in industrial processes 91 regarding anaerobic treatments the alkalinity is an important parameter that must be checked since small reductions in ph due to organic acids generated in the fermentative stage result in alkali consumption reducing the buffering capacity of this medium 44 49 66 ph tends to be reduced with accumulated organic acids compromising acetotrophic microorganisms and subsequently methanogenic microorganisms sant anna jr 43 mentions that some authors recommend monitoring the ratio between volatile acids and total alkalinity va ta in the range of 0 06 to 0 2 during anaerobic biological treatments of the few studies on cpwws that it was possible to calculate the va at ratio the obtained values were above 0 2 this can compromise anaerobic treatments and biogas production in turn brazilian researchers often increase cpww alkalinity to treat it anaerobically on a laboratory scale this is done via supplementation with inputs like sodium bicarbonate 49 65 sodium hydroxide 57 or low cost alkalizing materials 44 67 table 2 shows the ranges averages and standard deviations of some cpww characteristics the ranges are wide for both flour production and starch extraction effluents meaning that composition is quite varied probably due to the origin of the feedstock and mainly because cassava processing is specific for each industry 12 standard deviation values greater than the average for some parameters also indicate the variability of the reported data from the literature review the cod and bod5 averages for flour production effluents are approximately 3 to 5 times higher than starch extraction effluents ph is generally lower for flour production effluents 4 conventional treatments for effluents from cassava processing in brazil some studies mentioned the conventional treatment systems where cpww was collected for research these treatments are shown in table 3 most industries treat this effluent in stabilization ponds this is a simple low cost method although does require large areas with one or more ponds being used in series 14 39 in the first treatment pond anaerobiosis predominates due to the concentration of biodegradable organic matter being high and natural aeration does not provide enough o2 if it is not covered the generated biogas is emitted directly into the atmosphere in the subsequent treatment ponds containing lower organic matter concentrations both aerobic and anaerobic degradation mechanisms are at work 32 some sources did not mention the number of ponds used the digestate is discharged into the soil direct infiltration and this can be appropriate for protecting water bodies and providing nutrients to vegetation 35 69 it is important to highlight that some starch producers use ponds with coverings or so called biodigesters allowing them to recover biogas minimizing emissions into the atmosphere certain starch companies tend to burn the gas to generate heat in boilers instead of relying exclusively on firewood 88 characterizing treated effluents is relevant when verifying the efficiency of conventional treatments or when verifying whether effluents comply with legislation for discharging them into water bodies and to understand effluent characteristics for eventually disposing of this waste into soil data for treated cpww are rarely reported leite et al 9 analyzed covered pond treated wastewater from three different starch extraction industries all data for bod5 cyanide ph and temperature met federal legislation standards only one industry did not meet the maximum sss concentration level data not shown all showed ammonia concentration levels 60 mg l 1 well above the allowable limit it is well known that anaerobic processes are not effective in removing nitrogen and that they require an aerobic additional step 92 94 interestingly fleck et al 58 evaluated an aerated batch bioreactor for treating an anaerobically pretreated starch extraction effluent under optimized conditions the authors found that almost all ammonia had been removed after 24 h and the highest nitrate conversion about 25 occurred after 40 h as ponds have limitations 14 brazilian researchers have reported predominately on treating raw cpww through other anaerobic biological processes researches evaluating different anaerobic reactors and operation mode have been conducted in bench scale to improve the treatment and or optimize gaseous biofuels production e g h2 ch4 51 53 72 95 in addition the cpww derived digestate has been evaluated as a fertilizer 95 98 these eco friendly aspects are within the concept of circular economy 7 5 obtaining predictive models based on cpww characteristics it takes at least five days to analyze an effluent sample to measure its bod5 while the cod measurements can be obtained in up to 3 h 32 to facilitate cpww characterization and to monitor the treatment processes an attempt was made to find a linear correlation for estimating bod5 from the cod according to silva and mendonça 33 this correlation reduces operational costs because the cod is a cheaper laboratory analysis and helps make decisions regarding operational correction measures it also allows planners to define project parameters a linear correlation coefficient is significant if it is equal to or greater than 0 8 if it is between 0 5 and 0 8 it is moderate a linear correlation coefficient is weak for values lower than this 99 recent studies have sought out correlations among these and other physicochemical parameters for wastewaters to estimate relevant parameters by using less complex inputs for example liang et al 100 verified significant linear correlations between cod and toxicity for effluents from four textile industries in china obtaining r2 values greater than 0 82 ramos et al 80 obtained moderate coefficients between cod and bod5 values for effluents coming from brazilian textile companies 0 6737 and textile laundries 0 6055 linear correlations to estimate bod5 from cod with r2 values above 0 8 have been obtained for sewage systems in brazil 33 101 in turn dubber and gray 102 obtained linear correlations above 0 9 for cod bod5 toc bod5 and cod toc for domestic and municipal wastewaters collected in treatment plants in ireland table 4 shows different attempts to linearly correlate organic matter concentration data and other physicochemical parameters for cpww from the data presented in table s1 table 4 also contains the amount of data used for obtaining each correlation the data amount was also used to indicate whether the equations are reliable the most significant correlation was observed for cod tss fig s1 a however because one datum is out of line with the other data the linear correlation tended to be forced if the outlier is deleted the correlation coefficient drops to 0 4458 fig s1 b and the correlation is therefore weak on the other hand a strong correlation above 0 8 was found for cod bod5 fig 4 with varying data thus ensuring greater correlation reliability as the correlation was calculated from data from different industries the present work suggests the use of this equation for any cassava processing plants in brazil however it should be mentioned that if accuracy in bod5 is required the conventional analysis of this parameter must be performed 33 a significant correlation was also observed for bod5 tds but the number of samples containing both reported parameters was very low and the result is therefore unreliable bod5 still showed moderate correlations with ts and tfs and cod showed moderate correlations with turbidity ts tvs and tfs 6 conclusions based on the data from the literature review it is clear that cassava processing wastewater cpww needs to be treated before it is disposed of in nature comparing cpww characteristics with brazilian environmental legislations cpww was observed to contain high concentrations of organic matter cyanide solids and nutrients the effluent composition varies significantly among the observed samples and flour production effluent manipueira is generally more concentrated than starch extraction effluent tvs ts and tds ts ratios above 0 5 show that most of the effluents contain mostly organic and dissolved solids the bod5 cod bod5 n p and cod n p values show that both aerobic and anaerobic biological treatments are suitable although the high concentration of organic matter in cpww indicates that anaerobic treatment can be better it was verified that most brazilian industries use predominantly anaerobic biological processes through covered or uncovered stabilization ponds to treat their effluents as conventionally treated effluents may still contain pollutants alternative treatments must be studied to replace or complement stabilization ponds systems new anaerobic biological processes have been tested to treat and also generate biofuels and fertilizers being within the concept of the circular economy a significant linear correlation between cod and bod5 r2 0 8 was observed indicating that cod can be used to estimate bod5 since the former is easier to obtain this literature review can better guide the type of process to be researched for developing a more effective treatment and corroborates that cpww can be used as a feedstock for obtaining different products adding value to the cassava production chain credit authorship contribution statement renata c costa márcio d n ramos data curation formal analysis writing

12973,cassava is industrially processed to produce several food items e g flour and starch but the processing methods generate liquid residues that can be highly polluting this study seeks to conduct a literature review on the characteristics of cassava processing wastewaters cpww generated in brazil which is one of the world s leading producers of cassava this was done to suggest more adequate ways for treating the effluent and to obtain predictive models that can aid professionals in characterizing this effluent the results show that cpww contain high concentrations of organic matter besides nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous solids and cyanide based on its characteristics cpww has been evaluated as an alternative feedstock for obtaining biofuels fertilizers pesticides etc in addition the results show that flour production results in effluents with higher concentrations of pollutants than starch production this is because starch production uses more water per ton of processed cassava the average bod5 cod ratios for flour production 0 49 and for starch extraction effluents 0 47 show that they are highly biodegradable furthermore after analyzing the relationship between organic matter and nutrient concentrations c n p the results indicate that anaerobic biological processes are more suitable for treating this waste to corroborate this stabilization ponds covered or not have been the most used treatments in brazil there was a significant linear correlation between cod and bod5 r2 0 8 suggesting that bod5 can be estimated from cod in cpww generated through different factories graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords manipueira wastewater treatment biodegradability cod bod anaerobic digestion 1 introduction cassava manihot esculenta crantz also known as manioc or yucca is a perennial woody shrub from the euphorbiaceous family of plants 1 2 it is a tuberous root that can be cultivated in dry and nutrient poor soils and that does not require regular maintenance to grow well 1 3 cassava is usually planted in subtropical and tropical regions 3 brazil is one of the world s largest producers of cassava having produced 18 9 million tons in 2019 4 the root of the plant has the greatest commercial value being mainly composed of starch 80 on a dry basis 5 it is an excellent source of energy and a large portion of the cassava produced worldwide is marketed for human or animal consumption over 90 in addition to the application in textile and pulp and paper industries 3 flour and starch are the two main cassava derived foods 2 3 fig 1 shows the steps involved in producing cassava flour and starch regardless of the product several residues are generated like fibers peel bagasse and wastewaters cassava is crushed and then pressed to separate the solid material and the liquid residue the latter is commonly called manipueira the solids are then roasted to produce the flour to obtain starch the crushed cassava mass is washed with water to extract the starch which is then passed on to the concentration steps the liquid effluent generated in the starch extraction process is less concentrated than the manipueira 3 6 7 the amount of effluent often varies according to industrial type for example approximately 280 l of manipueira are generated from one ton of cassava at a flour producing plant in paraíba state 6 another flour producing plant in alagoas state generates about 400 l manipueira ton 1 8 volumes of starch extraction effluent generated per ton of processed cassava are greater 6100 l because water is added to extract starch 7 cassava processing effluents from industries may also contain wastewater coming from the initial steps of washing the root 6 9 in starch extraction industries most of the water used in the washing step is generated during the starch separation process 7 it is common to use the term cassava processing wastewater cpww when referring to effluents generated from various cassava processing methods 3 cpww is comprised mostly of water and a high level of organic matter like starch and soluble carbohydrates besides mineral salts 3 7 this effluent has a light yellow milky appearance 6 similar to other liquid wastes cpww must first be treated to comply with existing environmental legislation although there are reports in literature stating that raw effluent has been improperly disposed of thereby polluting surface water and groundwater sources 6 7 one common way of disposing of effluent is into the soil without conducting any type of treatment this can contaminate groundwater and negatively affect local vegetation 10 if discharged into water bodies the high concentration of organic matter in cpww can promote bacterial growth consume available oxygen and consequently kill fish and other aerobic life forms the color and turbidity of cpww blocks sunlight hindering photosynthesis and consequently dissolved oxygen levels 3 11 furthermore cpww can aggravate eutrophication processes due to its nutrient content n and p 12 in brazil starch extraction industries store effluent in stabilization ponds covered or not which are effective in removing above 90 of organic matter 9 13 the problem with the treatment through ponds is that they require large areas of land can emit an unpleasant odor and are poorly efficient in removing nutrients 14 cpww can be used to feed animals without having to treat it although cyanide must first be removed through spontaneous volatilization during a few days 15 16 promising results have been reported for fertigation processes with manipueira 17 20 although excessive amounts of effluent can negatively imbalance nutrient and salt concentrations and decrease the ph of the soil 21 manipueira is also commonly used to produce tucupi in the northern region of brazil which is a condiment prepared by fermenting the effluent for 72 h then cooking it for 10 min 22 manipueira has shown promise as a nematicide 23 insecticide 24 and fungicide 25 due to the cyanogenic glycosides and free cyanide contained in it another way of using cpww that is still being studied is using it as a feedstock to generate various biotechnological products like organic acids biosurfactants and especially biofuels 26 29 fig 2 shows some of the ways that cpww has been either practically applied or studied on a laboratory scale several parameters for characterizing effluents have been established by legislation so that effluents can be discharged into water bodies these parameters may be physical chemical or biological 30 they must also be applied to cpww since it is not usually reused the main parameter for the concentration of organic matter is the biochemical oxygen demand bod this parameter is present in all existing environmental legislations in brazil 31 however it only represents the concentration of biodegradable organic matter the bod determination involves an incubation period with bacteria taking at least 5 days bod5 under aerobic conditions another more practical parameter is the chemical oxygen demand cod which represents the concentration of biodegradable and non biodegradable organic matter within 3 h 32 predictive models can estimate bod5 using cod unlike bod5 cod is more practical and faster to obtain this can make monitoring and decision making more practical for operational corrections at treatment plants for any given liquid waste 33 some review articles about cpww have been recently published they have addressed general aspects and use of cpww as a feedstock in biorefinery 3 7 12 34 cpww treatment through anaerobic digestion 7 35 and its use as a pesticide 36 or fertilizer in agriculture 21 37 as a novelty the present review focuses on the main characteristics of cpww generated in brazil several characterization parameters were compared with the maximum allowable concentrations according to federal and state legislations regarding the disposal of effluents into water bodies relationships among the main parameters bod5 cod bod5 n p cod n p were evaluated to point out more adequate processes for treating this effluent furthermore an attempt to linearly correlate some parameters was made to find predictive models that make characterizing and monitoring cpww easier in treatment plants 2 analysis of the physicochemical characteristics of cpww table s1 shows the physicochemical characteristics of real effluents as reported in the literature the data were published between 2011 and 2020 in scientific articles theses dissertations and some papers from congresses were also consulted and google scholar scopus and the web of science were used to conduct the literature review different expressions and keywords were used like cassava processing wastewater manipueira cod bod cassava starch extraction effluent according to the sources surveyed samples of manipueira were collected from flour houses or industries and starch effluents were taken from starch factories some samples were acquired from industries that did not specify their products obtained from cassava effluent data that had been obtained in laboratory experiments were disregarded some studies did not specify whether they had collected effluents at specific processing stages or whether the effluent samples were coming from the entire industrial process the expression cassava processing wastewater cpww was used in this study to refer to all effluents from the literature review cassava processing was taken into account when classifying data in tables some authors referred to the same effluent in separate publications and care was taken so that no data was repeated when a study characterized more than one sample of effluent the data were reported separately regardless of whether the samples were obtained from the same cassava processing plant or not if the source reported only average values from several effluent samples at the same industry this information was used except for the data on ph which is a parameter represented in a logarithmic scale and so its average cannot be calculated by contrast if studies reported maximum and minimum ph values these data were considered here most manipueira samples were collected from flour producers in cities in the northeast of brazil while starch extraction effluents were collected from são paulo and paraná states effluents come from different states and regions all over brazil as shown in fig 3 most studies reported ph which is a practical measuring parameter fundamental for adopting both physicochemical and biological treatment processes and for disposing of treated effluents in water bodies 30 31 brazilian 161 legislation from the national environmental council conama establishes a ph range from 5 to 9 for discharging effluents into water bodies 38 more than half of the cpww samples had ph values below 5 while none exceeded 9 ph values generally below 7 are common since there are many organic acids generally reported as volatile acids va alkalinity is another parameter that is often measured in studies alkalinity refers to the number of ions in a solution that neutralizes hydrogen ions bicarbonates carbonates and hydroxides result in wastewater alkalinity 32 39 conama does not set any limits both for acids and alkalinity although these parameters are relevant for treating effluents through anaerobic biological processes 40 41 the concentration of organic matter in effluents was reported to be very high especially for flour production effluents organic matter in these effluents was approximately 150 times more concentrated than sewage in brazil in terms of bod5 which on average is 300 mg l 1 39 bod5 is an indicator of the concentration of biodegradable organic matter this parameter was reported in less than 30 of all samples conama requires that a minimum of 60 bod5 be removed for the effluent to be released into water bodies this value can be reduced if a self depuration study proves compliance with the requirements of the water body which the effluent will be released 38 state environmental agencies require that a minimum of 30 to 95 bod5 be removed or allow for a maximum concentration of 30 to 180 mg l 1 depending on the state 31 cod was reported in almost all consulted studies federal legislation does not set maximum concentrations much less a minimum cod removal requirement for releasing effluents into water bodies 38 by contrast state agencies require maximum cod concentrations of 60 to 600 mg l 1 or a minimum cod removal of 60 to 90 depending on the state 31 it was verified that the concentration of organic matter in terms of both bod5 and cod was well above the established legislative limits meaning that this effluent must be treated before it can be discharged into water bodies or disposed of in the soil in function of the consulted data it was observed that a flour production effluent had its bod5 level approximately 250 times greater than the limit established in the corresponding state legislation while a starch production effluent had cod level 100 times higher than the legislative limit total organic carbon toc can also be used to determine organic matter concentration 30 toc was evaluated by relatively few studies unlike bod5 and cod total sugar or total carbohydrate content was also reported by some studies there are no environmental agencies that limit carbohydrate concentration however these are probably responsible for the high concentrations of organic matter in these effluents turbidity measures the degree to which light can pass through a solution although turbidity is not legislated for effluent discharge it is an important parameter since suspended solids can interfere with the metabolisms of photosynthetic organisms 39 although a few studies have reported turbidity data cpww is a turbid effluent the color parameter was only reported by santos 42 for starch extraction effluents who gave values ranging from 6128 to 11 675 mg ptco l 1 phosphorus was evaluated in about half of all consulted studies and concentrations varied greatly conama resolution 430 states that the environmental agency may define specific standards for phosphorus in effluents that are released into water bodies that are prone to cyanobacterial blooms or stretches that have public supply catchments conama stipulates that the maximum value for the ammoniacal nitrogen parameter is 20 mg l 1 38 one study reported cpww with 3200 mg nh4 l 1 i e 160 times greater than the acceptable level six of nine effluents showed values below the permitted level total nitrogen tn content is not legislated although high concentrations have been reported mainly for manipueira the highest reported value was 5100 mg n l 1 some studies mistakenly reported total nitrogen measurements as they were measuring the concentration of total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn which consists of ammoniacal and organic n forms excluding other inorganic forms like nitrite and nitrate 30 cyanide is a highly toxic compound much more than ammonia and any effluent that will be discharged must have total cyanide levels below 1 0 mg l 1 and free cyanide levels below 0 2 mg l 1 38 virtually all studies that evaluated free or total cyanide found concentrations above the allowable limits cyanide is formed via the hydrolysis of cyanogenic glycosides linamarin and lotaustralin acting as a natural defense for cassava this high concentration of cyanide is important for using this effluent as a pesticide 36 but for animal food or discharge into water bodies it is problematic only settleable suspended solids sss are addressed in resolution 430 from conama 38 sss in effluents settle out within 1 h in an imhoff cone 30 the concentration of sss must be up to 1 ml l 1 if effluents are to be released into circulating water bodies no sss should be present if effluents are to be discharged into lakes and lagoons where circulation speeds are practically nonexistent 38 this parameter was analyzed in only 6 samples and all reported concentrations were above the maximum allowable level except for the sss as reported in table s1 the series for cpww solids can be found in table s2 they are classified into total solids ts total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds total volatile solids tvs or total fixed solids tfs ts refer to all the components in the sample that remain after evaporation 30 ts concentrations varied significantly among the samples when comparing effluents of different types one can see that samples from flour production have higher concentrations of solids than from starch production tfs refers to the dry inorganic matter present in wastewater while the tvs refer to the concentration of dry organic matter on the other hand tss are retained after filtration opposed to tds that remain in solution 39 tds were reported in a few cases but only for starch extraction effluents making it difficult to analyze the samples although the concentration of solids was generally higher for manipueira other relevant aspects were verified using the data in the table the tds ts ratio was calculated for some starch extraction effluent samples all ratios were above 0 87 showing that the fraction of dissolved solids is much greater than suspended solids regarding the tvs ts ratio all calculated values were much higher than the minimum value of 0 53 showing that most solids are organic compounds furthermore the average tvs ts ratio calculated for the two effluent types was equal to 0 8 tvs must mainly refer to carbohydrates in cpww the higher fraction of organic compounds indicates that this effluent can serve as an energy source in animal feed or as a substrate for producing organic acids and fuels via biotechnological routes 3 34 inorganic components are also important regardless of the way cpww is used since they are essentially macronutrients and micronutrients 43 as shown in table s3 cpww contains different metal cations electrical conductivity is linked to the total concentration of anions and cations mobility valence and relative concentrations federal legislation does not mention electrical conductivity but establishes maximum concentrations of various metals for discharging treated effluents into water bodies also shown in table s3 only one effluent sample had concentrations above the allowable level for zinc the values were above the allowable limits for less than half of the samples where iron and manganese were measured cadmium and nickel were rarely measured and concentrations were below the maximum allowable limits and only two samples had cu concentrations above the allowable limit flour production effluents were more concentrated than starch extraction effluents for most of these components except for fe mn and s unlike cations there were very few anions reported in the studies chloride ranged from 12 3 to 795 mg l 1 and it was analyzed in six samples sulfate was measured by four sources ranging from 18 04 to 2205 mg l 1 nitrate was analyzed in three studies and the reported values were very different from each other 4 mg l 1 28 19 mg l 1 18 and 407 mg l 1 44 nitrite was only measured by andrade 44 who reported 0 58 mg l 1 given these characteristics and the presence of n and p some studies have shown that flour production effluents can be used as fertilizers if applied in adequate amounts 20 45 46 the composition of this effluent complies with normative no 39 that defines the parameters for mineral fertilizers used in agriculture 47 this effluent contains primary macronutrients for fertilizers i e nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk furthermore some secondary macronutrients like calcium magnesium and sulfur and micronutrients like chlorine copper iron manganese nickel and zinc were also present however it is important to emphasize that higher effluent levels can harm plant development because of the high concentration of some nutrients like potassium 20 45 3 relationship between the analyzed parameters for cpww according to effluent characteristics it is possible to direct what treatments may be appropriate to allow its discharge in nature or reuse this takes the type degree of treatment and compliance with legislation into account 32 the bod5 cod ratio also known as the biodegradability index indicates the biodegradable fraction of organic matter in effluents when this ratio is 0 4 at least 40 of the organic matter is biodegradable and the effluent can be treated biologically by contrast a ratio 0 15 shows that there is a very low fraction of biodegradable organic matter and the effluent can be better treated using physicochemical processes ratios between 0 15 and 0 4 mean that effluent can be treated either biologically and or using physicochemical processes and other characteristics need to be evaluated 39 of all the reviewed studies here 21 cpww samples had both parameters quantified 13 had a bod5 cod ratio 0 4 table 1 showing that biological treatments are preferred due to their low cost and high efficiency given the favorable climatic conditions in brazil six samples had mid ranged ratios while only two had ratios 0 15 when calculating the average ratios for effluents from flour production and starch extraction the values obtained were 0 49 and 0 47 respectively this suggests that biological processes are best suited for treating these effluents n and p are nutrients present in many effluents including cpww this effluent can be used as a culture media for microalgae which will treat it 77 78 and algae biomass that accumulates can serve as raw material for generating value added products 12 62 78 79 evaluating these nutrients is important since maintaining microorganisms in biological treatments depends on the minimal amounts of n and p in addition to removing organic matter solids and cyanide nutrient removal is also necessary to avoid eutrophication problems in receiving water bodies 39 if the raw effluent has a low concentration of nutrients relative to the organic matter content supplementation is necessary if the effluent is to be biologically treated this is commonly applied to effluents coming from textile 80 82 and pulp and paper industries 83 85 the relationship between organic matter and nutrients can indicate the best suited biological treatment i e aerobic or anaerobic treatment and can indicate whether supplementation is needed or not if the bod5 n p proportion is around 100 5 1 aerobic processes are recommended sant anna jr 43 suggests a cod n p proportion of 250 5 1 for anaerobically treating effluents recently gao et al 86 used a cod n p proportion of 250 6 5 1 to anaerobically treat effluent from a thermomechanical pulping industry these proportions could not be calculated for all the samples consulted in this review since not all presented results for these parameters for some studies only one proportion was calculated here and in some cases using only one nutrient the results show that most samples had the minimum required nutrient concentrations relative to organic matter concentrations both for aerobic and anaerobic processes thus supplementation can be disregarded for biologically treating cpww even for tkn some samples still contained minimal n concentrations while others did not on the other hand concentrations well above the minimum levels are also concerning since the biological treatment applied may not properly remove nutrients 39 the type of biological treatment chosen either aerobic or anaerobic depends on efficiency energy costs and waste by product generation aerobic processes are more effective and generally comply with current legislation however they require a lot of energy due to the artificial aeration procedure needed to oxidize the organic matter they also generate a lot of sludge which must be treated and disposed of properly despite anaerobic processes being less efficient in removing organic matter they require less work and do not require aeration they do not generate much sludge besides it is already stabilized 39 43 in addition digestate treated effluent can be also used as a fertilizer 7 35 biogas is one by product from treatment that can be used as an energy source or must be burned since it is rich in methane a more potent greenhouse gas than co2 35 87 burning biogas generates thermal energy that is even used by some starch producers in brazil 88 however biogas used as an alternative energy source depends on the methane concentration implying that it may need to first be purified to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide 87 89 the degree of purity of biogas will determine its applicability e g as a heating source as a combined heat and energy generation source as vehicle fuel 90 for steam production or to serve as a base feedstock in industrial processes 91 regarding anaerobic treatments the alkalinity is an important parameter that must be checked since small reductions in ph due to organic acids generated in the fermentative stage result in alkali consumption reducing the buffering capacity of this medium 44 49 66 ph tends to be reduced with accumulated organic acids compromising acetotrophic microorganisms and subsequently methanogenic microorganisms sant anna jr 43 mentions that some authors recommend monitoring the ratio between volatile acids and total alkalinity va ta in the range of 0 06 to 0 2 during anaerobic biological treatments of the few studies on cpwws that it was possible to calculate the va at ratio the obtained values were above 0 2 this can compromise anaerobic treatments and biogas production in turn brazilian researchers often increase cpww alkalinity to treat it anaerobically on a laboratory scale this is done via supplementation with inputs like sodium bicarbonate 49 65 sodium hydroxide 57 or low cost alkalizing materials 44 67 table 2 shows the ranges averages and standard deviations of some cpww characteristics the ranges are wide for both flour production and starch extraction effluents meaning that composition is quite varied probably due to the origin of the feedstock and mainly because cassava processing is specific for each industry 12 standard deviation values greater than the average for some parameters also indicate the variability of the reported data from the literature review the cod and bod5 averages for flour production effluents are approximately 3 to 5 times higher than starch extraction effluents ph is generally lower for flour production effluents 4 conventional treatments for effluents from cassava processing in brazil some studies mentioned the conventional treatment systems where cpww was collected for research these treatments are shown in table 3 most industries treat this effluent in stabilization ponds this is a simple low cost method although does require large areas with one or more ponds being used in series 14 39 in the first treatment pond anaerobiosis predominates due to the concentration of biodegradable organic matter being high and natural aeration does not provide enough o2 if it is not covered the generated biogas is emitted directly into the atmosphere in the subsequent treatment ponds containing lower organic matter concentrations both aerobic and anaerobic degradation mechanisms are at work 32 some sources did not mention the number of ponds used the digestate is discharged into the soil direct infiltration and this can be appropriate for protecting water bodies and providing nutrients to vegetation 35 69 it is important to highlight that some starch producers use ponds with coverings or so called biodigesters allowing them to recover biogas minimizing emissions into the atmosphere certain starch companies tend to burn the gas to generate heat in boilers instead of relying exclusively on firewood 88 characterizing treated effluents is relevant when verifying the efficiency of conventional treatments or when verifying whether effluents comply with legislation for discharging them into water bodies and to understand effluent characteristics for eventually disposing of this waste into soil data for treated cpww are rarely reported leite et al 9 analyzed covered pond treated wastewater from three different starch extraction industries all data for bod5 cyanide ph and temperature met federal legislation standards only one industry did not meet the maximum sss concentration level data not shown all showed ammonia concentration levels 60 mg l 1 well above the allowable limit it is well known that anaerobic processes are not effective in removing nitrogen and that they require an aerobic additional step 92 94 interestingly fleck et al 58 evaluated an aerated batch bioreactor for treating an anaerobically pretreated starch extraction effluent under optimized conditions the authors found that almost all ammonia had been removed after 24 h and the highest nitrate conversion about 25 occurred after 40 h as ponds have limitations 14 brazilian researchers have reported predominately on treating raw cpww through other anaerobic biological processes researches evaluating different anaerobic reactors and operation mode have been conducted in bench scale to improve the treatment and or optimize gaseous biofuels production e g h2 ch4 51 53 72 95 in addition the cpww derived digestate has been evaluated as a fertilizer 95 98 these eco friendly aspects are within the concept of circular economy 7 5 obtaining predictive models based on cpww characteristics it takes at least five days to analyze an effluent sample to measure its bod5 while the cod measurements can be obtained in up to 3 h 32 to facilitate cpww characterization and to monitor the treatment processes an attempt was made to find a linear correlation for estimating bod5 from the cod according to silva and mendonça 33 this correlation reduces operational costs because the cod is a cheaper laboratory analysis and helps make decisions regarding operational correction measures it also allows planners to define project parameters a linear correlation coefficient is significant if it is equal to or greater than 0 8 if it is between 0 5 and 0 8 it is moderate a linear correlation coefficient is weak for values lower than this 99 recent studies have sought out correlations among these and other physicochemical parameters for wastewaters to estimate relevant parameters by using less complex inputs for example liang et al 100 verified significant linear correlations between cod and toxicity for effluents from four textile industries in china obtaining r2 values greater than 0 82 ramos et al 80 obtained moderate coefficients between cod and bod5 values for effluents coming from brazilian textile companies 0 6737 and textile laundries 0 6055 linear correlations to estimate bod5 from cod with r2 values above 0 8 have been obtained for sewage systems in brazil 33 101 in turn dubber and gray 102 obtained linear correlations above 0 9 for cod bod5 toc bod5 and cod toc for domestic and municipal wastewaters collected in treatment plants in ireland table 4 shows different attempts to linearly correlate organic matter concentration data and other physicochemical parameters for cpww from the data presented in table s1 table 4 also contains the amount of data used for obtaining each correlation the data amount was also used to indicate whether the equations are reliable the most significant correlation was observed for cod tss fig s1 a however because one datum is out of line with the other data the linear correlation tended to be forced if the outlier is deleted the correlation coefficient drops to 0 4458 fig s1 b and the correlation is therefore weak on the other hand a strong correlation above 0 8 was found for cod bod5 fig 4 with varying data thus ensuring greater correlation reliability as the correlation was calculated from data from different industries the present work suggests the use of this equation for any cassava processing plants in brazil however it should be mentioned that if accuracy in bod5 is required the conventional analysis of this parameter must be performed 33 a significant correlation was also observed for bod5 tds but the number of samples containing both reported parameters was very low and the result is therefore unreliable bod5 still showed moderate correlations with ts and tfs and cod showed moderate correlations with turbidity ts tvs and tfs 6 conclusions based on the data from the literature review it is clear that cassava processing wastewater cpww needs to be treated before it is disposed of in nature comparing cpww characteristics with brazilian environmental legislations cpww was observed to contain high concentrations of organic matter cyanide solids and nutrients the effluent composition varies significantly among the observed samples and flour production effluent manipueira is generally more concentrated than starch extraction effluent tvs ts and tds ts ratios above 0 5 show that most of the effluents contain mostly organic and dissolved solids the bod5 cod bod5 n p and cod n p values show that both aerobic and anaerobic biological treatments are suitable although the high concentration of organic matter in cpww indicates that anaerobic treatment can be better it was verified that most brazilian industries use predominantly anaerobic biological processes through covered or uncovered stabilization ponds to treat their effluents as conventionally treated effluents may still contain pollutants alternative treatments must be studied to replace or complement stabilization ponds systems new anaerobic biological processes have been tested to treat and also generate biofuels and fertilizers being within the concept of the circular economy a significant linear correlation between cod and bod5 r2 0 8 was observed indicating that cod can be used to estimate bod5 since the former is easier to obtain this literature review can better guide the type of process to be researched for developing a more effective treatment and corroborates that cpww can be used as a feedstock for obtaining different products adding value to the cassava production chain credit authorship contribution statement renata c costa márcio d n ramos data curation formal analysis writing

treatment performance and microbial activities in mbr are still unknown in this study effects of vanillin on production of extracellular polymeric substances eps and microbial community was investigated in lab scale mbr under continuous dose of vanillin vanillin dose remarkably reduced membrane fouling in accordance with less development of cake layer it was probably because bulk sludge contained more hydrophilic components and became less adhesive by lower abundance of xanthomonadaceae and chitonophagaceae which are known to produce viscous eps and hydrophobic lipopolysaccharides in addition filtration resistance of cake layer was probably reduced by less contents of smp and lb eps due to inhibition of flavobacterium and xanthomonadaceae which are biofilm forming bacteria and eps

processes vanillin a phenolic aldehyde contained in vanilla extract is known as a bioactive substance to inhibit various microbial activities including quorum sensing 22 addition of vanillin to bacterial culture is recently reported to prevent adhesion of microbial cells on membrane surface 23 25 those studies suggested that vanillin dose is potentially effective for mitigation of biofouling in mbr in those studies static cell adhesion was investigated by placing membrane coupons in microbial suspension without filtration under dose of vanillin for a few days biofouling in mbr however involves not only static adhesion of microbial cells but also presence of permeation drag force air scouring and cleaning cycles these conditions might offset or enhance effect of vanillin on biofouling mitigation moreover vanillin reportedly had antimicrobial activity against some microbial species 26 28 continuous dose of vanillin possibly brings various biological effects on microbial community and eps characteristics in sludge however effects of continuous vanillin dose on such microbial activities have not been well investigated yet in the past studies the objective of this study

fouling and organic removal performance dose of vanillin significantly reduced fouling progress fig 1 tmp development was remarkably mitigated only when vanillin was added in feed wastewater cleaning frequency was also reduced accordingly the mbr operations with no vanillin dose i e control and glucose needed 6 times of cleaning with average interval of 7 0 days while mbr with vanillin dose needed cleaning only twice during 9 weeks operation in mbr operations with no vanillin rapid increase of tmp as known as tmp jump occurred in 4 5 days after cleaning in the second filtration cycle and later on while there was no obvious tmp jump observed in mbr with vanillin dose the tmp jump is explained by increase of local flux in fouling layer when water channels in fouling layer is limited by pore blocking internal fouling or porosity loss of cake layer local flux at the available channels increases to maintain the fixed average permeate flux 33 35 the reduction of cleaning frequency nor tmp jump was not observed when the equivalent organic loading was added as glucose therefore the observed fouling mitigation was not due to increase of organic loading but caused as effect of vanillin dose vanillin is reportedly an antimicrobial agent against some bacteria 26 28 in mbr however vanillin did not have adverse effect on organic removal performance mbr with vanillin dose showed stable toc removal performance throughout the operation period the average toc removal ratio in mbr with vanillin was 98 0 5 of sd which was equivalent to those in two other conditions without vanillin table s2 3 2 eps characteristics eps concentrations in bulk sludge increased by vanillin dose in accordance with the increase of mlss p 0 05 in smp p 0 01 in lb eps fig 2a with vanillin dose eps concentrations in bulk sludge simply increased due to increase of mlss eps content per gmlss of bulk sludge did not significantly change by vanillin fig 2b therefore vanillin did not function to reduce nor enhance eps productivity of sludge microbes on the contrary with equivalent organic dose of glucose eps concentrations in bulk sludge significantly decreased p 0 05 in smp p 0 01 in lb eps fig 2a eps content per gmlss of bulk sludge also significantly decreased p 0 01 in lb eps fig 2b however no significant fouling mitigation was observed when organic loading was elevated with glucose dose even though eps production reduced these results suggest that fouling mitigation by vanillin was not caused by increase of organic loading rate nor by reduction of eps production in bulk sludge but for other reasons membrane should receive more eps when bulk sludge has a higher eps concentration when glucose was added in feed wastewater eps amount in cake layer changed in accordance with eps concentration in bulk sludge smp quantity per unit area of membrane surface in cake layer increased since smp concentration in bulk sludge increased lb eps in cake layer decreased since lb eps concentration in bulk sludge decreased fig 2 when vanillin was added however lb eps quantity per area in cake layer substantially reduced in mbr although lb eps concentrations in bulk sludge increased fig 2 total quantity of smp and lb eps in cake sludge was significantly lower with vanillin dose p 0 05 this implies change of eps characteristics by vanillin dose eps in bulk sludge possibly became less adhesive to membrane surface as an effect of vanillin dose adhesiveness of a sludge floc is governed by the extended dlvo theory which includes attractive lewis van der waals lw interaction acid base ab interaction and repulsive electrostatic el force polar or hydrophilic substances generally have smaller ab interaction thus are less adhesive to membrane 36 37 hydrophilicity of floc surface is affected by lb eps which surrounds cell aggregate of the floc 38 for example li and yang 2007 39 reported that lb eps has a negative effect on bioflocculation and sludge dewaterability their results suggest that lb eps plays an important role in hydration of sludge flocs in mbr with vanillin bulk sludge contained more hydrophilic components of lb eps than other two conditions of control and with glucose addition fig 3b lb eps in bulk sludge had two peaks in reverse phase chromatogram fig s2 in control the hydrophilic fraction at 3 5 min had a single component with 650 kda of apparent molecular weight with vanillin dose the hydrophilic fraction contained more components as small as 0 5 and 150 kda of apparent molecular weight while lb eps was dominated by smaller molecules mass based lb eps contents in bulk sludge did not change by vanillin dose fig 2b therefore lb eps with vanillin dose contained the larger number of eps molecules which can surround sludge flocs to enhance hydrophilic feature of the flocs because of this shift in lb eps components bulk sludge with vanillin dose was possibly more hydrophilic and less adhesive than in control previous studies also reported that vanillin reduces adhesion of eps on membrane 23 25 40 41 among the major components of eps polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides were reported to be significant in fouling progress 1 42 44 in this study no significant difference was found in polysaccharide and protein contents in bulk sludge among all conditions fig 4a however polysaccharide and protein contents in lb eps were significantly higher in cake layer when glucose was added fig 4b increased organic loading with glucose resulted in increase of polysaccharide contents in cake layer which reportedly causes progressive fouling however vanillin dose did not cause such increase of polysaccharide contents in cake layer these changes in eps characteristics of cake sludge by vanillin dose possibly resulted in less fouling progress contents of smp was significantly reduced by vanillin dose p 0 05 fig 2d specific filtration resistance of cake layer is much affected by eps contents and composition according to shen et al 2015 presence of smp significantly increased specific filtration resistance of cake layer therefore cake layer possibly had lower filtration resistance with vanillin dose because of its lower contents of smp in addition smp of cake sludge had quite different size polarity profile from that of bulk sludge according to wang et al 2007 46 supernatant in cake sludge contained more organic materials compared to that in bulk sludge the organic matters in the cake sludge supernatant consisted of a variety of larger molecules which is called biopolymer clusters bpcs with vanillin dose smp of cake sludge contained more hydrophilic components than in control the increase of hydrophilic components in smp was observed in a wide range of the size fig 3d contents of polysaccharides and proteins both increased in smp of cake sludge by vanillin dose fig 4 these increase in abundance of hydrophilic components in cake sludge also possibly enhanced water permeability of cake layer consequently less progressive fouling under vanillin dose was not brought by reduction of eps production in bulk sludge but by alteration of eps composition in bulk sludge sludge flocs became less adhesive because of increased abundance of hydrophilic lb eps in cake sludge specific filtration resistance of the cake layer possibly became lower because of decrease in its eps contents and increased hydrophilicity due to higher relative abundance of hydrophilic eps components 3 3 microbial community microbial communities in bulk and cake sludge were affected by vanillin dose in accordance with eps characteristics change according to principal component analysis of family level otu abundance microbial communities in bulk and cake sludge were relatively similar in mbr with glucose dose and in control in contract in mbr with vanillin dose microbial community in cake sludge was remarkably different from that in bulk sludge fig 5 all cake sludge samples with vanillin dose had positive pc1 values while those of bulk sludge had negative pc1 it suggests that cake layer had different microbial community from bulk sludge by vanillin dose in pc1 chitinophagaceae had highly positive loadings while flavobacteriaceae had highly negative loading fig 5 table s3 hence cake sludge with vanillin dose were characterized with higher abundance of chitinophagaceae 21 9 and lower abundance of flavobacteriaceae 1 7 when compared with bulk sludge 3 1 and 6 3 respectively fig 6 table s4 abundance of chitinophagaceae 31 remarkably reduced when either vanillin or glucose was added 0 4 or 2 4 respectively fig 6a table s4 chitinophagaceae were reported to have high potential to produce exopolysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides 47 lipopolysaccharides lps were reported to be the major foulant in mbr due to their hydrophobic property 24 43 lps was a constituent of the cell wall of gram negative bacteria its typical size was smaller than 100 kda 48 49 hence lps was observed as small components in tb eps in this study components smaller than 50 kda significantly reduced in tb eps of cake sludge with vanillin dose than those in control fig 3 this reduction of lps like components possibly caused by lower abundance of chitinophagaceae however abundance of chitinophagaceae increased on day 63 in cake layer with vanillin dose while it was constantly low in cake sludge in mbr with glucose dose therefore chitinophagaceae possibly played a certain role in fouling phenomena but their change of abundance was not specifically induced by vanillin dose reduction of flavobacteriaceae was another major microbial community change which caused fouling mitigation with vanilllin dose guo et al 2015 50 reported some genera in flavobacteriaceae had high positive correlation with eps production and fouling in this study flavobacterium was the only genus found in flavobacteriaceae family abundance of flavobacterium in cake sludge constantly reduced with vanillin dose it was 10 0 on day 21 then declined to 1 7 on day 63 fig 6c flavobacterium is known as biofilm forming bacteria and extracellular polysaccharide producers 51 52 in control mbr abundance of flavobacterium significantly increased by 20 30 from 21 until 63 days of operation with glucose dose abundance of flavobacterium in bulk and cake sludge did not show significant change on the contrary they remarkably decreased with vanillin dose vanillin possibly inhibited growth of flavobacterium due to its antimicrobial property and reduced adhesion of flavobacterium onto membrane moreover xanthomonadaceae was also present in lower abundance in cake sludge with vanillin dose it was 1 8 on day 21 and 2 3 on day 63 fig 6b table s4 xanthomonadaceae includes a variety of eps producing bacteria including xanthomonas which are known to produce highly viscous polysaccharide of xanthan gum 53 and lysobacter which is capable of quorum sensing and produce various exoenzymes 54 in our previous study xanthomonadaceae were associated with increase of fouling 11 moreover many isolates in xanthomonadaceae family reportedly indicates quorum sensing activity 16 55 56 nam et al 2015 hypothesized that vanillin inhibited microbial quorum sensing and biofilm formation on membrane this study also shows that reduction of xanthomonadaceae by vanillin dose possibly has a positive effect on mitigation of mbr fouling 3 4 possible mechanism of fouling mitigation by vanillin vanillin dose remarkably reduced membrane fouling in mbr without adverse impact on organic removal performance there was no significant reduction of eps by vanillin dose instead various changes were observed in both eps characteristics and microbial community in mbr with vanillin dose the most important impact of vanillin was much less development of cake layer quantity of eps in cake layer adhered on unit area of membrane remarkably reduced in spite of increase of eps concentrations in bulk sludge these phenomena were not observed when glucose was added to the equivalent organic loading rate reduction of cake layer development and biofilm formation by vanillin is also reported in other studies 23 25 40 41 this is probably one of the major reasons for fouling mitigation by vanillin interestingly the fouling mitigation was not caused by reduction of eps quantity in sludge but by other reasons the possible reason for less development of cake layer was less adhesiveness of bulk sludge flocs as a consequence of microbial community change adhesiveness of a sludge floc is governed by the extended dlvo theory a sludge floc with hydrophilic surface is generally less adhesive because it has larger repulsive ab force against solid surface hydrophilicity of a floc surface is affected by lb eps which surround cell aggregates of the floc 38 with vanillin dose bulk sludge contained more hydrophilic components of lb eps therefore bulk sludge flocs became more hydrophilic and less adhesive to surface of membrane and cake layer by dose of vanillin in accordance with this change of eps characteristics notable change was observed in microbial community in bulk sludge with vanillin dose flavobacteriaceae xanthomonadaceae and chitonophagaceae significantly decreased their abundance by vanillin dose decrease of their abundance probably resulted in less production of highly viscous polysaccharides like xanthan gum and hydrophobic lps another possible reason for fouling mitigation by vanillin is higher permeability of cake layer specific filtration resistance of cake layer becomes greater when the cake sludge has higher contents of smp and lb eps 45 57 by vanillin dose contents of smp and lb eps in cake sludge were significantly decreased moreover smp and lb eps in cake sludge contained more hydrophilic components these lower contents of smp and lb eps probably resulted in lower filtration resistance of the cake layer in mbr with vanillin dose microbial community change in cake layer also supported this change of eps content abundance of flavobacterium which are known as biofilm forming bacteria and eps producers and xanthomonadaceae were decreased in cake layer by vanillin dose in conclusion vanillin is suggested to mitigate biofouling in mbr by following mechanisms in bulk sludge i vanillin inhibited flavobacteriaceae xanthomonadaceae and chitonophagaceae bacteria which produces eps with high viscosity and hydrophobicity ii lb eps shifted to contain more hydrophilic and less viscous components iii bulk sludge flocs became more hydrophilic and less adhesive due to the change of lb eps characteristics iv less cake layer was developed because of less adhesion of bulk sludge on membrane and cake layer in cake sludge i vanillin inhibited flavobacterium and xanthomonadaceae which are biofilm forming bacteria and eps producers ii cake sludge contained lower smp and lb eps contents due to less production of eps by cake layer microbes iii the lower contents of smp and lb eps resulted in lower filtration resistance of cake layer in this study there was no direct evidence on inhibition of quorum sensing by vanillin dose however it was clearly shown that vanillin brought significant change in eps characteristics which is caused by change of microbial community the results of this study suggest interference to microbial activity can alter characteristics of sludge eps and be very effective to fouling control in mbr 4 conclusions dose of vanillin was remarkably effective to reduce biofouling progress the mitigation of membrane fouling was not caused by reduction of eps production but by change in microbial community and subsequent change in eps characteristics of bulk and cake sludge this fouling mitigation was not observed when equivalent organic loading of glucose was added in wastewater cake layer development was significantly reduced by vanillin dose it was probably because bulk sludge contained more hydrophilic components and became less adhesive by lower abundance of xanthomonadaceae and chitonophagaceae which produces viscous eps and hydrophobic lps less contents of smp and lb eps probably reduced filtration resistance of cake layer the reduction of smp and lb eps in cake sludge was probably caused by inhibition of flavobacterium and xanthomonadaceae which are biofilm forming bacteria and eps producers this study suggests that continuous dose of vanillin mitigates biofouling in mbr by interfering microbial activity thereby altering characteristics of sludge eps

membrane fouling by reducing eps production of activated sludge in mbr 17 21 these studies suggest that interference in sludge microbial activity can be effective measures to control biofouling in mbr processes vanillin a phenolic aldehyde contained in vanilla extract is known as a bioactive substance to inhibit various microbial activities including quorum sensing 22 addition of vanillin to bacterial culture is recently reported to prevent adhesion of microbial cells on membrane surface 23 25 those studies suggested that vanillin dose is potentially effective for mitigation of biofouling in mbr in those studies static cell adhesion was investigated by placing membrane coupons in microbial suspension without filtration under dose of vanillin for a few days biofouling in mbr however involves not only static adhesion of microbial cells but also presence of permeation drag force air scouring and cleaning cycles these conditions might offset or enhance effect of vanillin on biofouling mitigation moreover vanillin reportedly had antimicrobial activity against some microbial species 26 28 continuous dose of vanillin possibly brings various biological effects on microbial community and eps characteristics in sludge however effects of continuous vanillin dose on such microbial activities have not been well investigated yet in the past studies the objective of this study is to clarify impacts of continuous vanillin dose on eps characteristics and microbial community in mbr membrane fouling and organic removal performance were evaluated under continuous dose of vanillin in lab scale mbrs production and composition of eps in bulk and cake sludge were compared under different dose of vanillin and organic loading change in size distribution and hydrophilicity of eps were also characterized by using size polarity matrix analysis regarding the observed change of eps and microbial community possible mechanism of biofouling mitigation by vanillin was discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 lab scale membrane bioreactor lab scale mbrs were operated for continuous treatment of artificial wastewater the mbrs were fed with 150 mgc l of glucose based artificial wastewater labeled as control hereinafter and the artificial wastewater with additional dose of vanillin at 160 mgc l labeled as vanillin the concentration of vanillin was determined as the sufficiently high concentration where the effect of biofilm prevention was clearly observed in si and quan 2017 25 in order to clarify effect of increased organic loading another mbr was also operated

the reactor tank and cleaned physically by flushing with water the seed sludge mlss 2 5 g l was taken from aeration tank of conventional activated sludge at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in japan to start up the lab scale mbr the seed sludge was inoculated and acclimatized by operating under the same condition as control run but with no sludge withdrawal for one month until mlss reached 10 g l the control and vanillin runs were operated for 65 days then glucose run was operated for 32 days after the control run to start the glucose run the membranes were replaced with virgin membrane

fouling and organic removal performance dose of vanillin significantly reduced fouling progress fig 1 tmp development was remarkably mitigated only when vanillin was added in feed wastewater cleaning frequency was also reduced accordingly the mbr operations with no vanillin dose i e control and glucose needed 6 times of cleaning with average interval of 7 0 days while mbr with vanillin dose needed cleaning only twice during 9 weeks operation in mbr operations with no vanillin rapid increase of tmp as known as tmp jump occurred in 4 5 days after cleaning in the second filtration cycle and later on while there was no obvious tmp jump observed in mbr with vanillin dose the tmp jump is explained by increase of local flux in fouling layer when water channels in fouling layer is limited by pore blocking internal fouling or porosity loss of cake layer local flux at the available channels increases to maintain the fixed average permeate flux 33 35 the reduction of cleaning frequency nor tmp jump was not observed when the equivalent organic loading was added as glucose therefore the observed fouling mitigation was not due to increase of organic loading but caused as effect of vanillin dose vanillin is reportedly an antimicrobial agent against some bacteria 26 28 in mbr however vanillin did not have adverse effect on organic removal performance mbr with vanillin dose showed stable toc removal performance throughout the operation period the average toc removal ratio in mbr with vanillin was 98 0 5 of sd which was equivalent to those in two other conditions without vanillin table s2 3 2 eps characteristics eps concentrations in bulk sludge increased by vanillin dose in accordance with the increase of mlss p 0 05 in smp p 0 01 in lb eps fig 2a with vanillin dose eps concentrations in bulk sludge simply increased due to increase of mlss eps content per gmlss of bulk sludge did not significantly change by vanillin fig 2b therefore vanillin did not function to reduce nor enhance eps productivity of sludge microbes on the contrary with equivalent organic dose of glucose eps concentrations in bulk sludge significantly decreased p 0 05 in smp p 0 01 in lb eps fig 2a eps content per gmlss of bulk sludge also significantly decreased p 0 01 in lb eps fig 2b however no significant fouling mitigation was observed when organic loading was elevated with glucose dose even though eps production reduced these results suggest that fouling mitigation by vanillin was not caused by increase of organic loading rate nor by reduction of eps production in bulk sludge but for other reasons membrane should receive more eps when bulk sludge has a higher eps concentration when glucose was added in feed wastewater eps amount in cake layer changed in accordance with eps concentration in bulk sludge smp quantity per unit area of membrane surface in cake layer increased since smp concentration in bulk sludge increased lb eps in cake layer decreased since lb eps concentration in bulk sludge decreased fig 2 when vanillin was added however lb eps quantity per area in cake layer substantially reduced in mbr although lb eps concentrations in bulk sludge increased fig 2 total quantity of smp and lb eps in cake sludge was significantly lower with vanillin dose p 0 05 this implies change of eps characteristics by vanillin dose eps in bulk sludge possibly became less adhesive to membrane surface as an effect of vanillin dose adhesiveness of a sludge floc is governed by the extended dlvo theory which includes attractive lewis van der waals lw interaction acid base ab interaction and repulsive electrostatic el force polar or hydrophilic substances generally have smaller ab interaction thus are less adhesive to membrane 36 37 hydrophilicity of floc surface is affected by lb eps which surrounds cell aggregate of the floc 38 for example li and yang 2007 39 reported that lb eps has a negative effect on bioflocculation and sludge dewaterability their results suggest that lb eps plays an important role in hydration of sludge flocs in mbr with vanillin bulk sludge contained more hydrophilic components of lb eps than other two conditions of control and with glucose addition fig 3b lb eps in bulk sludge had two peaks in reverse phase chromatogram fig s2 in control the hydrophilic fraction at 3 5 min had a single component with 650 kda of apparent molecular weight with vanillin dose the hydrophilic fraction contained more components as small as 0 5 and 150 kda of apparent molecular weight while lb eps was dominated by smaller molecules mass based lb eps contents in bulk sludge did not change by vanillin dose fig 2b therefore lb eps with vanillin dose contained the larger number of eps molecules which can surround sludge flocs to enhance hydrophilic feature of the flocs because of this shift in lb eps components bulk sludge with vanillin dose was possibly more hydrophilic and less adhesive than in control previous studies also reported that vanillin reduces adhesion of eps on membrane 23 25 40 41 among the major components of eps polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides were reported to be significant in fouling progress 1 42 44 in this study no significant difference was found in polysaccharide and protein contents in bulk sludge among all conditions fig 4a however polysaccharide and protein contents in lb eps were significantly higher in cake layer when glucose was added fig 4b increased organic loading with glucose resulted in increase of polysaccharide contents in cake layer which reportedly causes progressive fouling however vanillin dose did not cause such increase of polysaccharide contents in cake layer these changes in eps characteristics of cake sludge by vanillin dose possibly resulted in less fouling progress contents of smp was significantly reduced by vanillin dose p 0 05 fig 2d specific filtration resistance of cake layer is much affected by eps contents and composition according to shen et al 2015 presence of smp significantly increased specific filtration resistance of cake layer therefore cake layer possibly had lower filtration resistance with vanillin dose because of its lower contents of smp in addition smp of cake sludge had quite different size polarity profile from that of bulk sludge according to wang et al 2007 46 supernatant in cake sludge contained more organic materials compared to that in bulk sludge the organic matters in the cake sludge supernatant consisted of a variety of larger molecules which is called biopolymer clusters bpcs with vanillin dose smp of cake sludge contained more hydrophilic components than in control the increase of hydrophilic components in smp was observed in a wide range of the size fig 3d contents of polysaccharides and proteins both increased in smp of cake sludge by vanillin dose fig 4 these increase in abundance of hydrophilic components in cake sludge also possibly enhanced water permeability of cake layer consequently less progressive fouling under vanillin dose was not brought by reduction of eps production in bulk sludge but by alteration of eps composition in bulk sludge sludge flocs became less adhesive because of increased abundance of hydrophilic lb eps in cake sludge specific filtration resistance of the cake layer possibly became lower because of decrease in its eps contents and increased hydrophilicity due to higher relative abundance of hydrophilic eps components 3 3 microbial community microbial communities in bulk and cake sludge were affected by vanillin dose in accordance with eps characteristics change according to principal component analysis of family level otu abundance microbial communities in bulk and cake sludge were relatively similar in mbr with glucose dose and in control in contract in mbr with vanillin dose microbial community in cake sludge was remarkably different from that in bulk sludge fig 5 all cake sludge samples with vanillin dose had positive pc1 values while those of bulk sludge had negative pc1 it suggests that cake layer had different microbial community from bulk sludge by vanillin dose in pc1 chitinophagaceae had highly positive loadings while flavobacteriaceae had highly negative loading fig 5 table s3 hence cake sludge with vanillin dose were characterized with higher abundance of chitinophagaceae 21 9 and lower abundance of flavobacteriaceae 1 7 when compared with bulk sludge 3 1 and 6 3 respectively fig 6 table s4 abundance of chitinophagaceae 31 remarkably reduced when either vanillin or glucose was added 0 4 or 2 4 respectively fig 6a table s4 chitinophagaceae were reported to have high potential to produce exopolysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides 47 lipopolysaccharides lps were reported to be the major foulant in mbr due to their hydrophobic property 24 43 lps was a constituent of the cell wall of gram negative bacteria its typical size was smaller than 100 kda 48 49 hence lps was observed as small components in tb eps in this study components smaller than 50 kda significantly reduced in tb eps of cake sludge with vanillin dose than those in control fig 3 this reduction of lps like components possibly caused by lower abundance of chitinophagaceae however abundance of chitinophagaceae increased on day 63 in cake layer with vanillin dose while it was constantly low in cake sludge in mbr with glucose dose therefore chitinophagaceae possibly played a certain role in fouling phenomena but their change of abundance was not specifically induced by vanillin dose reduction of flavobacteriaceae was another major microbial community change which caused fouling mitigation with vanilllin dose guo et al 2015 50 reported some genera in flavobacteriaceae had high positive correlation with eps production and fouling in this study flavobacterium was the only genus found in flavobacteriaceae family abundance of flavobacterium in cake sludge constantly reduced with vanillin dose it was 10 0 on day 21 then declined to 1 7 on day 63 fig 6c flavobacterium is known as biofilm forming bacteria and extracellular polysaccharide producers 51 52 in control mbr abundance of flavobacterium significantly increased by 20 30 from 21 until 63 days of operation with glucose dose abundance of flavobacterium in bulk and cake sludge did not show significant change on the contrary they remarkably decreased with vanillin dose vanillin possibly inhibited growth of flavobacterium due to its antimicrobial property and reduced adhesion of flavobacterium onto membrane moreover xanthomonadaceae was also present in lower abundance in cake sludge with vanillin dose it was 1 8 on day 21 and 2 3 on day 63 fig 6b table s4 xanthomonadaceae includes a variety of eps producing bacteria including xanthomonas which are known to produce highly viscous polysaccharide of xanthan gum 53 and lysobacter which is capable of quorum sensing and produce various exoenzymes 54 in our previous study xanthomonadaceae were associated with increase of fouling 11 moreover many isolates in xanthomonadaceae family reportedly indicates quorum sensing activity 16 55 56 nam et al 2015 hypothesized that vanillin inhibited microbial quorum sensing and biofilm formation on membrane this study also shows that reduction of xanthomonadaceae by vanillin dose possibly has a positive effect on mitigation of mbr fouling 3 4 possible mechanism of fouling mitigation by vanillin vanillin dose remarkably reduced membrane fouling in mbr without adverse impact on organic removal performance there was no significant reduction of eps by vanillin dose instead various changes were observed in both eps characteristics and microbial community in mbr with vanillin dose the most important impact of vanillin was much less development of cake layer quantity of eps in cake layer adhered on unit area of membrane remarkably reduced in spite of increase of eps concentrations in bulk sludge these phenomena were not observed when glucose was added to the equivalent organic loading rate reduction of cake layer development and biofilm formation by vanillin is also reported in other studies 23 25 40 41 this is probably one of the major reasons for fouling mitigation by vanillin interestingly the fouling mitigation was not caused by reduction of eps quantity in sludge but by other reasons the possible reason for less development of cake layer was less adhesiveness of bulk sludge flocs as a consequence of microbial community change adhesiveness of a sludge floc is governed by the extended dlvo theory a sludge floc with hydrophilic surface is generally less adhesive because it has larger repulsive ab force against solid surface hydrophilicity of a floc surface is affected by lb eps which surround cell aggregates of the floc 38 with vanillin dose bulk sludge contained more hydrophilic components of lb eps therefore bulk sludge flocs became more hydrophilic and less adhesive to surface of membrane and cake layer by dose of vanillin in accordance with this change of eps characteristics notable change was observed in microbial community in bulk sludge with vanillin dose flavobacteriaceae xanthomonadaceae and chitonophagaceae significantly decreased their abundance by vanillin dose decrease of their abundance probably resulted in less production of highly viscous polysaccharides like xanthan gum and hydrophobic lps another possible reason for fouling mitigation by vanillin is higher permeability of cake layer specific filtration resistance of cake layer becomes greater when the cake sludge has higher contents of smp and lb eps 45 57 by vanillin dose contents of smp and lb eps in cake sludge were significantly decreased moreover smp and lb eps in cake sludge contained more hydrophilic components these lower contents of smp and lb eps probably resulted in lower filtration resistance of the cake layer in mbr with vanillin dose microbial community change in cake layer also supported this change of eps content abundance of flavobacterium which are known as biofilm forming bacteria and eps producers and xanthomonadaceae were decreased in cake layer by vanillin dose in conclusion vanillin is suggested to mitigate biofouling in mbr by following mechanisms in bulk sludge i vanillin inhibited flavobacteriaceae xanthomonadaceae and chitonophagaceae bacteria which produces eps with high viscosity and hydrophobicity ii lb eps shifted to contain more hydrophilic and less viscous components iii bulk sludge flocs became more hydrophilic and less adhesive due to the change of lb eps characteristics iv less cake layer was developed because of less adhesion of bulk sludge on membrane and cake layer in cake sludge i vanillin inhibited flavobacterium and xanthomonadaceae which are biofilm forming bacteria and eps producers ii cake sludge contained lower smp and lb eps contents due to less production of eps by cake layer microbes iii the lower contents of smp and lb eps resulted in lower filtration resistance of cake layer in this study there was no direct evidence on inhibition of quorum sensing by vanillin dose however it was clearly shown that vanillin brought significant change in eps characteristics which is caused by change of microbial community the results of this study suggest interference to microbial activity can alter characteristics of sludge eps and be very effective to fouling control in mbr 4 conclusions dose of vanillin was remarkably effective to reduce biofouling progress the mitigation of membrane fouling was not caused by reduction of eps production but by change in microbial community and subsequent change in eps characteristics of bulk and cake sludge this fouling mitigation was not observed when equivalent organic loading of glucose was added in wastewater cake layer development was significantly reduced by vanillin dose it was probably because bulk sludge contained more hydrophilic components and became less adhesive by lower abundance of xanthomonadaceae and chitonophagaceae which produces viscous eps and hydrophobic lps less contents of smp and lb eps probably reduced filtration resistance of cake layer the reduction of smp and lb eps in cake sludge was probably caused by inhibition of flavobacterium and xanthomonadaceae which are biofilm forming bacteria and eps producers this study suggests that continuous dose of vanillin mitigates biofouling in mbr by interfering microbial activity thereby altering characteristics of sludge eps
