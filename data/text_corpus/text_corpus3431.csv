17155,anaerobic digestion is a commonly used process for the reduction and stabilization of wasted activated sludge generated in wastewater treatment plants however anaerobically digested ad sludge is still a problematic waste stream due to its large volume and often poor quality in this study two aerobic digesters were set up to treat anaerobically digested sludge with one digester operated in self generated acidic condition as the experimental reactor and one at neutral ph as the control reactor the acidic condition in the experimental reactor was driven by an inoculated special ammonia oxidizing bacterium candidatus nitrosoglobus which can tolerate low ph as a result of ammonium oxidation by ca nitrosoglobus the ph decreased to 4 8 0 2 and nitrite accumulated to and stayed at 200 0 17 2 mg n l 1 from which free nitrous acid fna at 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 formed in situ as a combined effect of low ph and high concentration of fna the experimental reactor reduced the total solids ts volatile solids vs and non volatile solids nvs in the ad sludge by 25 2 7 0 29 8 4 3 and 22 6 5 5 respectively in contrast the control reactor without ca nitrosoglobus inoculation operated at a near neutral ph of 6 8 0 3 and no fna formation only reduced vs in the ad sludge by 10 4 4 3 along with negligible nvs reduction additionally the acidic aerobic digestion in the experimental reactor significantly stabilized ad sludge decreasing the specific oxygen uptake rate sour to 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 and the most probable number mpn of faecal coliforms to 2 4 0 1 log mpn g 1ts both of which meet usepa standards for class a biosolids in comparison the control reactor produced biosolids at class b level only with an sour of 1 8 0 2 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 and a faecal coliforms mpn of 3 6 0 1 log mpn g 1ts by reducing the volume and improving the quality of the ad sludge the acidic aerobic digestion of ad sludge enabled by ca nitrosoglobus has the potential to significantly save the sludge disposal costs in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acidic aerobic digestion anaerobic digestion candidatus nitrosoglobus sludge reduction stabilization 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps generate large amounts of wasted activated sludge the sludge transport and disposal incur up to 60 of the overall cost in wwtps canales et al 1994 anaerobic digestion is a commonly used process in large scale wwtps to treat the sludge prior to its disposal which can reduce and stabilize the organic contents in sludge while recovering bioenergy however anaerobic digestion process alone could typically achieve a volatile solids vs reduction efficiency of 30 40 only novak et al 2011 and the quality of the biosolids produced rarely meet the standard for class a biosolids u s epa 40 cfr part 503 regulation therefore multi stage digestion processes have been proposed to enhance sludge reduction and stabilization such as anaerobic aerobic digestion kumar et al 2006 tomei et al 2011a aerobic anaerobic digestion hasegawa et al 2000 pagilla et al 2000 and anaerobic anaerobic digestion demirel and yenig√ºn 2002 rubio loza and noyola 2010 among these processes anaerobic aerobic digestion is the most promising configuration with extensive lab scale investigations kumar et al 2006 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008a 2008b tomei et al 2011a 2011b as well as pilot scale demonstration menniti et al 2010 the post anaerobic aerobic digestion process termed as paad here can further reduce the volume of anaerobically digested ad sludge however the vs reduction achieved through this process is limited to 10 15 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008a 2008b tomei et al 2011b 2011a due to the poor biodegradability of ad sludge several approaches have been proposed to enhance the biodegradability of ad sludge in a paad process for example when operated at mesophilic conditions 37 c 32 vs reduction was achieved on ad sludge tomei et al 2016 ultrasonic pretreatment of ad sludge was shown to improve the vs reduction to 30 40 in the aerobic digestion process song et al 2017 despite the proven effectiveness these methods are energy intensive which limit their practical application potentials recently a study showed that chemical pretreatment with free nitrous acid fna hno2 can effectively enhance the biodegradability of ad sludge leading to 25 30 vs reduction in the paad process wang et al 2016 however the fna pretreatment method would incur extra chemical costs due to the requirement of nitrite and acid dosage these chemical costs can potentially be waived considering both nitrite and acid can be generated through microbial oxidation of the ammonium in ad sludge eq 1 the self sustained nitrite and acid can form in situ fna eq 2 when paad is operated at acidic conditions 1 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o 2 no 2 h hn o 2 fna however a key bottleneck of this acidic paad concept is that common ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob generally get severely inhibited by fna at parts per million ppm level vadivelu et al 2006 thus unable to sustain an in situ high level of fna required for vs destruction the bottleneck could potentially be addressed by the latest discovery of a novel aob genus candidatus nitrosoglobus hayatsu et al 2017 very recently ca nitrosoglobus was found to be extremely tolerant to fna where its ammonium oxidation rate was not affected by the existence of fna up to 8 6 mg hno2 n l 1 wang et al 2021 if ca nitrosoglobus can be used to produce and sustain high level of fna in a paad system the vs reduction of ad sludge could potentially be enhanced significantly without the requirement of external acid and nitrite dosages the acidic paad process can potentially have other benefits such as pathogen removal previous study showed that fna is a strong biocidal agent for many microorganisms jiang et al 2011 thus the acidic paad process could potentially enhance pathogen destruction this study aimed to investigate if ca nitrosoglobus can stably sustain high fna concentration in a paad system leading to acidic paad through which ad sludge can be substantially reduced and stabilized two lab scale paad reactors were set up and operated in parallel for eight months with full scale ad sludge as the feed to establish an acidic paad process a nitrosoglobus containing sludge was used to inoculate one paad reactor set as the experimental reactor the other paad reactor was initially inoculated with normal activated sludge containing common aob nitrosomonas serving as the control reactor after 80 days of operation the nitrosoglobus containing sludge was also added to the control reactor to convert it into an acidic paad reactor acting as a repeated demonstration the study had two specific research objectives 1 to test if the acidic paad process with ppm level of fna accumulation can be established by ca nitrosoglobus to this end ph and nitrogenous compounds concentrations in the reactor were regularly measured 2 to investigate whether the acidic paad process can enhance the reduction and stabilization of ad sludge through monitoring the solids destruction and pathogen reduction performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of sludge the characteristics of the two aob containing aerobic sludge are summarized in table 1 both of these aob containing sludges were collected 250 ml each and thickened to 50 ml before being seeded into r1 and r2 respectively the nitrosoglobus containing aerobic sludge was harvested from a continuous lab scale nitritation reactor fed with real municipal wastewater wang et al 2021 the nitritation reactor was operated at a ph of 4 5 5 0 with a nitrite concentration in the reactor of 77 11 mg n l 1 the in situ fna concentration was 3 0 1 4 mg hno2 n l 1 amplicon sequencing analysis showed that the aob community in the acidic nitritation sludge was exclusively dominated by ca nitrosoglobus with a relative abundance of 1 9 0 1 the nitrosomonas containing aerobic sludge was collected from a local wwtp brisbane australia operated as a conventional modified ludzack ettinger mle process where nitrogen was removed via nitrification denitrification the plant was not designed to incorporate phosphorus removal the wwtp primarily received domestic wastewater at an average flow of 120 000 m3 d 1 amplicon sequencing analysis showed that the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira was about 1 2 0 1 and 3 0 0 2 while no other known nitrifiers were detected the feeding ad sludge used in this study was collected from a full scale anaerobic digester in the same local wwtp mentioned above brisbane australia the ad sludge was collected every week transported to the lab within one hour and stored in a 4 c cold room before fed to the paad reactors the main characteristics of the ad sludge are listed in table 2 2 2 paad reactors set up and operation two paad reactors named as r1 and r2 with a working volume of 650 ml each were set up in an air conditioned lab at a room temperature of 22 1 c r1 and r2 were initially seeded with 50 ml of nitrosoglobus and nitrosomonas contained aerobic sludge respectively then on a daily basis 50 ml of ad sludge was fed into each reactor until the sludge volume in both reactors reached 650 ml afterward 50 ml sludge was wasted daily which preceded the 50 ml feeding this feeding wasting operation resulted in a hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt of 13 days r1 and r2 were constantly aerated with compressed air at 3 l min 1 using an air diffuser giving a dissolved oxygen do concentration higher than 4 mg l 1 mettler toledo switzerland each reactor was equipped with a ph probe tps australia and a transmitter tps australia for ph data acquisition through which the average ph was calculated on a daily basis the ph was not controlled in either reactor both reactors were mixed at 250 rpm with magnetic stirrers r1 and r2 were both operated for 240 days consisting of two phases phase 1 lasted from day 0 to 80 when r1 and r2 were operated in parallel until reaching steady state the steady state performances of r1 and r2 were monitored and compared following the protocol in section 2 3 phase 2 day 81 240 commenced with the inoculation of 50 ml nitrosoglobus contained sludge into r2 in order to replicate the performances of r1 2 3 monitoring protocol the monitoring protocol is summarized here with the detailed methods for each analysis presented in section 2 5 the dissolved nitrogen ammonium nitrite and nitrate

were calculated as with ts as an example tsin tsout tsin 100 where tsin and tsout represent the ts in the feed and discharged sludge respectively during the steady state in phase 1 day 40 to 80 the sludge stabilization levels of r1 and r2 sludges were evaluated by measuring the specific oxygen uptake rate sour and faecal coliforms abundance every 1 2 weeks additionally the particle size distribution and solubilized metal concentrations of the feed r1 and r2 sludges were analysed every 1 2 weeks during this period biomass samples 2 ml each were collected on day 70 and 220 from the two reactors in triplicate and stored in a freezer 80 c for microbial community profiling 2 4 dna extraction amplicon sequencing and data analysis dna was extracted from the biomass samples using fastdna

bieganowski et al 2012 d10 d50 and d90 values were obtained where dx represents the particle size below which x of total volume of particles are contained the homogeneousness of sludge size distribution was evaluated by the span of particle size distribution normalized by the median particle size i e d90 d10 d50 vladisavljevic et al 2004 the smaller the value is the more homogeneously the sludge is distributed 2 5 4 solubilized metal concentrations the solubilized metal concentrations were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer usa

solubilized metal concentrations were determined as the metal concentrations in the solution by icp oes analysis 2 5 5 statistical analysis the statistical significance of results was evaluated by analysis of variance anova p values less than 0 001 0 01 0 05 were summarized with three two and one asterisks respectively 3 results 3 1 establishment of acidic paad by inoculating ca nitrosoglobus 3 1 1 nitrite accumulation at low ph the acidic paad process with fna accumulation was established successively in the two reactors by inoculating ca nitrosoglobus at different time during the reactor operation on day 0 for r1 and day 80 for r2 on day 0 the nitrosoglobus containing sludge was first seeded into r1 as shown in fig 1 a the ph quickly dropped to and stabilized at 4 8 0 2 concomitantly a stable nitrite concentration of 226 19 mg n l 1 was maintained in r1 from day 20 onwards fig 1b as a joint result of low ph and high nitrite concentration fna in r1 built up to 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 fig 1c the ammonium and nitrate concentrations stabilized at 271 11 and 31 8 mg n l 1 fig 1d and e respectively the tin in r1 was 474 37 mg n l 1 throughout the steady period fig f the operation of r2 consisted of two phases phase 1 0 80 and phase 2 80 240 in phase 1 r2 was initially inoculated with nitrosomonas containing aerobic sludge on day 0 the initial 40 day about 3 hrt srt was the start up period the initial ammonium build up fig 1d in r2 was due to the fed batch start up strategy leading to a higher ammonium loading rate than the ammonium oxidation rate the transient nitrite accumulation fig 1b in r2 in this period was likely because of a slower nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob growth rate compared to aob in the beginning both ammonium and nitrite decreased after day 30 suggesting the growth of aob and nob during day 40 80 r2 reached a steady state in this period the ph in r2 stabilized at a near neutral level 6 8 0 3 fig 1a a much lower nitrite concentration 19 10 mg n l 1 than r1 was observed in r2 fig 1b therefore the fna concentration in r2 was negligible 0 01 mg hno2 n l 1 the ammonium nitrate and tin stabilized at 278 13 9 3 and 290 17 mg n l 1 respectively fig 1d f overall r2 which was initially seeded with canonical aob nitrosomonas reached a significantly p 0 001 higher ph lower nitrite lower fna and lower tin compared to r1 inoculated with ca nitrosoglobus fig 1f to confirm the critical role of ca nitrosoglobus in the establishment of acidic paad nitrosoglobus containing sludge was inoculated into r2 on day 80 commencing phase 2 immediately after the inoculation the ph in r2 started to decrease and nitrite began to accumulate the ph and nitrogen profiles of r2 gradually converged to those in r1 after r2 reached steady state from day 130 onwards fig a f statistical comparison of the profiles of ph nitrite and fna between r1 and r2 showed no differences p 0 05 during the steady state of phase 2 day 130 240 collectively these results suggested that the inoculation of ca nitrosoglobus can reproducibly induce acidic ph 4 8 0 2 high level of nitrite 226 19 mg n l 1 and fna accumulation 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 in the paad process fig 1g 3 1 2 nitrogen balance analysis table 3 presents the concentrations of different nitrogenous compounds in the feeding sludge and r1 and r2 sludges in phase 1 and 2 in the steady state of phase 1 day 40 80 the tn concentrations decreased from 1620 146 mg n l 1 in the feeding sludge to 607 32 and 480 33 mg n l 1 in the effluent sludge of r1 and r2 corresponding to a tn removal efficiency of 53 1 6 1 and 70 4 7 7 respectively the substantial loss of nitrogen must have been due to nitrification and denitrification i e the ammonium released via solids breakdown was oxidised to nitrite nitrate which was subsequently converted to n2 via denitrification the higher tn removal efficiency in r2 than r1 suggests denitrification happened to a larger extent in r2 which was responsible the much lower accumulation of nitrite nitrate in r2 nitrogen loss due to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification is common in aerobic sludge digesters operated with high solids concentrations kumar et al 2006 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008 the high solids concentration 10 g mlvss l 1 could limit oxygen transfer within the dense sludge flocs thereby creating micro anoxic zones where denitrification could take place both r1 and r2 had a lower organic n than the feeding sludge 490 217 mg n l 1 showing the occurrence of organic n hydrolysis during the steady state of phase 1 the organic nitrogen concentration 77 40 mg n l 1 in the acidic r1 was much lower than that in the ph neutral r2 190 37 mg n l 1 this result suggests higher organic n hydrolysis in the acidic paad process than the ph neutral one the tkn removal efficiency was 78 4 7 7 in r1 between day 40 80 slightly higher than that in r2 72 1 7 7 indicating higher ammonia oxidation efficiency in r1 the higher ammonium oxidation efficiency was congruent with the lower ph value attained in r1 fig 1a a proton balance involving proton generation via ammonium oxidation proton consumption via denitrification and alkalinity neutralization was presented in the supplementary material nevertheless after the inoculation of ca nitrosoglobus into r2 on day 80 the nitrogen conversion related parameters in r2 all converged to r1 levels during the steady state of phase 2 day 130 240 table 3 3 2 enhanced sludge digestion performances in the acidic paad process 3 2 1 enhanced sludge reduction fig 2 presents the vs and nvs reduction performances of r1 and r2 in the initial 40 days the vs and nvs concentrations in both reactors were gradually building up during the steady state of phase 1 day 40 80 in r1 where the acidic ph and high fna accumulation were established the vs concentration stabilized at 14 0 0 9 g l 1 fig 2a giving an average vs reduction efficiency of 29 8 4 3 fig 2b at the same time in r2 which had near neutral ph and negligible fna accumulation the vs concentration was about 20 1 0 9 g l 1 resulting in an average vs reduction efficiency of 10 4 4 3 besides the nvs reduction efficiency in the acidic r1 was also much higher than that in the ph neutral r2 22 6 5 5 versus nearly 0 fig 2d both vs and nvs reduction were significantly enhanced in r1 compared to r2 p 0 001 fig 2e and 2f as a joint result the ts reduction efficiency in r1 reached 25 2 7 0 which was more than three fold the value in r2 7 2 1 3 following nitrosoglobus inoculation in r2 on day 80 the vs and nvs concentrations and their reduction efficiencies in r2 stabilised at levels similar to r1 fig 2b and 2d the vs and nvs reduction efficiencies of r1 and r2 showed no statistical difference p 0 05 during the steady state of phase 2 fig 2e and 2f collectively these results demonstrated that the vs and nvs reduction of ad sludge were significantly enhanced in an acidic paad process with a lower ph along with fna accumulation 3 2 2 improved sludge stabilization the sludge stabilization levels evaluated by sour and faecal coliforms mpn were compared between r1 and r2 during the steady state of phase 1 the sour decreased from 2 0 0 1 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 in the feed sludge to 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 in r1 and 1 9 0 2 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 in r2 fig 3 a the faecal coliforms level in r1 was at 2 4 0 1 log mpn g 1ts which was reduced by 1 9 log compared to the feed sludge fig 3b in contrast r2 only achieved 0 6 log reduction on faecal coliforms mpn both the sour and faecal coliforms mpn levels of the r1 sludge met the standards for class a biosolids u s epa 40 cfr part 503 regulation while the r2 and feed sludge only fulfilled class b standards the comparison showed that the stability of the ad sludge was significantly improved in an acidic paad process with fna accumulation 3 2 3 enhanced solubilization of inorganic solids the concentrations of soluble metals and metalloids were measured in the r1 r2 and feed sludges during the steady state of phase 1 fig 4 the concentrations of aluminium potassium and sodium displayed comparable levels in the supernatant of r1 and r2 with no statistical differences p 0 05 however the calcium iron magnesium concentrations along with the phosphorous concentration in the supernatant of r1 were significantly higher than those of r2 and feeding sludges p 0 01 suggesting that some of the inorganic solids were solubilized in the acidic paad process the heavy metals such as cu zn pb showed negligible solubilization in both r1 and r2 3 3 particle size distribution particle size distributions of the feed r1 and r2 sludges were measured at the steady state of phase 1 to evaluate the degree of sludge disintegration compared to the feed sludge the particle sizes of r1 sludge decreased substantially while only slight decline was observed for r2 sludge fig 5 a the d10 d50 and d90 values of r1 were significantly lower than those of r2 sludge whereas r2 and feeding sludge showed no statistical differences in these values fig 5b the homogeneousness of sludge size distribution indicated by the span of particle size distribution normalized by the median particle size d90 d10 d50 were determined as 1 8 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 3 0 1 for r1 r2 and feed sludge respectively the smaller span suggested that r1 sludge was more homogeneously distributed than r2 sludge overall the sludge disintegration was intensified in an acidic paad process with fna accumulation 3 4 microbial community analysis amplicon sequencing was performed on r1 and r2 sludge samples collected during the steady state in phase 1 day 70 and phase 2 day 220 the relative abundances of the nitrifying bacteria in these four samples are summarized in table 4 on day 70 ca nitrosoglobus was the only detectable aob in r1 with a relative abundance of 2 2 0 7 whereas no known nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were detected the dominance of ca nitrosoglobus under acidic ph 4 8 0 2 and high fna 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 conditions suggests that ca nitrosoglobus is tolerant to acidic ph and fna in contrast on day 70 the aob community in the ph neutral r2 was dominated by nitrosomonas in addition nitrospira a commonly known nob was also detected however both nitrosomonas and nitrospira disappeared from r2 in the steady state of phase 2 when acidic ph and high fna conditions were established subsequently to the inoculation of nitrosoglobus containing sludge meanwhile ca nitrosoglobus took over and dominated the nitrifying community in r2 the exclusive predominance of ca nitrosoglobus in the nitrifying community strongly suggest that ca nitrosoglobus played a critical role in sustaining the acidic ph and high fna conditions in the paad process after nitrosoglobus containing sludge was added into r2 the richness of the overall microbial community represented by chao1 index decreased from 550 28 on day 70 to 320 21 on day 220 the inoculation also altered the main dominant microorganisms in r2 fig s2 for example xanthomonadaceae which predominated in r2 on day 70 with a relative abundance of 4 7 0 2 completely disappeared on day 220 in contrast the relative abundances of rhodanobacteraceae weeksellaceae mycobacteriaceae and nitrosococcaceae significantly increased in r2 on day 220 compared to day 70 p 0 01 a possible explanation of this microbial community shift is that these microorganisms might adapt to acidic ph and high fna conditions nevertheless the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and require to be further investigated in future studies 4 discussion 4 1 the critical role of ca nitrosoglobus in sustaining the acidic paad this study for the first time established a novel acidic paad process the acidic condition in the paad system was self sustained by microbial ammonium oxidation for which two requirements need to be met low alkalinity to ammonium molar ratio in the feed and prevalence of acid and fna resistant aob ad sludge as feed sludge fulfills the first prerequisite with an alkalinity ammonium ratio of 0 5 0 7 mol caco3 mol 1nh4 n gal√≠ et al 2007 modin et al 2011 this ratio is lower than the stoichiometric ratio of alkalinity ammonia in microbial ammonium oxidation i e 1 mol caco3 consumption per mole nh4 n oxidation therefore ad sludge does not have adequate alkalinity to neutralize the acid generated by the oxidation of ammonium and thereby becomes acidified by the un neutralized protons however fed with the same ad sludge and operated under identical conditions the control reactor was not acidified fig 1a in phase 1 before being inoculated with ca nitrosoglobus previous paad systems also receiving ad sludge with low alkalinity to ammonium ratio have never been reported to achieve self sustained acidic conditions the reason is that the dominant aob therein nitrosomonas prefer to work at neutral ph and cease functioning at ph 6 0 and lower fumasoli et al 2015 in contrast in this study a special acid tolerant aob culture ca nitrosoglobus was inoculated to the digester ca nitrosoglobus was first isolated from agricultural soils and proposed as a new aob genus in 2017 hayatsu et al 2017 our research group recently cultivated a culture containing this aob from a wastewater treatment reactor wang et al 2021 the experimental results verified our hypothesis that the inoculation of this newly known aob would facilitate the establishment of an acidic paad process indeed soon after ca nitrosoglobus was inoculated ph in the paad reactors dropped from neutral to 4 8 0 2 as repetitively demonstrated in this study fig 1a indicating the critical role of ca nitrosoglobus in maintaining acidic ph in the digesters the critical role of ca nitrosoglobus not only manifested in driving the acidic ph but also and more critically in sustaining a high fna concentration at 8 5 1 8 ppm fna is formed from the nitrite and protons produced by aob in acidic condition eq 2 however a ppm level of fna accumulation would not be possible unless the aob can cope with this condition based on the current knowledge ca nitrosoglobus is the only aob known to date that can self sustain the level of fna achieved in this study the conventional aob i e nitrosomonas and nitrosospira would be severely inhibited by fna at ppm levels li et al 2020 vadivelu et al 2006 which was the reason that the microbially attainable fna level in previous literatures was no more than 2 ppm duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 the indispensable role of ca nitrosoglobus was also corroborated by the results of microbial community analysis table 4 showing that ca nitrosoglobus was the only detectable aob when high level of fna existed in a nutshell this study demonstrated ca nitrosoglobus was the crux to the sustained acidic fna condition intentional inoculation of nitrosoglobus contained sludge was adopted in this engineering system for a rapid start up however it should be an interesting research question to reveal whether and how ca nitrosoglobus can be naturally selected under long term paad operation additionally the physiological mechanism of the unique fna resistance of ca nitrosoglobus remains unclear and should be further investigated in future pure culture studies with the use of e g multiple omics tools 4 2 acidic paad system enhances sludge reduction and stabilization the in situ fna sustained by ca nitrosoglobus was likely responsible for the improved vs reduction observed in the acidic paad reactors previous studies showed that short term exposure 1 day to fna 1 0 3 0 mg hno2 n l 1 could effectively lyse sludge wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 indeed in this study the extent of sludge disintegration was intensified in acidic paad reactor compared to the ph neutral paad reactor fig 5 higher degree of sludge disintegration was likely due to breakdown of extracellular polymeric substances and macro molecules in cell envelops by fna chislett et al 2020 this led to the release of more easily biodegradable substances which improved the sludge biodegradability the improved biodegradability subsequently led to the enhanced vs reduction 29 8 4 3 in the acidic paad reactor vs 10 4 4 3 in the control paad reactor fig 2 it should be noted that coinciding with higher fna concentration significantly lower ph and higher nitrite concentration were also observed in the acidic paad reactor fig 1g however low ph around 5 0 and high nitrite up to 50 300 mg n l 1 alone cannot stimulate vs reduction as shown in previous studies pijuan et al 2012 wang et al 2013 therefore high concentration of fna 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 was likely to be the leading factor responsible for the enhanced vs reduction in acidic paad systems apart from vs the nvs reduction efficiency was also significantly enhanced in the acidic paad reactors fig 2 according to the standard methods apha 2012 nvs includes inorganic solids and also organic matters such as some humic and fulvic acids which do not volatilize at 550 c watts et al 1982 the solubilization of some inorganic solids such as carbonates at acidic conditions could have contributed to this loss of nvs here caco3 is used as an example caco3 2 h ca2 co2 h2o while the cations ca2 would become part of nvs during the measurement of ts and vs co3 2 would have been converted to co2 and h2o at acidic conditions neither co2 lost to air through stripping nor h2o would contribute to nvs during the solids measurement as such the solubilization of caco3 would lead to reduction of nvs in order to confirm and quantify the nvs loss due to solubilization of carbonates at acidic ph the ph of the feeding sludge was adjusted from its normal level 7 9 0 2 to 4 8 average ph in r1 by adding hcl an nvs loss of 0 6 0 1 g l 1 was observed between the raw sludge and the acidified sludge with the contribution of added cl to ts taken into consideration this loss of nvs accounts for approximately 40 of the nvs loss in r1 1 5 0 2 g l 1 the gap in nvs reduction could be related to the degradation of non volatile organic compounds during the acidic paad process as our previous studies showed that fna could break down large organic molecules such as humic substances chislett et al 2020 leading to degradation it should be noted that the solubilization of inorganic solids led to significantly higher metal ions concentration in the liquid phase fig 4 these metals ions would precipitate as sludge when returned to the head of wwtp a possible solution is to remove recover the soluble metals from the digestion liquor e g via ph elevation before the liquor is returned to the mainstream system enhanced stabilization of sludge was achieved in the acidic paad system decreased sour of sludge could be linked to the increased vs destruction the higher pathogen removal efficiency observed in the acidic paad process was presumably due to fna it has been reported that ppm level fna pretreatment for 24 h can substantially inactivate pathogen by 2 3 log values in wasted activated sludge meng et al 2020 wei et al 2018 in this study an in situ fna of 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 was self sustained by ammonium oxidation which was inferred to contribute to the 1 9 log pathogen reduction in r1 fig 3b it is noted that the nitrogen removal efficiency of acidic paad reactor was lower than the ph neutral reactor table 3 possibly because the denitrification activity was partially inhibited by nitrite or fna nitrite accumulation in the range of 140 700 mg n l 1 can inhibit the growth of denitrifying bacteria rake and eagon 1980 van verseveld et al 1977 fna can inhibit the activity of denitrifying bacteria with a threshold of 0 04 mg hno2 n l 1 abeling and seyfried 1992 the fna concentration in the acidic paad reactor was far higher than this threshold and thereby likely reduced the denitrification activity in this specific case the reduced denitrification was beneficial due to reduced nitrite consumption and reduced regeneration of alkalinity via denitrification both of which helped to maintain low ph and high level of fna in the reactor 4 3 implications on sludge handling at wwtps by reducing the volume and improving the quality of ad sludge the acidic paad system can significantly reduce the sludge handling costs at wwtps previously a crucial reason restricting the adoption of paad in wwtps is the limited benefits versus expenditures conventional paad processes can achieve only 10 15 vs reduction and negligible nvs reduction novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008a 2008b tomei et al 2011b 2011a which was confirmed by the performance of r2 during phase 1 in this study in comparison the acidic paad process not only doubled the vs reduction but also reduced nvs further by 22 6 5 5 overall the acidic paad process approximately tripled the solids reduction of conventional paad process additionally the quality of biosolids produced by the acidic paad process was also improved achieving the class a standards of pathogen and sour levels u s epa 40 cfr part 503 regulation the improvement to sludge quality i e from class b to class a enables unrestricted biosolids reuse to agricultural lands provided that the heavy metal levels also meet the class a standards see further discussion below which would also substantially reduce the disposal cost for example from aud 60 to aud 30 per wet ton personal communication with local wwtp operators through the solid liquor separation other potential benefits to wwtps could be pursued from the fna rich supernatant generated from the acidic paad process for instance the renewable fna stream can be used for controlling sewer corrosion and odour jiang et al 2017 2015 lessening membrane fouling filloux et al 2015 enhancing energy recovery wang et al 2013 facilitating algae harvesting bai et al 2014 and suppressing nob activity wang et al 2014 it was previously demonstrated that pretreatment via thermal ultrasonic or chemical methods song et al 2017 tomei et al 2016 wang et al 2016 can achieve a comparable vs reduction level of 20 40 on ad sludge thermophilic aerobic digestion process can also effectively inactivate pathogens meeting class a standards liu et al 2012 piterina et al 2012 however these processes require intensive energy or chemical inputs in comparison the acidic paad process can be implemented simply by inoculating paad reactors with a microorganism that can be enriched from ad liquor a direct quantitative comparison of acidic paad with these pretreatment technologies are difficult at present since the results depend on many factors including the characteristic of ad sludge hereby a desktop scaling up study on a wwtp with 800 000 population equivalents was performed to estimate the economic potential of the acidic paad process see supplementary material for details the net benefit of the acidic paad system was estimated to be aud 492 000 per annum compared to the control ph neutral system the saving could be higher up to aud 1 500 00 per annum if considering the biosolid quality improvement from class b to class a therefore the acidic paad bears potential economic attractiveness however it should be highlighted that the current cost benefit analysis is indictive only a rigorous cost benefit analysis of the acidic paad process and a quantitative economic comparison with the existing processes which are difficult at the current lab scale stage should be undertaken after a scaling up study for biosolids toxic heavy metals are also an important concern the acidic paad process achieved negligible solubilization of heavy metals that is likely because the operational ph 4 8 0 2 was higher than the heavy metal leaching inducing ph 2 0 3 0 yet ca nitrosoglobus was shown to maintain ammonium oxidizing capability at ph as low as 2 0 hayatsu et al 2017 therefore it may be possible to operate the acidic paad reactor at a leaching inducing ph to enable heavy metals removal future study is required to optimize the operational ph of the acidic paad process to achieve simultaneous sludge reduction stabilization and heavy metals removal additionally the release of phosphorus at low ph may reduce the value of the biosolids as fertilizers and the p recovery requires further investigations this study was conducted with the full scale ad sludge from a local municipal wwtp brisbane australia it should be noted that the ad sludge characteristics may vary from region to region depending on the local wwtp operating conditions for instance the ammonium concentration can be as low as 200 mg n l 1 in ad sludge personal communication with operators the acidic ph is likely attainable given the low alkalinity ammonium ratio of 0 5 0 7 mol caco3 mol 1nh4 n however the attainable nitrite concentration would be much lower leading to a lower fna concentration under such circumstances the solids destruction and pathogen inactivation performance could be impacted consequently future studies are required to verify the applicability of the acidic paad process to a wide range of ad sludge with varying characteristics 5 conclusion the acidic paad process established by the inoculation of ca nitrosoglobus significantly improved the reduction and stabilization of ad sludge in lab scale acidic paad reactors the reduction of ts vs and nvs achieved by the acidic paad system were 25 2 7 0 29 8 4 3 and 22 6 5 5 respectively the sour and faecal coliforms mpn in the effluent sludge of the acidic paad reactor were 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 and 2 4 0 1 log mpn g 1ts respectively both of which meet the us epa standards for class a biosolids for unrestricted land application the improvements to sludge reduction and stabilization likely resulted from the combination of low ph at 4 8 0 2 and high fna at 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 in the system driven by the acid and fna resistant aob ca nitrosoglobus declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17155,anaerobic digestion is a commonly used process for the reduction and stabilization of wasted activated sludge generated in wastewater treatment plants however anaerobically digested ad sludge is still a problematic waste stream due to its large volume and often poor quality in this study two aerobic digesters were set up to treat anaerobically digested sludge with one digester operated in self generated acidic condition as the experimental reactor and one at neutral ph as the control reactor the acidic condition in the experimental reactor was driven by an inoculated special ammonia oxidizing bacterium candidatus nitrosoglobus which can tolerate low ph as a result of ammonium oxidation by ca nitrosoglobus the ph decreased to 4 8 0 2 and nitrite accumulated to and stayed at 200 0 17 2 mg n l 1 from which free nitrous acid fna at 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 formed in situ as a combined effect of low ph and high concentration of fna the experimental reactor reduced the total solids ts volatile solids vs and non volatile solids nvs in the ad sludge by 25 2 7 0 29 8 4 3 and 22 6 5 5 respectively in contrast the control reactor without ca nitrosoglobus inoculation operated at a near neutral ph of 6 8 0 3 and no fna formation only reduced vs in the ad sludge by 10 4 4 3 along with negligible nvs reduction additionally the acidic aerobic digestion in the experimental reactor significantly stabilized ad sludge decreasing the specific oxygen uptake rate sour to 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 and the most probable number mpn of faecal coliforms to 2 4 0 1 log mpn g 1ts both of which meet usepa standards for class a biosolids in comparison the control reactor produced biosolids at class b level only with an sour of 1 8 0 2 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 and a faecal coliforms mpn of 3 6 0 1 log mpn g 1ts by reducing the volume and improving the quality of the ad sludge the acidic aerobic digestion of ad sludge enabled by ca nitrosoglobus has the potential to significantly save the sludge disposal costs in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acidic aerobic digestion anaerobic digestion candidatus nitrosoglobus sludge reduction stabilization 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps generate large amounts of wasted activated sludge the sludge transport and disposal incur up to 60 of the overall cost in wwtps canales et al 1994 anaerobic digestion is a commonly used process in large scale wwtps to treat the sludge prior to its disposal which can reduce and stabilize the organic contents in sludge while recovering bioenergy however anaerobic digestion process alone could typically achieve a volatile solids vs reduction efficiency of 30 40 only novak et al 2011 and the quality of the biosolids produced rarely meet the standard for class a biosolids u s epa 40 cfr part 503 regulation therefore multi stage digestion processes have been proposed to enhance sludge reduction and stabilization such as anaerobic aerobic digestion kumar et al 2006 tomei et al 2011a aerobic anaerobic digestion hasegawa et al 2000 pagilla et al 2000 and anaerobic anaerobic digestion demirel and yenig√ºn 2002 rubio loza and noyola 2010 among these processes anaerobic aerobic digestion is the most promising configuration with extensive lab scale investigations kumar et al 2006 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008a 2008b tomei et al 2011a 2011b as well as pilot scale demonstration menniti et al 2010 the post anaerobic aerobic digestion process termed as paad here can further reduce the volume of anaerobically digested ad sludge however the vs reduction achieved through this process is limited to 10 15 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008a 2008b tomei et al 2011b 2011a due to the poor biodegradability of ad sludge several approaches have been proposed to enhance the biodegradability of ad sludge in a paad process for example when operated at mesophilic conditions 37 c 32 vs reduction was achieved on ad sludge tomei et al 2016 ultrasonic pretreatment of ad sludge was shown to improve the vs reduction to 30 40 in the aerobic digestion process song et al 2017 despite the proven effectiveness these methods are energy intensive which limit their practical application potentials recently a study showed that chemical pretreatment with free nitrous acid fna hno2 can effectively enhance the biodegradability of ad sludge leading to 25 30 vs reduction in the paad process wang et al 2016 however the fna pretreatment method would incur extra chemical costs due to the requirement of nitrite and acid dosage these chemical costs can potentially be waived considering both nitrite and acid can be generated through microbial oxidation of the ammonium in ad sludge eq 1 the self sustained nitrite and acid can form in situ fna eq 2 when paad is operated at acidic conditions 1 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o 2 no 2 h hn o 2 fna however a key bottleneck of this acidic paad concept is that common ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob generally get severely inhibited by fna at parts per million ppm level vadivelu et al 2006 thus unable to sustain an in situ high level of fna required for vs destruction the bottleneck could potentially be addressed by the latest discovery of a novel aob genus candidatus nitrosoglobus hayatsu et al 2017 very recently ca nitrosoglobus was found to be extremely tolerant to fna where its ammonium oxidation rate was not affected by the existence of fna up to 8 6 mg hno2 n l 1 wang et al 2021 if ca nitrosoglobus can be used to produce and sustain high level of fna in a paad system the vs reduction of ad sludge could potentially be enhanced significantly without the requirement of external acid and nitrite dosages the acidic paad process can potentially have other benefits such as pathogen removal previous study showed that fna is a strong biocidal agent for many microorganisms jiang et al 2011 thus the acidic paad process could potentially enhance pathogen destruction this study aimed to investigate if ca nitrosoglobus can stably sustain high fna concentration in a paad system leading to acidic paad through which ad sludge can be substantially reduced and stabilized two lab scale paad reactors were set up and operated in parallel for eight months with full scale ad sludge as the feed to establish an acidic paad process a nitrosoglobus containing sludge was used to inoculate one paad reactor set as the experimental reactor the other paad reactor was initially inoculated with normal activated sludge containing common aob nitrosomonas serving as the control reactor after 80 days of operation the nitrosoglobus containing sludge was also added to the control reactor to convert it into an acidic paad reactor acting as a repeated demonstration the study had two specific research objectives 1 to test if the acidic paad process with ppm level of fna accumulation can be established by ca nitrosoglobus to this end ph and nitrogenous compounds concentrations in the reactor were regularly measured 2 to investigate whether the acidic paad process can enhance the reduction and stabilization of ad sludge through monitoring the solids destruction and pathogen reduction performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of sludge the characteristics of the two aob containing aerobic sludge are summarized in table 1 both of these aob containing sludges were collected 250 ml each and thickened to 50 ml before being seeded into r1 and r2 respectively the nitrosoglobus containing aerobic sludge was harvested from a continuous lab scale nitritation reactor fed with real municipal wastewater wang et al 2021 the nitritation reactor was operated at a ph of 4 5 5 0 with a nitrite concentration in the reactor of 77 11 mg n l 1 the in situ fna concentration was 3 0 1 4 mg hno2 n l 1 amplicon sequencing analysis showed that the aob community in the acidic nitritation sludge was exclusively dominated by ca nitrosoglobus with a relative abundance of 1 9 0 1 the nitrosomonas containing aerobic sludge was collected from a local wwtp brisbane australia operated as a conventional modified ludzack ettinger mle process where nitrogen was removed via nitrification denitrification the plant was not designed to incorporate phosphorus removal the wwtp primarily received domestic wastewater at an average flow of 120 000 m3 d 1 amplicon sequencing analysis showed that the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira was about 1 2 0 1 and 3 0 0 2 while no other known nitrifiers were detected the feeding ad sludge used in this study was collected from a full scale anaerobic digester in the same local wwtp mentioned above brisbane australia the ad sludge was collected every week transported to the lab within one hour and stored in a 4 c cold room before fed to the paad reactors the main characteristics of the ad sludge are listed in table 2 2 2 paad reactors set up and operation two paad reactors named as r1 and r2 with a working volume of 650 ml each were set up in an air conditioned lab at a room temperature of 22 1 c r1 and r2 were initially seeded with 50 ml of nitrosoglobus and nitrosomonas contained aerobic sludge respectively then on a daily basis 50 ml of ad sludge was fed into each reactor until the sludge volume in both reactors reached 650 ml afterward 50 ml sludge was wasted daily which preceded the 50 ml feeding this feeding wasting operation resulted in a hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt of 13 days r1 and r2 were constantly aerated with compressed air at 3 l min 1 using an air diffuser giving a dissolved oxygen do concentration higher than 4 mg l 1 mettler toledo switzerland each reactor was equipped with a ph probe tps australia and a transmitter tps australia for ph data acquisition through which the average ph was calculated on a daily basis the ph was not controlled in either reactor both reactors were mixed at 250 rpm with magnetic stirrers r1 and r2 were both operated for 240 days consisting of two phases phase 1 lasted from day 0 to 80 when r1 and r2 were operated in parallel until reaching steady state the steady state performances of r1 and r2 were monitored and compared following the protocol in section 2 3 phase 2 day 81 240 commenced with the inoculation of 50 ml nitrosoglobus contained sludge into r2 in order to replicate the performances of r1 2 3 monitoring protocol the monitoring protocol is summarized here with the detailed methods for each analysis presented in section 2 5 the dissolved nitrogen ammonium nitrite and nitrate

were calculated as with ts as an example tsin tsout tsin 100 where tsin and tsout represent the ts in the feed and discharged sludge respectively during the steady state in phase 1 day 40 to 80 the sludge stabilization levels of r1 and r2 sludges were evaluated by measuring the specific oxygen uptake rate sour and faecal coliforms abundance every 1 2 weeks additionally the particle size distribution and solubilized metal concentrations of the feed r1 and r2 sludges were analysed every 1 2 weeks during this period biomass samples 2 ml each were collected on day 70 and 220 from the two

1 1 nitrite accumulation at low ph the acidic paad process with fna accumulation was established successively in the two reactors by inoculating ca nitrosoglobus at different time during the reactor operation on day 0 for r1 and day 80 for r2 on day 0 the nitrosoglobus containing sludge was first seeded into r1 as shown in fig 1 a the ph quickly dropped to and stabilized at 4 8 0 2 concomitantly a stable nitrite concentration of 226 19 mg n l 1 was maintained in r1 from day 20 onwards fig 1b as a joint result of low ph and high nitrite concentration fna in r1 built up to 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 fig 1c the ammonium and nitrate concentrations stabilized at 271 11 and 31 8 mg n l 1 fig 1d and e respectively the tin in r1 was 474 37 mg n l 1 throughout the steady period fig f the operation of r2 consisted of two phases phase 1 0 80 and phase 2 80 240 in phase 1 r2 was initially inoculated with nitrosomonas containing aerobic sludge on day 0 the initial 40 day about 3 hrt srt was the start up period the initial ammonium build up fig 1d in r2 was due to the fed batch start up strategy leading to a higher ammonium loading rate than the ammonium oxidation rate the transient nitrite accumulation fig 1b in r2 in this period was likely because of a slower nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob growth rate compared to aob in the beginning both ammonium and nitrite decreased after day 30 suggesting the growth of aob and nob during day 40 80 r2 reached a steady state in this period the ph in r2 stabilized at a near neutral level 6 8 0 3 fig 1a a much lower nitrite concentration 19 10 mg n l 1 than r1 was observed in r2 fig 1b therefore the fna concentration in r2 was negligible 0 01 mg hno2 n l 1 the ammonium nitrate and tin stabilized at 278 13 9 3 and 290 17 mg n l 1 respectively fig 1d f overall r2 which was initially seeded with canonical aob nitrosomonas reached a significantly p 0 001 higher ph lower nitrite lower fna and lower tin compared to r1 inoculated with ca nitrosoglobus fig 1f to confirm the critical role of ca nitrosoglobus in the establishment of acidic paad nitrosoglobus containing sludge was inoculated into r2 on day 80 commencing phase 2 immediately after the inoculation the ph in r2 started to decrease and nitrite began to accumulate the ph and nitrogen profiles of r2 gradually converged to those in r1 after r2 reached steady state from day 130 onwards fig a f statistical comparison of the profiles of ph nitrite and fna between r1 and r2 showed no differences p 0 05 during the steady state of phase 2 day 130 240 collectively these results suggested that the inoculation of ca nitrosoglobus can reproducibly induce acidic ph 4 8 0 2 high level of nitrite 226 19 mg n l 1 and fna accumulation 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 in the paad process fig 1g 3 1 2 nitrogen balance analysis table 3 presents the concentrations of different nitrogenous compounds in the feeding sludge and r1 and r2 sludges in phase 1 and 2 in the steady state of phase 1 day 40 80 the tn concentrations decreased from 1620 146 mg n l 1 in the feeding sludge to 607 32 and 480 33 mg n l 1 in the effluent sludge of r1 and r2 corresponding to a tn removal efficiency of 53 1 6 1 and 70 4 7 7 respectively the substantial loss of nitrogen must have been due to nitrification and denitrification i e the ammonium released via solids breakdown was oxidised to nitrite nitrate which was subsequently converted to n2 via denitrification the higher tn removal efficiency in r2 than r1 suggests denitrification happened to a larger extent in r2 which was responsible the much lower accumulation of nitrite nitrate in r2 nitrogen loss due to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification is common in aerobic sludge digesters operated with high solids concentrations kumar et al 2006 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008 the high solids concentration 10 g mlvss l 1 could limit oxygen transfer within the dense sludge flocs thereby creating micro anoxic zones where denitrification could take place both r1 and r2 had a lower organic n than the feeding sludge 490 217 mg n l 1 showing the occurrence of organic n hydrolysis during the steady state of phase 1 the organic nitrogen concentration 77 40 mg n l 1 in the acidic r1 was much lower than that in the ph neutral r2 190 37 mg n l 1 this result suggests higher organic n hydrolysis in the acidic paad process than the ph neutral one the tkn removal efficiency was 78 4 7 7 in r1 between day 40 80 slightly higher than that in r2 72 1 7 7 indicating higher ammonia oxidation efficiency in r1 the higher ammonium oxidation efficiency was congruent with the lower ph value attained in r1 fig 1a a proton balance involving proton generation via ammonium oxidation proton consumption via denitrification and alkalinity neutralization was presented in the supplementary material nevertheless after the inoculation of ca nitrosoglobus into r2 on day 80 the nitrogen conversion related parameters in r2 all converged to r1 levels during the steady state of phase 2 day 130 240 table 3 3 2 enhanced sludge digestion performances in the acidic paad process 3 2 1 enhanced sludge reduction fig 2 presents the vs and nvs reduction performances of r1 and r2 in the initial 40 days the vs and nvs concentrations in both reactors were gradually building up during the steady state of phase 1 day 40 80 in r1 where the acidic ph and high fna accumulation were established the vs concentration stabilized at 14 0 0 9 g l 1 fig 2a giving an average vs reduction efficiency of 29 8 4 3 fig 2b at the same time in r2 which had near neutral ph and negligible fna accumulation the vs concentration was about 20 1 0 9 g l 1 resulting in an average vs reduction efficiency of 10 4 4 3 besides the nvs reduction efficiency in the acidic r1 was also much higher than that in the ph neutral r2 22 6 5 5 versus nearly 0 fig 2d both vs and nvs reduction were significantly enhanced in r1 compared to r2 p 0 001 fig 2e and 2f as a joint result the ts reduction efficiency in r1 reached 25 2 7 0 which was more than three fold the value in r2 7 2 1 3 following nitrosoglobus inoculation in r2 on day 80 the vs and nvs concentrations and their reduction efficiencies in r2 stabilised at levels similar to r1 fig 2b and 2d the vs and nvs reduction efficiencies of r1 and r2 showed no statistical difference p 0 05 during the steady state of phase 2 fig 2e and 2f collectively these results demonstrated that the vs and nvs reduction of ad sludge were significantly enhanced in an acidic paad process with a lower ph along with fna accumulation 3 2 2 improved sludge stabilization the sludge stabilization levels evaluated by sour and faecal coliforms mpn were compared between r1 and r2 during the steady state of phase 1 the sour decreased from 2 0 0 1 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 in the feed sludge to 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 in r1 and 1 9 0 2 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 in r2 fig 3 a the faecal coliforms level in r1 was at 2 4 0 1 log mpn g 1ts which was reduced by 1 9 log compared to the feed sludge fig 3b in contrast r2 only achieved 0 6 log reduction on faecal coliforms mpn both the sour and faecal coliforms mpn levels of the r1 sludge met the standards for class a biosolids u s epa 40 cfr part 503 regulation while the r2 and feed sludge only fulfilled class b standards the comparison showed that the stability of the ad sludge was significantly improved in an acidic paad process with fna accumulation 3 2 3 enhanced solubilization of inorganic solids the concentrations of soluble metals and metalloids were measured in the r1 r2 and feed sludges during the steady state of phase 1 fig 4 the concentrations of aluminium potassium and sodium displayed comparable levels in the supernatant of r1 and r2 with no statistical differences p 0 05 however the calcium iron magnesium concentrations along with the phosphorous concentration in the supernatant of r1 were significantly higher than those of r2 and feeding sludges p 0 01 suggesting that some of the inorganic solids were solubilized in the acidic paad process the heavy metals such as cu zn pb showed negligible solubilization in both r1 and r2 3 3 particle size distribution particle size distributions of the feed r1 and r2 sludges were measured at the steady state of phase 1 to evaluate the degree of sludge disintegration compared to the feed sludge the particle sizes of r1 sludge decreased substantially while only slight decline was observed for r2 sludge fig 5 a the d10 d50 and d90 values of r1 were significantly lower than those of r2 sludge whereas r2 and feeding sludge showed no statistical differences in these values fig 5b the homogeneousness of sludge size distribution indicated by the span of particle size distribution normalized by the median particle size d90 d10 d50 were determined as 1 8 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 3 0 1 for r1 r2 and feed sludge respectively the smaller span suggested that r1 sludge was more homogeneously distributed than r2 sludge overall the sludge disintegration was intensified in an acidic paad process with fna accumulation 3 4 microbial community analysis amplicon sequencing was performed on r1 and r2 sludge samples collected during the steady state in phase 1 day 70 and phase 2 day 220 the relative abundances of the nitrifying bacteria in these four samples are summarized in table 4 on day 70 ca nitrosoglobus was the only detectable aob in r1 with a relative abundance of 2 2 0 7 whereas no known nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were detected the dominance of ca nitrosoglobus under acidic ph 4 8 0 2 and high fna 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 conditions suggests that ca nitrosoglobus is tolerant to acidic ph and fna in contrast on day 70 the aob community in the ph neutral r2 was dominated by nitrosomonas in addition nitrospira a commonly known nob was also detected however both nitrosomonas and nitrospira disappeared from r2 in the steady state of phase 2 when acidic ph and high fna conditions were established subsequently to the inoculation of nitrosoglobus containing sludge meanwhile ca nitrosoglobus took over and dominated the nitrifying community in r2 the exclusive predominance of ca nitrosoglobus in the nitrifying community strongly suggest that ca nitrosoglobus played a critical role in sustaining the acidic ph and high fna conditions in the paad process after nitrosoglobus containing sludge was added into r2 the richness of the overall microbial community represented by chao1 index decreased from 550 28 on day 70 to 320 21 on day 220 the inoculation also altered the main dominant microorganisms in r2 fig s2 for example xanthomonadaceae which predominated in r2 on day 70 with a relative abundance of 4 7 0 2 completely disappeared on day 220 in contrast the relative abundances of rhodanobacteraceae weeksellaceae mycobacteriaceae and nitrosococcaceae significantly increased in r2 on day 220 compared to day 70 p 0 01 a possible explanation of this microbial community shift is that these microorganisms might adapt to acidic ph and high fna conditions nevertheless the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and require to be further investigated in future studies 4 discussion 4 1 the critical role of ca nitrosoglobus in sustaining the acidic paad this study for the first time established a novel acidic paad process the acidic condition in the paad system was self sustained by microbial ammonium oxidation for which two requirements need to be met low alkalinity to ammonium molar ratio in the feed and prevalence of acid and fna resistant aob ad sludge as feed sludge fulfills the first prerequisite with an alkalinity ammonium ratio of 0 5 0 7 mol caco3 mol 1nh4 n gal√≠ et al 2007 modin et al 2011 this ratio is lower than the stoichiometric ratio of alkalinity ammonia in microbial ammonium oxidation i e 1 mol caco3 consumption per mole nh4 n oxidation therefore ad sludge does not have adequate alkalinity to neutralize the acid generated by the oxidation of ammonium and thereby becomes acidified by the un neutralized protons however fed with the same ad sludge and operated under identical conditions the control reactor was not acidified fig 1a in phase 1 before being inoculated with ca nitrosoglobus previous paad systems also receiving ad sludge with low alkalinity to ammonium ratio have never been reported to achieve self sustained acidic conditions the reason is that the dominant aob therein nitrosomonas prefer to work at neutral ph and cease functioning at ph 6 0 and lower fumasoli et al 2015 in contrast in this study a special acid tolerant aob culture ca nitrosoglobus was inoculated to the digester ca nitrosoglobus was first isolated from agricultural soils and proposed as a new aob genus in 2017 hayatsu et al 2017 our research group recently cultivated a culture containing this aob from a wastewater treatment reactor wang et al 2021 the experimental results verified our hypothesis that the inoculation of this newly known aob would facilitate the establishment of an acidic paad process indeed soon after ca nitrosoglobus was inoculated ph in the paad reactors dropped from neutral to 4 8 0 2 as repetitively demonstrated in this study fig 1a indicating the critical role of ca nitrosoglobus in maintaining acidic ph in the digesters the critical role of ca nitrosoglobus not only manifested in driving the acidic ph but also and more critically in sustaining a high fna concentration at 8 5 1 8 ppm fna is formed from the nitrite and protons produced by aob in acidic condition eq 2 however a ppm level of fna accumulation would not be possible unless the aob can cope with this condition based on the current knowledge ca nitrosoglobus is the only aob known to date that can self sustain the level of fna achieved in this study the conventional aob i e nitrosomonas and nitrosospira would be severely inhibited by fna at ppm levels li et al 2020 vadivelu et al 2006 which was the reason that the microbially attainable fna level in previous literatures was no more than 2 ppm duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 the indispensable role of ca nitrosoglobus was also corroborated by the results of microbial community analysis table 4 showing that ca nitrosoglobus was the only detectable aob when high level of fna existed in a nutshell this study demonstrated ca nitrosoglobus was the crux to the sustained acidic fna condition intentional inoculation of nitrosoglobus contained sludge was adopted in this engineering system for a rapid start up however it should be an interesting research question to reveal whether and how ca nitrosoglobus can be naturally selected under long term paad operation additionally the physiological mechanism of the unique fna resistance of ca nitrosoglobus remains unclear and should be further investigated in future pure culture studies with the use of e g multiple omics tools 4 2 acidic paad system enhances sludge reduction and stabilization the in situ fna sustained by ca nitrosoglobus was likely responsible for the improved vs reduction observed in the acidic paad reactors previous studies showed that short term exposure 1 day to fna 1 0 3 0 mg hno2 n l 1 could effectively lyse sludge wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 indeed in this study the extent of sludge disintegration was intensified in acidic paad reactor compared to the ph neutral paad reactor fig 5 higher degree of sludge disintegration was likely due to breakdown of extracellular polymeric substances and macro molecules in cell envelops by fna chislett et al 2020 this led to the release of more easily biodegradable substances which improved the sludge biodegradability the improved biodegradability subsequently led to the enhanced vs reduction 29 8 4 3 in the acidic paad reactor vs 10 4 4 3 in the control paad reactor fig 2 it should be noted that coinciding with higher fna concentration significantly lower ph and higher nitrite concentration were also observed in the acidic paad reactor fig 1g however low ph around 5 0 and high nitrite up to 50 300 mg n l 1 alone cannot stimulate vs reduction as shown in previous studies pijuan et al 2012 wang et al 2013 therefore high concentration of fna 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 was likely to be the leading factor responsible for the enhanced vs reduction in acidic paad systems apart from vs the nvs reduction efficiency was also significantly enhanced in the acidic paad reactors fig 2 according to the standard methods apha 2012 nvs includes inorganic solids and also organic matters such as some humic and fulvic acids which do not volatilize at 550 c watts et al 1982 the solubilization of some inorganic solids such as carbonates at acidic conditions could have contributed to this loss of nvs here caco3 is used as an example caco3 2 h ca2 co2 h2o while the cations ca2 would become part of nvs during the measurement of ts and vs co3 2 would have been converted to co2 and h2o at acidic conditions neither co2 lost to air through stripping nor h2o would contribute to nvs during the solids measurement as such the solubilization of caco3 would lead to reduction of nvs in order to confirm and quantify the nvs loss due to solubilization of carbonates at acidic ph the ph of the feeding sludge was adjusted from its normal level 7 9 0 2 to 4 8 average ph in r1 by adding hcl an nvs loss of 0 6 0 1 g l 1 was observed between the raw sludge and the acidified sludge with the contribution of added cl to ts taken into consideration this loss of nvs accounts for approximately 40 of the nvs loss in r1 1 5 0 2 g l 1 the gap in nvs reduction could be related to the degradation of non volatile organic compounds during the acidic paad process as our previous studies showed that fna could break down large organic molecules such as humic substances chislett et al 2020 leading to degradation it should be noted that the solubilization of inorganic solids led to significantly higher metal ions concentration in the liquid phase fig 4 these metals ions would precipitate as sludge when returned to the head of wwtp a possible solution is to remove recover the soluble metals from the digestion liquor e g via ph elevation before the liquor is returned to the mainstream system enhanced stabilization of sludge was achieved in the acidic paad system decreased sour of sludge could be linked to the increased vs destruction the higher pathogen removal efficiency observed in the acidic paad process was presumably due to fna it has been reported that ppm level fna pretreatment for 24 h can substantially inactivate pathogen by 2 3 log values in wasted activated sludge meng et al 2020 wei et al 2018 in this study an in situ fna of 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 was self sustained by ammonium oxidation which was inferred to contribute to the 1 9 log pathogen reduction in r1 fig 3b it is noted that the nitrogen removal efficiency of acidic paad reactor was lower than the ph neutral reactor table 3 possibly because the denitrification activity was partially inhibited by nitrite or fna nitrite accumulation in the range of 140 700 mg n l 1 can inhibit the growth of denitrifying bacteria rake and eagon 1980 van verseveld et al 1977 fna can inhibit the activity of denitrifying bacteria with a threshold of 0 04 mg hno2 n l 1 abeling and seyfried 1992 the fna concentration in the acidic paad reactor was far higher than this threshold and thereby likely reduced the denitrification activity in this specific case the reduced denitrification was beneficial due to reduced nitrite consumption and reduced regeneration of alkalinity via denitrification both of which helped to maintain low ph and high level of fna in the reactor 4 3 implications on sludge handling at wwtps by reducing the volume and improving the quality of ad sludge the acidic paad system can significantly reduce the sludge handling costs at wwtps previously a crucial reason restricting the adoption of paad in wwtps is the limited benefits versus expenditures conventional paad processes can achieve only 10 15 vs reduction and negligible nvs reduction novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008a 2008b tomei et al 2011b 2011a which was confirmed by the performance of r2 during phase 1 in this study in comparison the acidic paad process not only doubled the vs reduction but also reduced nvs further by 22 6 5 5 overall the acidic paad process approximately tripled the solids reduction of conventional paad process additionally the quality of biosolids produced by the acidic paad process was also improved achieving the class a standards of pathogen and sour levels u s epa 40 cfr part 503 regulation the improvement to sludge quality i e from class b to class a enables unrestricted biosolids reuse to agricultural lands provided that the heavy metal levels also meet the class a standards see further discussion below which would also substantially reduce the disposal cost for example from aud 60 to aud 30 per wet ton personal communication with local wwtp operators through the solid liquor separation other potential benefits to wwtps could be pursued from the fna rich supernatant generated from the acidic paad process for instance the renewable fna stream can be used for controlling sewer corrosion and odour jiang et al 2017 2015 lessening membrane fouling filloux et al 2015 enhancing energy recovery wang et al 2013 facilitating algae harvesting bai et al 2014 and suppressing nob activity wang et al 2014 it was previously demonstrated that pretreatment via thermal ultrasonic or chemical methods song et al 2017 tomei et al 2016 wang et al 2016 can achieve a comparable vs reduction level of 20 40 on ad sludge thermophilic aerobic digestion process can also effectively inactivate pathogens meeting class a standards liu et al 2012 piterina et al 2012 however these processes require intensive energy or chemical inputs in comparison the acidic paad process can be implemented simply by inoculating paad reactors with a microorganism that can be enriched from ad liquor a direct quantitative comparison of acidic paad with these pretreatment technologies are difficult at present since the results depend on many factors including the characteristic of ad sludge hereby a desktop scaling up study on a wwtp with 800 000 population equivalents was performed to estimate the economic potential of the acidic paad process see supplementary material for details the net benefit of the acidic paad system was estimated to be aud 492 000 per annum compared to the control ph neutral system the saving could be higher up to aud 1 500 00 per annum if considering the biosolid quality improvement from class b to class a therefore the acidic paad bears potential economic attractiveness however it should be highlighted that the current cost benefit analysis is indictive only a rigorous cost benefit analysis of the acidic paad process and a quantitative economic comparison with the existing processes which are difficult at the current lab scale stage should be undertaken after a scaling up study for biosolids toxic heavy metals are also an important concern the acidic paad process achieved negligible solubilization of heavy metals that is likely because the operational ph 4 8 0 2 was higher than the heavy metal leaching inducing ph 2 0 3 0 yet ca nitrosoglobus was shown to maintain ammonium oxidizing capability at ph as low as 2 0 hayatsu et al 2017 therefore it may be possible to operate the acidic paad reactor at a leaching inducing ph to enable heavy metals removal future study is required to optimize the operational ph of the acidic paad process to achieve simultaneous sludge reduction stabilization and heavy metals removal additionally the release of phosphorus at low ph may reduce the value of the biosolids as fertilizers and the p recovery requires further investigations this study was conducted with the full scale ad sludge from a local municipal wwtp brisbane australia it should be noted that the ad sludge characteristics may vary from region to region depending on the local wwtp operating conditions for instance the ammonium concentration can be as low as 200 mg n l 1 in ad sludge personal communication with operators the acidic ph is likely attainable given the low alkalinity ammonium ratio of 0 5 0 7 mol caco3 mol 1nh4 n however the attainable nitrite concentration would be much lower leading to a lower fna concentration under such circumstances the solids destruction and pathogen inactivation performance could be impacted consequently future studies are required to verify the applicability of the acidic paad process to a wide range of ad sludge with varying characteristics 5 conclusion the acidic paad process established by the inoculation of ca nitrosoglobus significantly improved the reduction and stabilization of ad sludge in lab scale acidic paad reactors the reduction of ts vs and nvs achieved by the acidic paad system were 25 2 7 0 29 8 4 3 and 22 6 5 5 respectively the sour and faecal coliforms mpn in the effluent sludge of the acidic paad reactor were 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g 1vs h 1 and 2 4 0 1 log mpn g 1ts respectively both of which meet the us epa standards for class a biosolids for unrestricted land application the improvements to sludge reduction and stabilization likely resulted from the combination of low ph at 4 8 0 2 and high fna at 8 5 1 8 mg hno2 n l 1 in the system driven by the acid and fna resistant aob ca nitrosoglobus declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17156,methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o are the most powerful greenhouse gases globally recent emissions exceed previous estimates the potential link between n2o reduction and ch4 oxidation in anoxic wetland sediments would be a sink for both gases which has attracted broad attention to explore the simultaneous n2o and ch4 biotransformation wetland sediments were used to inoculate an enrichment reactor continuously fed with ch4 and n2o for 500 days after enrichment the ch4 oxidation rate reached 2 8 Œºmol g 1 dw d 1 which was 800 fold higher than the rate of the wetland sediments used as inoculum moreover stable isotopic tracing proved ch4 oxidation was driven by n2o consumption under anoxic conditions genomic sequencing showed that the microbial community was dominated by methanotrophs species of methylocaldum genus belonging to Œ≥ proteobacteria class were significantly enriched and became the predominant methanotrophs quantitative analysis indicated methane monooxygenase and nitrous oxide reductase increased by 38 and 8 fold compared to the inoculum as to the potential mechanisms we propose that n2o driven ch4 oxidation was mediated by aerobic methanotrophs solely or along with denitrifying bacteria under hypoxia electrons and energy are generated and transferred in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway our findings expand the range of

methanotroph s was observed in freshwater wetland sediments in our recent study eq 3 cheng et al 2019 meanwhile lower gibbs free energy illustrated by eq 3 indicates potential coupling of n2o

one way analysis of variance anova was used to perform all statistical analyses the results were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of the enriched culture although interest in amo has increased recently martinez cruz et al 2018 shen et al 2019 xie et al 2018 so far little attention has been given to the potential association between n2o reduction and ch4 oxidation coupled ch4 and n2o biotransformation has been proposed in a freshwater wetland sediment after a 7 day anoxic incubation assay cheng et al 2019 however the transformation mechanism was unclear in the present study an enriched culture obtained using a wetland sediment as inoculum was used to explore the role of n2o in ch4 oxidation under anoxic conditions basic parameters of headspace gas and culture supernatant were monitored as illustrated in fig 2 and tables 1 s3 the enrichment reactor started up with ch4 and n2o concentrations of 4 95 Œºm and 16 94 Œºm respectively fig 2 then the n2o concentration was gradually increased and kept at 33 to 99 ŒºŒº considering nitrate or nitrite could be electron acceptors zhu et al 2016 the concentration of nitrate and nitrite was monitored the initial concentration of nitrate and nitrite was 1 0 0 3 mg l and 0 5 0 1 mg l respectively which could be regarded as accumulated nitrogen in wetland sediments hansen et al 2018 nitrate and nitrite were almost depleted 0 1 mg l before day 180 from day 180 nitrate and nitrite dependent amo was excluded as nitrate and nitrite were almost undetected in the culture liquid phase fig 2 the anoxic conditions were strictly maintained ts decreased from 13 7 0 3 mg l on day 60 to 10 7 0 3 mg l on day 240 there was no obvious change of ts measured on day 310 a culture sample was withdrawn on day 320 for further molecular analysis ts was 11 3 0 3 mg l after 420 d of incubation to directly analyze gas changes during incubation the gas composition was monitored during one 24 h cycle fig 3 illustrates four typical cycles conducted before day 180 fig 3a b between day 180 and 320 fig 3c and after day 320 fig 3d for all cycles ch4 and n2o concentrations were higher and stable because gas was supplied at a constant rate during the stirring period consumption of ch4 and n2o could not be directly evaluated because gases were added continuously however the produced co2 may be an indicator of amo increased co2 concertation was observed in day 60 cycle fig 3a however the co2 increase cannot be attributed to n2o and ch4 for that low nitrate or nitrite concentrations were measured a decrease of the co2 concentration was observed in day 175 cycle 40 3 3 7 mg l compared to that in day 60 cycle 63 5 6 3 mg l there are two possible reasons for the observed decrease on the one hand nitrite and nitrate were almost depleted on day 175 resulting in loss of electron acceptors for amo shen et al 2019 the other reason may be the decreased biomass concentration as illustrated in fig 2 notably a continuous increase of n2o concentration was observed in day 175 cycle which may have enhanced the enrichment of n2o utilizing microorganisms combined with the results illustrated in fig 2 the microbial community analysis of day 180 culture sample was essential relatively stable gas concentrations of co2 ch4 and n2o were observed both in day 300 and day 421 cycles however the concentration of the three gases was different the co2 concentration was higher on day 421 66 7 11 5 mg l than on day 300 51 2 5 8 mg l conversely the concentration of both n2o and ch4 on day 421 60 1 4 2 mg l and 54 7 8 7 mg l was lower than on day 300 101 4 13 2 mg l and 90 5 13 9 mg l respectively the difference could be attributed to culture enrichment the higher co2 and lower n2o and ch4 concentrations on day 421 compared to day 300 imply a higher extent of amo by the culture besides increased co2 concentration observed within the first 6 h of the 24 h cycle is likely attributed to n2o driven ch4 oxidation to further explore the transformation mechanism a methane oxidation rate test as well as isotope labelled experiments were conducted using the enriched culture 3 2 isotopic tracing of methane transformation the enrichment medium contained 1 25 g l potassium bicarbonate which is a possible source of co2 to distinguish the co2 produced as a result of ch4 oxidation an isotope labeling experiment was performed in triplicate using 13ch4 to trace carbon fig 1b Œ¥13c measurements of headspace gas and liquid samples initially and after a 24 h incubation are shown in fig 4 remarkably the greatest 13c depletions from 11 6 0 74 to 68 10 10 97 were observed in the experimental ch4 n2o vials fig 4a the significant increase of Œ¥13c indicates that the produced co2 was derived from 13c labeled ch4 indicating a strong contribution of amo the control ch4 series also had 13c depleted carbon isotopic compositions but they were not as strong as those observed in the experimental ch4 n2o series the difference in 13c depletion between the experimental and control series indicates the involvement of n2o in ch4 oxidation the reason for the observed low 13c depletion in the control ch4 series could not be determined unidentified electron acceptor s may drive amo as proposed by gupta et al 2013 who found amo rates were not correlated with added concentrations of known electron acceptors nitrate sulfate ferric iron etc the specific mechanism of amo is not fully known and the potential electron acceptors require further study cui et al 2015 it is possible that humic substances in the culture served as the electron acceptor s when the n2o concentration was low bai et al 2019 valenzuela et al 2020 meanwhile Œ¥13c values in co2 remained within background levels in the blank and control n2o series indicating that 13co2 was not produced without the addition of 13ch4 the pattern of Œ¥ 13c depletions in liquid samples quantified as dissolved 13co2 fig 4b agree with headspace Œ¥ 13c changes indicating that amo did occur in the experimental ch4 n2o series and n2o greatly promoted this process isotope labelling unambiguously shows that ch4 can be oxidized under anoxic conditions and is linked to n2o reduction these results are comparable to those obtained with other electron acceptors for amo such as manganese and iron dependent marine amo as well as nitrite dependent wetlands amo martinez cruz et al 2017 sander et al 2015 haroon et al 2013 used both 13c labelled ch4 and 15n labelled nitrate to perform nitrate dependent amo in an archaeal lineage 15n labelled or 18o labelled isotopic n2o testing was not possible in the present study as 15n2 18o was not available due to safety issues high risk of combustion or explosion however oxygen and another nitrogen source were strictly controlled during the entire study firstly the do level in culture liquid was monitored both in the enrichment reactor and the vials used for the batch isotopic experiments secondly 13co2 was not formed in the series not amended with n2o all together these results demonstrate that the n2o driven amo process is likely a previously overlooked simultaneous n2o and ch4 sink in wetland sediments 3 3 enhanced methane oxidation rate culture samples were used to determine the consumption of n2o and ch4 under experimental well controlled conditions fig 5 a decrease in headspace n2o and ch4 concentrations was observed in the experimental ch4 n2o series while their concentrations were relatively constant in the control and blank series the gas change rates in the methane oxidation batch experiment are listed in table s4 the ch4 depletion rate ranged from 20 2 to 31 3 Œºmol l 1 d 1 and that of n2o was from 4 4 to 23 4 Œºmol l 1 d 1 in the experimental ch4 n2o series normalized to the culture dry weight the ch4 depletion rate reached 2 8 Œºmol g 1 dw d 1 compared to the previously measured ch4 depletion rate in the same wetland sediment without enrichment 3 4 0 1 nmol co2 g 1 dw d 1 cheng et al 2019 the ch4 depletion rate increased by more than 800 fold after the long term enrichment a similar rate 45 6 Œºmol l 1 d 1 has been reported in a manganese dependent amo culture after 434 d enrichment leu et al 2020 the maximum rate of nitrite dependent amo was only 61 0 nmol co2 g 1 dw d 1 in sandy riverbeds shen et al 2019 in lake sediments reported amo rates ranged from 0 01 to 100 Œºmol l 1 d 1 martinez cruz et al 2017 martinez cruz et al 2018 the difference in reported amo rates is attributed to the type of electron acceptor s as well as the microbial community diversity martinez cruz et al 2017 notably the mole ratio of n2o depletion to ch4 depletion was ca 0 38 table s4 which is one tenth of the theoretical value of 4 eq 3 this difference is attributed to the difference in aqueous solubility between n2o and ch4 the henry s law constant of n2o 2 4 10 4 mol m 3 pa 1 is nearly 10 times higher than that of ch4 1 4 10 5 mol m 3 pa 1 table s5 sander 2015 thus a large portion of n2o is dissolved in the liquid phase due to its higher solubility than ch4 concentrations of ch4 and n2o in the liquid phase were calculated according to the equations illustrated in text s2 assuming gas liquid phase equilibrium the mean measured ratio was 4 25 n2o to ch4 in the liquid phase table s6 which is comparable to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 4 this is evidence of simultaneous n2o reduction and ch4 oxidation in previous studies on amo the mole ratio of reactants or products was also calculated for example the measured ratio of ch4 cr vi in cr vi dependent methane oxidation was about 0 326 0 352 which is comparable to the theoretical value of 0 375 lu et al 2016 in nitrite dependent methane oxidation the measured stoichiometric ratio of ch4 n2 was 3 3 87 which is comparable to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 3 4 ettwig et al 2010 3 4 microbial community structure changes dna illumina sequencing of inoculum and enriched culture samples removed on day 180 r 180 d 320 r 320 d and 500 r 500 d along with real time quantitative pcr were carried out lower bacterial diversity was found in culture samples than the inoculum the shannon index values of r 180 d 5 57 r 320 d 6 25 and r 500 d 5 97 were lower than for the inoculum 7 93 table s7 s8 the species which survived during the long term enrichment are regarded as likely to be involved in n2o driven amo in both inoculum and culture samples proteobacteria were the predominant phylum fig 6 c proteobacteria were also detected with a greater relative abundance after 500 d enrichment which increased from 56 8 to 67 7 further analysis of the relative class and order abundance shows Œ≥ proteobacteria became the dominant proteobacteria during enrichment fig s2 the highest order was methylococcales which represented 68 5 of the respective Œ≥ proteobacteria in the enriched culture on day 500 fig s3 it should be noted that type i aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria which mainly belong to methylococcales have been reported to be involved in amo cabrol et al 2020 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 the abundance and activity of aerobic methanotrophs under hypoxia has attracted attention in the field of methane oxidation after kits et al 2015 proposed ame d could be accomplished by a Œ≥ proteobacterial methanotroph methylomonas denitrificans sp nov strain fjg1 maintained under low oxygen conditions kits et al 2015 siniscalchi et al 2017 besides methylobacter Œ≥ proteobacteria has been identified as the microorganism involved in amo in sub arctic lake sediments martinez cruz et al 2017 furthermore recently zheng et al 2020 demonstrated the methylomonas genus Œ≥ proteobacteria coupled ch4 oxidation with ferrihydrite reduction under hypoxia thus aerobic methanotrophs is likely to survive and use ch4 as carbon and energy sources under anoxic conditions in the present study methylococcales was dominated by species of the genus methylocaldum representing 85 4 of methylococcales order in the r 500 d culture sample fig 6d to identify the main microorganisms after the long term enrichment clone library analysis was conducted with the day 500 dna sample fig 6b as shown in the phylogenetic tree five clusters were assigned including a main cluster showing a high similarity to methylocaldum sp dr65 93 5 94 7 identity another main cluster cluster iii showed a very high similarity 98 5 98 7 to an uncultured Œ≥ proteobactium clone which is affiliated with the genus methylobacter sequences of cluster ii were less similar to methylocaldum having 91 4 92 4 identity sequences of these three clusters could be assigned as one group which belongs to methylococcaceae family these results are in good accordance with the above analyses of illumina sequencing therefore methylocaldum and methylobacter genus were the dominant methanotrophic members in this community which can use ch4 as the sole source of carbon and energy bodrossy et al 1997 active methylobacter type methanotrophs have previously been found under anoxic conditions and were considered to be involved in ch4 oxidation oswald et al 2016 zhu et al 2012 detected methylcaldum sp in an enriched nitrite dependent methane oxidizing culture methylocaldum related species were also shown to be involved in ch4 oxidation occurring in a sealed down flow hanging sponge reactor hatamoto et al 2010 considering nc10 phylum and archaea anme 2d may participate in amo deutzmann et al 2014 we also investigated their sequences at the phylum level however nc10 phylum or anme 2d family were not involved in n2o driven ch4 oxidation thus aerobic methanotrophs are likely involved in the ch4 oxidation pathway rather than reverse methanogenesis nazaries et al 2013 3 5 potential metabolic pathway and implications of n2o driven ch4 oxidation to figure out how methanotroph act under n2o amendment in the enriched culture predicted functional analysis was performed and metabolic maps were annotated mapped in kegg database table 2 s9 fig s4 as is well known type i methanotrophs utilize the ribulose monophosphate rump cycle to assimilate formaldehyde hcoh in the inner membrane anthony 1982 then electrons are generated and transferred in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway of inner membrane between the cytoplasm and periplasm it should be noted that the complete methane oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation pathway were annotated by genomic sequencing table 2 fig s4 thus it is important to elucidate how electrons are transferred from choh metabolism to n2o reduction n2o reduction is the final step of denitrification zhi and ji 2014 according to electron transport chain etc in denitrification electrons are transferred to nitrate reductase via ubiquinols uq or to nitrite and nitrous oxide reductase nosz via uq and cytochrome cyt c fig s5 chen and strous 2013 therefore the sequencing data were further examined for denitrifying bacteria although not dominant in the enriched culture microbial community the relative abundance of the genus thauera under rhodocyclales order and phaeodactylibacter under sphingobacteriales order was 8 34 and 3 20 respectively and were the most abundant denitrifying bacteria fig 6d it is well known that n2o is reduced by nitrous oxide reductase nosz stres et al 2004 the gene amplified from thauera strain tn9 had the highest similarity 95 with nosz gene indicating thauera species contribute to the observed reduction of n2o yang et al 2013 besides sphingobacteriales was also involved in n2o reduction in a sequencing batch reactor and a moving bed biofilm reactor gabarr√≥ et al 2013 torresi et al 2018 based on all of the above discussed results type i methanotrophs and nitrous oxide reductase are involved in n2o driven amo a quantitative analysis of functional gene changes was essential to verify this supposition methane monooxygenase subunit a pmoa indicates presence of aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria dedysh et al 2004 the change in the abundance of 16s rrna nosz and pmoa genes is shown in fig 6a notably the gene pmoa significantly increased from 1 29 1011 copies g dry weight in the inoculum to 5 02 1012 copies g dry weight on 500 d over 38 fold higher the gene nosz increased from 2 43 1011 copies g dry weight in the inoculum to 1 92 1012 copies g dry weight on 500 d nearly 8 fold higher the abundance of pmoa and nosz is consistent with the results of microbial community structure of the enriched culture especially on day 500 however nosz transcripts could be detected in methanotrophs dumont et al 2013 partial denitrification activities have been reported in methylomonas denitrificans fjg1 kits et al 2015 thus it is uncertain whether denitrifying bacteria participate in the simultaneous ch4 oxidation and n2o reduction methanotrophs may solely mediate the process of simultaneous n2o reduction and ch4 oxidation based on the above discussed results we propose a metabolic pathway of n2o driven methane oxidation under anoxic conditions fig 7 in this pathway methanotrophs solely or along with denitrifying bacteria are considered to play an important role in the simultaneous ch4 and n2o transformation ch4 is oxidized by pmoa to methanol ch3oh which is then converted by methanol dehydrogenase mdhl to hcoh in the case of methanotrophs solely mediating the process electrons could be generated and then transferred by uq and cytochromes in the inner membrane between cytoplasm and periplasm finally nosz accepts electrons from cytochrome c and reduces n2o to n2 meanwhile choh is oxidized by glutathione independent formaldehyde dehydrogenase fdha to formic acid chooh which is then converted by formate dehydrogenase fdh to co2 in the case of methanotrophs and denitrifying bacteria working together to carry out the process the electron transport may be more complex valenzuela et al 2020 proposed electrons could not be directly transported between ch4 oxidizing and n2o reducing microorganisms while humic substances could mediate the coupled biotransformation in wetland sediments besides some soluble organic intermediates e g flavin mononucleotide fmn riboflavin etc secreted by the microorganisms may act as electron shuttles light et al 2018 due to the complexity of interspecies electron transfer future research and development on the simultaneous ch4 and n2o biotransformation pathway are needed in all the proposed new pathway linking ch4 and n2o expands our knowledge of the carbon and nitrogen cycles in wetland sediments fig 8 n2o driven amo is a potential sink of both ch4 and n2o in wetlands which has been previously overlooked it is of great ecological significance not only for the reduction of ch4 and n2o emissions two potent greenhouse gases but also by assigning a new role of aerobic methanotrophs under hypoxia therefore the contribution of methanotrophs to the reduction of global ch4 emissions should be reconsidered for their biotransformation capacity under hypoxia besides as ch4 was the sole organic carbon source in the present study the observed survival and enrichment as well as activity of denitrifiers should be further explored meanwhile nitrate and or nitrite dependent amo may affect the occurrence of coupled ch4 and n2o biotransformation in natural environments thus connections between microbial pathways would be a meaningful future research 4 conclusions the process of n2o driven ch4 oxidation under anoxic conditions is considered to be a potential sink of two important greenhouse gases after 500 d of enrichment the ch4 oxidation rate increased over 800 fold compared to the wetland sediment inoculum moreover methanotrophs and denitrifiers increased by 38 and 8 fold while species of the methylocaldum genus became the predominant methanotrophs stable isotopic tracing proved ch4 oxidation was driven by n2o consumption the process is considered to be carried out by aerobic methanotrophs solely or along with denitrifying bacteria under hypoxia these findings contribute to a better understanding of electron acceptors associated with ch4 oxidation as well as the link of carbon and nitrogen cycles author contributions the manuscript was written through

17156,methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o are the most powerful greenhouse gases globally recent emissions exceed previous estimates the potential link between n2o reduction and ch4 oxidation in anoxic wetland sediments would be a sink for both gases which has attracted broad attention to explore the simultaneous n2o and ch4 biotransformation wetland sediments were used to inoculate an enrichment reactor continuously fed with ch4 and n2o for 500 days after enrichment the ch4 oxidation rate reached 2 8 Œºmol g 1 dw d 1 which was 800 fold higher than the rate of the wetland sediments used as inoculum moreover stable isotopic tracing proved ch4 oxidation was driven by n2o consumption under anoxic conditions genomic sequencing showed that the microbial community was dominated by methanotrophs species of methylocaldum genus belonging to Œ≥ proteobacteria class were significantly enriched and became the predominant methanotrophs quantitative analysis indicated methane monooxygenase and nitrous oxide reductase increased by 38 and 8 fold compared to the inoculum as to the potential mechanisms we propose that n2o driven ch4 oxidation was mediated by aerobic methanotrophs solely or along with denitrifying bacteria under hypoxia electrons and energy are generated and transferred in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway our findings expand the range of electron acceptors associated with ch4 oxidation as well as elucidate the significant role of methanotrophs relative to both carbon and nitrogen cycles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wetland sediments methane oxidation methanotrophs nitrous oxide denitrification 1 introduction methane ch4 is a potent greenhouse gas which is 25 fold more effective in trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide co2 on a per molecule basis marotta et al 2014 emissions of atmospheric ch4 from freshwater habitats like natural wetlands and rice fields are as much as 103 tg ch4 year 1 bastviken et al 2011 chen et al 2020 wetlands represent the largest source accounting for 62 of the natural ch4 budget nazaries et al 2013 to control global atmospheric ch4 flux it is important to reduce ch4 emissions from wetlands in general most ch4 is formed in deep sediment anaerobic zones and oxidized before it reaches the atmosphere gupta et al 2013 methane oxidation is classified as either aerobic methane oxidation or anaerobic methane oxidation amo depending on the level of involved oxygen kits et al 2015 martinez cruz et al 2018 shen et al 2019 xie et al 2018 so far reduction of sulfate nitrite nitrate manganese or iron ion has been reported to be coupled to amo under anoxic conditions sivan et al 2014 wu et al 2019 for the ocean over 90 of ch4 is consumed by amo using sulfate as electron acceptor knittel and boetius 2009 for fresh water amo coupled to denitrification amo d has been proposed since 2004 and has received massive attention because amo d simultaneously impacts both carbon and nitrogen two elements of global importance cai et al 2019 islas lima et al 2004 nitrous oxide n2o is an intermediate compound in the classic denitrification pathway however n2o was thought to indirectly participate in ch4 oxidation for that it was undetected during amo d eqs 1 2 angle et al 2017 ettwig et al 2010 zhu et al 2016 n2o is a highly potent greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming 310 fold warming potential higher than co2 a dominant ozone layer depleting substance jia et al 2020 thus it is necessary to clarify the role of n2o in the

nitrite driven amo which involves intracellularly generated oxygen mediated by the nc10 phylum of bacteria and the other pathway is reverse methanogenesis mediated by methanotrophic archaea ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 recently aerobic methanotrophs such as the methylomonas and methylosinus genera have been demonstrated to couple ch4 oxidation to mineral reduction under hypoxia zheng et al 2020 this discovery expanded our knowledge of ch4 oxidation under anoxic conditions coincidentally kits et al 2015 proposed methylomonas denitrificans sp nov strain fjg1t an aerobic methanotroph which couples ch4 consumption to nitrate removal where n2o was released as a final product interestingly simultaneous biotransformation of ch4 and n2o carried out by unidentified methanotroph s was observed in freshwater wetland sediments in our recent study eq 3 cheng et al 2019 meanwhile lower gibbs free energy illustrated by eq 3 indicates potential coupling of n2o reduction to ch4 oxidation therefore it is necessary to further clarify the role of n2o in amo especially the metabolic pathway of coupled ch4 and n2o biotransformation under anoxic conditions as well as the bacterial species involved 3 ch4 4n2o co2 4n2 2h2o go 1232 4 kj mol ch4 to discern the role of n2o in amo we enriched a mixed culture from a wetland sediment with continuous supply of ch4 and

community was monitored by real time pcr rt pcr 16s rrna gene illumina sequencing and 16s adenine a thiamine t clone library analysis atcla overall the findings of this study have significant ecological implications related to the attenuation of two major greenhouse gases in the global carbon and nitrogen cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and enrichment sediment samples upper 10

one way analysis of variance anova was used to perform all statistical analyses the results were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of the enriched culture although interest in amo has increased recently martinez cruz et al 2018 shen et al 2019 xie et al 2018 so far little attention has been given to the potential association between n2o reduction and ch4 oxidation coupled ch4 and n2o biotransformation has been proposed in a freshwater wetland sediment after a 7 day anoxic incubation assay cheng et al 2019 however the transformation mechanism was unclear in the present study an enriched culture obtained using a wetland sediment as inoculum was used to explore the role of n2o in ch4 oxidation under anoxic conditions basic parameters of headspace gas and culture supernatant were monitored as illustrated in fig 2 and tables 1 s3 the enrichment reactor started up with ch4 and n2o concentrations of 4 95 Œºm and 16 94 Œºm respectively fig 2 then the n2o concentration was gradually increased and kept at 33 to 99 ŒºŒº considering nitrate or nitrite could be electron acceptors zhu et al 2016 the concentration of nitrate and nitrite was monitored the initial concentration of nitrate and nitrite was 1 0 0 3 mg l and 0 5 0 1 mg l respectively which could be regarded as accumulated nitrogen in wetland sediments hansen et al 2018 nitrate and nitrite were almost depleted 0 1 mg l before day 180 from day 180 nitrate and nitrite dependent amo was excluded as nitrate and nitrite were almost undetected in the culture liquid phase fig 2 the anoxic conditions were strictly maintained ts decreased from 13 7 0 3 mg l on day 60 to 10 7 0 3 mg l on day 240 there was no obvious change of ts measured on day 310 a culture sample was withdrawn on day 320 for further molecular analysis ts was 11 3 0 3 mg l after 420 d of incubation to directly analyze gas changes during incubation the gas composition was monitored during one 24 h cycle fig 3 illustrates four typical cycles conducted before day 180 fig 3a b between day 180 and 320 fig 3c and after day 320 fig 3d for all cycles ch4 and n2o concentrations were higher and stable because gas was supplied at a constant rate during the stirring period consumption of ch4 and n2o could not be directly evaluated because gases were added continuously however the produced co2 may be an indicator of amo increased co2 concertation was observed in day 60 cycle fig 3a however the co2 increase cannot be attributed to n2o and ch4 for that low nitrate or nitrite concentrations were measured a decrease of the co2 concentration was observed in day 175 cycle 40 3 3 7 mg l compared to that in day 60 cycle 63 5 6 3 mg l there are two possible reasons for the observed decrease on the one hand nitrite and nitrate were almost depleted on day 175 resulting in loss of electron acceptors for amo shen et al 2019 the other reason may be the decreased biomass concentration as illustrated in fig 2 notably a continuous increase of n2o concentration was observed in day 175 cycle which may have enhanced the enrichment of n2o utilizing microorganisms combined with the results illustrated in fig 2 the microbial community analysis of day 180 culture sample was essential relatively stable gas concentrations of co2 ch4 and n2o were observed both in day 300 and day 421 cycles however the concentration of the three gases was different the co2 concentration was higher on day 421 66 7 11 5 mg l than on day 300 51 2 5 8 mg l conversely the concentration of both n2o and ch4 on day 421 60 1 4 2 mg l and 54 7 8 7 mg l was lower than on day 300 101 4 13 2 mg l and 90 5 13 9 mg l respectively the difference could be attributed to culture enrichment the higher co2 and lower n2o and ch4 concentrations on day 421 compared to day 300 imply a higher extent of amo by the culture besides increased co2 concentration observed within the first 6 h of the 24 h cycle is likely attributed to n2o driven ch4 oxidation to further explore the transformation mechanism a methane oxidation rate test as well as isotope labelled experiments were conducted using the enriched culture 3 2 isotopic tracing of methane transformation the enrichment medium contained 1 25 g l potassium bicarbonate which is a possible source of co2 to distinguish the co2 produced as a result of ch4 oxidation an isotope labeling experiment was performed in triplicate using 13ch4 to trace carbon fig 1b Œ¥13c measurements of headspace gas and liquid samples initially and after a 24 h incubation are shown in fig 4 remarkably the greatest 13c depletions from 11 6 0 74 to 68 10 10 97 were observed in the experimental ch4 n2o vials fig 4a the significant increase of Œ¥13c indicates that the produced co2 was derived from 13c labeled ch4 indicating a strong contribution of amo the control ch4 series also had 13c depleted carbon isotopic compositions but they were not as strong as those observed in the experimental ch4 n2o series the difference in 13c depletion between the experimental and control series indicates the involvement of n2o in ch4 oxidation the reason for the observed low 13c depletion in the control ch4 series could not be determined unidentified electron acceptor s may drive amo as proposed by gupta et al 2013 who found amo rates were not correlated with added concentrations of known electron acceptors nitrate sulfate ferric iron etc the specific mechanism of amo is not fully known and the potential electron acceptors require further study cui et al 2015 it is possible that humic substances in the culture served as the electron acceptor s when the n2o concentration was low bai et al 2019 valenzuela et al 2020 meanwhile Œ¥13c values in co2 remained within background levels in the blank and control n2o series indicating that 13co2 was not produced without the addition of 13ch4 the pattern of Œ¥ 13c depletions in liquid samples quantified as dissolved 13co2 fig 4b agree with headspace Œ¥ 13c changes indicating that amo did occur in the experimental ch4 n2o series and n2o greatly promoted this process isotope labelling unambiguously shows that ch4 can be oxidized under anoxic conditions and is linked to n2o reduction these results are comparable to those obtained with other electron acceptors for amo such as manganese and iron dependent marine amo as well as nitrite dependent wetlands amo martinez cruz et al 2017 sander et al 2015 haroon et al 2013 used both 13c labelled ch4 and 15n labelled nitrate to perform nitrate dependent amo in an archaeal lineage 15n labelled or 18o labelled isotopic n2o testing was not possible in the present study as 15n2 18o was not available due to safety issues high risk of combustion or explosion however oxygen and another nitrogen source were strictly controlled during the entire study firstly the do level in culture liquid was monitored both in the enrichment reactor and the vials used for the batch isotopic experiments secondly 13co2 was not formed in the series not amended with n2o all together these results demonstrate that the n2o driven amo process is likely a previously overlooked simultaneous n2o and ch4 sink in wetland sediments 3 3 enhanced methane oxidation rate culture samples were used to determine the consumption of n2o and ch4 under experimental well controlled conditions fig 5 a decrease in headspace n2o and ch4 concentrations was observed in the experimental ch4 n2o series while their concentrations were relatively constant in the control and blank series the gas change rates in the methane oxidation batch experiment are listed in table s4 the ch4 depletion rate ranged from 20 2 to 31 3 Œºmol l 1 d 1 and that of n2o was from 4 4 to 23 4 Œºmol l 1 d 1 in the experimental ch4 n2o series normalized to the culture dry weight the ch4 depletion rate reached 2 8 Œºmol g 1 dw d 1 compared to the previously measured ch4 depletion rate in the same wetland sediment without enrichment 3 4 0 1 nmol co2 g 1 dw d 1 cheng et al 2019 the ch4 depletion rate increased by more than 800 fold after the long term enrichment a similar rate 45 6 Œºmol l 1 d 1 has been reported in a manganese dependent amo culture after 434 d enrichment leu et al 2020 the maximum rate of nitrite dependent amo was only 61 0 nmol co2 g 1 dw d 1 in sandy riverbeds shen et al 2019 in lake sediments reported amo rates ranged from 0 01 to 100 Œºmol l 1 d 1 martinez cruz et al 2017 martinez cruz et al 2018 the difference in reported amo rates is attributed to the type of electron acceptor s as well as the microbial community diversity martinez cruz et al 2017 notably the mole ratio of n2o depletion to ch4 depletion was ca 0 38 table s4 which is one tenth of the theoretical value of 4 eq 3 this difference is attributed to the difference in aqueous solubility between n2o and ch4 the henry s law constant of n2o 2 4 10 4 mol m 3 pa 1 is nearly 10 times higher than that of ch4 1 4 10 5 mol m 3 pa 1 table s5 sander 2015 thus a large portion of n2o is dissolved in the liquid phase due to its higher solubility than ch4 concentrations of ch4 and n2o in the liquid phase were calculated according to the equations illustrated in text s2 assuming gas liquid phase equilibrium the mean measured ratio was 4 25 n2o to ch4 in the liquid phase table s6 which is comparable to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 4 this is evidence of simultaneous n2o reduction and ch4 oxidation in previous studies on amo the mole ratio of reactants or products was also calculated for example the measured ratio of ch4 cr vi in cr vi dependent methane oxidation was about 0 326 0 352 which is comparable to the theoretical value of 0 375 lu et al 2016 in nitrite dependent methane oxidation the measured stoichiometric ratio of ch4 n2 was 3 3 87 which is comparable to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 3 4 ettwig et al 2010 3 4 microbial community structure changes dna illumina sequencing of inoculum and enriched culture samples removed on day 180 r 180 d 320 r 320 d and 500 r 500 d along with real time quantitative pcr were carried out lower bacterial diversity was found in culture samples than the inoculum the shannon index values of r 180 d 5 57 r 320 d 6 25 and r 500 d 5 97 were lower than for the inoculum 7 93 table s7 s8 the species which survived during the long term enrichment are regarded as likely to be involved in n2o driven amo in both inoculum and culture samples proteobacteria were the predominant phylum fig 6 c proteobacteria were also detected with a greater relative abundance after 500 d enrichment which increased from 56 8 to 67 7 further analysis of the relative class and order abundance shows Œ≥ proteobacteria became the dominant proteobacteria during enrichment fig s2 the highest order was methylococcales which represented 68 5 of the respective Œ≥ proteobacteria in the enriched culture on day 500 fig s3 it should be noted that type i aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria which mainly belong to methylococcales have been reported to be involved in amo cabrol et al 2020 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 the abundance and activity of aerobic methanotrophs under hypoxia has attracted attention in the field of methane oxidation after kits et al 2015 proposed ame d could be accomplished by a Œ≥ proteobacterial methanotroph methylomonas denitrificans sp nov strain fjg1 maintained under low oxygen conditions kits et al 2015 siniscalchi et al 2017 besides methylobacter Œ≥ proteobacteria has been identified as the microorganism involved in amo in sub arctic lake sediments martinez cruz et al 2017 furthermore recently zheng et al 2020 demonstrated the methylomonas genus Œ≥ proteobacteria coupled ch4 oxidation with ferrihydrite reduction under hypoxia thus aerobic methanotrophs is likely to survive and use ch4 as carbon and energy sources under anoxic conditions in the present study methylococcales was dominated by species of the genus methylocaldum representing 85 4 of methylococcales order in the r 500 d culture sample fig 6d to identify the main microorganisms after the long term enrichment clone library analysis was conducted with the day 500 dna sample fig 6b as shown in the phylogenetic tree five clusters were assigned including a main cluster showing a high similarity to methylocaldum sp dr65 93 5 94 7 identity another main cluster cluster iii showed a very high similarity 98 5 98 7 to an uncultured Œ≥ proteobactium clone which is affiliated with the genus methylobacter sequences of cluster ii were less similar to methylocaldum having 91 4 92 4 identity sequences of these three clusters could be assigned as one group which belongs to methylococcaceae family these results are in good accordance with the above analyses of illumina sequencing therefore methylocaldum and methylobacter genus were the dominant methanotrophic members in this community which can use ch4 as the sole source of carbon and energy bodrossy et al 1997 active methylobacter type methanotrophs have previously been found under anoxic conditions and were considered to be involved in ch4 oxidation oswald et al 2016 zhu et al 2012 detected methylcaldum sp in an enriched nitrite dependent methane oxidizing culture methylocaldum related species were also shown to be involved in ch4 oxidation occurring in a sealed down flow hanging sponge reactor hatamoto et al 2010 considering nc10 phylum and archaea anme 2d may participate in amo deutzmann et al 2014 we also investigated their sequences at the phylum level however nc10 phylum or anme 2d family were not involved in n2o driven ch4 oxidation thus aerobic methanotrophs are likely involved in the ch4 oxidation pathway rather than reverse methanogenesis nazaries et al 2013 3 5 potential metabolic pathway and implications of n2o driven ch4 oxidation to figure out how methanotroph act under n2o amendment in the enriched culture predicted functional analysis was performed and metabolic maps were annotated mapped in kegg database table 2 s9 fig s4 as is well known type i methanotrophs utilize the ribulose monophosphate rump cycle to assimilate formaldehyde hcoh in the inner membrane anthony 1982 then electrons are generated and transferred in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway of inner membrane between the cytoplasm and periplasm it should be noted that the complete methane oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation pathway were annotated by genomic sequencing table 2 fig s4 thus it is important to elucidate how electrons are transferred from choh metabolism to n2o reduction n2o reduction is the final step of denitrification zhi and ji 2014 according to electron transport chain etc in denitrification electrons are transferred to nitrate reductase via ubiquinols uq or to nitrite and nitrous oxide reductase nosz via uq and cytochrome cyt c fig s5 chen and strous 2013 therefore the sequencing data were further examined for denitrifying bacteria although not dominant in the enriched culture microbial community the relative abundance of the genus thauera under rhodocyclales order and phaeodactylibacter under sphingobacteriales order was 8 34 and 3 20 respectively and were the most abundant denitrifying bacteria fig 6d it is well known that n2o is reduced by nitrous oxide reductase nosz stres et al 2004 the gene amplified from thauera strain tn9 had the highest similarity 95 with nosz gene indicating thauera species contribute to the observed reduction of n2o yang et al 2013 besides sphingobacteriales was also involved in n2o reduction in a sequencing batch reactor and a moving bed biofilm reactor gabarr√≥ et al 2013 torresi et al 2018 based on all of the above discussed results type i methanotrophs and nitrous oxide reductase are involved in n2o driven amo a quantitative analysis of functional gene changes was essential to verify this supposition methane monooxygenase subunit a pmoa indicates presence of aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria dedysh et al 2004 the change in the abundance of 16s rrna nosz and pmoa genes is shown in fig 6a notably the gene pmoa significantly increased from 1 29 1011 copies g dry weight in the inoculum to 5 02 1012 copies g dry weight on 500 d over 38 fold higher the gene nosz increased from 2 43 1011 copies g dry weight in the inoculum to 1 92 1012 copies g dry weight on 500 d nearly 8 fold higher the abundance of pmoa and nosz is consistent with the results of microbial community structure of the enriched culture especially on day 500 however nosz transcripts could be detected in methanotrophs dumont et al 2013 partial denitrification activities have been reported in methylomonas denitrificans fjg1 kits et al 2015 thus it is uncertain whether denitrifying bacteria participate in the simultaneous ch4 oxidation and n2o reduction methanotrophs may solely mediate the process of simultaneous n2o reduction and ch4 oxidation based on the above discussed results we propose a metabolic pathway of n2o driven methane oxidation under anoxic conditions fig 7 in this pathway methanotrophs solely or along with denitrifying bacteria are considered to play an important role in the simultaneous ch4 and n2o transformation ch4 is oxidized by pmoa to methanol ch3oh which is then converted by methanol dehydrogenase mdhl to hcoh in the case of methanotrophs solely mediating the process electrons could be generated and then transferred by uq and cytochromes in the inner membrane between cytoplasm and periplasm finally nosz accepts electrons from cytochrome c and reduces n2o to n2 meanwhile choh is oxidized by glutathione independent formaldehyde dehydrogenase fdha to formic acid chooh which is then converted by formate dehydrogenase fdh to co2 in the case of methanotrophs and denitrifying bacteria working together to carry out the process the electron transport may be more complex valenzuela et al 2020 proposed electrons could not be directly transported between ch4 oxidizing and n2o reducing microorganisms while humic substances could mediate the coupled biotransformation in wetland sediments besides some soluble organic intermediates e g flavin mononucleotide fmn riboflavin etc secreted by the microorganisms may act as electron shuttles light et al 2018 due to the complexity of interspecies electron transfer future research and development on the simultaneous ch4 and n2o biotransformation pathway are needed in all the proposed new pathway linking ch4 and n2o expands our knowledge of the carbon and nitrogen cycles in wetland sediments fig 8 n2o driven amo is a potential sink of both ch4 and n2o in wetlands which has been previously overlooked it is of great ecological significance not only for the reduction of ch4 and n2o emissions two potent greenhouse gases but also by assigning a new role of aerobic methanotrophs under hypoxia therefore the contribution of methanotrophs to the reduction of global ch4 emissions should be reconsidered for their biotransformation capacity under hypoxia besides as ch4 was the sole organic carbon source in the present study the observed survival and enrichment as well as activity of denitrifiers should be further explored meanwhile nitrate and or nitrite dependent amo may affect the occurrence of coupled ch4 and n2o biotransformation in natural environments thus connections between microbial pathways would be a meaningful future research 4 conclusions the process of n2o driven ch4 oxidation under anoxic conditions is considered to be a potential sink of two important greenhouse gases after 500 d of enrichment the ch4 oxidation rate increased over 800 fold compared to the wetland sediment inoculum moreover methanotrophs and denitrifiers increased by 38 and 8 fold while species of the methylocaldum genus became the predominant methanotrophs stable isotopic tracing proved ch4 oxidation was driven by n2o consumption the process is considered to be carried out by aerobic methanotrophs solely or along with denitrifying bacteria under hypoxia these findings contribute to a better understanding of electron acceptors associated with ch4 oxidation as well as the link of carbon and nitrogen cycles author contributions the manuscript was written through

the benzene ring table 1 czaplicka 2004 liu et al 2006 cps from industrial waste streams pesticides dyes and insecticides have been largely disposed into the ecosystems and caused serious harm to the environment and human health and safety alkhuraiji and alkhuraiji 2019 chen et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 singh and garg 2019 zhao et al 2018 due to their carcinogenic mutagenic and cytotoxic properties the world health organization who and the united states environmental protection agency usepa have defined cps as potential human carcinogens and priority pollutants igbinosa et al 2013 several strategies have been proposed to remove cps while biotechnology has become the most attractive and potential one due to its low cost and eco friendly characteristics berillo et al 2019 dvorak et al 2017 shen et al 2005 till now many microbial strains species consortia have been identified and enriched to possess a variety of degradation capabilities pathways and mechanisms for making cps less toxic or completely mineralized farrell and quilty 1999 martinez jardines et al 2018 nordin et al 2005 biological treatment technology can be mainly divided into two categories aerobic and anaerobic degradation as for the aerobic cps degradation process the ring cleavage and dechlorination reactions are mainly driven by diverse monooxygenases dioxygenases isomerase and hydrolase while the anaerobic cps degradation process completed through reductive dehalogenases rds and carboxylase mediated dechlorination and ring cleavage reactions several cps mineralization pathways have been discovered and proposed in pure cultures figs 1 2 bae et al 1996 belchik and xun 2008 farrell and quilty 1999 geng et al 2020 hollender et al 1997 huang et al 2008b koh et al 1997 matus et al 2003 moiseeva et al 2001 nordin et al 2005 ohtsubo et al 1999 perkins et al 1990 sanchez and gonzalez 2007 uotila et al 1992 yang et al 2009 zhang and wiegel 1990 however due to the high toxicity of cps as well as the low activity and rarity of related functional enzymes limitations and difficulties of cps biodegradation do exist which have been poorly discussed and reviewed when degrading cps aerobically especially when degrading polychlorophenols poly cps in single aerobic strain chlorinated intermediate metabolites e g 2 6 dichloro and tetrachloro hydroquinone would remain and are difficult to be further dechlorinated resulting in the accumulation of dead end products snyder et al 2006 westmeier and rehm 1987 as for the anaerobic degradation process the dechlorination products such as 4 cp and phenol often can t achieve efficient ring cleavage due to the lack of necessary and sustainable electron acceptors el sayed 2016 jiang et al 2018 recently many promising methods have been proposed to enhance the cps biodegradation rate in pure or mixed culture in addition to the application of high performance activated sludge and the introduction of novel functional materials new operating mode and more efficient biotechnologies have also been applied to enhance the cps mineralization efficiency the introduction of functional materials could well complement and facilitate cps biodegradation for instance materials with high redox potential e g manganese oxides or with catalytic properties n doped tio2 could provide supplementary oxidative ring cleavage pathway to cooperate with the microbial ring cleavage pathway thus enhancing the entire cps degradation efficiency wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2017 iron oxides such as hematite and magnetite could promote cps dechlorination by improving the electron transfer ability of the system jiang et al 2018 furthermore the sequential anaerobic aerobic cps degrading bioreactor has great advantage allowing cps to be more effectively dechlorinated anaerobically and mineralized aerobically lopez echartea et al 2019 ribarova et al 2001 bioelectrochemical system bes also has much more potential for cps biodegradation through employing bioanode biocathode to provide continuous and necessary electron acceptors donors kronenberg et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 in bes the anode can be utilized as an electron acceptor to promote the microbial oxidative degradation of cps and their intermediates while the cathode can be served as an electron donor to efficiently accelerate the microbial reductive dechlorination of cps and refractory chlorinated intermediates the improvement and optimization of electrode materials can further enhance their oxidative or reductive ability to cps several reviews have provided more discussion about the specific biodegradation process of cps mainly from the perspective of molecular mechanism including degradative genes expression and enzymatic catalytic characteristic arora and bae 2014a wu et al 2004 for instance solyanikova and golovleva 2004 discussed the specific gene clusters and enzyme systems responsible for each step in the aerobic biodegradation pathways of cps as for the dechlorination process the different types of dehalogenases involved as well as the corresponding encoding genes were also summarized arora and bae 2014b villemur 2013 however few reviews focused on providing a comprehensive comparison and discussion of various biodegradation processes several previous papers reviewed the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation processes of cps yet their review time is early annachhatre and gheewala 1996 field and sierra alvarez 2007 steiert and crawford 1985 in recent years new biodegradative bacteria and enzymes were discovered the potential of bes in wastewater treatment was excavated and the introduction of functional materials to promote biodegradation was developed therefore a comprehensive review is urgently needed to point out the latest critical challenges and opportunities in the field of cps biodegradation in this review the up to date biodegradation pathways functional bacteria and enzymes improvement strategies and existing challenges in the aerobic and anaerobic cps biodegradation modes are provided and then the opportunities for efficient cps biodegradation in the sequential anaerobic aerobic bioreactors and emerging bes are further discussed moreover critical perspectives are also proposed including the need to further understand the information and effect of functional microorganisms and materials the potential application of innovative biotechnologies and new operating modes and the scale up of bioreactors the objective of this review is to systematically summarize the current advances of the biodegradation strategies of cps and provide new insights and guidance for the enhanced removal of cps from various environments using green and sustainable biotechnologies 2 aerobic biodegradation of cps several aerobic biodegradation mechanisms of cps have been reported and a few bacterial species strains capable of utilizing cps aerobically have been isolated and taxonomically identified table 2 lobo et al 2018 wang et al 2019a in this section the aerobic biodegradation pathways for mcps dcps and poly cps as well as the corresponding functional bacterial species strains enzymes and stimulation strategies capable of enhancing the cps degradation efficiency will be described and reviewed furthermore the critical challenges for the aerobic cps biodegradation are also highlighted 2 1 aerobic biodegradation of mcps and dcps due to the less number of chlorine groups mcps and dcps are relatively less toxic and can achieve ring cleavage and degradation without prior dechlorination fig 1a g farrell and quilty 1999 fava et al 1995 khan et al 2011a knackmuss and hellwig 1978 moiseeva et al 2001 solyanikova and golovleva 2004 westerberg et al 2000 monooxygenases play the major role in the first step of degradation generally monooxygenases e g 4 cp 2 monooxygenase 2 cp 6 monooxygenase and 2 4 dcp 6 monooxygenase with the function of oxidative ortho hydroxylation will be responsible for the initial transformation of mcps and dcps into chlorocatechols ccs fig 1a b d e f g but distinctively the 4 cp 4 monooxygenase with the function of oxidative dechlorination was also found to be able to participate in the first step of the aerobic 4 cp biodegradation to produce chlorine free hydroquinone and hydroxyquinol fig 1c the earlier toxicity reduction of 4 cp via oxidative dechlorination could improve the whole biodegradation efficiency of 4 cp bae et al 1996 nordin et al 2005 after the first step of cps conversion is catalyzed via monooxygenases dioxygenases with the function of ring cleavage will start to function to complete the further mineralization of the intermediates there mainly exist two categories of aerobic ring cleavage pathways ortho cleavage via 1 2 dioxygenase type i ortho cleavage degradation of chlorine free aromatics via hydroxyquinol type ii modified ortho cleavage degradation of chloroaromatic via cc type iii new modified ortho cleavage similar to type ii while the degradation pathway after ring cleavage is slightly different and meta cleavage via 2 3 dioxygenase fig 1a g dorn and knackmuss 1978 farrell and quilty 1999 moiseeva et al 2002 since the meta cleavage pathway may lead to the production of toxic and dead end intermediates the ortho cleavage pathway is a more common pathway of aerobic cps biodegradation the aerobic biodegradation pathways of 4 cp 2 cp 3 cp and 2 4 dcp as well as the specific functional bacteria and enzymes participating in were summarized and discussed fig 1a g table 2 finkel shtein et al 2000 goswami et al 2002 im et al 2004 konovalova et al 2009 olaniran et al 2017 tarao and seto 2000 as for the aerobic biodegradation of 4 cp in strains such as rhodococcus opacus 6a containing 4 cp 2 monooxygenase 4 cc 1 2 dioxygenase chloromuconate cycloisomerase and dienelactone hydrolase 4 cp can be catabolized via the modified ortho cleavage fig 1a farrell and quilty 2002 finkel shtein et al 2000 konovalova et al 2009 while in strains like comamonas testosteroni jh5 4 cp can be degraded via meta cleavage under the action of 4 cc 2 3 dioxygenase 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase 4 oxalocrotonate isomerase 4 oxalocrotonate decarboxylase and 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase fig 1b el sayed et al 2014 hollender et al 1997 im et al 2004 moreover 4 cp can achieve dechlorination firstly and then ring cleavage via hydroquinone and hydroxyquinol in arthrobacter ureafaciens cpr70 and arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6 bae et al 1996 nordin et al 2005 fig 1c 4 cp 4 monooxygenase and 4 cc 4 monooxygenase play an important role to catalyze the oxidative dechlorination of 4 cp in this degradation pathway as for the aerobic degradation of 2 cp and 3 cp only the pathways via the formation of cc rather than via hydroquinone or hydroxyquinol like 4 cp have been discovered and confirmed 2 cp can be firstly converted into 3 cc by 2 cp 6 monooxygenase and then be further catabolized under the modified ortho cleavage via 3cc 1 2 dioxygenase chloromuconate cycloisomerase and dienelactone hydrolase in strains like pseudomonas sp b13 schlomann 1994 fig 1d up new modified ortho cleavage via 3 cc 1 2 dioxygenase chloromuconate cycloisomerase chloromuconolactone isomerase and dienelactone hydrolase in rhodococcus opacus 1cp moiseeva et al 2001 moiseeva et al 2002 fig 1d down or meta cleavage via 3 cc 2 3 dioxygenase oxalocrotonate tautomerase and oxalocrotonate decarboxylase in stenotrophomonas maltophilia kb2 wojcieszynska et al 2013 fig 1e as for 3 cp it will firstly generate 4 cc or 3 cc with 3 cp 6 monooxygenase or 3 cp 2 monooxygenase respectively and then be catabolized via ortho or meta cleavage pathway through the mentioned above enzymes fig 1f hollender et al 2000 table 2 as for the aerobic biodegradation of 2 4 dcp it can be directly converted into 3 5 dichlorocatechol 3 5 dcc through 2 4 dcp 6 monooxygenase and be further catabolized via the modified ortho cleavage in stains like alcaligenes eutrophus jmp134 with 3 5 dcc 1 2 dioxygenase and 2 4 dichloromuconic acid isomerase perkins et al 1990 fig 1g up or via meta cleavage in a eutrophus jmp222 via 3 5 dcc 2 3 dioxygenase a derivative of a eutrophus jmp134 lost plasmid pjp4 koh et al 1997 olaniran et al 2017 fig 1g down table 2 2 2 aerobic biodegradation of poly cps because of the presence of more chlorine groups poly cps are more toxic and refractory than mcps and dcps and cannot achieve ring cleavage and mineralization without prior dechlorination fig 1h k li et al 1991 matus et al 2003 ohtsubo et al 1999 zaborina et al 1998 the toxicity of poly cps needs to be firstly reduced via oxidative dechlorination to complete further mineralization several monooxygenases e g 2 4 5 tcp 4 monooxygenase 2 4 6 tcp 4 monooxygenase and pcp 4 monooxygenase and cytochrome p 450 type enzyme a coenzyme of monooxygenase with the function of oxidative dechlorination were found to participate in the initial aerobic biodegradation pathway of poly cps to produce chlorohydroquinone louie et al 2002 ohtsubo et al 1999 uotila et al 1992 uotila et al 1991 webb et al 2010 the chlorohydroquinone would then be dechlorinated by functional monooxygenases dehalogenases to achieve further toxic reduction uotila et al 1992 zaborina et al 1998 when the number of chlorine groups decreases below three the intermediate products would be less toxic and could proceed ring cleavage under the action of ring cleavage dioxygenases to complete catabolism the aerobic biodegradation pathways of the representative poly cps 2 4 5 trichlorophenol 2 4 5 tcp 2 4 6 tcp and pentachlorophenol pcp were illustrated fig 1h k the specific bacterial species strains responsible for the aerobic biodegradation of poly cps were summarized table 2 jesus et al 2009 kao et al 2005 webb et al 2010 xun and webster 2004 their degradation pathways are similar to some extent 2 4 5 tcp 2 4 6 tcp and pcp will firstly complete dechlorination to generate less chlorinated hydroquinone or hydroxyquinol via functional monooxygenase and dehalogenase and then the less toxic intermediates will be further catabolized via dioxygenase fig 1h k however aerobic strains capable of completely mineralizing tcps and pcp are scarce table 2 in some cases the toxic chlorinated intermediates of poly cps e g 2 5 dichloro 2 6 dichloro and tetrachloro hydroquinone may accumulate and inactivate functional enzymes due to their difficulty in further dechlorination orser and lange 1994 uotila et al 1991 functional enzymes play a key role in catalyzing cps biodegradation table 3 the biodegradation of mcps and dcps mainly relies on enzymes with ring cleavage function while the biodegradation of poly cps mainly depends on enzymes with dechlorination and ring cleavage functions important monooxygenases and dioxygenases that catalyze aerobic dechlorination and ring cleavage processes are combined with other functional enzymes e g dehalogenase cycloisomerase hydrolase isomerase and reductase that catalyze the transformation of intermediates to complete the whole cps mineralization process fig 1 table 3 ferraroni et al 2006 ferraroni et al 2004 hammer et al 1993 hayes et al 2012 kaschabek and reineke 1993 kwon et al 2014 okuta et al 2003 porter et al 2014 seibert et al 1993 zaborina et al 1995 the crystal structure of the enzyme dictates the position of active sites and the type of residues which further determine the catalytic activity and ability during the enzyme catalytic process ferraroni et al 2013 katti et al 1989 kuhm et al 1990 solyanikova and golovleva 2004 for instance the crystal of hydroxyquinol 1 2 dioxygenase isolated from nocardioides simplex 3e shows the extensive openings and consequent exposure to the solution in the upper part of the catalytic cavity and this structure arrangement favors the binding of hydroxyquinol rather than catechol making this enzyme better at degrading hydroxyquinol ferraroni et al 2005 moreover the residues containing in the enzyme structure also show a correlation with the enzyme catalytic performance the histidine residue his 289 in the monooxygenase of burkholderia cepacia ac1100 plays an important role in catalyzing the initial steps of tcp degradation tcp to dichlorohydroquinone webb et al 2010 the conserved his 199 in catechol 2 3 dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida mt 2 also seems to function critically in the enzyme catalytic process of chlorocatechol kita et al 1999 however the specific relationship between the enzyme crystal structures and the enzyme function are still unclear which need be further studied also it s worth noting that the cps degrading enzymes are similar to those involved in degrading other chloroaromatics so the research scope of this part is relatively extensive in the future researchers should continue to explore the crystal structures of the functional enzymes and try to figure out their specific roles in the catalytic process the functional enzymes could be designed modified and combined more accurately and reasonably through enzyme engineering which would further promote the degradation of cps and other chloroaromatics 2 3 key strategies to improve aerobic cps biodegradation efficiency with the development of aerobic biotechnology effective strategies have also been applied to degrade cps showing better performance and prospects gallego et al 2001 tomei and angelucci 2019 the application of aerobic granular sludges has great potential with higher biomass concentration and more excellent settling capacity stable granules show a higher toxicity tolerance and degradation rate of 4 cp and 2 4 6 tcp compared with fluffy sludges gomez acata et al 2018 miao et al 2014 wei et al 2015 besides the biodegradation of cps in certain nitrifying consortium could be achieved via co metabolism by the catalysis of functional ammonia oxygenase of nitrifiers where the nitrifiers can not only endure the toxicity of cps but also promote the removal of cps tran et al 2013 martinez jardines et al 2018 shows that the co metabolic degradation rate of 2 cp via ammonium monooxygenase increases with the increase of initial ammonia concentration in the nitrifying system acclimated with ammonium and 2 cp for 11 months this provides ideas not only for promoting the degradation of cps but also for dealing with the co contamination of cps and ammonia nitrogen silva et al 2011 wei et al 2015 several functional materials with high redox potential can also be introduced biogenic manganese oxides biomnox in situ generated by the oxidation of mn ii with manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob can be coupled with the cps degrading bacteria in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr to achieve high cps degradation efficiency tu et al 2015 wang et al 2019a the biomnox with many mn iv vacancies and large surface areas can provide an alternative meta cleavage pathway for 4 cp degradation which is complementary to the ortho cleavage pathway employed by the degradative bacteria fig 3 a 2 4 the difficulty in aerobic cps biodegradation dechlorination dechlorination is the key step in aerobic cps biodegradation which determines the degradation efficiency and rate the lack or lower activity of enzymes with dechlorination function in most aerobic strains chen et al 2013 payne et al 2015 as well as the rarity of related functional strains make dechlorination the biggest obstacle in the aerobic biodegradation of cps especially when degrading poly cps in most cases without the related functional strains mentioned before the chlorinated intermediate metabolites may fail to be dechlorinated and thus finally accumulate for example chlorinated meta cleavage intermediates generated by 2 3 dioxygenase such as 5 chloroformyl 2 hydroxypenta 2 4 dienoic acid from 2 cp and 3 cp as well as 5 chloro 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde from 4 cp have been widely reported as highly toxic dead end intermediates which will bind irreversibly to functional enzymes e g mono and dioxygenases and result in their inactivation bartels et al 1984 klecka and gibson 1981 rafiee et al 2012 reineke et al 1982 westmeier and rehm 1987 the primary chlorinated metabolites of higher toxic tcps and pcp 2 6 dichlorohydroquinone and tetrachlorohydroquinone are also difficult to be further degraded in most aerobic strains due to the difficulty in further dechlorination li et al 1991 snyder et al 2006 moreover although several strains enzymes have shown the ability to achieve the oxidative dechlorination of cps under aerobic condition as mentioned above their oxidative dechlorination rate is much lower than the reductive dechlorination rate of cps under anaerobic condition d angelo and reddy 2000 olaniran and igbinosa 2011 therefore the challenges of dechlorination hinder the efficient and complete aerobic mineralization of cps providing an efficient and sustainable dechlorination environment for cps and the toxic chlorinated intermediates during the aerobic degradation process could substantially increase the overall mineralization efficiency such as coupling anaerobic condition or the biocathode in bes which will be further discussed subsequently 3 anaerobic biodegradation of cps 3 1 anaerobic biodegradation process of cps unlike the aerobic biodegradation process dechlorination processes are much easier to happen in anaerobic condition where the chlorines in cps can be replaced by hydrogens to produce mcps or phenol thus achieving the toxicity reduction lin et al 2019 the anaerobic degradation rate with cps as the only carbon and energy sources is very slow for the lack of electron donors therefore it is necessary to introduce hydrogen or co substrates e g acetate and lactate as efficient electron donors to enhance the dechlorination rate hydrogen has been widely believed to be able to directly participate in the dechlorination reaction and provide electrons el sayed 2016 li et al 2013b while the specific role of co substrates is unclear whether the co substrates are directly involved in dechlorination or indirectly participate in dechlorination by producing hydrogen through fermentation or both needs to be further studied many anaerobic bacterial species strains capable of dechlorinating cps have been discovered and isolated table 4 adrian et al 2007 gerritse et al 1996 sun et al 2000 tront et al 2006 van de pas et al 2001 zhang et al 2012 in these dechlorinators rds are the most critical and responsible enzymes for dechlorination process liang et al 2012 different bacterial strains may have different functional genes e g crda cpra1 5 and hcbb1 3 ito et al 2018 villemur 2013 which encode different types of rds determining different dechlorination selectivity ortho meta or para position table 4 for instance in desulfitobacterium hafniense pcp 1 the 2 4 6 tcp rd system encoded by crda is responsible for the removal of ortho and para position chlorines and the 3 5 dcp rd system encoded by cpra5 is in charge of the removal of meta position chlorines gauthier et al 2006 moreover as for the rds themselves their crystal structures are critical point which directly determine their activity to different type cps and affect their ability for dechlorination there are many types of rds that catalyze different dehalogenation processes of different halogenated organic compounds up to now several rds have been purified and their crystal structures have been studied which help researchers further understand the molecular mechanisms of enzyme catalyzed dehalogenation process bommer et al 2014 payne et al 2015 however as for rds able to catalyze the dechlorination of cps their crystal structural information is still less which need be focused in the future to understand their active site environments and the key catalytic residues to further promote cps dechlorination furthermore dechlorinators have limited ring cleavage ability to achieve further effective degradation of the dechlorinated product phenol therefore the reasonable combination of anaerobic dechlorinators and anaerobic phenol degraders in anaerobic bioreactors is a better choice where cps can be effectively converted to phenol by dechlorinators with functional rds and to small molecules of volatile fatty acids vfas by phenol degraders with functional phenol carboxylase and dehydroxylase the specific dehydroxylase and encoding genes haven t been reported yet and eventually be mineralized into co2 and ch4 via benzoate pathway fig 2a b c table 5 becker et al 1999 geng et al 2020 li et al 2010 qian et al 2020 yang et al 2009 zhang and wiegel 1990 notably the anaerobic dechlorinators and anaerobic phenol degraders often need to be acclimated separately in advance and then combined because the anaerobic phenol degraders are often difficult to screen out spontaneously from the cps contaminated anaerobic environment li et al 2010 yang et al 2009 3 2 parameters affecting dechlorination performance there are many parameters that may affect the anaerobic cps dechlorination performance including the location of chlorines the type and concentration of the co substrate temperature etc selective dechlorination is an interesting topic in the anaerobic biodegradation of cps which is directly related to the location of chlorine and the type of biodegradative bacteria and enzymes table 4 generally the para position chlorine group is the hardest to remove meta position chlorine comes second and ortho position chlorine is most easily eliminated song et al 2019 the type of co substrate may also affect the selective dechlorination process since different co substrate may induce different enzyme activity ortho meta or para rds for instance formate and sucrose tend to promote the para dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp while yeast extract and methanol tend to facilitate the ortho dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp puyol et al 2009 besides affecting the dechlorination selectivity different co substrate may also result in different promotion efficiency for dechlorination khan et al 2011b wang et al 2012 majumder and gupta 2008 suggests that glucose and methanol easily convert to acetate are more beneficial to promote 2 cp and 2 4 dcp dechlorination compared with formate easily convert to co2 and propionate difficult to anaerobically degrade in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb which may be due to the fact that acetate product has better fermentation performance to produce an efficient electron donor h2 therefore it is important to choose suitable co substrate for different types of cps in different situation temperature is also a critical parameter affecting anaerobic dechlorination process mesophilic condition is more conducive for dechlorination than thermophilic condition leven and schnurer 2005 limam et al 2016 tas and pavlostathis 2007 on one hand higher temperature 40 c would enhance the methanogenesis process which would competitively consume large amounts of available electron donors required for reductive dechlorination process fletcher et al 2011b on the other hand the activity of the dechlorinators would be affected take the typical dechlorinator dehalococcoides sp as an example the 16s rrna gene and functional gene abundances related to dechlorination at 30 c exceed those measured at higher temperature 35 c in dehalococcoides sp which shows the inhibition of the dechlorination activity at higher temperature fletcher et al 2011a friis et al 2007 furthermore introducing functional materials can also efficiently enhance the anaerobic dechlorination rate which could be mainly attributed to the increase of electron transfer and redox rate in the anaerobic dechlorination system for instance alumina particles immobilized with fulvic acids and biochar carrageenan microspheres were able to be served as solid phase redox mediator to facilitate the microbial dechlorination process alvarez et al 2012 ji et al 2019 besides the metal oxide nanoparticles especially the iron oxides such as hematite and magnetite have also shown great potential in promoting cps dechlorination process by facilitating the electron transfer of the system jiang et al 2018 the fe ii fe iii redox couple formed on the iron surface could participate in and promote the electron transfer process and thus finally facilitate the 4 cp dechlorination process fig 3b kim et al 2019 the presence of iron oxides nanoparticles would also promote the selective enrichment of the iron oxidizing bacteria geobacter a well known electroactive bacteria that have strains able to degrade phenolic compounds and can promote extracellular electron transfer eet during the reaction to improve the biodegradation process fig 3b zhang et al 2013 3 3 the difficulties in anaerobic cps biodegradation as for the anaerobic microbial mineralization of cps limitations and difficulties do exist including i para dechlorination is hard and ii ring cleavage rate is slow bacterial strains containing highly active para rds and able to achieve para position chlorine removal are few make 4 cp often become the final accumulated product of cps dechlorination reactions table 4 el sayed 2016 li et al 2013b puyol et al 2009 song et al 2018 in addition achieving efficient ring cleavage process is much more difficult in the anaerobic environment than in the aerobic environment due to the lack of sufficient electron acceptors like oxygen therefore the anaerobic mineralization rate of phenol or mcps is much slow el sayed 2016 haggblom 1998 li et al 2016 in summary anaerobic biodegradation technology is better in terms of dechlorination especially for poly cps and it has lower energy consumption however the difficulties and limitations of the further mineralization of several dechlorinated products such as 4 cp or phenol have become the critical problems in the anaerobic degradation process providing efficient and sustainable electron acceptors such as oxygen or the electrode in bes for the dechlorination products could be a promising strategy to improve the complete removal of cps 4 consortium mediated cps biodegradation in addition to pure degradative bacteria degradative consortia have also been widely studied in cps biodegradation the consortium mediated cps biodegradation have shown much higher cps tolerance and removal ability due to the interaction and synergy of different species and the expression and possession of complete metabolic enzymes required for the whole degradation process while the pure bacterial strain may sometimes only express the enzymes that function on transforming parent products to toxic intermediates and the toxic intermediates may accumulate due to the lack of relevant degradative enzymes patel and kumar 2016b for instance pseudomonas sp tcp114 shows the ability to degrade 2 4 6 tcp and arthrobacter sp cpr706 is able to degrade 4 cp but when 2 4 6 tcp 4 cp and phenol exist together in the medium neither of the two pure strains can degrade any of the contaminants present however when the two strains were mixed the resulting defined consortium could degrade all the three phenolic compounds tcp 4 cp and phenol simultaneously in one medium bae et al 1997 moreover none of the four pure strains bacillus endophyticus cp1r genbank accession no km259919 bacillus cereus 3ys km522855 kocuria rhizophila 11y km522854 and pseudomonas aeruginosa gf km259920 is able to degrade 3 cp and 4 cp at a higher concentration individually but the bacterial consortium with the mixture of these four strains show much higher tolerance and degradation ability of 3 cp and 4 cp patel and kumar 2016b besides the defined mixed consortia microbial consortia with the ability of degrading cps can also be gradually enriched and formed in bioreactors with cps treatment or environment with cps contamination el sayed 2016 li et al 2013a liang et al 2017 liang et al 2015 patel and kumar 2016a sulfate reducing consortium shows the ability to obtain bacteria adapted to 2 cp degradation in bioreactors ulises garcia cruz et al 2018 the microorganisms collected from a sediment near an oil refinery are also able to be enriched into a cps degrading consortium with the predominance of anaerospora hongkongensis pseudomonas stutzeri pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes clostridium sp and desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans to degrade 2 3 dcp and mcps el sayed et al 2018 similarly in the cps contaminated sites the copy numbers of dechlorinators dehalobacterium and sulfurospirillum spp and phenol degraders geobacter spp proliferate remarkably and remain at a high level in the enriched consortium when degrading 4 cp and 2 4 6 tcp li et al 2015 5 sequential anaerobic aerobic biodegradation of cps cps mainly perform reductive dechlorination under anaerobic environment while in aerobic conditions cps are subject to ring cleavage steiert and crawford 1985 therefore combining anaerobic and aerobic processes to achieve cascaded dechlorination and ring cleavage of cps is a more efficient and advisable option majumder and gupta 2008 2009 oliveira et al 2020 pathiraja et al 2019 puyol et al 2015 since the operating mechanism and condition of anaerobic and aerobic functional bacteria are different they were arranged in two separate bioreactors the mixed culture containing anaerobic dechlorinators will be acclimated and enriched in the anaerobic bioreactor to firstly achieve cps dechlorination and the enrichment with dominant aerobic phenol degraders will involve in further mineralization in the following aerobic bioreactor sequential uasb and aerobic suspended growth asg reactors have been used to treat pcp 2 4 6 tcp and 2 4 dcp results showed that these two bioreactors could cooperate well to achieve efficient mineralization atuanya et al 2000 similarly uasb has also been coupled with aerobic continuous stirred tank reactor cstr to treat 2 4 dcp wastewater under continuous flow condition the mineralization efficiency of 120 mg l 1 2 4 dcp can achieve 86 67 which is much higher than either alone sponza and ulukoy 2006 lopez echartea et al 2019 further expanded the reactor size to pilot scale and realized the bioremediation of cps contaminated sawmill soil likewise in addition to the traditional sequential bioreactors the utilization of photosynthetic bacteria psb may be a more potential and novel approach to mineralize cps existing researches have shown that in light anaerobic condition cps can achieve anaerobic dechlorination and oxygen can be gradually generated via photosynthesis in psb while in dark aerobic condition phenolic compounds can complete aerobic ring cleavage kong et al 2014b lu et al 2019 this provides us with a promising strategy by allocating the lighting time to psb reasonably cps may achieve dechlorination first and then realize sequentially efficient mineralization under light anaerobic and dark aerobic switched condition fig 4 it is greatly potential to achieve the sequential anaerobic aerobic biodegradation of cps in the psb assisted single chamber bioreactors 6 cps degradation in bioelectrochemical system bes in the process of cps biodegradation the main reasons leading to the failure of mineralization are i the accumulation of intermediate metabolites and ii the difficulty of highly efficient dechlorination bes has potential to solve these problems well on one hand the anode in bes could be served as sustainable electron acceptors to more quickly metabolize the accumulated products and convert them into electricity both achieving power generation and promoting cps further degradation miran et al 2017 on the other hand the cathode in bes could provide continuous electrons to promote some difficult to dechlorinate products to complete dechlorination with the development of bes it has been increasingly applied to degrade cps in this section we will provide a comprehensive summary of the bioelectrochemical degradation of cps and some critical perspectives 6 1 biodegradation of cps with biocathode the cathode in bes have shown a great ability to reduce cps to phenol the carbon sources e g acetate and glucose supplied to the bes bioanode can be converted to electrons through electroactive bacteria and then the electrons will flow to the cathode through an external circuit and finally react with cps to complete dechlorination and toxicity reduction fig 5 b compared with anaerobic biodegradation the carbon sources required for bes can be reduced by 5 times the energy consumption is also reduced by 5 30 times compared with conventional electrochemical system wen et al 2013 in addition to the contribution of abiotic cathode to dechlorination biocathode and improved electrode materials began to be used to further improve the reaction efficiency fig 5d table 6 khan et al 2019 kong et al 2014a kong et al 2014b lin et al 2019 yao et al 2019 dechlorinators are introduced into the cathode to form biocathode including pure culture like the 2 cp degrading anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans 2cp 1 strycharz et al 2010 or microbial community like the 4 cp degrading psb and the acclimated 2 4 6 tcp degrading consortium khan et al 2019 kong et al 2014b with the addition of small amounts of carbon sources in the cathode chamber the biocathode shows stronger dechlorination ability fig 5d ii besides the higher dechlorination efficiency bes cathode also shows a higher selectivity for para position dechlorination of cps which is of great advantage since the para position chlorine is usually difficult to remove in pure anaerobic biological system 4 cp was widely used as the target pollutant in bes experiment and the experimental results showed that 4 cp could be efficiently and selectively reduced to phenol by the bes cathode table 6 as for electrode materials carbon based materials such as graphite and carbon cloth are the most commonly used electrodes which have good biocompatibility but limited conductivity liu et al 2014 composing metal and carbon based materials to form composite materials have proven to be a better choice besides maintaining the good biocompatibility they can increase the electron transfer efficiency between cps and the cathode thus enhancing the cps dechlorination rate kong et al 2014a li et al 2020 wei et al 2011 table 6 to further degrade the biocathode dechlorinated product other stimulation strategies have been conducted as mentioned above the ring cleavage reactions of phenol and cps can be driven by oxygen coincidentally oxygen is the most commonly used electron acceptor in the bes cathode the supply of modest oxygen n2 o2 60 40 in cathode has been shown to enable further mineralization of 2 4 6 tcp and pcp after dechlorination fig 5d iii table 6 huang et al 2012 huang et al 2014 however there are few studies focusing on using other electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate in the cathode to achieve cps mineralization on one hand the redox potential of nitrate and sulfate is lower than that of oxygen so their reduction process in cathode have less competition with cps dechlorination on the other hand denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria srb using phenol or even cps as the only electron donors have been found and studied widely arellano gonzalez et al 2016 chang et al 2004 garcia cruz et al 2018 martinez gutierrez et al 2019 xia et al 2011 introducing nitrate or sulfate into the cathode chamber to realize the mineralization of cps can not only reduce the energy consumption required by oxygen exposure but also provide a new insight and possibility for treating the co contaminated environment of nutrients and cps fig 5d iv 6 2 biodegradation of cps with bioanode generally due to the high toxicity cps are difficult to be directly used as a bes anode fuel however due to the application of versatile consortium and the discovery of new materials and degradation mechanisms the methods to mineralize cps successfully in anode have gradually been found and converting cps into electrical power becomes a more meaningful experimental design hassan et al 2019 table 7 the cases that have been shown to achieve cps degradation in anode include i introducing specific functional bacteria hassan et al 2016 kong et al 2014b miran et al 2017 ii applying catalytic anode materials zhou et al 2017 and iii adding co substrates huang et al 2011 li et al 2018 wang et al 2012 yu et al 2019 table 7 it s a good strategy to inoculate the highly efficient degraders in the anode to promote the degradation of cps and form low toxicity products which can be further mineralized and generate electricity in the bioanode fig 5a exoelectrogenic srb and psb have shown the ability to degrade 4 cp and bacillus subtilis were able to catalyze 2 4 dcp degradation in the bioanode hassan et al 2016 kong et al 2014b miran et al 2017 besides these bacteria electroactive geobacter metallireducens also shows the ability to degrade phenol under anaerobic condition jiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 geobacter can also enhance cps dechlorination by promoting eet which may be the other advantage to introduce geobacter in the bioanode for cps dechlorination and mineralization another choice is to design anode materials with strong catalytic oxidation capability to promote the initial ring cleavage of cps bioanodes coating photocatalytic materials e g n doped tio2 and mpg c3n4 showed higher mineralization efficiency of cps e g 4 cp and 2 4 6 tcp due to the synergetic effects of electrocatalysis and microbial catalysis fig 5c i wang et al 2019c zhou et al 2017 in addition it s also useful to modify the electrode with high redox potential material for instance polypyrrole Œ≤ mno2 modified graphite felt bioanode has shown the ability to enhance phenol degradation in the bes anode by promoting the ring cleavage process fig 5c ii chen et al 2017 therefore designing new electrode materials with high redox potential could effectively promote the cps degradation in the anode zhang and liu 2020 furthermore adding co substrates such as glucose and acetate can also effectively facilitate the bioanodes to degrade cps huang et al 2011 wang et al 2012 although not as effective as the first two methods it is the easiest one to implement the co substrates can be served as electron donors to promote the dechlorination process of cps in the bioanode and thus enhance the detoxification of pollutants the co substrates can also stimulate the bacterial growth and act as an inducer of the degradative enzymes e g rds to thus enhance the biodegradation ability of the bioanode chiranjeevi and patil 2020 huang et al 2011 majumder and gupta 2008 6 3 sequential cathode anode degradation of cps in bes the cathode provides electrons which is more conducive to reductive dechlorination while the anode accepts electrons which is better for oxidative mineralization therefore similar to the sequential anaerobic aerobic bioreactor sequential cathode anode cascaded mode is also a promising strategy for the complete mineralization of contaminants fig 5e kong et al 2014b yang et al 2020 phenol generated from cps dechlorination in the cathode can be shifted to the anode and achieve further degradation however few information is available for this strategy which may be due to the need to constantly transfer the cathode effluent to the anode but this mode has several advantages i simple operating conditions no special dechlorination bacteria or expensive new electrodes need to be introduced into the anode ii saving anode carbon source the introduced phenol can not only achieve further degradation but also can be served as a supplementary carbon source for the bioanode thus reducing the amount of other carbon sources required in conclusion both anode and cathode in bes has great potential in degrading and even mineralizing cps through a number of strategies hassan et al 2016 kong et al 2014a the selection of the specific operating mode anode degradation cathode degradation or sequential cathode anode degradation may depend on the actual situation of the cps contaminated environment to be remediated 7 future perspectives for cps biodegradation the biodegradation processes of cps under aerobic anaerobic or bioelectrochemical condition have certain correlations whether in the application of functional bacteria or materials in this section the future perspectives for the overall cps biodegradation are provided aiming to further improve the degradation rate and scale of the biological systems 7 1 further grasp microbial information and apply novel biotechnologies diverse bacterial species have been discovered to degrade cps mainly including pseudomonas sp rhodococcus sp bacillus sp cupriavidus sp dehalococcoides sp dehalobacter sp and desulfitobacterium sp konovalova et al 2009 matus et al 2003 moiseeva et al 2002 song et al 2019 villemur 2013 wang et al 2014 which contribute to different degradation pathways and capabilities of cps however at this stage researchers need to have a deeper understanding of the microorganisms from bacterial cell to metabolic enzyme and gene level in addition to discover more cps degradative strains e g strains belonging to geobacter metallireducens or dehalococcoides mccartyi the information and types of different degradative genes need to be further grasped as well as their expression activity in different environments in this case the most suitable functional strains could be selected for different cps contaminated environments and the functional gene expression may even be used as biomarker to illustrate the biodegradation activity in addition to the pure culture many degradative consortia can also be acclimated and enriched from the cps contaminated environment which may have better adaptability and degradability for higher concentration cps the specific metabolic relationship between core bacteria enzymes and genes in microbial consortium need to be further studied in the next step such as the impact and role of the non degradative bacteria on the degradative bacteria e g some methanogens including methanosarcina sp and some acetogenic bacteria including desulfovibrio sp may play an important role in mediating acetate and h2 sources for dechlorinator dehalococcoides sp wang et al 2019b as well as the non degradative genes on the degradative genes e g hup and vhu that express hydrogenases may have influence on tcea and vcra that express rds deeper understanding can help us to more reasonably combine strains in one consortium or even design and integrate genes into one bacterium several emerging and innovative biotechnologies provide great possibilities for the future of biodegradation for example using genetic engineering to efficiently combine rds encoding reductive genes with oxygenase encoding oxidative genes to construct synthetic bacteria with enhanced function and selecting an appropriate environment for active expression cps could be efficiently mineralized researches can also design directionally evolve and combine functional enzymes according to their unique crystal structures to further improve their catalytic ability and activity by enzyme engineering another extremely attractive example is that by using new microbial 3d printing technology a promising technology to prepare functional living materials with desirable and controllable microbial community structure gonzalez et al 2020 kyle 2018 mccarthy et al 2019 schaffner et al 2017 the optimized microbiome including anaerobic dechlorinators in the inner anaerobic layer and aerobic phenol degraders in the outer aerobic layer would be artificially constructed to achieve efficient and stable cascade degradation and mineralization of cps fig 6 in conclusion continuing to excavate and understand the microbial information in the cps degrading microbial consortium and resolving the metabolic roles of core members is the major foci in the future the development and application of novel biotechnologies also need to be focused on genetic engineering enzyme engineering and microbiome assembly technology e g microbial 3d printing may be the next frontier in the environmental biotechnology field 7 2 deeply understand the role of materials in cps biodegradation and design better materials in early bioreactors materials are mainly considered as carriers whose function is to load more functional microorganisms with the development of novel functional materials in addition to only serving as carriers materials can also participate in and promote the degradative reactions and combine biological processes to maximize the overall degradation efficiency zhao et al 2019 however there are still few studies focusing on the specific promotion mechanisms of different materials in biodegradation as well as their influence on different microorganisms which need further exploration for example both photocatalytic materials e g n doped tio2 and materials with high redox potential e g biomnox can improve cps biodegradation by promoting ring cleavage reaction but their promotion mechanisms are completely different the former by generating hydroxyl radicals and the latter by providing highly oxidative sites which could lead to different influence on functional bacteria in this case researchers need to figure out whether highly oxidative sites would help increase the activity of functional aerobic bacteria and whether hydroxyl radicals would inactivate several anaerobic bacteria the deeper excavation could help maximize the combination efficiency of functional materials and bacteria besides specific materials may improve the activity of certain relevant bacteria such as iron materials can induce geobacter sp so it is necessary to further study whether the induction of specific bacteria will promote the cps biodegradation or not based on these more functional materials with dual functions of carrier and catalysis promoting better integration with bacterial functions could be designed and applied furthermore utilizing microbial 3d printing technology mentioned above to design and optimize the assembly way of functional microorganisms and materials may also be a promising strategy in the future 7 3 the development and application of new operating modes during cps mineralization process ring cleavage is electron loss reaction more likely to occur in the oxidative condition while dechlorination is electron uptake reaction tending to happen in the reductive condition therefore the development and application of new reasonable operating modes to completely mineralize cps via ring cleavage and dechlorination under more suitable conditions would greatly increase their mineralization rate the sequential anaerobic aerobic bioreactors have been widely studied showing a better performance to degrade cps similarly the sequential cathode anode cascaded mode or microaeration environment in bes is also recommended by microaeration dissolved oxygen do gradient would be formed in the anode cathode biofilm and planktonic flocs which could provide a suitable environment for the anaerobic dechlorination and aerobic ring cleavage of cps thus improving cps degradation efficiency and depth fig 7 besides microaeration would promote the formation of flocs in planktonic sludge and enhance the diversity activity and differentiation of functional anaerobic community e g hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria which would also promote the anaerobic cps biodegradation cheng et al 2015 duc and khanal 2018 yang et al 2018 the degradation metabolites would be further degraded with bioanode biocathode fig 7 besides coupling the bes biocathode dechlorination with nitrate or sulfate reduction bioreactors is also a promising operating mode with the potential to simultaneously remove cps and nutrients 7 4 the practical application of bioreactors and in situ bioremediation until now most researches on cps biodegradation are still in laboratory scale and there are very few cases of large scale or in situ bioremediation applications due to the high toxicity of cps on bacteria to achieve the scale up of bioreactors and in situ bioremediation is the challenge and ultimate goal in this field which is inseparable from the discovery of more efficient functional bacteria the design of cheaper and more efficient materials the development of operating modes with high efficiency and the design of novel reactor configurations mikkonen et al 2018 performed a long term full scale in situ aeration in a groundwater contaminated with pcp and tetrachlorophenols tecps the abundances of catabolically capable degraders e g sphingomonadaceae and the gene encoding pcp hydroxylase pcpb have been activated and enriched which can significantly improve the cps removal efficiency through the application of bioaugmentation and the supplement of electron donor hydrogen gas anaerobic in situ pcp bioremediation dechlorination has also been achieved cole 2000 these two successful cases indicate that the indigenous bacteria existing in the cps contaminated environment do contain functional species and genes with the ability to degrade cps however they require necessary auxiliary measures to be activated such as adding co substrate conducting full scale aeration or providing functional materials etc furthermore using immobilized biotechnology to introduce the pre acclimated highly efficient functional bacteria into the cps contaminated site is also a promising strategy to achieve in situ bioremediation for example the potential double layer aerobic layer and anaerobic layer living material designed by 3d printing which is mentioned above may be applied to the cps contaminated environment by supplying proper level of oxygen cps can be effectively degraded from inner anaerobic dechlorination layer to outer aerobic mineralization layer fig 6 as for bioelectrochemical technology its advantages and several improving methods have been discussed based on cps degradation mechanisms section 6 but in practical applications researchers should also pay attention to the innovation of integrated configuration as well as the optimization of electrode layout mode and environmental parameters do ph conductivity etc to achieve in situ bioelectroremediation up to now appliable modular electrode with the potential to be used in actual sewage treatment system has been designed and several electrode optimization arrangements have also been proposed to scale up bes dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however there is still a long way to go to achieve large scale bes treatment especially when dealing with highly toxic contaminants like cps furthermore there may be other pollutants coexisting with cps in the polluted water such as nitrate sulfate other organic compounds and heavy metals the effect of the coexisting pollutants on cps biodegradation as well as the simultaneous removal of the existing pollutants are important research topics as electron acceptors nitrate sulfate may snatch electron donors to inhibit the dechlorination of cps but may promote the biodegradation of phenol in denitrification or sulfate reducing process ahn et al 2009 arellano gonzalez et al 2016 chang et al 2003 yoshida et al 2007 therefore coupling some pretreatment methods to preferentially complete the cps dechlorination in the polluted water containing cps and nitrate sulfate may promote the further simultaneous removal of the pollutants in addition the coexistence of other organic compounds may also affect cps biodegradation puyol et al 2009 wang et al 2012 when coexisting with easily degradable organics e g acetate and glucose the biodegradation efficiency of cps may be promoted however when coexisting with other highly toxic organics such as polycyclic aromatics the functional bacteria responsible for cps degradation may be inhibited the influence of heavy metals cannot be ignored either excessive concentration of heavy metal would be toxic to bacteria and enzymes chen et al 2015 marchlewicz et al 2017 kuo and genthner 1996 showed that when the concentration of heavy metal cd ii cu ii or cr vi was about 2 0 mg l 1 the acclimation time of 2 cp degrading consortium would be extended and the 2 cp degradation efficiency would be decreased when the concentration of heavy metal reached 300 mg l 1 the biodegradation rate and efficiency of cps would be more severely reduced huang et al 2008a in these cases pretreatment strategies may be required to reduce the toxicity of the polluted water and improve the biodegradation performance of cps cost is also a critical consideration in the practical application since the scale efficiency life span and treatment condition are different it is difficult to make a direct and specific economical comparison of different biotechnologies the major cost of anaerobic cps biodegradation process comes from the addition of large amounts of co substrates e g acetate and glucose while the main cost of aerobic cps biodegradation process comes from the aeration process therefore reducing the carbon and energy consumption is a long term goal of the anaerobic and aerobic cps biodegradation several novel biotechnologies such as the anaerobic membrane bioreactors and aerobic granular sludge have shown the potential to reduce the carbon and energy consumption in wastewater treatment process compared with conventional activated sludge technology geng et al 2020 pronk et al 2015 sarma and tay 2018 which may also be applied in cps biodegradation processes moreover the cost would be remarkably increased when introducing functional materials or electrodes into the bioreactors as for bes reactor the cost reduction of the electrodes and the scale up of the system are always hot issues recently wang et al 2020 developed a novel and cost effective scalable electrode modules total volume of 1 m3 for wastewater treatment and the unit cost of the electrode modules was estimated to be 595 7 m 3 although there still exists an increase in the cost of bes compared with pure bioreactors the wastewater treatment efficiency was significantly enhanced therefore it is necessary to find a balance between the economy and efficiency according to different practical environments contaminated by cps different biodegradation processes methods and reactor types need to be selected and applied 8 conclusions the efficiency and scale of cps biodegradation still need to be improved to achieve large scale cps removal or in situ bioremediation this review provides comprehensive information on typical cps biodegradation technologies and establishes their connection diverse aerobic and anaerobic degraders degradative enzymes and metabolic pathways of cps have been discovered and characterized as well as several improving methods and critical parameters have been established however limitations and difficulties still exist in cps mineralization such as the dechlorination of poly cps under aerobic condition and the ring cleavage of mcps and phenol under anaerobic condition several new strategies have shown the potential to overcome some current limitations such as coupling functional materials reasonably employing degradative bacteria and applying sequential anaerobic aerobic reactors or bes future researches should focus on further grasping the information on strain enzyme gene and the mechanism of microbial interactions and deeply understanding the specific role of functional materials in cps biodegradation the enormous application potential of novel biotechnologies e g genetic enzyme engineering and microbial 3d printing technology and the development of new operating modes e g sequential cathode anode cascaded mode and microaerobic regulation

environment and human health and safety alkhuraiji and alkhuraiji 2019 chen et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 singh and garg 2019 zhao et al 2018 due to their carcinogenic mutagenic and cytotoxic properties the world health organization who and the united states environmental protection agency usepa have defined cps as potential human carcinogens and priority pollutants igbinosa et al 2013 several strategies have been proposed to remove cps while biotechnology has become the most attractive and potential one due to its low cost and eco friendly characteristics berillo et al 2019 dvorak et al 2017 shen et al 2005 till now many microbial strains species consortia have been identified and enriched to possess a variety of degradation capabilities pathways and mechanisms for making cps less toxic or completely mineralized farrell and quilty 1999 martinez jardines et al 2018 nordin et al 2005 biological treatment technology can be mainly divided into two categories aerobic and anaerobic degradation as for the aerobic cps degradation process the ring cleavage and dechlorination reactions are mainly driven by diverse monooxygenases dioxygenases isomerase and hydrolase while the anaerobic cps degradation process completed through reductive dehalogenases rds and carboxylase mediated dechlorination and ring cleavage reactions several cps mineralization pathways have been discovered and proposed in pure cultures figs 1 2 bae et al 1996 belchik and xun 2008 farrell and quilty 1999 geng et al 2020 hollender et al 1997 huang et al 2008b koh et al 1997 matus et al 2003 moiseeva et al 2001 nordin et al 2005 ohtsubo et al 1999 perkins et al 1990 sanchez and gonzalez 2007 uotila et al 1992 yang et al 2009 zhang and wiegel 1990 however due to the high toxicity of cps as well as the low activity and rarity of related functional enzymes limitations and difficulties of cps biodegradation do exist which have been poorly discussed and reviewed when degrading cps aerobically especially when degrading polychlorophenols poly cps in single aerobic strain chlorinated intermediate metabolites e g 2 6 dichloro and tetrachloro hydroquinone would remain and are difficult to be further dechlorinated resulting in the accumulation of dead end products snyder et al 2006 westmeier and rehm 1987 as for the anaerobic degradation process the dechlorination products such as 4 cp and phenol often can t achieve efficient ring cleavage due to the lack of necessary and sustainable electron acceptors el sayed 2016 jiang et al 2018 recently many promising methods have been proposed to enhance the cps biodegradation rate in pure or mixed culture in addition to the application of high performance activated sludge and the introduction of novel functional materials new operating mode and more efficient biotechnologies have also been applied to enhance the cps mineralization efficiency the introduction of functional materials could well complement and facilitate cps biodegradation for instance materials with high redox potential e g manganese oxides or with catalytic properties n doped tio2 could provide supplementary oxidative ring cleavage pathway to cooperate with the microbial ring cleavage pathway thus enhancing the entire cps degradation efficiency wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2017 iron oxides such as hematite and magnetite could promote cps dechlorination by improving the electron transfer ability of the system jiang et al 2018 furthermore the sequential anaerobic aerobic cps degrading bioreactor has great advantage allowing cps to be more effectively dechlorinated anaerobically and mineralized aerobically lopez echartea et al 2019 ribarova et al 2001 bioelectrochemical system bes also has much more potential for cps biodegradation through employing bioanode biocathode to provide continuous and necessary electron acceptors donors kronenberg et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 in bes the anode can be utilized as an electron acceptor to promote the microbial oxidative degradation of cps and their intermediates while the cathode can be served as an electron donor to efficiently accelerate the microbial reductive dechlorination of cps and refractory chlorinated intermediates the improvement and optimization of electrode materials can further enhance their oxidative or reductive ability to cps several reviews have provided more discussion about the specific biodegradation process of cps mainly from the perspective of molecular mechanism including degradative genes expression and enzymatic catalytic characteristic arora and bae 2014a wu et al 2004 for instance solyanikova and golovleva 2004 discussed the specific gene clusters and enzyme systems responsible for each step in the aerobic biodegradation pathways of cps as for the dechlorination process the different types of dehalogenases involved as well as the corresponding encoding genes were also summarized arora and bae 2014b villemur 2013 however few reviews focused on providing a comprehensive comparison and discussion of various biodegradation processes several previous papers reviewed the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation processes of cps yet their review time is early annachhatre and gheewala 1996 field and sierra alvarez 2007 steiert and crawford 1985 in recent years new biodegradative bacteria and enzymes were discovered the potential of bes in wastewater treatment was excavated and the introduction of functional materials to promote biodegradation was developed therefore a comprehensive review is urgently needed to point out the latest critical challenges and opportunities in the field of cps biodegradation in this review the up to date biodegradation pathways functional bacteria and enzymes improvement strategies and existing challenges in the aerobic and anaerobic cps biodegradation modes are provided and then the opportunities for efficient cps biodegradation in the sequential anaerobic aerobic bioreactors and emerging bes are further discussed moreover critical perspectives are also proposed including the need to further understand the information and effect of functional microorganisms and materials the potential application of innovative biotechnologies and new operating modes and the scale up of bioreactors the objective of this review is to systematically summarize the current advances of the biodegradation strategies of cps and provide new insights and guidance for the enhanced removal of cps from various environments using green and sustainable biotechnologies 2 aerobic biodegradation of cps several aerobic biodegradation mechanisms of cps have been reported and a few bacterial species strains capable of utilizing cps aerobically have been isolated and taxonomically identified table 2 lobo et al 2018 wang et al 2019a in this section the aerobic biodegradation pathways for mcps dcps and poly cps as well as the corresponding functional bacterial species strains enzymes and stimulation strategies capable of enhancing the cps degradation efficiency will be described and reviewed furthermore the critical challenges for the aerobic cps biodegradation are also highlighted 2 1 aerobic biodegradation of mcps and dcps due to the less number of chlorine groups mcps and dcps are relatively less toxic and can achieve ring cleavage and degradation without prior dechlorination fig 1a g farrell and quilty 1999 fava et al 1995 khan et al 2011a knackmuss and hellwig 1978 moiseeva et al 2001 solyanikova and golovleva 2004 westerberg et al 2000 monooxygenases play the major role in the first step of degradation generally monooxygenases e g 4 cp 2 monooxygenase 2 cp 6 monooxygenase and 2 4 dcp 6 monooxygenase with the function of oxidative ortho hydroxylation will be responsible for the initial transformation of mcps and dcps into chlorocatechols ccs fig 1a b d e f g but distinctively the 4 cp 4 monooxygenase with the function of oxidative dechlorination was also found to be able to participate in the first step of the aerobic 4 cp biodegradation to produce chlorine free hydroquinone and hydroxyquinol fig 1c the earlier toxicity reduction of 4 cp via oxidative dechlorination could improve the whole biodegradation efficiency of 4 cp bae et al 1996 nordin et al 2005 after the first step of cps conversion is catalyzed via monooxygenases dioxygenases with the function of ring cleavage will start to function to complete the further mineralization of the intermediates there mainly exist two categories of aerobic ring cleavage pathways ortho cleavage via 1 2 dioxygenase type i ortho cleavage degradation of chlorine free aromatics via hydroxyquinol type ii modified ortho cleavage degradation of chloroaromatic via cc type iii new modified ortho cleavage similar to type ii while the degradation pathway after ring cleavage is slightly different and meta cleavage via 2 3 dioxygenase fig 1a g dorn and knackmuss 1978 farrell and quilty 1999 moiseeva et al 2002 since the meta cleavage pathway may lead to the production of toxic and dead end intermediates the ortho cleavage pathway is a more common pathway of aerobic cps biodegradation the aerobic biodegradation pathways of 4 cp 2 cp 3 cp and 2 4 dcp as well as the specific functional bacteria and enzymes participating in were summarized and discussed fig 1a g table 2 finkel shtein et al 2000 goswami et al 2002 im et al 2004 konovalova et al 2009 olaniran et al 2017 tarao and seto 2000 as for the aerobic biodegradation of 4 cp in strains such as rhodococcus opacus 6a containing 4 cp 2 monooxygenase 4 cc 1 2 dioxygenase chloromuconate cycloisomerase and dienelactone hydrolase 4 cp can be catabolized via the modified ortho cleavage fig 1a farrell and quilty 2002 finkel shtein et al 2000 konovalova et al 2009 while in strains like comamonas testosteroni jh5 4 cp can be degraded via meta cleavage under the action of 4 cc 2 3 dioxygenase 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase 4 oxalocrotonate isomerase 4 oxalocrotonate decarboxylase and 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase fig 1b el sayed et al 2014 hollender et al 1997 im et al 2004 moreover 4 cp can achieve dechlorination firstly and then ring cleavage via hydroquinone and hydroxyquinol in arthrobacter ureafaciens cpr70 and arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6 bae et al 1996 nordin et al 2005 fig 1c 4 cp 4 monooxygenase and 4 cc 4 monooxygenase play an important role to catalyze the oxidative dechlorination of 4 cp in this degradation pathway as for the aerobic degradation of 2 cp and 3 cp only the pathways via the formation of cc rather than via hydroquinone or hydroxyquinol like 4 cp have been discovered and confirmed 2 cp can be firstly converted into 3 cc by 2 cp 6 monooxygenase and then be further catabolized under the modified ortho cleavage via 3cc 1 2 dioxygenase chloromuconate cycloisomerase and dienelactone hydrolase in strains like pseudomonas sp b13 schlomann 1994 fig 1d up new modified ortho cleavage via 3 cc 1 2 dioxygenase chloromuconate cycloisomerase chloromuconolactone isomerase and dienelactone hydrolase in rhodococcus opacus 1cp moiseeva et al 2001 moiseeva et al 2002 fig 1d down or meta cleavage via 3 cc 2 3 dioxygenase oxalocrotonate tautomerase and oxalocrotonate decarboxylase in stenotrophomonas maltophilia kb2 wojcieszynska et al 2013 fig 1e as for 3 cp it will firstly generate 4 cc or 3 cc with 3 cp 6 monooxygenase or 3 cp 2 monooxygenase respectively and then be catabolized via ortho or meta cleavage pathway through the mentioned above enzymes fig 1f hollender et al 2000 table 2 as for the aerobic biodegradation of 2 4 dcp it can be directly converted into 3 5 dichlorocatechol 3 5 dcc through 2 4 dcp 6 monooxygenase and be further catabolized via the modified ortho cleavage in stains like alcaligenes eutrophus jmp134 with 3 5 dcc 1 2 dioxygenase and 2 4 dichloromuconic acid isomerase perkins et al 1990 fig 1g up or via meta cleavage in a eutrophus jmp222 via 3 5 dcc 2 3 dioxygenase a derivative of a eutrophus jmp134 lost plasmid pjp4 koh et al 1997 olaniran et al 2017 fig 1g down table 2 2 2 aerobic biodegradation of poly cps because of the presence of more chlorine groups poly cps are more toxic and refractory than mcps and dcps and cannot achieve ring cleavage and mineralization without prior dechlorination fig 1h k li et al 1991 matus et al 2003 ohtsubo et al 1999 zaborina et al 1998 the toxicity of poly cps needs to be firstly reduced via oxidative dechlorination to complete further mineralization several monooxygenases e g 2 4 5 tcp 4 monooxygenase 2 4 6 tcp 4 monooxygenase and pcp 4 monooxygenase and cytochrome p 450 type enzyme a coenzyme of monooxygenase with the function of oxidative dechlorination were found to participate in the initial aerobic biodegradation pathway of poly cps to produce chlorohydroquinone louie et al 2002 ohtsubo et al 1999 uotila et al 1992 uotila et al 1991 webb et al 2010 the chlorohydroquinone would then be dechlorinated by functional monooxygenases dehalogenases to achieve further toxic reduction uotila et al 1992 zaborina et al 1998 when the number of chlorine groups decreases below three the intermediate products would be less toxic and could proceed ring cleavage under the action of ring cleavage dioxygenases to complete catabolism the aerobic biodegradation pathways of the representative poly cps 2 4 5 trichlorophenol 2 4 5 tcp 2 4 6 tcp and pentachlorophenol pcp were illustrated fig 1h k the specific bacterial species strains responsible for the aerobic biodegradation of poly cps were summarized table 2 jesus et al 2009 kao et al 2005 webb et al 2010 xun and webster 2004 their degradation pathways are similar to some extent 2 4 5 tcp 2 4 6 tcp and pcp will firstly complete dechlorination to generate less chlorinated hydroquinone or hydroxyquinol via functional monooxygenase and dehalogenase and then the less toxic intermediates will be further catabolized via dioxygenase fig 1h k however aerobic strains capable of completely mineralizing tcps and pcp are scarce table 2 in some cases the toxic chlorinated intermediates of poly cps e g 2 5 dichloro 2 6 dichloro and tetrachloro hydroquinone may accumulate and inactivate functional enzymes due to their difficulty in further dechlorination orser and lange 1994 uotila et al 1991 functional enzymes play a key role in catalyzing cps biodegradation table 3 the biodegradation of mcps and dcps mainly relies on enzymes with ring cleavage function while the biodegradation of poly cps mainly depends on enzymes with dechlorination and ring cleavage functions important monooxygenases and dioxygenases that catalyze aerobic dechlorination and ring cleavage processes are combined with other functional enzymes e g dehalogenase cycloisomerase hydrolase isomerase and reductase that catalyze the transformation of intermediates to complete the whole cps mineralization process fig 1 table 3 ferraroni et al 2006 ferraroni et al 2004 hammer et al 1993 hayes et al 2012 kaschabek and reineke 1993 kwon et al 2014 okuta et al 2003 porter et al 2014 seibert et al 1993 zaborina et al 1995 the crystal structure of the enzyme dictates the position of active sites and the type of residues which further determine the catalytic activity and ability during the enzyme catalytic process ferraroni et al 2013 katti et al 1989 kuhm et al 1990 solyanikova and golovleva 2004 for instance the crystal of hydroxyquinol 1 2 dioxygenase isolated from nocardioides simplex 3e shows the extensive openings and consequent exposure to the solution in the upper part of the catalytic cavity and this structure arrangement favors the binding of hydroxyquinol rather than catechol making this enzyme better at degrading hydroxyquinol ferraroni et al 2005 moreover the residues containing in the enzyme structure also show a correlation with the enzyme catalytic performance the histidine residue his 289 in the monooxygenase of burkholderia cepacia ac1100 plays an important role in catalyzing the initial steps of tcp degradation tcp to dichlorohydroquinone webb et al 2010 the conserved his 199 in catechol 2 3 dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida mt 2 also seems to function critically in the enzyme catalytic process of chlorocatechol kita et al 1999 however the specific relationship between the enzyme crystal structures and the enzyme function are still unclear which need be further studied also it s worth noting that the cps degrading enzymes are similar to those involved in degrading other chloroaromatics so the research scope of this part is relatively extensive in the future researchers should continue to explore the crystal structures of the functional enzymes and try to figure out their specific roles in the catalytic process the functional enzymes could be designed modified and combined more accurately and reasonably through enzyme engineering which would further promote the degradation of cps and other chloroaromatics 2 3 key strategies to improve aerobic cps biodegradation efficiency with the development of aerobic biotechnology effective strategies have also been applied to degrade cps showing better performance and prospects gallego et al 2001 tomei and angelucci 2019 the application of aerobic granular sludges has great potential with higher biomass concentration and more excellent settling capacity stable granules show a higher toxicity tolerance and degradation rate of 4 cp and 2 4 6 tcp compared with fluffy sludges gomez acata et al 2018 miao et al 2014 wei et al 2015 besides the biodegradation of cps in certain nitrifying consortium could be achieved via co metabolism by the catalysis of functional ammonia oxygenase of nitrifiers where the nitrifiers can not only endure the toxicity of cps but also promote the removal of cps tran et al 2013 martinez jardines et al 2018 shows that the co metabolic degradation rate of 2 cp via ammonium monooxygenase increases with the increase of initial ammonia concentration in the nitrifying system acclimated with ammonium and 2 cp for 11 months this provides ideas not only for promoting the degradation of cps but also for dealing with the co contamination of cps and ammonia nitrogen silva et al 2011 wei et al 2015 several functional materials with high redox potential can also be introduced biogenic manganese oxides biomnox in situ generated by the oxidation of mn ii with manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob can be coupled with the cps degrading bacteria in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr to achieve high cps degradation efficiency tu et al 2015 wang et al 2019a the biomnox with many mn iv vacancies and large surface areas can provide an alternative meta cleavage pathway for 4 cp degradation which is complementary to the ortho cleavage pathway employed by the degradative bacteria fig 3 a 2 4 the difficulty in aerobic cps biodegradation dechlorination dechlorination is the key step in aerobic cps biodegradation which determines the degradation efficiency and rate the lack or lower activity of enzymes with dechlorination function in most aerobic strains chen et al 2013 payne et al 2015 as well as the rarity of related functional strains make dechlorination the biggest obstacle in the aerobic biodegradation of cps especially when degrading poly cps in most cases without the related functional strains mentioned before the chlorinated intermediate metabolites may fail to be dechlorinated and thus finally accumulate for example chlorinated meta cleavage intermediates generated by 2 3 dioxygenase such as 5 chloroformyl 2 hydroxypenta 2 4 dienoic acid from 2 cp and 3 cp as well as 5 chloro 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde from 4 cp have been widely reported as highly toxic dead end intermediates which will bind irreversibly to functional enzymes e g mono and dioxygenases and result in their inactivation bartels et al 1984 klecka and gibson 1981 rafiee et al 2012 reineke et al 1982 westmeier and rehm 1987 the primary chlorinated metabolites of higher toxic tcps and pcp 2 6 dichlorohydroquinone and tetrachlorohydroquinone are also difficult to be further degraded in most aerobic strains due to the difficulty in further dechlorination li et al 1991 snyder et al 2006 moreover although several strains enzymes have shown the ability to achieve the oxidative dechlorination of cps under aerobic condition as mentioned above their oxidative dechlorination rate is much lower than the reductive dechlorination rate of cps under anaerobic condition d angelo and reddy 2000 olaniran and igbinosa 2011 therefore the challenges of dechlorination hinder the efficient and complete aerobic mineralization of cps providing an efficient and sustainable dechlorination environment for cps and the toxic chlorinated intermediates during the aerobic degradation process could substantially increase the overall mineralization efficiency such as coupling anaerobic condition or the biocathode in bes which will be further discussed subsequently 3 anaerobic biodegradation of cps 3 1 anaerobic biodegradation process of cps unlike the aerobic biodegradation process dechlorination processes are much easier to happen in anaerobic condition where the chlorines in cps can be replaced by hydrogens to produce mcps or phenol thus achieving the toxicity reduction lin et al 2019 the anaerobic degradation rate with cps as the only carbon and energy sources is very slow for the lack of electron donors therefore it is necessary to introduce hydrogen or co substrates e g acetate and lactate as efficient electron donors to enhance the dechlorination rate hydrogen has been widely believed to be able to directly participate in the dechlorination reaction and provide electrons el sayed 2016 li et al 2013b while the specific role of co substrates is unclear whether the co substrates are directly involved in dechlorination or indirectly participate in dechlorination by producing hydrogen through fermentation or both needs to be further studied many anaerobic bacterial species strains capable of dechlorinating cps have been discovered and isolated table 4 adrian et al 2007 gerritse et al 1996 sun et al 2000 tront et al 2006 van de pas et al 2001 zhang et al 2012 in these dechlorinators rds are the most critical and responsible enzymes for dechlorination process liang et al 2012 different bacterial strains may have different functional genes e g crda cpra1 5 and hcbb1 3 ito et al 2018 villemur 2013 which encode different types of rds determining different dechlorination selectivity ortho meta or para position table 4 for instance in desulfitobacterium hafniense pcp 1 the 2 4 6 tcp rd system encoded by crda is responsible for the removal of ortho and para position chlorines and the 3 5 dcp rd system encoded by cpra5 is in charge of the removal of meta position chlorines gauthier et al 2006 moreover as for the rds themselves their crystal structures are critical point which directly determine their activity to different type cps and affect their ability for dechlorination there are many types of rds that catalyze different dehalogenation processes of different halogenated organic compounds up to now several rds have been purified and their crystal structures have been studied which help researchers further understand the molecular mechanisms of enzyme catalyzed dehalogenation process bommer et al 2014 payne et al 2015 however as for rds able to catalyze the dechlorination of cps their crystal structural information is still less which need be focused in the future to understand their active site environments and the key catalytic residues to further promote cps dechlorination furthermore dechlorinators have limited ring cleavage ability to achieve further effective degradation of the dechlorinated product phenol therefore the reasonable combination of anaerobic dechlorinators and anaerobic phenol degraders in anaerobic bioreactors is a better choice where cps can be effectively converted to phenol by dechlorinators with functional rds and to small molecules of volatile fatty acids vfas by phenol degraders with functional phenol carboxylase and dehydroxylase the specific dehydroxylase and encoding genes haven t been reported yet and eventually be mineralized into co2 and ch4 via benzoate pathway fig 2a b c table 5 becker et al 1999 geng et al 2020 li et al 2010 qian et al 2020 yang et al 2009 zhang and wiegel 1990 notably the anaerobic dechlorinators and anaerobic phenol degraders often need to be acclimated separately in advance and then combined because the anaerobic phenol degraders are often difficult to screen out spontaneously from the cps contaminated anaerobic environment li et al 2010 yang et al 2009 3 2 parameters affecting dechlorination performance there are many parameters that may affect the anaerobic cps dechlorination performance including the location of chlorines the type and concentration of the co substrate temperature etc selective dechlorination is an interesting topic in the anaerobic biodegradation of cps which is directly related to the location of chlorine and the type of biodegradative bacteria and enzymes table 4 generally the para position chlorine group is the hardest to remove meta position chlorine comes second and ortho position chlorine is most easily eliminated song et al 2019 the type of co substrate may also affect the selective dechlorination process since different co substrate may induce different enzyme activity ortho meta or para rds for instance formate and sucrose tend to promote the para dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp while yeast extract and methanol tend to facilitate the ortho dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp puyol et al 2009 besides affecting the dechlorination selectivity different co substrate may also result in different promotion efficiency for dechlorination khan et al 2011b wang et al 2012 majumder and gupta 2008 suggests that glucose and methanol easily convert to acetate are more beneficial to promote 2 cp and 2 4 dcp dechlorination compared with formate easily convert to co2 and propionate difficult to anaerobically degrade in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb which may be due to the fact that acetate product has better fermentation performance to produce an efficient electron donor h2 therefore it is important to choose suitable co substrate for different types of cps in different situation temperature is also a critical parameter affecting anaerobic dechlorination process mesophilic condition is more conducive for dechlorination than thermophilic condition leven and schnurer 2005 limam et al 2016 tas and pavlostathis 2007 on one hand higher temperature 40 c would enhance the methanogenesis process which would competitively consume large amounts of available electron donors required for reductive dechlorination process fletcher et al 2011b on the other hand the activity of the dechlorinators would be affected take the typical dechlorinator dehalococcoides sp as an example the 16s rrna gene and functional gene abundances related to dechlorination at 30 c exceed those measured at higher temperature 35 c in dehalococcoides sp which shows the inhibition of the dechlorination activity at higher temperature fletcher et al 2011a friis et al 2007 furthermore introducing functional materials can also efficiently enhance the anaerobic dechlorination rate which could be mainly attributed to the increase of electron transfer and redox rate in the anaerobic dechlorination system for instance alumina particles immobilized with fulvic acids and biochar carrageenan microspheres were able to be served as solid phase redox mediator to facilitate the microbial dechlorination process alvarez et al 2012 ji et al 2019 besides the metal oxide nanoparticles especially the iron oxides such as hematite and magnetite have also shown great potential in promoting cps dechlorination process by facilitating the electron transfer of the system jiang et al 2018 the fe ii fe iii redox couple formed on the iron surface could participate in and promote the electron transfer process and thus finally facilitate the 4 cp dechlorination process fig 3b kim et al 2019 the presence of iron oxides nanoparticles would also promote the selective enrichment of the iron oxidizing bacteria geobacter a well known electroactive bacteria that have strains able to degrade phenolic compounds and can promote extracellular electron transfer eet during the reaction to improve the biodegradation process fig 3b zhang et al 2013 3 3 the difficulties in anaerobic cps biodegradation as for the anaerobic microbial mineralization of cps limitations and difficulties do exist including i para dechlorination is hard and ii ring cleavage rate is slow bacterial strains containing highly active para rds and able to achieve para position chlorine removal are few make 4 cp often become the final accumulated product of cps dechlorination reactions table 4 el sayed 2016 li et al 2013b puyol et al 2009 song et al 2018 in addition achieving efficient ring cleavage process is much more difficult in the anaerobic environment than in the aerobic environment due to the lack of sufficient electron acceptors like oxygen therefore the anaerobic mineralization rate of phenol or mcps is much slow el sayed 2016 haggblom 1998 li et al 2016 in summary anaerobic biodegradation technology is better in terms of dechlorination especially for poly cps and it has lower energy consumption however the difficulties and limitations of the further mineralization of several dechlorinated products such as 4 cp or phenol have become the critical problems in the anaerobic degradation process providing efficient and sustainable electron acceptors such as oxygen or the electrode in bes for the dechlorination products could be a promising strategy to improve the complete removal of cps 4 consortium mediated cps biodegradation in addition to pure degradative bacteria degradative consortia have also been widely studied in cps biodegradation the consortium mediated cps biodegradation have shown much higher cps tolerance and removal ability due to the interaction and synergy of different species and the expression and possession of complete metabolic enzymes required for the whole degradation process while the pure bacterial strain may sometimes only express the enzymes that function on transforming parent products to toxic intermediates and the toxic intermediates may accumulate due to the lack of relevant degradative enzymes patel and kumar 2016b for instance pseudomonas sp tcp114 shows the ability to degrade 2 4 6 tcp and arthrobacter sp cpr706 is able to degrade 4 cp but when 2 4 6 tcp 4 cp and phenol exist together in the medium neither of the two pure strains can degrade any of the contaminants present however when the two strains were mixed the resulting defined consortium could degrade all the three phenolic compounds tcp 4 cp and phenol simultaneously in one medium bae et al 1997 moreover none of the four pure strains bacillus endophyticus cp1r genbank accession no km259919 bacillus cereus 3ys km522855 kocuria rhizophila 11y km522854 and pseudomonas aeruginosa gf km259920 is able to degrade 3 cp and 4 cp at a higher concentration individually but the bacterial consortium with the mixture of these four strains show much higher tolerance and degradation ability of 3 cp and 4 cp patel and kumar 2016b besides the defined mixed consortia microbial consortia with the ability of degrading cps can also be gradually enriched and formed in bioreactors with cps treatment or environment with cps contamination el sayed 2016 li et al 2013a liang et al 2017 liang et al 2015 patel and kumar 2016a sulfate reducing consortium shows the ability to obtain bacteria adapted to 2 cp degradation in bioreactors ulises garcia cruz et al 2018 the microorganisms collected from a sediment near an oil refinery are also able to be enriched into a cps degrading consortium with the predominance of anaerospora hongkongensis pseudomonas stutzeri pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes clostridium sp and desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans to degrade 2 3 dcp and mcps el sayed et al 2018 similarly in the cps contaminated sites the copy numbers of dechlorinators dehalobacterium and sulfurospirillum spp and phenol degraders geobacter spp proliferate remarkably and remain at a high level in the enriched consortium when degrading 4 cp and 2 4 6 tcp li et al 2015 5 sequential anaerobic aerobic biodegradation of cps cps mainly perform reductive dechlorination under anaerobic environment while in aerobic conditions cps are subject to ring cleavage steiert and crawford 1985 therefore combining anaerobic and aerobic processes to achieve cascaded dechlorination and ring cleavage of cps is a more efficient and advisable option majumder and gupta 2008 2009 oliveira et al 2020 pathiraja et al 2019 puyol et al 2015 since the operating mechanism and condition of anaerobic and aerobic functional bacteria are different they were arranged in two separate bioreactors the mixed culture containing anaerobic dechlorinators will be acclimated and enriched in the anaerobic bioreactor to firstly achieve cps dechlorination and the enrichment with dominant aerobic phenol degraders will involve in further mineralization in the following aerobic bioreactor sequential uasb and aerobic suspended growth asg reactors have been used to treat pcp 2 4 6 tcp and 2 4 dcp results showed that these two bioreactors could cooperate well to achieve efficient mineralization atuanya et al 2000 similarly uasb has also been coupled with aerobic continuous stirred tank reactor cstr to treat 2 4 dcp wastewater under continuous flow condition the mineralization efficiency of 120 mg l 1 2 4 dcp can achieve 86 67 which is much higher than either alone sponza and ulukoy 2006 lopez echartea et al 2019 further expanded the reactor size to pilot scale and realized the bioremediation of cps contaminated sawmill soil likewise in addition to the traditional sequential bioreactors the utilization of photosynthetic bacteria psb may be a more potential and novel approach to mineralize cps existing researches have shown that in light anaerobic condition cps can achieve anaerobic dechlorination and oxygen can be gradually generated via photosynthesis in psb while in dark aerobic condition phenolic compounds can complete aerobic ring cleavage kong et al 2014b lu et al 2019 this provides us with a promising strategy by allocating the lighting time to psb reasonably cps may achieve dechlorination first and then realize sequentially efficient mineralization under light anaerobic and dark aerobic switched condition fig 4 it is greatly potential to achieve the sequential anaerobic aerobic biodegradation of cps in the psb assisted single chamber bioreactors 6 cps degradation in bioelectrochemical system bes in the process of cps biodegradation the main reasons leading to the failure of mineralization are i the accumulation of intermediate metabolites and ii the difficulty of highly efficient dechlorination bes has potential to solve these problems well on one hand the anode in bes could be served as sustainable electron acceptors to more quickly metabolize the accumulated products and convert them into electricity both achieving power generation and promoting cps further degradation miran et al 2017 on the other hand the cathode in bes could provide continuous electrons to promote some difficult to dechlorinate products to complete dechlorination with the development of bes it has been increasingly applied to degrade cps in this section we will provide a comprehensive summary of the bioelectrochemical degradation of cps and some critical perspectives 6 1 biodegradation of cps with biocathode the cathode in bes have shown a great ability to reduce cps to phenol the carbon sources e g acetate and glucose supplied to the bes bioanode can be converted to electrons through electroactive bacteria and then the electrons will flow to the cathode through an external circuit and finally react with cps to complete dechlorination and toxicity reduction fig 5 b compared with anaerobic biodegradation the carbon sources required for bes can be reduced by 5 times the energy consumption is also reduced by 5 30 times compared with conventional electrochemical system wen et al 2013 in addition to the contribution of abiotic cathode to dechlorination biocathode and improved electrode materials began to be used to further improve the reaction efficiency fig 5d table 6 khan et al 2019 kong et al 2014a kong et al 2014b lin et al 2019 yao et al 2019 dechlorinators are introduced into the cathode to form biocathode including pure culture like the 2 cp degrading anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans 2cp 1 strycharz et al 2010 or microbial community like the 4 cp degrading psb and the acclimated 2 4 6 tcp degrading consortium khan et al 2019 kong et al 2014b with the addition of small amounts of carbon sources in the cathode chamber the biocathode shows stronger dechlorination ability fig 5d ii besides the higher dechlorination efficiency bes cathode also shows a higher selectivity for para position dechlorination of cps which is of great advantage since the para position chlorine is usually difficult to remove in pure anaerobic biological system 4 cp was widely used as the target pollutant in bes experiment and the experimental results showed that 4 cp could be efficiently and selectively reduced to phenol by the bes cathode table 6 as for electrode materials carbon based materials such as graphite and carbon cloth are the most commonly used electrodes which have good biocompatibility but limited conductivity liu et al 2014 composing metal and carbon based materials to form composite materials have proven to be a better choice besides maintaining the good biocompatibility they can increase the electron transfer efficiency between cps and the cathode thus enhancing the cps dechlorination rate kong et al 2014a li et al 2020 wei et al 2011 table 6 to further degrade the biocathode dechlorinated product other stimulation strategies have been conducted as mentioned above the ring cleavage reactions of phenol and cps can be driven by oxygen coincidentally oxygen is the most commonly used electron acceptor in the bes cathode the supply of modest oxygen n2 o2 60 40 in cathode has been shown to enable further mineralization of 2 4 6 tcp and pcp after dechlorination fig 5d iii table 6 huang et al 2012 huang et al 2014 however there are few studies focusing on using other electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate in the cathode to achieve cps mineralization on one hand the redox potential of nitrate and sulfate is lower than that of oxygen so their reduction process in cathode have less competition with cps dechlorination on the other hand denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria srb using phenol or even cps as the only electron donors have been found and studied widely arellano gonzalez et al 2016 chang et al 2004 garcia cruz et al 2018 martinez gutierrez et al 2019 xia et al 2011 introducing nitrate or sulfate into the cathode chamber to realize the mineralization of cps can not only reduce the energy consumption required by oxygen exposure but also provide a new insight and possibility for treating the co contaminated environment of nutrients and cps fig 5d iv 6 2 biodegradation of cps with bioanode generally due to the high toxicity cps are difficult to be directly used as a bes anode fuel however due to the application of versatile consortium and the discovery of new materials and degradation mechanisms the methods to mineralize cps successfully in anode have gradually been found and converting cps into electrical power becomes a more meaningful experimental design hassan et al 2019 table 7 the cases that have been shown to achieve cps degradation in anode include i introducing specific functional bacteria hassan et al 2016 kong et al 2014b miran et al 2017 ii applying catalytic anode materials zhou et al 2017 and iii adding co substrates huang et al 2011 li et al 2018 wang et al 2012 yu et al 2019 table 7 it s a good strategy to inoculate the highly efficient degraders in the anode to promote the degradation of cps and form low toxicity products which can be further mineralized and generate electricity in the bioanode fig 5a exoelectrogenic srb and psb have shown the ability to degrade 4 cp and bacillus subtilis were able to catalyze 2 4 dcp degradation in the bioanode hassan et al 2016 kong et al 2014b miran et al 2017 besides these bacteria electroactive geobacter metallireducens also shows the ability to degrade phenol under anaerobic condition jiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 geobacter can also enhance cps dechlorination by promoting eet which may be the other advantage to introduce geobacter in the bioanode for cps dechlorination and mineralization another choice is to design anode materials with strong catalytic oxidation capability to promote the initial ring cleavage of cps bioanodes coating photocatalytic materials e g n doped tio2 and mpg c3n4 showed higher mineralization efficiency of cps e g 4 cp and 2 4 6 tcp due to the synergetic effects of electrocatalysis and microbial catalysis fig 5c i wang et al 2019c zhou et al 2017 in addition it s also useful to modify the electrode with high redox potential material for instance polypyrrole Œ≤ mno2 modified graphite felt bioanode has shown the ability to enhance phenol degradation in the bes anode by promoting the ring cleavage process fig 5c ii chen et al 2017 therefore designing new electrode materials with high redox potential could effectively promote the cps degradation in the anode zhang and liu 2020 furthermore adding co substrates such as glucose and acetate can also effectively facilitate the bioanodes to degrade cps huang et al 2011 wang et al 2012 although not as effective as the first two methods it is the easiest one to implement the co substrates can be served as electron donors to promote the dechlorination process of cps in the bioanode and thus enhance the detoxification of pollutants the co substrates can also stimulate the bacterial growth and act as an inducer of the degradative enzymes e g rds to thus enhance the biodegradation ability of the bioanode chiranjeevi and patil 2020 huang et al 2011 majumder and gupta 2008 6 3 sequential cathode anode degradation of cps in bes the cathode provides electrons which is more conducive to reductive dechlorination while the anode accepts electrons which is better for oxidative mineralization therefore similar to the sequential anaerobic aerobic bioreactor sequential cathode anode cascaded mode is also a promising strategy for the complete mineralization of contaminants fig 5e kong et al 2014b yang et al 2020 phenol generated from cps dechlorination in the cathode can be shifted to the anode and achieve further degradation however few information is available for this strategy which may be due to the need to constantly transfer the cathode effluent to the anode but this mode has several advantages i simple operating conditions no special dechlorination bacteria or expensive new electrodes need to be introduced into the anode ii saving anode carbon source the introduced phenol can not only achieve further degradation but also can be served as a supplementary carbon source for the bioanode thus reducing the amount of other carbon sources required in conclusion both anode and cathode in bes has great potential in degrading and even mineralizing cps through a number of strategies hassan et al 2016 kong et al 2014a the selection of the specific operating mode anode degradation cathode degradation or sequential cathode anode degradation may depend on the actual situation of the cps contaminated environment to be remediated 7 future perspectives for cps biodegradation the biodegradation processes of cps under aerobic anaerobic or bioelectrochemical condition have certain correlations whether in the application of functional bacteria or materials in this section the future perspectives for the overall cps biodegradation are provided aiming to further improve the degradation rate and scale of the biological systems 7 1 further grasp microbial information and apply novel biotechnologies diverse bacterial species have been discovered to degrade cps mainly including pseudomonas sp rhodococcus sp bacillus sp cupriavidus sp dehalococcoides sp dehalobacter sp and desulfitobacterium sp konovalova et al 2009 matus et al 2003 moiseeva et al 2002 song et al 2019 villemur 2013 wang et al 2014 which contribute to different degradation pathways and capabilities of cps however at this stage researchers need to have a deeper understanding of the microorganisms from bacterial cell to metabolic enzyme and gene level in addition to discover more cps degradative strains e g strains belonging to geobacter metallireducens or dehalococcoides mccartyi the information and types of different degradative genes need to be further grasped as well as their expression activity in different environments in this case the most suitable functional strains could be selected for different cps contaminated environments and the functional gene expression may even be used as biomarker to illustrate the biodegradation activity in addition to the pure culture many degradative consortia can also be acclimated and enriched from the cps contaminated environment which may have better adaptability and degradability for higher concentration cps the specific metabolic relationship between core bacteria enzymes and genes in microbial consortium need to be further studied in the next step such as the impact and role of the non degradative bacteria on the degradative bacteria e g some methanogens including methanosarcina sp and some acetogenic bacteria including desulfovibrio sp may play an important role in mediating acetate and h2 sources for dechlorinator dehalococcoides sp wang et al 2019b as well as the non degradative genes on the degradative genes e g hup and vhu that express hydrogenases may have influence on tcea and vcra that express rds deeper understanding can help us to more reasonably combine strains in one consortium or even design and integrate genes into one bacterium several emerging and innovative biotechnologies provide great possibilities for the future of biodegradation for example using genetic engineering to efficiently combine rds encoding reductive genes with oxygenase encoding oxidative genes to construct synthetic bacteria with enhanced function and selecting an appropriate environment for active expression cps could be efficiently mineralized researches can also design directionally evolve and combine functional enzymes according to their unique crystal structures to further improve their catalytic ability and activity by enzyme engineering another extremely attractive example is that by using new microbial 3d printing technology a promising technology to prepare functional living materials with desirable and controllable microbial community structure gonzalez et al 2020 kyle 2018 mccarthy et al 2019 schaffner et al 2017 the optimized microbiome including anaerobic dechlorinators in the inner anaerobic layer and aerobic phenol degraders in the outer aerobic layer would be artificially constructed to achieve efficient and stable cascade degradation and mineralization of cps fig 6 in conclusion continuing to excavate and understand the microbial information in the cps degrading microbial consortium and resolving the metabolic roles of core members is the major foci in the future the development and application of novel biotechnologies also need to be focused on genetic engineering enzyme engineering and microbiome assembly technology e g microbial 3d printing may be the next frontier in the environmental biotechnology field 7 2 deeply understand the role of materials in cps biodegradation and design better materials in early bioreactors materials are mainly considered as carriers whose function is to load more functional microorganisms with the development of novel functional materials in addition to only serving as carriers materials can also participate in and promote the degradative reactions and combine biological processes to maximize the overall degradation efficiency zhao et al 2019 however there are still few studies focusing on the specific promotion mechanisms of different materials in biodegradation as well as their influence on different microorganisms which need further exploration for example both photocatalytic materials e g n doped tio2 and materials with high redox potential e g biomnox can improve cps biodegradation by promoting ring cleavage reaction but their promotion mechanisms are completely different the former by generating hydroxyl radicals and the latter by providing highly oxidative sites which could lead to different influence on functional bacteria in this case researchers need to figure out whether highly oxidative sites would help increase the activity of functional aerobic bacteria and whether hydroxyl radicals would inactivate several anaerobic bacteria the deeper excavation could help maximize the combination efficiency of functional materials and bacteria besides specific materials may improve the activity of certain relevant bacteria such as iron materials can induce geobacter sp so it is necessary to further study whether the induction of specific bacteria will promote the cps biodegradation or not based on these more functional materials with dual functions of carrier and catalysis promoting better integration with bacterial functions could be designed and applied furthermore utilizing microbial 3d printing technology mentioned above to design and optimize the assembly way of functional microorganisms and materials may also be a promising strategy in the future 7 3 the development and application of new operating modes during cps mineralization process ring cleavage is electron loss reaction more likely to occur in the oxidative condition while dechlorination is electron uptake reaction tending to happen in the reductive condition therefore the development and application of new reasonable operating modes to completely mineralize cps via ring cleavage and dechlorination under more suitable conditions would greatly increase their mineralization rate the sequential anaerobic aerobic bioreactors have been widely studied showing a better performance to degrade cps similarly the sequential cathode anode cascaded mode or microaeration environment in bes is also recommended by microaeration dissolved oxygen do gradient would be formed in the anode cathode biofilm and planktonic flocs which could provide a suitable environment for the anaerobic dechlorination and aerobic ring cleavage of cps thus improving cps degradation efficiency and depth fig 7 besides microaeration would promote the formation of flocs in planktonic sludge and enhance the diversity activity and differentiation of functional anaerobic community e g hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria which would also promote the anaerobic cps biodegradation cheng et al 2015 duc and khanal 2018 yang et al 2018 the degradation metabolites would be further degraded with bioanode biocathode fig 7 besides coupling the bes biocathode dechlorination with nitrate or sulfate reduction bioreactors is also a promising operating mode with the potential to simultaneously remove cps and nutrients 7 4 the practical application of bioreactors and in situ bioremediation until now most researches on cps biodegradation are still in laboratory scale and there are very few cases of large scale or in situ bioremediation applications due to the high toxicity of cps on bacteria to achieve the scale up of bioreactors and in situ bioremediation is the challenge and ultimate goal in this field which is inseparable from the discovery of more efficient functional bacteria the design of cheaper and more efficient materials the development of operating modes with high efficiency and the design of novel reactor configurations mikkonen et al 2018 performed a long term full scale in situ aeration in a groundwater contaminated with pcp and tetrachlorophenols tecps the abundances of catabolically capable degraders e g sphingomonadaceae and the gene encoding pcp hydroxylase pcpb have been activated and enriched which can significantly improve the cps removal efficiency through the application of bioaugmentation and the supplement of electron donor hydrogen gas anaerobic in situ pcp bioremediation dechlorination has also been achieved cole 2000 these two successful cases indicate that the indigenous bacteria existing in the cps contaminated environment do contain functional species and genes with the ability to degrade cps however they require necessary auxiliary measures to be activated such as adding co substrate conducting full scale aeration or providing functional materials etc furthermore using immobilized biotechnology to introduce the pre acclimated highly efficient functional bacteria into the cps contaminated site is also a promising strategy to achieve in situ bioremediation for example the potential double layer aerobic layer and anaerobic layer living material designed by 3d printing which is mentioned above may be applied to the cps contaminated environment by supplying proper level of oxygen cps can be effectively degraded from inner anaerobic dechlorination layer to outer aerobic mineralization layer fig 6 as for bioelectrochemical technology its advantages and several improving methods have been discussed based on cps degradation mechanisms section 6 but in practical applications researchers should also pay attention to the innovation of integrated configuration as well as the optimization of electrode layout mode and environmental parameters do ph conductivity etc to achieve in situ bioelectroremediation up to now appliable modular electrode with the potential to be used in actual sewage treatment system has been designed and several electrode optimization arrangements have also been proposed to scale up bes dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however there is still a long way to go to achieve large scale bes treatment especially when dealing with highly toxic contaminants like cps furthermore there may be other pollutants coexisting with cps in the polluted water such as nitrate sulfate other organic compounds and heavy metals the effect of the coexisting pollutants on cps biodegradation as well as the simultaneous removal of the existing pollutants are important research topics as electron acceptors nitrate sulfate may snatch electron donors to inhibit the dechlorination of cps but may promote the biodegradation of phenol in denitrification or sulfate reducing process ahn et al 2009 arellano gonzalez et al 2016 chang et al 2003 yoshida et al 2007 therefore coupling some pretreatment methods to preferentially complete the cps dechlorination in the polluted water containing cps and nitrate sulfate may promote the further simultaneous removal of the pollutants in addition the coexistence of other organic compounds may also affect cps biodegradation puyol et al 2009 wang et al 2012 when coexisting with easily degradable organics e g acetate and glucose the biodegradation efficiency of cps may be promoted however when coexisting with other highly toxic organics such as polycyclic aromatics the functional bacteria responsible for cps degradation may be inhibited the influence of heavy metals cannot be ignored either excessive concentration of heavy metal would be toxic to bacteria and enzymes chen et al 2015 marchlewicz et al 2017 kuo and genthner 1996 showed that when the concentration of heavy metal cd ii cu ii or cr vi was about 2 0 mg l 1 the acclimation time of 2 cp degrading consortium would be extended and the 2 cp degradation efficiency would be decreased when the concentration of heavy metal reached 300 mg l 1 the biodegradation rate and efficiency of cps would be more severely reduced huang et al 2008a in these cases pretreatment strategies may be required to reduce the toxicity of the polluted water and improve the biodegradation performance of cps cost is also a critical consideration in the practical application since the scale efficiency life span and treatment condition are different it is difficult to make a direct and specific economical comparison of different biotechnologies the major cost of anaerobic cps biodegradation process comes from the addition of large amounts of co substrates e g acetate and glucose while the main cost of aerobic cps biodegradation process comes from the aeration process therefore reducing the carbon and energy consumption is a long term goal of the anaerobic and aerobic cps biodegradation several novel biotechnologies such as the anaerobic membrane bioreactors and aerobic granular sludge have shown the potential to reduce the carbon and energy consumption in wastewater treatment process compared with conventional activated sludge technology geng et al 2020 pronk et al 2015 sarma and tay 2018 which may also be applied in cps biodegradation processes moreover the cost would be remarkably increased when introducing functional materials or electrodes into the bioreactors as for bes reactor the cost reduction of the electrodes and the scale up of the system are always hot issues recently wang et al 2020 developed a novel and cost effective scalable electrode modules total volume of 1 m3 for wastewater treatment and the unit cost of the electrode modules was estimated to be 595 7 m 3 although there still exists an increase in the cost of bes compared with pure bioreactors the wastewater treatment efficiency was significantly enhanced therefore it is necessary to find a balance between the economy and efficiency according to different practical environments contaminated by cps different biodegradation processes methods and reactor types need to be selected and applied 8 conclusions the efficiency and scale of cps biodegradation still need to be improved to achieve large scale cps removal or in situ bioremediation this review provides comprehensive information on typical cps biodegradation technologies and establishes their connection diverse aerobic and anaerobic degraders degradative enzymes and metabolic pathways of cps have been discovered and characterized as well as several improving methods and critical parameters have been established however limitations and difficulties still exist in cps mineralization such as the dechlorination of poly cps under aerobic condition and the ring cleavage of mcps and phenol under anaerobic condition several new strategies have shown the potential to overcome some current limitations such as coupling functional materials reasonably employing degradative bacteria and applying sequential anaerobic aerobic reactors or bes future researches should focus on further grasping the information on strain enzyme gene and the mechanism of microbial interactions and deeply understanding the specific role of functional materials in cps biodegradation the enormous application potential of novel biotechnologies e g genetic enzyme engineering and microbial 3d printing technology and the development of new operating modes e g sequential cathode anode cascaded mode and microaerobic regulation

factors including subsurface heterogeneity electron donor availability and distribution of microbial populations this work presents a coupled experimental and mathematical modeling study designed to explore the influence of heterogeneity on mrd and to assess the suitability of microcosm derived rate parameters for modeling complex heterogeneous systems a monod based model is applied to simulate a

mrd exhibiting increased deviation from measured values under electron donor limiting conditions maximum discrepancy of 14 in contrast simulations employing a homogeneous uniform flow domain resulted in underprediction of mrd extent by an average of 13 with a maximum discrepancy of 45 model sensitivity analysis suggested that trace amounts of natural dissolved organic carbon served as an important fermentable substrate providing up to 69 of the reducing equivalents consumed for mrd under donor limiting conditions aquifer cell port concentration data and model simulations revealed that ethene formation varied spatially within the domain and was associated with regions of longer residence times these results demonstrate the strong influence of subsurface heterogeneity on the accuracy of mrd

in predictions to a number of factors including poor mixing mass transfer limitations varying abundance of substrate differing ph and temperature conditions and transient flow and influent contaminant concentrations in addition to these contradictory findings previous studies were primarily conducted in well mixed or uniform porous media there is a lack of studies investigating the transferability of microcosm batch rates to natural heterogeneous aquifer formations aquifer flow cells can be configured to resemble realistic subsurface conditions providing insight into the coupling of mrd with other processes that occur in heterogeneous porous media c√°piro et al 2015 hnatko et al 2020 to date there has been only one study haest et al 2012 that compared mrd transport simulations incorporating monod dechlorination kinetics to aquifer cell observations this study found that a reactive transport model employing batch and column fitted parameters underestimated dechlorination by 37 however these experiments were conducted in a small test cell with a uniform porous medium and thus the potential influence of heterogeneity and back diffusion could not be explored the above discussion highlights the need for an improved understanding of the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on mrd as well as the need to evaluate the applicability of experimentally derived batch parameters to larger scale systems particularly complex heterogeneous systems this paper describes a coupled experimental and mathematical modeling study designed to evaluate the suitability of microcosm measured parameters for predictions of mrd in multidimensional heterogeneous systems an aquifer cell was packed with materials from the commerce street superfund site williston vt and configured to mimic site conditions effluent and sampling port measurements of volatile fatty acid vfa and volatile organic compound concentrations vocs including trichloroethene tce cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce and vinyl chloride vc and ethene as well as biomass abundance were used to evaluate model predictive performance and to explore process coupling in heterogeneous environments 2

2 heterogeneous aquifer cell experiment a 63 5 cm length 38 cm height 1 4 cm thickness aquifer cell fig 1 was constructed in an aluminum frame held by two 1 4 cm thick glass panels with eighteen sampling ports configured in four vertical columns of four or five ports c√°piro et al 2015 suchomel et al 2007 site clay sm s1 1 was dried ground with a mortar and pestle then re saturated with a 0

soil materials collected from the commerce street site as described in sm s1 1 sections of soil cores representing 15 cm 6 in of borehole depth were homogenized and placed in 4 to 6 cm layers the discrete sections of soil cores were placed in the aquifer cell to recreate the stratigraphy of the field site fig 1 the top of the aquifer was closed with parafilm bemis company inc neenah wi to reduce the evaporative losses of water and chlorinated ethenes the system was not completely sealed however so that atmospheric pressure could be maintained after packing flow was established in the aquifer cell using a constant head influent system as described by c√°piro et al 2015 a bromide and erioglaucine a blue dye tracer test was performed to assess the flow field as described in sm s1 4 the aquifer cell experiment was conducted in phases that were designed to mimic a downhole mrd test undertaken at the commerce st site sm s1 4 first the aquifer cell was flushed with a 0 3 mm tce solution prepared with anoxic site groundwater sm s1 1 at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 12 2 cm day seepage velocity for a period of 32 days to establish a uniform background tce concentration a recirculation phase was then initiated with the effluent removed with a peristaltic pump cole parmer vernon hills il at a rate of 0 1 ml min 6 1 cm day seepage velocity amended with 100 mm lactate stock at 0 01 ml min to achieve a concentration of 10 mm lactate and reinjected into the aquifer cell at the inlet after 10 days of recirculation the aquifer cell was bioaugmented with kb 1 inoculum sirem guelph on diluted inoculum 20 ml was injected at a rate of 1 ml min into each of 5 sampling ports nearest the inlet a1 to a5 in fig 1 using a syringe pump to yield a target concentration of approximately 106 dhc cells l of pore water this cell abundance has been demonstrated as a screening criterion for anticipated ethene production clark et al 2018 lu et al 2006 ritalahti et al 2010a b recirculation with lactate amendment continued for an additional 14 days following bioaugmentation to distribute the inoculum throughout the aquifer cell after recirculation the flow regime was returned to a head driven system employing an influent solution of anoxic groundwater amended with 0 3 mm tce and a flow rate of approximately 0 1 ml min was maintained for the next 60 days table s1 a 1 0 l pulse of 10 mm lactate approximately 0 65 pore volume pv was introduced beginning 18 days after the end of recirculation to provide additional electron donor 2 3 mathematical modeling reactive transport modeling was conducted using an improved modified version of the modular three dimensional multispecies transport simulator mt3dms christ et al 2006 parker and park 2004 yang et al 2018 zheng and wang 1999 following christ and abriola 2007 the simulator was further adapted to incorporate multi order monod kinetics coupled with a microbial growth model to account for biotransformation

resistance within the cell biomass bacteria were assumed attached and immobile these assumptions are considered valid for the mrd experiments modeled here as 1 previous studies of mrd suggest that cells involved in active dechlorination and undergoing growth are primarily attached to the solid phase amos et al 2009 c√°piro et al 2015 chen et al 2013 hnatko et al 2020 schaefer et al 2009 and 2 relative uniform microbial cell abundance was achieved initially by the recirculation design to minimize the need to model microbial transport although bio clogging can change the flow field it is most likely to present in conditions with constant aggressive fermentable substrate injection chu et al 2003 sleep et al 2006 yang and mccarty 2002 sleep et al 2006 and in source zones where the mixing of electron donor and acceptor occurs for long periods chu et al 2005 given that lactate injections were periodic and that dhc cell abundance increased within one order of magnitude during the long term monitoring period section 3 2 2 the influence of microbial growth on aqueous flow was neglected herein the mathematical model incorporates four microbial species two dechlorinators one competitor and one fermenter a dual monod kinetics model chen et al 2013 christ and abriola 2007 clapp et al 2004 lee et al 2004 accounting for competitive inhibition hydrogen utilization and biomass growth was applied to describe mrd previous studies of the kb 1 culture duhamel et al 2002 duhamel and edwards 2007 and 2006 haest et al 2010a b haest et al 2010b showed that two dominant species geobacter sp geo and dhc were responsible for degrading the majority of tce to cis dce and converting cis dce to ethene respectively hydrogen produced from organic substrate i e lactate fermentation was assumed to be the only direct electron donor for both dechlorinating species the contribution of acetate as an electron donor to the dechlorination of tce to cis dce was assumed to be negligible as it has been documented to generally proceed at lower rates aulenta et al 2002 lee et al 2007 this is also a common assumption in most previous mrd monod models chen et al 2013 christ and abriola 2007 kouznetsova et al 2010 electron donor competitors including methanogens iron reducers and sulfate reducers were neglected as these microbial populations make up a minor fraction of the kb 1 culture duhamel and edwards 2006 bioaugmentation and the recirculation design successfully provided a large viable dechlorinating population transforming tce to ethene with effluent concentrations of 84 ethene and 16 cis dce at the end of the recirculation phase as described in section 3 2 1 the mathematical expression for transformation of each chlorinated solvent component is thus given as 3 r i

for inhibition caused by competition between the chlorinated ethenes cupples et al 2004 garant and lynd 1998 haest et al 2010a lee et al 2004 yu et al 2005 for simplification lactate was assumed to be fermented in a single step to produce h2 e g chen et al 2013 christ and abriola 2007 which is immediately available as an electron donor for dechlorination the stoichiometry is given as ohnishi et al

small biomass concentration had no appreciable effect on predicted mrd a uniform initial non attached to total cell nttc ratio of 25 was initially selected as the midpoint of the range of published aquifer cell experimental values 10 38 c√°piro et al 2015 for geo and dhc then adjusted to 33 during calibration to the aquifer cell measurements of effluent voc and port biomass concentrations 2 3 2 model fitting of batch experiments a finite difference multi species mass balance model based upon amos et al 2007 was used to estimate mrd parameters from batch microcosm data governing equations are given in equations 3 and 6 with rate expressions of r i a and dx j dt summarized in table s2 the model incorporated equilibrium liquid solid and liquid gas mass partitioning as well as mass loss via sampling and diffusion through the septa consistent with the experimental conditions section 2 1 h2 electron donor was set to be in excess in the model preliminary simulations demonstrated that adequate model fits could be achieved without including competitive inhibition in the model so the competitive inhibition factors i i were set to unity given the large liquid to solid ratios in the microcosms it was assumed that all dechlorination occurred in the aqueous phase data times series of biomass and voc concentrations from three microcosm replicates mc 1 2 and 3 and from an abiotic

aqueous phase dhc biomass concentration a nonlinear least squares optimization algorithm l bfgs b zhu et al 1997 as implemented in the scipy optimization and root finding module virtanen et al 2020 was employed to find the best fit for three maximum substrate utilization rates k max tce k max dce and k max vc and two yield coefficients y dce and y vc mc 2 data were fit first for all five parameters and then the fitted mc 2 yield coefficients were held constant for subsequent maximum substrate utilization rate fits to mc 1 and mc 3 data to improve the uniqueness of fits the dhc decay rate k d dhc was estimated by fitting an exponential decay model to two qpcr measurements from the mc 1 reactor taken after all chlorinated ethenes had undergone reductive dechlorination geo related parameters k b geo and y tce and half saturation constants k s i were adopted from the literature table 1 a a complete description of model implementation and the staged fitting process is described in sm s1 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 microcosm rate parameters in the three replicate microcosm experiments an average of 49 3 4 5 days was required to transform 95 of the tce to ethene fig s2 fitted microcosm model simulations were generally in good agreement with measured concentrations with combined mean squared errors f of 4 1 10 4 7 6 10 5 and 5 2 10 5 for the three replicates fig s2 the fitted parameters including k max tce y dce y vc and k b dhc fell within the range of published values table 1 a although k max dce and k max vc were larger than previously reported values 40 greater for cis dce and 90 greater for vc this discrepancy may be due to differences in experimental conditions soils substrates growth medium and temperature employed here in comparison with those used in previous kb 1 studies b√¶lum et al 2014 duhamel and edwards 2007 friis et al 2007 haest et al 2010a the variation in fitting methods e g the algorithms and objective functions and mrd model formulation e g open or closed system the form of competitive inhibition also play an important role in determining the mrd parameters and coefficients chambon et al 2013 assuming a lognormal distribution the 95 prediction intervals geisser 1993 for literature values of k max dce and k max vc are found to be 2 85 10 5 4 11 and 1 08 10 3 6 35 10 1 mmol mg d respectively degree of freedom 5 both prediction intervals encompass the estimates in this study suggesting that our values are not significantly different from previously published values at the 95 confidence level 3 2 mrd in the aquifer cell 3 2 1 experimental results at the end of the recirculation phase day 55 fig 2 a e high concentrations of ethene averaging 0 14 mm across 10 port samples had accumulated in the aquifer cell as evidenced by the high initial ethene effluent concentration fig 2 d and measured port data fig s6 d these high ethene levels were achieved following the continuous introduction of lactate in the influent and increased contaminant residence transformation time due to recirculation it is useful to identify four distinct experimental time periods following recirculation p1 days 55 73 extending for 2 6 pv p2 days 73 80 1 pv of lactate injection p3 days 80 96 2 3 pv post lactate injection and p4 96 days 2 4 pv absence of measured vfas in effluent fig 2 a e during p1 when lactate was not being introduced the fermentable electron donor substrate was consumed and effluent cis dce and vc concentrations increased three fold 0 06 mm to 0 18 mm and six fold 0 003 mm to 0 018 mm respectively while ethene concentrations initially high due to an excess of electron donor and aquifer cell recirculation declined by 60 9 0 23 mm to 0 09 mm here the decline in ethene was attributed to depletion of electron donor for cis dce to ethene dechlorination during p2 cis dce transformation to vc and ethene slightly increased as fermentable electron donor substrate was again introduced however the extent of dechlorination was incomplete cis dce decreased by 16 7 of its peak value 0 18 mm to 0 15 mm vc increased by approximately a factor of two 0 017 mm to 0 036 mm and ethene declined by 33 3 0 09 mm to 0 06 mm during p3 the effluent cis dce concentration dropped rapidly by 45 and then plateaued at 0 096 mm during p4 lactate was depleted in the effluent i e no longer in excess and a small amount of untransformed tce 5 8 of injected tce began to be detected at day 105 this latter measurement suggests that some tce transformation was being sustained in the absence of injected substrate the measured extent of transformation at the end of p4 required the presence of 0 34 mm of h2 equivalent to 0 056 mm lactate it was hypothesized that dissolved organic carbon doc in the influent groundwater derived from the aquifer materials and endogenous decay was contributing to dechlorination during p4 consistent with the measured transformation of tce to cis dce by indigenous microbes at the commerce st field site and the doc concentrations 0 80 to 4 9 mg c l equivalent to 0 025 to 0 14 mm lactate measured in site groundwater abriola et al 2019 previous research supports this hypothesis demonstrating the ability of native dechlorinating bacteria i e dhc to use doc in riverbed sediments to facilitate tce dechlorination at rates consistent with other carbon sources schneidewind et al 2014 3 2 2 modeling of mrd in the aquifer cell the numerical model of the aquifer cell was designed to reflect a multi layer permeability distribution and to reproduce the flow distribution system depicted in fig 1 a detailed description of the model domain construction boundary conditions numerical solution techniques and bromide tracer simulation is included in sm s2 2 based upon the presence of parafilm bemis company inc neenah wi at the upper surface of the cell volatile losses and oxygen exchange with the atmosphere were neglected in the model quantification of potential aqueous diffusion mass exchange at the top of the cell suggested that maximum total voc losses would not exceed 1 2 and that o2 concentrations would not exceed 9 10 3 mg l to 0 36 mg l see sm s2 3 the effluent bromide tracer breakthrough curve btc data fig s4 and erioglaucine a tracer test photographs fig s5 were used to characterize the flow field the hydraulic conductivity was adjusted iteratively to minimize the mean relative errors between the predicted cprediction and experimental cmeasurement effluent concentrations for a total of n data samples taken from the initial

predicted and experimental effluent bromide btc were obtained a small area of blue dye was observed at the bottom of the effluent screen at 5 4 hours highlighted in fig s5 b consistent with early breakthrough observed in fig s4 the mismatch in early time btc concentrations accounted for 4 1 of total bromide mass injected and was likely caused by a small proportion of influent solution that bypassed the porous medium at the interface between the clay and the sand the mres decreased to 14 0 when the early breakthrough mass was excluded flow bypassing was not included in the reactive transport model as the precise location could not be confirmed from the erioglaucine a tracer images it is unlikely that bypassing had a major impact on supply of tce continuous injections from the inflow chamber or on electron donor delivery breakthrough of 36 7 of the total injected lactate mass section 3 2 1 estimated material properties are provided in table 2 numerical modeling was used to evaluate the suitability of microcosm derived parameters table 1 a to predict aquifer cell experimental measurements the simulation period extended for 60 days i e p1 p4 with initial chemical constituents and biomass concentration distributions fig s8 and s9 obtained from interpolation of concentrations measured in sampling ports fig s10 and s11 information on initial concentration interpolation can be found in sm s2 4 porous media sorption and mrd parameters used in the simulations are presented in tables 1 and 2 rate parameters and coefficients for lactate transformation k s lac k max lac and y lac are given in table 1 b consistent with effluent measurements in p4 a background concentration of 0 056 mm lactate was included in the influent throughout the simulation period to represent the reducing equivalents provided by the doc in the site groundwater sm s1 1 which derived from the aquifer materials and endogenous decay fig 2 a e presents a comparison of simulation results to measured effluent btcs for all monitored species assuming a background level of doc is available the microcosm derived parameters yielded model predictions that captured the general trends and magnitudes of the effluent btcs over the simulated period mres were 6 7 27 0 41 5 32 0 and 21 6 for tce cis dce vc ethene and total vfas respectively predicted total voc concentrations in the effluent not plotted compared well with measured total vocs mre 5 this close agreement suggests that the overall flow system was well modeled and indicates good experimental mass recovery close inspection of fig 2 a e however reveals that the magnitude of modeled concentration discrepancies for each of the daughter products varied significantly over time with ranges of mredce 13 3 56 0 mrevc 31 2 55 2 and mreeth 10 3 49 0 across the four time periods p1 p4 fig s12 in particular a large discrepancy 50 between measured and modeled effluent cis dce and vc concentrations was observed during p4 while good agreement with measured concentrations was attained for ethene mre 10 3 the inadequacy of predictions in p4 may be associated with unmodeled small scale permeability variations the presence of fermentable electron donor in the site soil and or uncertainty in the initial biomass distribution see sections 3 3 and 3 4 for further discussion an examination of concentration and simulation data at the sampling ports fig 3 provides insight into the factors that influence the distribution of mrd within the flow cell while voc measurements at the upgradient ports 6 cm from the influent chamber fig 3 a b and c indicated minimal no formation of vc and ethene the data at downgradient ports 40 5 cm from the influent chamber fig 3 d e and f demonstrate greater mrd this finding is consistent with previous research that demonstrated the influence of residence time on the extent of mrd e g amos et al 2009 c√°piro et al 2015 chen et al 2013 haest et al 2010b comparisons among downgradient ports c1 c3 and c5 fig 3 d e and f reveals that the mrd extent increased from top to bottom suggesting that more complete mrd was associated with the slower flow and anoxic conditions at depth these observations are consistent with a previous heterogeneous aquifer cell study with kb 1 hnatko et al 2020 where high concentrations of cis dce were observed in ports near the influent chamber and higher persistent ethene concentrations were measured in lower ports near the clay layer these observations indicated rapid transformation of tce to cis dce and a larger extent of dechlorination in slow flow regions the model was able to capture the general shapes and trends of the measured voc concentrations at the cell ports however the cis dce concentrations were overpredicted at 88 of data points by an average factor of 1 5 and ethene concentrations at port c5 fig 3 f were overpredicted during p3 by greater than a factor of 2 these observations are difficult to explain given the smaller prediction errors for effluent cis dce concentrations thus there may be other factors mechanisms most likely associated with port sampling protocols and small scale packing variations that led to these local discrepancies since predictions of voc concentrations in the lower layers are influenced by mass diffusing from the clay layer fig 5 the absence of initial measurements of biomass and vocs in the clay layer following recirculation could have adversely impacted model accuracy in this zone in general port observations demonstrate the importance of small scale permeability variations and spatially varying initial conditions on local mrd processes while predictions of effluent concentrations were more sensitive to the large scale layering section 3 3 measured microbial abundance varied within one order of magnitude over time with spatially averaged values of 4 07 108 1 29 108 2 47 108 2 19 105 and 7 80 108 1 77 106 cell l for dhc at days 54 90 3 and 103 6 the long term monitoring phase respectively and an average of 1 24 108 3 90 107 and 4 31 107 3 00 104 cells l for geo at days 54 and 90 3 respectively fig 4 day 54 biomass measurements were used to establish the initial dhc and geo distributions in the aquifer cell for the model figs 4 a and d comparison of simulated and measured dhc abundance at days 90 3 and 103 6 reveals close agreement with normalized root mean squared logarithmic errors nrmsle of 6 1 and 24 0 respectively fig 4 b and c however large deviations of predictions were observed at day 103 6 at the top ports a1 b1 c1 and d1 nrmsles decreased substantially to 2 6 when these four top ports were excluded these predictive errors at the upper port locations in l6 and l7 fig 1 could be associated with low flow of vocs and substrate into this region and or the influence of water air oxygen contact on cell growth and mrd adrian et al 2007 amos et al 2007 2008 in contrast to dhc predictions those forgeo did not conform to the port measurements in magnitude or trend fig 4 e this was not unexpected since the values of y tce and k d geo employed in the model were taken from the literature and k max tce fits were based upon only two microcosm data points due to the rapid transformation of tce this same rapid transformation of tce in the aquifer cell however made predictions of tce concentration less sensitive to the geo growth parameters given this insensitivity geo cell abundance was not measured at the end of the experiment a previous study haest et al 2012 that used batch and column rates to model mrd in a 2 d flow cell also observed large errors when the reactive transport model was used to simulate local microbial numbers especially those for geo in that study geo and dhc numbers at sampling ports were on average a factor of 179 and 13 higher respectively than those measured at the end of the experiment it was hypothesized by those researchers that the degradation of tce by dhc contributed to the overestimation of geo numbers in comparison to dhc this process was not considered in the present study or in previous modeling studies e g haest et al 2012 3 3 influence of heterogeneity on mrd the port data presented above demonstrate that the extent of mrd varied temporally and spatially in the heterogeneous aquifer cell model simulations were generally consistent with these observations simulated voc profiles fig 5 a demonstrated spatially variable ethene concentrations with the most ethene production associated with the presence of low permeability layers in the model and in the experiment these low permeability zones provided longer residence times for complete dechlorination the low permeability media also acted as reservoirs to supply fermentable substrates after substrates were flushed from the higher permeable zones conservative tracer studies figs s4 and s5 confirmed this influence of permeability variations on back diffusion breakthrough curves exhibited an early peak associated with flow in the higher permeable layers and subsequent tailing resulting from release of tracer mass from lower permeability layers one additional simulation was conducted to explore the influence of physical heterogeneity as well as spatial variations in initial conditions on predictions of mrd in the aquifer cell here a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field was assumed along with uniform initial chemical vocs and total vfas and biomass distributions table s5 while the mrd rate parameters and coefficients were kept the same as the original heterogeneous case simulated in section 3 2 2 the initial concentration values in the uniform case were taken as averages of the initial measured port data while the average hydraulic conductivity was calibrated to the measured flow rate comparison of simulation results for the uniform case fig 2 f j with that of the original heterogeneous case fig 2 a e hereafter cited as the base case reveals less accurate effluent concentration predictions with mres of 23 9 64 4 96 4 63 7 and 24 7 for tce cis dce vc ethene and total vfas respectively this represents an increase in mres by factors of 3 6 2 4 2 3 2 0 and 1 1 for these five components when compared with those of the base case the quality of model predictions can also be assessed by comparing the extent of dechlorination eod eod c dce 2 c vc 3 c eth 3 c tce c dce c vc c eth for model predictions and measurements haest et al 2012 haest et al 2010b explained in sm s2 5 here we use the ratio of modeled mod to observed data eod eod ratio eod mod eod data in the effluent to evaluate model performance the uniform model largely underpredicted transformation during p2 and p4 with an averaged eod ratio meo d ratio t k t 0 t k t final eod mod t k eod data t k n of 0 61 0 04 and 0 62 0 04 in comparison to performance of the base case model with meod ratio during p2 0 86 0 01 and p4 0 90 0 05 fig s13 the uniform model was also associated with larger variability in the meod ratio for p1 0 96 0 22 p3 1 01 0 27 and over the entire simulation period 0 87 0 26 in comparison to the base case ratios for p1 0 95 0 07 p3 1 05 0 15 and the entire period 0 96 0 11 the latter statistic indicates that the base case model simulations presented herein underestimated dechlorination extent by an average of 4 11 over the entire simulation period the above levels of prediction agreement compare favorably with that reported in a previous modeling study that employed batch and column measured parameters to predict mrd in a smaller flow cell 17 cm 10 cm meod ratio 0 63 haest et al 2012 an examination of fig 5 which compares the spatial distribution of chlorinated ethenes for the homogeneous and base cases at one time during p3 helps to explain the differences in the computed meod ratio in the base case heterogeneous model the low permeability zones in the top and bottom of the system provided longer residence time for mrd which increased the production of ethene and eod fig 5 a in the uniform model the residence time for dechlorination was uniform across the domain increasing the amount of incomplete mrd or cis dce stall and resulting in larger deviations between measured and predicted eod fig 5 b note that the uniform model did not explicitly incorporate the clay layer which had a large impact on model prediction of ethene production and eod 3 4 model sensitivity as discussed above background doc consistent with site groundwater data was assumed to be present in the injection fluid this doc served as a fermentable substrate yielding electron donor for dechlorinating populations an alternative scenario without injection of background doc was simulated to explore the influence of dissolved fermentable substrates on model predictions fig 2 k o with no background doc breakthrough of tce 0 15 mm at peak was predicted in the effluent beginning at day 93 7 and transformation to tce daughter products particularly cis dce was largely underpredicted ignoring background doc in the model simulation resulted in much larger discrepancies with measured data with calculated mres of 124 1 40 0 30 0 and 38 7 for tce cis dce vc and ethene respectively this represented changes in mres by factors of 18 6 1 5 0 7 and 1 2 compared with the base case the simulation without background doc underpredicted the extent of mrd with an meod ratio of 0 81 0 19 the difference between model predictions was greater at later times when vfas were depleted with an meod ratio of 0 45 during p4 for the no doc simulation fig s13 this comparison demonstrates the importance of accounting for background doc after supplied electron donor substrate has been depleted although mrd rate parameters averaged over the microcosm replicates were employed in aquifer cell modeling three sets of maximum utilization rates k max i were available from batch model fits to microcosm replicates previous studies have shown that model predictions are most sensitive to k max i compared with other mrd rate parameters and coefficients e g chen et al 2013 christ and abriola 2007 kouznetsova et al 2010 given the variability of the fitted k max i from the triplicate microcosms 6 7 1 3 7 4 1 4 and 3 9 0 3 102¬µmol mg cell day for tce cis dce and vc respectively aquifer cell simulations were performed to examine prediction sensitivity to this variability few previous studies have considered the influence of rate parameter variability on predictions typically employing a single set of fitted rate parameters three additional numerical simulations were conducted using the three sets of k max parameters fit to the triplicate microcosm experiments table 1 along with the heterogeneous aquifer cell permeabilities table 2 results in fig s14 the predicted dechlorination extent among these simulations varied over time with meod ratio values of 1 10 0 20 0 92 0 10 and 0 80 0 13 for the simulations based upon mc 1 2 and 3 respectively changes in meod ratio mirrored the trends of changes in k max i particularly for k max dce and k max vc table 1 a 1 4 times average decrease in k max dce and k max vc from mc 1 to mc 3 led to a decrease in meod ratio by the same factor successful model prediction of mrd has also been linked to selection of an appropriate active dechlorinating biomass haest et al 2010b phelan et al 2015 in the aquifer cell model the nttc ratio of dhc was adjusted within the literature range to improve model prediction of voc and biomass concentrations therefore simulations were also performed to examine the sensitivity of predicted effluent concentrations and extent of mrd to changes in the nttc ratio of dhc here three simulations were conducted with different nttc ratios for dhc 10 25 and 50 to represent the literature variability range for published laboratory experiments c√°piro et al 2015 chen et al 2013 sabolowsky et al 2010 this parameter directly affects the initial value of attached active biomass for the simulations computed meod ratio for these simulations were 1 26 0 25 0 96 0 15 and 0 88 0 09 respectively fig s15 simulated effluent concentrations fig s15 k o demonstrated that the selected nttc ratio had a more pronounced impact on prediction accuracy under high electron donor concentration conditions in the case with a nttc of 10 ethene was the only component that was predicted in the effluent after the lactate pulse p3 period with a peak concentration of 0 25 mm indicating compete transformation of tce while the concentration of ethene was underpredicted over time a high concentration of cis dce was predicted in the effluent in the case with a nttc of 50 decreasing the initial attached active dhc biomass by a factor of 9 0 increasing the nttc ratio from 10 to 50 led to a 1 4 times decrease in meod ratio although the nttc ratio may not be readily quantifiable and could vary with organism growth state these results suggest that model predictions may be relatively insensitive to uncertainty in initial dechlorinating population estimates as discussed above the variability in predicted eod among the conducted model sensitivity simulations was moderate with a mean meod ratio of 0 94 the range is 0 80 1 09 for the varying k max cases and 1 04 the range is 0 88 1 26 for the differing nttc ratio cases the change in permeability between the uniform and heterogeneous domain simulations resulted in a slightly larger average prediction error in meod ratio 0 92 the two values are 0 87 and 0 96 however the prediction errors associated with ignoring heterogeneity mean meod ratio 0 76 were greater under electron donor limiting conditions i e during p4 compared to those associated with variability of k max mean meod ratio 0 84 or nttc ratio mean meod ratio 0 83 these comparisons suggest that physical heterogeneity is likely to play a substantial role in determining accuracy of model predictions especially under electron donor limiting conditions model predictions based upon sparse sampling of permeability would not be able to capture fine scale variations and may be associated with larger errors although the analysis presented above highlights the sensitivity of model predictions to several selected parameters these modeling results also suggest that microcosm derived rate parameters can be used to provide relevant predictions of effluent concentrations mres 27 and the extent of mrd meodratio less than 4 deviation in well characterized heterogeneous domains 4 conclusions a coupled experimental and modeling investigation was undertaken to examine mrd under field relevant conditions with periods of limited electron donor and variations in permeability despite the differences in physical scales solid to liquid mass ratios and flow conditions model simulations employing microcosm estimated rate parameters exhibited mres of only 26 0 for mrd in this more complex system this model prediction accuracy was shown to depend on incorporation of the spatial distribution of permeability trace background doc and initial biomass abundance as well as microbial transformation rates these results contrast with many published studies that have reported that calculated transformation rates from larger scale systems were inconsistent with overpredicted by microcosm rate parameters although model predictions yielded good overall agreement with experimental observations in this study caution is recommended in extrapolation of these conclusions to other systems conditions for example the conditions flow ph temperature nutrient inhibition electron donor and electron acceptor in the aquifer cell experiment were maintained to provide a suitable growth environment for the microbes model predictions were least accurate under donor limiting conditions furthermore the presence of the competing microbial populations such as methanogens sulfate and iron reducers would be expected to influence the rate extent and timing of dechlorination thus redox processes utilizing other electron acceptors need to be considered and modeled kinetically for field sites where ideal mrd conditions are not achieved microcosm derived rates may not be readily applicable to reactive transport modeling in natural heterogeneous field environments if the hydrogeochemical conditions differ greatly between the laboratory and field such as under conditions of monitored natural attenuation this study revealed that heterogeneity in soil permeability influences the extent and spatial variation of mrd inclusion of physical heterogeneity in numerical modeling is crucial to accurate predictions model simulations using microcosm estimated dechlorination rates but employing uniform formation properties and initial conditions were unable to adequately predict the extent of mrd in the aquifer cell the extent of mrd was underpredicted in these simulations although this work was focused on modeling mrd at the bench scale this finding highlights the potential benefit of permeability characterization at field sites sparse sampling will necessarily result in application of models that use average soil properties increasing prediction errors results also point to the potential benefit of identifying and modeling low permeability layers for long term field site prediction and management under conditions where fine scale heterogeneity delineation is not possible advanced modeling tools for data interpolation uncertainty quantification and adaptive sampling e g arshadi et al 2020 cardiff et al 2013 koch and nowak 2016 tang 2019 zhu et al 2009 zhu and yeh 2006 could prove useful in enabling quantification of the uncertainty resulting from ignoring small scale subsurface variability future work focusing on upscaling to identify effective rate parameters could improve the extrapolation of laboratory rates to systems with coarser resolution a sensitivity analysis indicates that local permeability variations have a much more substantial influence on the extent of mrd than uncertainty in microbial transformation rates or initial biomass estimates particularly under carbon and electron donor limited conditions trace levels of background fermentable substrate doc contributed substantially to mrd in the aquifer cell highlighting the importance of characterizing organic compounds that may serve as fermentable sources of electron donor that can be utilized by microbes in natural groundwater and soil comparisons of simulation and experimental port data revealed that model prediction errors exhibited a large variance evolving with time spatial location and the specific voc examined local concentrations within the aquifer cell were sensitive to fine scale variations in physical chemical and biological properties micro environments variations unlikely to be captured in field scale modeling efforts these results suggest that mathematical models will be more useful for the prediction of the overall extent of mrd and trends in space and time rather than specific concentrations at sampling location declaration of competing interest the

mrd exhibiting increased deviation from measured values under electron donor limiting conditions maximum discrepancy of 14 in contrast simulations employing a homogeneous uniform flow domain resulted in underprediction of mrd extent by an average of 13 with a maximum discrepancy of 45 model sensitivity analysis suggested that trace amounts of natural dissolved organic carbon served as an important fermentable substrate providing up to 69 of the reducing equivalents consumed for mrd under donor limiting conditions aquifer cell port concentration data and model simulations revealed that ethene formation varied spatially within the domain and was associated with regions of longer residence times these results demonstrate the strong influence of subsurface heterogeneity on the accuracy of mrd

incorporating monod dechlorination kinetics to aquifer cell observations this study found that a reactive transport model employing batch and column fitted parameters underestimated dechlorination by 37 however these experiments were conducted in a small test cell with a uniform porous medium and thus the potential influence of heterogeneity and back diffusion could not be explored the above discussion highlights the need for an improved understanding of the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on mrd as well as the need to evaluate the applicability of experimentally derived batch

2 heterogeneous aquifer cell experiment a 63 5 cm length 38 cm height 1 4 cm thickness aquifer cell fig 1 was constructed in an aluminum frame held by two 1 4 cm thick glass panels with eighteen sampling ports configured in four vertical columns of four or five ports c√°piro et al 2015 suchomel et al 2007 site clay sm s1 1 was dried ground with a mortar and pestle then re saturated with a 0

soil materials collected from the commerce street site as described in sm s1 1 sections of soil cores representing 15 cm 6 in of borehole depth were homogenized and placed in 4 to 6 cm layers the discrete sections of soil cores were placed in the aquifer cell to recreate the stratigraphy of the field site fig 1 the top of the aquifer was closed with parafilm bemis company inc neenah wi to reduce the evaporative losses of water and chlorinated ethenes the system was not completely sealed however so that atmospheric pressure could be maintained after packing flow was established in the aquifer cell using a constant head influent system as described by c√°piro et al 2015 a bromide and erioglaucine a blue dye tracer test was performed to assess the flow field as described in sm s1 4 the aquifer cell experiment was conducted in phases that were designed to mimic a downhole mrd test undertaken at the commerce st site sm s1 4 first the aquifer cell was flushed with a 0 3 mm tce

recirculation with lactate amendment continued for an additional 14 days following bioaugmentation to distribute the inoculum throughout the aquifer cell after recirculation the flow regime was returned to a head driven system employing an influent solution of anoxic groundwater amended with 0 3 mm tce and a flow rate of approximately 0 1 ml min was maintained for the next 60 days table s1 a

zheng and wang 1999 following christ and abriola 2007 the simulator was further adapted to incorporate multi order monod kinetics coupled with a microbial growth model to account for biotransformation

relative uniform microbial cell abundance was achieved initially by the recirculation design to minimize the need to model microbial transport although bio clogging can change the flow field it is most likely to present in conditions with constant aggressive fermentable substrate injection chu et al 2003 sleep et al 2006 yang and mccarty 2002 sleep et al 2006 and in source zones where the mixing of electron donor and acceptor occurs for long periods chu et al 2005 given that lactate injections were periodic and that dhc cell abundance increased within one order of magnitude during the long term monitoring period section 3 2 2 the influence of microbial growth on aqueous flow was neglected herein the mathematical model incorporates four microbial species two dechlorinators one competitor and one fermenter a dual monod kinetics model chen et al 2013 christ and abriola 2007 clapp et al 2004 lee et al 2004 accounting for competitive inhibition hydrogen utilization and biomass growth was applied to describe mrd previous studies of the kb 1 culture duhamel et al 2002 duhamel and edwards 2007 and 2006 haest et al 2010a b haest et al 2010b showed that two dominant species geobacter sp geo and dhc were responsible for degrading the majority of tce to cis dce and converting cis dce to ethene respectively hydrogen produced from organic substrate i e lactate fermentation was assumed to be the only direct electron donor for both dechlorinating species the contribution of acetate as an electron donor to the dechlorination of tce to cis dce was assumed to be negligible

the fitted parameters including k max tce y dce y vc and k b dhc fell within the range of published values table 1 a although k max dce and k max vc were larger than previously reported values 40 greater for cis dce and 90 greater for vc this discrepancy may be due to differences in experimental conditions soils substrates growth medium and temperature employed here in comparison with those

aquifer cell 3 2 1 experimental results at the end of the recirculation phase day 55 fig 2 a e high concentrations of ethene averaging 0 14 mm across 10 port samples had accumulated in the aquifer cell as evidenced by the high initial ethene effluent concentration fig 2 d and measured port data fig s6 d these high ethene levels were achieved following the continuous introduction of lactate in the influent and increased contaminant residence transformation time due to recirculation it is useful to identify four distinct experimental time periods following recirculation p1 days 55 73

not being introduced the fermentable electron donor substrate was consumed and effluent cis dce and vc concentrations increased three fold 0 06 mm to 0 18 mm and six fold 0 003 mm to 0 018 mm respectively while ethene concentrations initially high due to an excess of electron donor and aquifer cell recirculation declined by 60 9 0 23 mm to 0 09 mm here the decline in ethene was attributed to depletion of electron donor for cis dce to ethene dechlorination during p2 cis dce transformation to vc and ethene slightly increased as fermentable electron donor substrate was again introduced however the extent of dechlorination was incomplete cis dce decreased by 16 7 of its peak value 0 18 mm to 0 15 mm vc increased by approximately a factor of two 0 017 mm to 0 036 mm and ethene declined by 33 3 0 09 mm to 0 06 mm during p3 the effluent cis dce concentration dropped rapidly by 45 and then plateaued at 0 096 mm during p4 lactate was depleted in the effluent i e no longer in excess and a small amount of untransformed tce 5 8 of injected tce began to be detected at day 105 this latter measurement suggests that some tce transformation was being sustained in the absence of injected substrate the measured extent of transformation at the end of p4 required the presence of 0 34 mm of h2 equivalent to 0 056 mm lactate it was hypothesized that dissolved organic carbon doc in the influent groundwater derived from the aquifer materials and endogenous decay was contributing to dechlorination during p4 consistent with the measured transformation of tce to cis dce by indigenous microbes at the commerce st field site and the doc concentrations 0 80 to 4 9 mg c l equivalent to 0 025 to 0 14 mm lactate measured in site groundwater abriola et al 2019 previous research supports this hypothesis demonstrating the ability of native dechlorinating bacteria i e dhc to use doc in riverbed sediments to facilitate tce dechlorination at rates consistent with other carbon sources schneidewind et al 2014 3 2 2 modeling of mrd in the aquifer cell the numerical model of the aquifer cell was designed to reflect a multi layer permeability distribution and to reproduce the

potential aqueous diffusion mass exchange at the top of the cell suggested that maximum total voc losses would not exceed 1 2 and that o2 concentrations would not exceed 9 10 3 mg l to 0 36 mg l see sm s2 3 the effluent bromide tracer breakthrough curve btc data fig s4 and erioglaucine a tracer test photographs fig s5 were used to characterize the flow field the hydraulic conductivity was

predicted and experimental effluent bromide btc were obtained a small area of blue dye was observed at the bottom of the effluent screen at 5 4 hours highlighted in fig s5 b consistent with early breakthrough observed in fig s4 the mismatch in early time btc concentrations accounted for 4 1 of total bromide mass injected and was likely caused by a small proportion of influent solution that bypassed the porous medium at the interface between the clay and the sand the mres decreased to 14 0 when the early breakthrough mass was excluded flow bypassing was not included in the reactive transport model as the precise location could not be confirmed from the erioglaucine a tracer images it is unlikely that bypassing had a major impact on supply of tce continuous injections from the inflow chamber or on electron donor delivery breakthrough of 36 7 of the total injected lactate mass section 3 2 1 estimated material properties are provided in table 2 numerical modeling was used to

lac k max lac and y lac are given in table 1 b consistent with effluent measurements in p4 a background concentration of 0 056 mm lactate was included in the influent throughout the simulation period to represent the reducing equivalents provided by the doc in the site groundwater sm s1 1 which derived from the aquifer materials and endogenous decay fig 2 a e presents a comparison of simulation results to measured effluent btcs for all monitored species assuming a background level of doc is available the microcosm derived parameters yielded model predictions that captured the general trends and magnitudes of the effluent btcs over the simulated period mres were 6 7 27 0 41 5 32 0 and 21 6 for tce cis dce vc ethene and total vfas respectively predicted total voc concentrations in the effluent not plotted compared well with measured total vocs mre 5 this close agreement suggests that the overall flow system was well modeled and indicates good experimental mass recovery close inspection of fig 2 a e however reveals that the magnitude of modeled concentration discrepancies for each of the daughter products varied significantly over time with ranges of mredce 13 3 56 0 mrevc 31 2 55 2 and mreeth 10 3 49 0 across the four time periods p1 p4 fig s12 in particular a large discrepancy 50 between measured and modeled effluent cis dce and vc concentrations was observed during p4 while good agreement with measured concentrations was attained for ethene mre 10 3 the inadequacy of predictions in p4 may be associated with unmodeled small scale permeability variations the presence of fermentable electron donor in the site soil and or uncertainty in the initial biomass distribution see sections 3 3 and 3 4 for further discussion an examination of concentration and simulation data at the sampling ports fig 3 provides insight into the factors that influence the distribution of mrd within the flow cell while voc measurements at the upgradient ports 6 cm from the influent chamber fig 3 a b and c indicated minimal no formation of vc and ethene the data at downgradient ports 40 5 cm from the influent chamber fig 3 d e and f demonstrate greater mrd this finding is consistent with previous research that demonstrated the influence of residence time on the extent of mrd e g amos et al 2009 c√°piro et al 2015 chen et al 2013 haest et al 2010b comparisons among downgradient ports c1 c3 and c5 fig 3 d e and f reveals that the mrd extent increased from top to bottom suggesting that more complete mrd was associated with the slower flow and anoxic conditions at depth these observations are consistent with a previous heterogeneous aquifer cell study with kb 1 hnatko et al 2020 where high concentrations of cis dce were observed in ports near the influent chamber and higher persistent ethene concentrations were measured in lower ports near the clay layer these observations indicated rapid transformation of tce to cis dce and a larger extent of dechlorination in slow flow regions the model was able to capture the general shapes and trends of the measured voc concentrations at the cell ports however the cis dce concentrations were overpredicted at 88 of data points by an average factor of 1 5 and ethene concentrations at port c5 fig 3 f were overpredicted during p3 by greater than a factor of 2 these observations are difficult to explain given the smaller prediction errors for effluent cis dce concentrations thus there may be other factors mechanisms most likely associated with port sampling protocols and small scale packing variations that led to these local discrepancies since predictions of voc concentrations in the lower layers are influenced by mass diffusing from the clay layer fig 5 the absence of initial measurements of biomass and vocs in the clay layer following recirculation could have adversely impacted model accuracy in this zone in general port observations demonstrate the importance of small scale permeability variations and spatially varying initial conditions on local mrd processes while predictions of effluent concentrations were more sensitive to the large scale layering section 3 3 measured microbial abundance varied within one order of magnitude over time with spatially averaged values of 4 07 108 1 29 108 2 47 108 2 19 105 and 7 80 108 1 77 106 cell l for dhc at days 54 90 3

used to establish the initial dhc and geo distributions in the aquifer cell for the model figs 4 a and d comparison of simulated and measured dhc abundance at days 90 3 and 103 6 reveals close agreement with normalized root mean squared logarithmic errors nrmsle of 6 1 and 24 0 respectively fig 4 b and c however large deviations of predictions were observed at day 103 6 at the top ports a1 b1 c1 and d1 nrmsles decreased substantially to 2 6 when these four top ports were excluded these predictive errors at the upper port locations in l6 and l7 fig 1 could be associated with low flow of vocs and substrate into this region and or the influence of water air oxygen contact on cell growth and mrd adrian et al 2007 amos et al 2007 2008 in contrast to dhc predictions those forgeo did not conform to the port measurements in magnitude or trend fig 4 e this was not unexpected since the values of y tce and k d geo employed in the model were taken from the literature and k max tce fits were based upon only two microcosm data points due to the rapid transformation of tce this same rapid transformation of tce in the aquifer cell however made predictions of tce concentration less sensitive to the geo growth parameters given this insensitivity geo cell abundance was not measured at the end of the experiment a previous study haest et al 2012 that used batch and column rates to model mrd in a 2 d flow cell also observed large errors when the reactive transport model was used to simulate local microbial numbers especially those for geo in that study geo and dhc numbers at sampling ports were on average a factor of 179 and 13 higher respectively than those measured at the end of the experiment it was hypothesized by those researchers that the degradation of tce by dhc contributed to the overestimation of geo numbers in comparison to dhc this process was not considered in the present study or in previous modeling studies e g haest et al 2012 3 3 influence of heterogeneity on mrd the port data presented above demonstrate that the extent of mrd varied temporally and spatially in the heterogeneous aquifer cell model simulations were generally consistent with these observations simulated voc profiles fig 5 a demonstrated spatially variable ethene concentrations with the most ethene production associated with the presence of low permeability layers in the model and in the experiment these low permeability zones provided longer residence times for complete dechlorination the low permeability media also acted as reservoirs to supply fermentable substrates after substrates were flushed from the higher permeable zones conservative tracer studies figs s4 and s5 confirmed this influence of permeability variations on back diffusion breakthrough curves exhibited an early peak associated with flow in the higher permeable layers and subsequent tailing resulting from release of tracer mass from lower permeability layers one additional simulation was conducted to explore the influence of physical heterogeneity as well as spatial variations in initial conditions on predictions of mrd in the aquifer cell here a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field was assumed along with uniform initial chemical vocs and total vfas and biomass distributions table s5 while the mrd rate parameters and coefficients were kept the same as the original heterogeneous case simulated in section 3 2 2 the initial concentration values in the uniform case were taken as averages of the initial measured port data while the average hydraulic conductivity was calibrated to the measured flow rate comparison of simulation results for the uniform case fig 2 f j with that of the original heterogeneous case fig 2 a e hereafter cited as the base case reveals less accurate effluent concentration predictions with mres of 23 9 64 4 96 4 63 7 and 24 7 for tce cis dce vc ethene and total vfas respectively this represents an increase in mres by factors of 3 6 2 4 2 3 2 0 and 1 1 for these five components when compared with those of the base case the quality of model predictions can also be assessed by comparing the extent of dechlorination eod eod c dce 2 c vc 3 c eth 3 c tce c dce c vc c eth for model predictions and measurements haest et al 2012 haest et al 2010b explained in sm s2 5 here we use the ratio of modeled mod to observed data eod eod ratio eod mod eod data in the effluent to evaluate model performance the uniform model largely underpredicted transformation during p2 and p4 with an averaged eod ratio meo d ratio t k t 0 t k t final eod mod t k eod data t k n of 0 61 0 04 and 0 62 0 04 in comparison to performance of the base case model with meod ratio during p2 0 86 0 01 and p4 0 90 0 05 fig s13 the uniform model was also associated with larger variability in the meod ratio for p1 0 96 0 22 p3 1 01 0 27 and over the entire simulation period 0 87 0 26 in comparison to the base case ratios for p1 0 95 0 07 p3 1 05 0 15 and the entire period 0 96 0 11 the latter statistic indicates that the base case model simulations presented herein underestimated dechlorination extent by an average of 4 11 over the entire simulation period the above levels of prediction agreement compare favorably with that reported in a previous modeling study that employed batch and column measured parameters to predict mrd in a smaller flow cell 17 cm 10 cm meod ratio 0 63 haest et al 2012 an examination of fig 5 which compares the spatial distribution of chlorinated ethenes for the homogeneous and base cases at one time during p3 helps to explain the differences in the computed meod ratio in the base case heterogeneous model the low permeability zones in the top and bottom of the system provided longer residence time for mrd which increased the production of ethene and eod fig 5 a in the uniform model the residence time for dechlorination was uniform across the domain increasing the amount of incomplete mrd or cis dce stall and resulting in larger deviations between measured and predicted eod fig 5 b note that the uniform model did not explicitly incorporate the clay layer which had a large impact on model prediction of ethene production and eod 3 4 model sensitivity as discussed above background doc consistent with site groundwater data was assumed to be present in the injection fluid this doc served as a fermentable substrate yielding electron donor for dechlorinating populations an alternative scenario without injection of background doc was simulated to explore the influence of dissolved fermentable substrates on model predictions fig 2 k o with no background doc breakthrough of tce 0 15 mm at peak was predicted in the effluent beginning at day 93 7 and transformation to tce daughter products particularly cis dce was largely underpredicted ignoring background doc in the model simulation resulted in much larger discrepancies with measured data with calculated mres of 124 1 40 0 30 0 and 38 7 for tce cis dce vc and ethene respectively this represented changes in mres by factors of 18 6 1 5 0 7 and 1 2 compared with the base case the simulation without background doc underpredicted the extent of mrd with an meod ratio of 0 81 0 19 the difference between model predictions was greater at later times when vfas were depleted with an meod ratio of 0 45 during p4 for the no doc simulation fig s13 this comparison demonstrates the importance of accounting for background doc after supplied electron donor substrate has been depleted although mrd rate parameters averaged over the microcosm replicates were employed in aquifer cell modeling three sets of maximum utilization rates k max i were available from batch model fits to microcosm replicates previous studies have shown that model predictions are most sensitive to k max i compared with other mrd rate parameters and coefficients e g chen et al 2013 christ and abriola 2007 kouznetsova et al 2010 given the variability of the fitted k max i from the triplicate microcosms 6 7 1 3 7 4 1 4 and 3 9 0 3 102¬µmol mg cell day for tce cis dce and vc respectively aquifer cell simulations were performed to examine prediction sensitivity to this variability few previous studies have considered the influence of rate parameter variability on predictions typically employing a single set of fitted rate parameters three additional numerical simulations were conducted using the three sets of k max parameters fit to the triplicate microcosm experiments table 1 along with the heterogeneous aquifer cell permeabilities table 2 results in fig s14 the predicted dechlorination extent among these simulations varied over time with meod ratio values of 1 10 0 20 0 92 0 10 and 0 80 0 13 for the simulations based upon mc 1 2 and 3 respectively changes in meod ratio mirrored the trends of changes in k max i particularly for k max dce and k max vc table 1 a 1 4 times average decrease in k max dce and k max vc from mc 1 to mc 3 led to a decrease in meod ratio by the same factor successful model prediction of mrd has also been linked to selection of an appropriate active dechlorinating biomass haest et al 2010b phelan et al 2015 in the aquifer cell model the nttc ratio of dhc was adjusted within the literature range to improve model prediction of voc and biomass concentrations therefore simulations were also performed to examine the sensitivity of predicted effluent concentrations and extent of mrd to changes in the nttc ratio of dhc here three simulations were conducted with different nttc ratios for dhc 10 25 and 50 to represent the literature variability range for published laboratory experiments c√°piro et al 2015 chen et al 2013 sabolowsky et al 2010 this parameter directly affects the initial value of attached active biomass for the simulations computed meod ratio for these simulations were 1 26 0 25 0 96 0 15 and 0 88 0 09 respectively fig s15 simulated effluent concentrations fig s15 k o demonstrated that the selected nttc ratio had a more pronounced impact on prediction accuracy under high electron donor concentration conditions in the case with a nttc of 10 ethene was the only component that was predicted in the effluent after the lactate pulse p3 period with a peak concentration of 0 25 mm indicating compete transformation of tce while the concentration of ethene was underpredicted over time a high concentration of cis dce was predicted in the effluent in the case with a nttc of 50 decreasing the initial attached active dhc biomass by a factor of 9 0 increasing the nttc ratio from 10 to 50 led to a 1 4 times decrease in meod ratio although the nttc ratio may not be readily quantifiable and could vary with organism growth state these results suggest that model predictions may be relatively insensitive to uncertainty in initial dechlorinating population estimates as discussed above the variability in predicted eod among the conducted model sensitivity simulations was moderate with a mean meod ratio of 0 94 the range is 0 80 1 09 for the varying k max cases and 1 04 the range is 0 88 1 26 for the differing nttc ratio cases the change in permeability between the uniform and heterogeneous domain simulations resulted in a slightly larger average prediction error in meod ratio 0 92 the two values are 0 87 and 0 96 however the prediction errors associated with ignoring heterogeneity mean meod ratio 0 76 were greater under electron donor limiting conditions i e during p4 compared to those associated with variability of k max mean meod ratio 0 84 or nttc ratio mean meod ratio 0 83 these comparisons suggest that physical heterogeneity is likely to play a substantial role in determining accuracy of model predictions especially under electron donor limiting conditions model predictions based upon sparse sampling of permeability would not be able to capture fine scale variations and may be associated with larger errors although the analysis presented above highlights the sensitivity of model predictions to several selected parameters these modeling results also suggest that microcosm derived rate parameters can be used to provide relevant predictions of effluent concentrations mres 27 and the extent of mrd meodratio less than 4 deviation in well characterized heterogeneous domains 4 conclusions a coupled experimental and modeling investigation was undertaken to examine mrd under field relevant conditions with periods of limited electron donor and variations in permeability despite the differences in physical scales solid to liquid mass ratios and flow conditions model simulations employing microcosm estimated rate parameters exhibited mres of only 26 0 for mrd in this more complex system this model prediction accuracy was shown to depend on incorporation of the spatial distribution of permeability trace background doc and initial biomass abundance as well as microbial transformation rates these results contrast with many published studies that have reported that calculated transformation rates from larger scale systems were inconsistent with overpredicted by microcosm rate parameters although model predictions yielded good overall agreement with experimental observations in this study caution is recommended in extrapolation of these conclusions to other systems conditions for example the conditions flow ph temperature nutrient inhibition electron donor and electron acceptor in the aquifer cell experiment were maintained to provide a suitable growth environment for the microbes model predictions were least accurate under donor limiting conditions furthermore the presence of the competing microbial populations such as methanogens sulfate and iron reducers would be expected to influence the rate extent and timing of dechlorination thus redox processes utilizing other electron acceptors need to be considered and modeled kinetically for field sites where ideal mrd conditions are not achieved microcosm derived rates may not be readily applicable to reactive transport modeling in natural heterogeneous field environments if the hydrogeochemical conditions differ greatly between the laboratory and field such as under conditions of monitored natural attenuation this study revealed that heterogeneity in soil permeability influences the extent and spatial variation of mrd inclusion of physical heterogeneity in numerical modeling is crucial to accurate predictions model simulations using microcosm estimated dechlorination rates but employing uniform formation properties and initial conditions were unable to adequately predict the extent of mrd in the aquifer cell the extent of mrd was underpredicted in these simulations although this work was focused on modeling mrd at the bench scale this finding highlights the potential benefit of permeability characterization at field sites sparse sampling will necessarily result in application of models that use average soil properties increasing prediction errors results also point to the potential benefit of identifying and modeling low permeability layers for long term field site prediction and management under conditions where fine scale heterogeneity delineation is not possible advanced modeling tools for data interpolation uncertainty quantification and adaptive sampling e g arshadi et al 2020 cardiff et al 2013 koch and nowak 2016 tang 2019 zhu et al 2009 zhu and yeh 2006 could prove useful in enabling quantification of the uncertainty resulting from ignoring small scale subsurface variability future work focusing on upscaling to identify effective rate parameters could improve the extrapolation of laboratory rates to systems with coarser resolution a sensitivity analysis indicates that local permeability variations have a much more substantial influence on the extent of mrd than uncertainty in microbial transformation rates or initial biomass estimates particularly under carbon and electron donor limited conditions trace levels of background fermentable substrate doc contributed substantially to mrd in the aquifer cell highlighting the importance of characterizing organic compounds that may serve as fermentable sources of electron donor that can be utilized by microbes in natural groundwater and soil comparisons of simulation and experimental port data revealed that model prediction errors exhibited a large variance evolving with time spatial location and the specific voc examined local concentrations within the aquifer cell were sensitive to fine scale variations in physical chemical and biological properties micro environments variations unlikely to be captured in field scale modeling efforts these results suggest that mathematical models will be more useful for the prediction of the overall extent of mrd and trends in space and time rather than specific concentrations at sampling location declaration of competing interest the

17159,this study investigated the mechanisms of mixed io3 i system under uv irradiation in drinking water and compared the iodinated trihalomethanes i thms formation of a mixed io3 i system to that of single i and io3 systems during subsequent chloramination the effects of initial i io3 molar ratio ph and uv intensity on a mixed io3 i system were studied the introduction of i enhanced the conversion rate of io3 to reactive iodine species ris besides io3 degradation rate increased with the increase of initial i concentration and uv intensity and the decrease of ph value in a mixed io3 i system io3 could undergo direct photolysis and photoreduction by hydrated electron eaq moreover the enhancement of i thm formation in a mixed io3 i system during subsequent chloramination was observed the i thm yields in a mixed io3 i system were higher than the sum of i thms produced in a single io3 and i systems at all the evaluated initial i concentrations and ph values the difference between i thm formation in a mixed io3 i system and the sum of i thms in a single io3 and i systems increased with the increase of initial i concentration as the initial ph decreased from 9 to 5 the difference of i thm yields enhanced while the total i thm yield of a mixed io3 i system and single i and io3 systems decreased slightly besides io3 i containing water with doc concentration of 2 5 4 5 mg c l which mainly contained humic acid substances had a higher risk in i thms formation than individual i containing and io3 containing water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iodate io3 iodide i iodinated trihalomethanes i thms uv irradiation chloramination 1 introduction since early 1900s disinfection has been applied to safeguard drinking water from waterborne pathogens richardson et al 2000 chlorine and chloramine two widely used chemical disinfectants can react with dissolved organic matter dom or inorganic precursors such as iodide and bromide in water resulting in the formation of undesired disinfection by products dbps richardson 2003 in addition emerging iodinated dbps i dbps are reported to be the most genotoxic and cytotoxic dbps and et al 2004 duirk et al 2011 richardson et al 2008 richardson and postigo 2011 among these i dbps iodinated trihalomethanes i thms are worthy of attention because they can result in the issues of taste and odor in drinking water in addition to their high toxicity bichsel and von gunten 2000a bruchet et al 1991 cancho et al 2001 hanai et al 1996 hansson et al 1987 chloramination has been widely applied in many water utilities and can reduce the amount of regulated carbonaceous thm yields but i thms can be produced easily by this disinfection method in iodine containing water hatch 1999 plewa et al 2002 the formation of i dbps depends on the type and concentration of iodine species in water iodate io3 iodide i and iodo organic compounds are reported to be the dominant iodine species in water gilfedder et al 2009 gong and zhang 2013 gschwend et al 1985 hansen et al 2011 as many studies shown in i containing water i can be rapidly oxidized by chloramine to hypoiodous acid hoi i2 and i3 which are reactive iodine species ris and can easily react with nom to form various i dbps and et al 2004 and and gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000a it was also reported that iodo organic compounds such as iodinated x ray contrast media compounds can lead to the formation of i dbps during chlorination and chloramination of drinking water jeong et al 2010 ye et al 2014 io3 is commonly considered as a desired sink of iodine in drinking water due to its non toxicity and stability allard et al 2013 b√ºrgi et al 2001 united states food and drug administration has granted the status of io3 as generally recognized as safe b√ºrgi et al 2001 however the validity of this standpoint was challenged for the first time by saunders et al 2012 who reported the photoreduction of io3 at near uv visible wavelengths Œª 290 nm in humic acid synthetic water after that the phototransformation of io3 to i and the formation of i thms from io3 in uv disinfected water followed by chloramination were reported zhang et al 2016b on this basis the photolysis characteristics of io3 under uv irradiation was further studied tian et al 2017 considering the wide application of uv irradiation dotson et al 2012 and the photosensitivity of io3 io3 can be a another possible iodine source of i dbps because it can photoconversion to i and ris that can readily form i dbps therefore io3 deserves more attention in uv and subsequent disinfection processes in dwtps however io3 and i are naturally present in water at the same time gong and zhang 2013 schwehr and santschi 2003 wong 1991 besides without pre oxidation jekel 1998 rigobello et al 2013 i will not be oxidized to io3 both of them will coexist during the subsequent treatment process in dwtps and and gunten 1999 iodine is mostly present as i or io3 in most cases of surface water and ground water gong and zhang 2013 schwehr and santschi 2003 wong 1991 commonly i has been detected in source water at an average of 20 Œºg l while a high concentration case of 104 2 Œºg l was also found in a drinking water treatment plant dwtp of the united states moran et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 io3 has been detected in tap water at the range of 0 4 42 5 Œºg l and in surface and ground waters at a range of 0 8 Œºg l 4 2 Œºg l gong and zhang 2013 schwehr and santschi 2003 although io3 and i coexist in water commonly the research has always focused on single io3 or i system while their interaction under uv irradiation and i dbps formation during subsequent chloramination have been insufficiently studied so far the investigation on mixed io3 i system has been carried out around dushman reaction and potassium iodide iodate ki kio3 actinometer the redox reaction between io3 and i under an acid condition is known as the dushman reaction which has been widely applied to characterize the micromixing process in a chemical reactors or mixer dushman 1903 many researchers have studied its kinetics and reported a large number of rate laws for the redox reaction for instance rate law was reported by abel and hilferding 1928 as k1 h 2 i io3 k1 405 m 3s 1 barton and wright 1968 as k2 h 2 i 2 io3 k2 3 108 m 4s 1 and schildcrout and fortunato 1975 as k3 h 2 i 2 io3 k4 h 2 i io3 k3 4 2 108 m 4s 1 and k4 2 5 106 m 3s 1 in 1997 the reaction between io3 and i during uv irradiation was investigated by rahn 1997 the ki kio3 system was considered as an alternative chemical actinometer for potassium iodide nitrous oxide ki n2o actinometer due to its high quantum yield of photoproduct triiodide i3 and anti interference performance in visible light rahn 1997 in the subsequent studies of ki kio3 actinometer the involved reactions were consistent with those of rahn bolton et al 2011 qiang et al 2015 rahn et al 2006 i can absorb photons to generate hydrated electron eaq and iodine atom under uv irradiation and finally generate i3 io3 as an electron scavenge in this system can facilitate the process the yield of i3 is proportional to the quantum yield therefore the number of einsteins of photons absorbed by the system can be obtained however the quantum yield for ki kio3 actinometer system only considered the photos absorbed by i rather than by both i and io3 under uv irradiation in a study of i thm formation in a mixed io3 i system it is believed that only io3 could absorb photons and there is no further study of the reaction mechanisms in a mixed io3 i system xia et al 2018 therefore the mechanism of mixed io3 i system under uv irradiation in drinking water needs to be further studied clearly because of the possibility of interaction between io3 and i and their photosensitivity under uv irradiation the purpose of this study was to investigate the reaction mechanisms of i and io3 during uv irradiation and their impact on the formation of i thms during subsequent chloramination effects of three factors including initial i io3 molar ratio expressed by initial different i concentration under fixed io3 concentration condition ph and uv intensity on io3 photodegradation were studied moreover the i thm formation in a single iodine system a single io3 or single i system and a mixed io3 i system was investigated at different initial i concentrations ph values doc concentrations and water sources to elucidate the potential risks of treating iodide iodate containing water by uv irradiation and subsequent chloramine

methanol and acetic acid solution 0 1 the detection limits of io3 i and hoi i2 were 10 5 and 10 Œºg i l respectively triiodide i3 was analyzed by using a uv vis spectrophotometer at its maximum

and discussion 3 1 comparison of io3 degradation and its products in single io3 and mixed io3 i systems the concentrations of i and io3 ranged from 0 4 to 104 2 Œºg l and 0 4 to 42 5 Œºg l respectively but the molar ration of i io3 is varied from locations to locations gong and zhang 2013 moran et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 schwehr and santschi 2003 in order to get obvious phenomenon and effective measurements of io3 conversion and iodine species i hoi i2 and i3 in single io3 and mixed io3 i systems more clearly higher initial concentration of io3 60 Œºm and i 30 300 Œºm were chosen in this study the photodegradation efficiencies of io3 in the absence and presence of different initial i concentrations without and with uv irradiation were investigated and the results are displayed in fig s2 and fig 1 respectivelly it can be seen from fig s2 that io3 hardly degraded without uv irradiation when it existed alone or coexisted with i in fig 1 only 29 9 of the initial io3 was decomposed by direct photolysis after 1 h uv irradiation however the removal efficiency of io3 increased to 32 8 36 9 48 1 65 0 and 70 1 with the initial i concentrations of 30 60 120 240 and 300 Œºm respectively it is obvious that the uv irradiation and increasing i concentration in the mixed io3 i system greatly enhanced the io3 degradation rate which implies that internal interactions occurred between i and io3 in water under uv irradiation to further investigate the mechanism of io3 photodegradation in a single io3 and mixed io3 i systems the degradation products of io3 in both systems were analyzed by using uplc and uv vis spectrophotometer respectively the evolutions of the detected iodine species io3 i hoi i2 and i3 with uv irradiation time and without uv irradiation were illustrated in fig 2 and fig s3 respectively in fig s3 io3 and i were almost unchanged and hoi i2 and i3 were not detected as presented in fig 2 a io3 concentration kept decreasing in the 1 h monitoring period while the main photolysis products of it i and hoi i2 kept increasing in the single io3 system which was consistent with the results reported by tian et al 2017 the concentrations of i and hoi i2 were 9 9 and 6 6 Œºm after 1 h uv irradiation respectively while i3 was not observed in this system fig 2 b displays the significant reduction of io3 and i during uv irradiation in the mixed io3 i system the reason for the decrease of i might be explained by that i can react with uv or the photolysis products of io3 such as io and i2 and its reduction rate is greater than its formation rate at which i is generated by io3 dushman 1903 nagarajan and fessenden 1985 however the concentrations of hoi i2 and i3 ris increased to 15 3 and 4 7 Œºm in the first 20 min and then decreased gradually to 7 2 and 3 9 Œºm after 1h uv irradiation because hoi and i can react to form i2 which can further react with i to form i3 eigen and kustin 1962 rigg and weiss 1952 troy et al 1991 hoi and i2 could be regarded as the intermediate products while i3 could be regarded as a product of i2 and i i3 was stable formed in the excess of i guichardon and falk 2000 schwarz and bielski 1986 troy et al 1991 therefore in the later stage of the reaction i greatly decreased and was not sufficient to generate i3 resulting in a slightly decrease in i3 however i3 was more stable than i2 and hoi making it maintain a stable existence compared with i2 and hoi which was consistent with ye et al 2012 it is worth noting that hoi i2 were also reduced in the later stage of the reaction indicating that they might be converted to other forms of iodine this speculation was further confirmed by the results that the total amount of iodine species in the single io3 and the mixed io3 i systems was not conserved table s1 thus it can be reasonably speculated that hoi i2 will also decrease at a certain period of after 1 h of uv irradiation in fig 2 a which is similar to the trend of photodecomposition products of bromate bro3 under 190 260 nm uv irradiation farkas and klein 1948 according to the above analysis i3 in this paper was mainly used to reflect the reaction degree of io3 and i in mixed io3 i system just as i3 was used to reflect the reaction degree of i and eaq in ki kio3 actinometer rahn 1997 fig 3 displays the effect of different initial i concentrations on the production of i3 during uv irradiation the evolution of i3 exhibited a peak point after 10 30 min at the initial i concentrations of 30 300 Œºm it can be drawn that the yield of i3 increased and its peak point shifted to later time with increasing initial i dose due to the accelerated i3 formation process by increasing i concentration the greater decomposition of io3 and subsequently formation of i3 implied that the mixed io3 i system might be based on the reductive pathway under uv irradiation after introducing i in the system it can also be inferred from fig 2 and fig 3 that more io3 was converted to ris in a mixed io3 i system than in a single io3 system it has been reported that ris plays a crucial role in i thm formation during the subsequent chlorination or chloramination process liu et al 2017 xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b therefore further i thm formation experiments were performed in the mixed io3 i system in the following section 3 4 3 2 proposed reaction mechanisms the direct photolysis of io3 has been reported to occur through absorbing the light emitted by low pressure hg uv lamps tian et al 2017 being transitioned to the excited state for further decomposition to some intermediates farkas and klein 1948 found that the photodecomposition products of bro3 under uv irradiation at the wavelength 190 260 nm were hypobromite bro bromide br and oxygen o2 in addition bromite bro2 was regarded as an intermediate photolysis product of bro3 under uv irradiation in other related studies jung et al 2014 siddiqui et al 1996 through literature review we found an iodine species iodite io2 was assumed to explain the sequential reactions of the two electron oxidant io3 and a two electron reductant bichsel and von gunten 2000b concialini and tubertini 1978 lambert and fina 1984 sharma and gupta 1971 considering the possible formation of other iodine intermediates speculated in the previous section 3 1 and the structural similarity between io3 and bro3 io2 might also be a photodegradation intermediate of io3 therefore in a the single io3 system io3 decomposition by direct photolysis might sequentially form io2 io and i eqs 1 3 which was consistent with other research results reporting that io3 photodegradation was not affected by ph but affected by uv intensity tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b in a mixed io3 i system in addition to the direct photolysis of io3 mentioned above photoreduction of io3 may also happen it has been reported that the reaction between eaq generated by uv irradiation of i and io3 can convert io3 into io at the first stage rahn 1997 however considering that the reaction between io3 and eaq may be similar to that between bromate and eaq which is a gradual reduction process io3 could first be converted to io2 and further transformed into io as presented in eqs 5 6 through eqs 7 9 io can be reduced to i2 and further to i3 in the presence of excess i eigen and kustin 1962 rahn 1997 rigg and weiss 1952 schwarz and bielski 1986 troy et al 1991 the overall reaction between i and io3 under uv irradiation can be expressed in eq 10 it is obvious that the degradation of io3 can be affected by uv intensity and ph in the overall reaction of the mixed io3 i system therefore the influence of uv intensity and ph on io3 photodegradation was further investigated in the following sections besides it is worth noting that the proposed mechanisms of the reactions in a mixed io3 i system indicated that the iodate iodide chemical actinometer at uv 254 nm is inaccurate because it only considers the ability of i to absorb photos without taking into account that io3 can also absorb photons with the quantum yield of 0 0591 einstein 1 tian et al 2017 1 2 i o 3 h v 2 i o 2 o 2 2 2 i o 2 h v 2 i o o 2 3 2 i o h v 2 i o 2 4

io3 photodegradation in a mixed io3 i system 3 3 1 effect of ph fig 4 a and fig s4 displays the effect of ph on io3 degradation in the mixed io3 i system with and without uv irradiation respectively it can be seen from fig s4 that io3 only slightly degraded under acid phs without uv irradiation which was consistent with the phenomenon in dushman reaction system dushman 1903 in fig 4 a it is obvious that io3 degradation efficiency increased from 17 8 to 70 4 as ph value decreased from 9 to 5 during uv irradiation it has been reported that direct photolysis of io3 and the electron photodetachment from i were not significantly influenced by ph sauer et al 2004 tian et al 2017 the strong ph dependence of io3 degradation in the presence of i could be explained by the strong effect of ph on the reactivity of eaq with io3 eq 10 io3 removal efficiency after 1 h uv irradiation at ph 5 was 4 1 times higher than that at ph 9 fig 4 a however there was almost no difference of the degradation rates between ph 6 and 5 which may due to that eaq could be quickly quenched by h with a rate constant of 2 3 1010 m 1s 1 rendering the competition of eaq between io3 and h eq 5 buxton et al 1988 fig 4 b displays the effect of initial ph values on i3 degradation in the presence of i during uv irradiation the yield of i3 at neutral and acidic ph value increased in the first 20 min and then gradually decreased while i3 yield kept increasing at ph 8 9 in addition i3 formation at ph 5 7 was faster than that at ph 8 9 in the first 20 min uv irradiation the possible reason for the different trends and formation rate of i3 between ph 5 7 and ph 8 9 could be that the overall reaction in a mixed io3 i system was faster under neutral and acidic ph values than under alkaline ph values resulting in faster consumption of i so that i3 can be generated quickly and reach peak point early under neutral and acidic ph values fig 4 b and eq 10 however the decrease of i3 accelerated with the decrease of ph from 7 to 5 during uv irradiation from 20 to 60 min the lower the ph the more eaq was quenched by io3 io2 and h resulting the faster consumption of i eqs 4 6 buxton et al 1988 therefore i3 was more converted into i2 and i with decreasing ph during later 20 to 60 min uv irradiation eq 9 troy et al 1991 3 3 2 effect of uv intensity the effect of uv intensity on io3 degradation in the mixed io3 i system was displayed in fig 4 c io3 degradation efficiency after 1 h uv irradiation were 34 8 45 2 and 65 0 at uv intensity of 132 194 and 870 Œºw cm2 respectively apparently high uv intensity has a positive effect on photodegradation rate of io3 this phenomenon could be explained by the enhancement of io3 direct photodissociation by photo and photoreduction by eaq which generate via increasing uv irradiation of i sun et al 2017b tian et al 2017 the enhancing degradation rate of io3 with increasing uv intensity confirmed the photosensitivity of the mixed io3 i system to uv irradiation and rationality of proposed reaction mechanism eqs 1 4 5 3 4 i thm formation in a mixed io3 i system during chloramination 3 4 1 effect of initial i concentration the effect of i concentration 0 25 Œºm on i thm formation in io3 containing ha synthetic water after uv irradiation followed by 3 days chloramination was studied and the results are illustrated in fig 5 a i thm formation in a single i or io3 system was also evaluated and presented in fig 5 a for comparing the effect of iodide iodate coexistence on i thm yields it is obvious that the initial concentration of i exerted a strong effect on i thm formation both in the single i and the mixed io3 i systems the mixed io3 i system and the sum of the single i and io3 systems gradually increased from 108 4 and 62 8 Œºg l at 2 5 Œºm i to 1076 1 and 940 0 Œºg l at 25 Œºm i respectively it is known that chloramine can oxidize i to ris which can easily react with nom and form i thms and et al 2004 and and gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000a therefore the increase of i concentration in the solution resulted in the increasing concentration of ris and inevitably led to the increase of i thms in both mixed io3 i and single i systems moreover it is worth noting that the i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system are higher than the sum of the i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems at each dosed i concentration after uv irradiation followed by chloramination the i thms difference between mixed io3 i system and the sum of single i and io3 systems was due to the difference of ris concentration which was depended on conversion rate of io3 according to the comparison of io3 uv degradation between the mixed io3 i and the single io3 systems mentioned above fig 1 fig 2 the reason might be that the mixed io3 i system irradiated by uv made more io3 converted into ris which could further react with ha and produced more i thms as shown in fig 5 a the i thms difference between mixed io3 i system and the sum of single i and io3 systems was increased with the increase of initial i concentration when the initial concentration of i was 25 Œºm the maximum difference of i thms between the mixed io3 i system and the sum of the single i and io3 systems reached 136 4 Œºg l this phenomenon implies that a higher i io3 molar ratio can lead to the higher risks of i thm formation i thm formation potential was higher in a mixed io3 i system than in a single iodine system in the post chloramine process after uv irradiation in order to verify the hazards of mixed io3 i system we conducted the similar i thm formation experiments under different i io3 molar ratio without uv irradiation and the results are presented in fig s5 as shown in fig s5 i thms were hardly generated in single io3 system and the formation of it in mixed io3 i system in each dosed i concentration condition was greater than that in single i system besides higher increase of i thms formation were obtained in mixed io3 i system than those in single i system when increase initial i concentration the reason may be that the stirring of the mixed io3 i solution that is the micromixing process made io3 and i undergo dushman reaction dushman 1903 k√∂lbl et al 2013 wenzel et al 2018 resulting in more ris formation than single i system it is obviously that the hazard of mixed io3 i system that produced more i thms was further amplified under uv irradiation fig 5 a uv irradiation made more i thms formed in mixed io3 i system under the same condition and made the i thms concentration difference between mixed io3 i system and the sum of single i and io3 systems more significant therefore special attention should be paid to the uv disinfection of raw water with coexistence of i and io3 3 4 2 effect of ph during uv irradiation the effect of ph during uv irradiation on the formation of i thms was studied with initial concentration of i and io3 as 5 and 10 Œºm respectively after uv irradiation followed by 3 days chloramination and the results are displayed in fig 5 b in order to eliminate the influence of ph in the post chloramination process all solutions were adjusted to ph 7 using naoh or h2so4 after uv irradiation as displayed in fig 5 b i thm formation in the mixed io3 i system and the sum of those in the single i and io3 systems gradually increased from 573 1 and 358 6 Œºg l at ph 5 to 645 1 and 479 4 Œºg l at ph 9 respectively however their difference decreased from 214 4 Œºg l at ph 5 to 165 7 Œºg l at ph 9 which consist with the impact of ph on io3 degradation in this study fig 4 a for the single i system the lower the ph the less i thm yield duirk et al 2011 hua and reckhow 2008 for the single io3 system ph almost has no effect on i thm yield tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b however the lower the ph the greater the conversion of io3 to ris discussed in section 3 3 1 which leaded to the relatively smaller decrease of i thm yield in the mixed io3 i system than in single i system as a result the i thm yield difference between the mixed io3 i system and the single i io3 systems decreased with increasing ph the increasing enhancement of i thm formation with increasing ph in mixed io3 i system and single i systems could be attributed to the following reasons firstly ha could be activated by uv and reacted with ris such as hoi i2 and i3 to form iodo derivatives and overall reactivity of ha could be enhanced by higher ph values avena et al 1999 saunders et al 2012 steinberg et al 2008 sun et al 2017a secondly i2 was the dominate species at acid phs and will be transformed to i3 in the presence of excess i which was a less reactive iodine species than hoi and i2 eqs 7 9 cripps et al 2003 liu et al 2017 thirdly the reaction rate between ris and nom decreased with the decreased of ph values lin et al 2008 warner et al 2000 3 4 3 effect of doc concentration the effect of dom concentration expressed as doc concentration on i thm formation in ha synthetic water after uv irradiation followed by 3 day chloramination was studied and the results are displayed in fig 5 c obviously statistically significant i thm yield decreases in single io3 system and single i system were detected as doc increase from 1 2 to 4 5 mg c l however the i thm yield in mixed io3 i system presented an increasing then decreasing trend as doc increased from 1 2 to 4 5 mg c l and reached a maximum of 830 6 Œºg l at doc of 2 5 mg c l the phenomenon may be because the increase in doc concentration can provide more organic precursors and reactive sites to promote the i thm formation however nh2cl will be consumed by exorbitant dom leading to a reduction of nh2cl for further oxidizing i to ris xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the i thm decrease of chi3 in high doc concentration which accounts for the main part of total i thm was due to the difficulty formation of triiodo dbps in the presence of excess dom liu et al 2017 also contributing to the total i thm reduction in addition i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system were higher than the sum of the i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems at doc of 2 5 4 5 mg c l which was consistent with the previous conclusion of this paper however it is worth noting that i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system were lower than the sum of i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems at doc of 1 2 mg c l this may because when doc concentration was 1 2 mg c l the precursors contained were not enough for the mixed io3 i system which could produce more ris however single io3 system and single i system had a total doc concentration of 2 4 mg c l 1 2 mg c l for each system which was higher than the mixed io3 i system even though they generated less ris 3 4 4 i thm formation from two raw waters the raw water from a dwtp rw1 and a surface water rw2 was collected and spiked 10 Œºm of io3 or 5 Œºm of i to evaluate i thm formation in mixed io3 i system under realistic water sources and uv dose treatment condition 40 mj cm2 criquet et al 2012 jones et al 2011 ha synthetic waters ha1 and ha2 prepared with the same doc concentration as rw1 and rw2 were also investigated under the same conditions to exclude the influence of doc concentration the results are illustrated in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 i thm formation in the mixed io3 i system and the sum of i thm in the single i and io3 systems were detected during monochloramination for 3 days as 52 1 and 50 1 Œºg l in surface water rw1 36 7 and 29 5 Œºg l in ha synthetic water ha1 28 8 and 34 7 Œºg l in dwtp raw water rw2 47 0 and 39 9 Œºg l in ha synthetic water ha2 i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system were higher than the sum of the i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems in rw1 ha1 and ha2 which was consistent with the previous conclusion of this paper however the opposite results were observed in rw2 these phenomena may be related to the characteristics of the four water sources the basic characteristics of these four water sources were summarized in table s2 and the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra of four water sources are illustrated in fig 7 to differentiate and characterize their structures it should be noted that the i thm formation in four water samples was not well correlated with suva table s2 indicating that suva value cannot be used as a suitable indicator for evaluating i thm formation wang et al 2014 xia et al 2018 eem spectra was operationally divided into five regions to differentiate various structures of dbp precursors tyrosine like the region i Œªex 250 nm Œªem 330 nm tryptophan like the region ii Œªex 250 nm 330 nm Œªem 380 nm fulvic acid like the region iii Œªex 250 nm Œªem 380 nm soluble microbial product like the region iv Œªex 250 nm Œªem 380 nm and humic acid like the region v Œªex 250 nm Œªem 380 nm regions chen et al 2003 in fig 7 rw1 ha1 and ha2 were similar and mainly have the region v humic acid like both rw1 and rw2 have a fluorophore in the region v and they differ in the region iv soluble microbial product like where rw2 has an eem center and rw1 exhibits an eem shoulder therefore the opposite results that i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system were lower than the sum of the i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems in rw2 might associated with its soluble microbial product like substances indicating that humic acid like substances was more active to form i thms in mixed io3 i system which had relatively high ris concentration wang et al 2014 4 conclusions this study proposed the reaction mechanism in a mixed io3 i system which consisted of direct photolysis of io3 and photoreduction of io3 by eaq generated by i that absorbed photos the results indicate that iodate iodide actinometer should consider photosensitivity of io3 the electron scavenger to uv irradiation in the coexistence of io3 and i uv disinfection converted more products into ris which could be further enhanced by decreasing ph value and increasing uv intensity and initial i io3 molar ratio i thms were identified in the subsequent chloramination process significantly increase of i thms was observed in the mixed io3 i system compared to those in a single io3 and i systems especially when using uv disinfection furthermore a high concentration of i and acid ph values could increase the difference of i thm formation between the two systems in addition doc concentration at 2 5 4 5 mg c l and dom with the principal components of humic acid like substances were the water background conditions for mixed io3 i system produced more i thms than single io3 and i systems overall this study clarified the reaction mechanisms in the iodate iodide containing water under uv irradiation and elucidated its potential risk and water dom conditions which could significantly enhancing i thm formation during subsequent chloramination therefore when io3 and i coexist in water with relatively high doc concentration and dom dominated by humic acid like substances uv irradiation should be applied carefully and uv and subsequent disinfection processes should be carried out at acid or nearly neutral ph values to control

17159,this study investigated the mechanisms of mixed io3 i system under uv irradiation in drinking water and compared the iodinated trihalomethanes i thms formation of a mixed io3 i system to that of single i and io3 systems during subsequent chloramination the effects of initial i io3 molar ratio ph and uv intensity on a mixed io3 i system were studied the introduction of i enhanced the conversion rate of io3 to reactive iodine species ris besides io3 degradation rate increased with the increase of initial i concentration and uv intensity and the decrease of ph value in a mixed io3 i system io3 could undergo direct photolysis and photoreduction by hydrated electron eaq moreover the enhancement of i thm formation in a mixed io3 i system during subsequent chloramination was observed the i thm yields in a mixed io3 i system were higher than the sum of i thms produced in a single io3 and i systems at all the evaluated initial i concentrations and ph values the difference between i thm formation in a mixed io3 i system and the sum of i thms in a single io3 and i systems increased with the increase of initial i concentration as the initial ph decreased from 9 to 5 the difference of i thm yields enhanced while the total i thm yield of a mixed io3 i system and single i and io3 systems decreased slightly besides io3 i containing water with doc concentration of 2 5 4 5 mg c l which mainly contained humic acid substances had a higher risk in i thms formation than individual i containing and io3 containing water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iodate io3 iodide i iodinated trihalomethanes i thms uv irradiation chloramination 1 introduction since early 1900s disinfection has been applied to safeguard drinking water from waterborne pathogens richardson et al 2000 chlorine and chloramine two widely used chemical disinfectants can react with dissolved organic matter dom or inorganic precursors such as iodide and bromide in water resulting in the formation of undesired disinfection by products dbps richardson 2003 in addition emerging iodinated dbps i dbps are reported to be the most genotoxic and cytotoxic dbps and et al 2004 duirk et al 2011 richardson et al 2008 richardson and postigo 2011 among these i dbps iodinated trihalomethanes i thms are worthy of attention because they can result in the issues of taste and odor in drinking water in addition to their high toxicity bichsel and von gunten 2000a bruchet et al 1991 cancho et al 2001 hanai et al 1996 hansson et al 1987 chloramination has been widely applied in many water utilities and can reduce the amount of regulated carbonaceous thm yields but i thms can be produced easily by this disinfection method in iodine containing water hatch 1999 plewa et al 2002 the formation of i dbps depends on the type and concentration of iodine species in water iodate io3 iodide i and iodo organic compounds are reported to be the dominant iodine species in water gilfedder et al 2009 gong and zhang 2013 gschwend et al 1985 hansen et al 2011 as many studies shown in i containing water i can be rapidly oxidized by chloramine to hypoiodous acid hoi i2 and i3 which are reactive iodine species ris and can easily react with nom to form various i dbps and et al 2004 and and gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000a it was also reported that iodo organic compounds such as iodinated x ray contrast media compounds can lead to the formation of i dbps during chlorination and chloramination of drinking water jeong et al 2010 ye et al 2014 io3 is commonly considered as a desired sink of iodine in drinking water due to its non toxicity and stability allard et al 2013 b√ºrgi et al 2001 united states food and drug administration has granted the status of io3 as generally recognized as safe b√ºrgi et al 2001 however the validity of this standpoint was challenged for the first time by saunders et al 2012 who reported the photoreduction of io3 at near uv visible wavelengths Œª 290 nm in humic acid synthetic water after that the phototransformation of io3 to i and the formation of i thms from io3 in uv disinfected water followed by chloramination were reported zhang et al 2016b on this basis the photolysis characteristics of io3 under uv irradiation was further studied tian et al 2017 considering the wide application of uv irradiation dotson et al 2012 and the photosensitivity of io3 io3 can be a another possible iodine source of i dbps because it can photoconversion to i and ris that can readily form i dbps therefore io3 deserves more attention in uv and subsequent disinfection processes in dwtps however io3 and i are naturally present in water at the same time gong and zhang 2013 schwehr and santschi 2003 wong 1991 besides without pre oxidation jekel 1998 rigobello et al 2013 i will not be oxidized to io3 both of them will coexist during the subsequent treatment process in dwtps and and gunten 1999 iodine is mostly present as i or io3 in most cases of surface water and ground water gong and zhang 2013 schwehr and santschi 2003 wong 1991 commonly i has been detected in source water at an average of 20 Œºg l while a high concentration case of 104 2 Œºg l was also found in a drinking water treatment plant dwtp of the united states moran et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 io3 has been detected in tap water at the range of 0 4 42 5 Œºg l and in surface and ground waters at a range of 0 8 Œºg l 4 2 Œºg l gong and zhang 2013 schwehr and santschi 2003 although io3 and i coexist in water commonly the research has always focused on single io3 or i system while their interaction under uv irradiation and i dbps formation during subsequent chloramination have been insufficiently studied so far the investigation on mixed io3 i system has been carried out around dushman reaction and potassium iodide iodate ki kio3 actinometer the redox reaction between io3 and i under an acid condition is known as the dushman reaction which has been widely applied to characterize the micromixing process in a chemical reactors or mixer dushman 1903 many researchers have studied its kinetics and reported a large number of rate laws for the redox reaction for instance rate law was reported by abel and hilferding 1928 as k1 h 2 i io3 k1 405 m 3s 1 barton and wright 1968 as k2 h 2 i 2 io3 k2 3 108 m 4s 1 and schildcrout and fortunato 1975 as k3 h 2 i 2 io3 k4 h 2 i io3 k3 4 2 108 m 4s 1 and k4 2 5 106 m 3s 1 in 1997 the reaction between io3 and i during uv irradiation was investigated by rahn 1997 the ki kio3 system was considered as an alternative chemical actinometer for potassium iodide nitrous oxide ki n2o actinometer due to its high quantum yield of photoproduct triiodide i3 and anti interference performance in visible light rahn 1997 in the subsequent studies of ki kio3 actinometer the involved reactions were consistent with those of rahn bolton et al 2011 qiang et al 2015 rahn et al 2006 i can absorb photons to generate hydrated electron eaq and iodine atom under uv irradiation and finally generate i3 io3 as an electron scavenge in this system can facilitate the process the yield of i3 is proportional to the quantum yield therefore the number of einsteins of photons absorbed by the system can be obtained however the quantum yield for ki kio3 actinometer system only considered the photos absorbed by i rather than by both i and io3 under uv irradiation in a study of i thm formation in a mixed io3 i system it is believed that only io3 could absorb photons and there is no further study of the reaction mechanisms in a mixed io3 i system xia et al 2018 therefore the mechanism of mixed io3 i system under uv irradiation in drinking water needs to be further studied clearly because of the possibility of interaction between io3 and i and their photosensitivity under uv irradiation the purpose of this study was to investigate the reaction mechanisms of i and io3 during uv irradiation and their impact on the formation of i thms during subsequent chloramination effects of three factors including initial i io3 molar ratio expressed by initial different i concentration under fixed io3 concentration condition ph and uv intensity on io3 photodegradation were studied moreover the i thm formation in a single iodine system a single io3 or single i system and a mixed io3 i system was investigated at different initial i concentrations ph values doc concentrations and water sources to elucidate the potential risks of treating iodide iodate containing water by uv irradiation and subsequent chloramine

in dark at 25 1 c for 3d summers et al 1996 the solution ph was adjusted to 7 after the dose of chloramine to eliminate the effect of ph on i thm formation during chloramination three days later the solutions were quenched using na2s2o3 at 20 excess of the initial nh2cl concentration and then extracted by mtbe immediately to avoid any decomposition of i thms 2 3 analytical methods the ph of

methanol and acetic acid solution 0 1 the detection limits of io3 i and hoi i2 were 10 5 and 10 Œºg i l respectively triiodide i3 was analyzed by using a uv vis spectrophotometer at its maximum

and discussion 3 1 comparison of io3 degradation and its products in single io3 and mixed io3 i systems the concentrations of i and io3 ranged from 0 4 to 104 2 Œºg l and 0 4 to 42 5 Œºg l respectively but the molar ration of i io3 is varied from locations to locations gong and zhang 2013 moran et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 schwehr and santschi 2003 in order to get obvious phenomenon and effective measurements of io3 conversion and iodine species i hoi i2 and i3 in single io3 and mixed io3 i systems more clearly higher initial concentration of io3 60 Œºm and i 30 300 Œºm were chosen in this study the photodegradation efficiencies of io3 in the absence and presence of different initial i concentrations without and with uv irradiation were investigated and the results are displayed in fig s2 and fig 1 respectivelly it can be seen from fig s2 that io3 hardly degraded without uv irradiation when it existed alone or coexisted with i in fig 1 only 29 9 of the initial io3 was decomposed by direct photolysis after 1 h uv irradiation however the removal efficiency of io3 increased to 32 8 36 9 48 1 65 0 and 70 1 with the initial i concentrations of 30 60 120 240 and 300 Œºm respectively it is obvious that the uv irradiation and increasing i concentration in the mixed io3 i system greatly enhanced the io3 degradation rate which implies that internal interactions occurred between i and io3 in water under uv irradiation to further investigate the mechanism of io3 photodegradation in a single io3 and mixed io3 i systems the degradation products of io3 in both systems were analyzed by using uplc and uv vis spectrophotometer respectively the evolutions of the detected iodine species io3 i hoi i2 and i3 with uv irradiation time and without uv irradiation were illustrated in fig 2 and fig s3 respectively in fig s3 io3 and i were almost unchanged and hoi i2 and i3 were not detected as presented in fig 2 a io3 concentration kept decreasing in the 1 h monitoring period while the main photolysis products of it i and hoi i2 kept increasing in the single io3 system which was consistent with the results reported by tian et al 2017 the concentrations of i and hoi i2 were 9 9 and 6 6 Œºm after 1 h uv irradiation respectively while i3 was not observed in this system fig 2 b displays the significant reduction of io3 and i during uv irradiation in the mixed io3 i system the reason for the decrease of i might be explained by that i can react with uv or the photolysis products of io3 such as io and i2 and its reduction rate is greater than its formation rate at which i is generated by io3 dushman 1903 nagarajan and fessenden 1985 however the concentrations of hoi i2 and i3 ris increased to 15 3 and 4 7 Œºm in the first 20 min and then decreased gradually to 7 2 and 3 9 Œºm after 1h uv irradiation because hoi and i can react to form i2 which can further react with i to form i3 eigen and kustin 1962 rigg and weiss 1952 troy et al 1991 hoi and i2 could be regarded as the intermediate products while i3 could be regarded as a product of i2 and i i3 was stable formed in the excess of i guichardon and falk 2000 schwarz and bielski 1986 troy et al 1991 therefore in the later stage of the reaction i greatly decreased and was not sufficient to generate i3 resulting in a slightly decrease in i3 however i3 was more stable than i2 and hoi making it maintain a stable existence compared with i2 and hoi which was consistent with ye et al 2012 it is worth noting that hoi i2 were also reduced in the later stage of the reaction indicating that they might be converted to other forms of iodine this speculation was further confirmed by the results that the total amount of iodine species in the single io3 and the mixed io3 i systems was not conserved table s1 thus it can be reasonably speculated that hoi i2 will also decrease at a certain period of after 1 h of uv irradiation in fig 2 a which is similar to the trend of photodecomposition products of bromate bro3 under 190 260 nm uv irradiation farkas and klein 1948 according to the above analysis i3 in this paper was mainly used to reflect the reaction degree of io3 and i in mixed io3 i system just as i3 was used to reflect the reaction degree of i and eaq in ki kio3 actinometer rahn 1997 fig 3 displays the effect of different initial i concentrations on the production of i3 during uv irradiation the evolution of i3 exhibited a peak point after 10 30 min at the initial i concentrations of 30 300 Œºm it can be drawn that the yield of i3 increased and its peak point shifted to later time with increasing initial i dose due to the accelerated i3 formation process by increasing i concentration the greater decomposition of io3 and subsequently formation of i3 implied that the mixed io3 i system might be based on the reductive pathway under uv irradiation after introducing i in the system it can also be inferred from fig 2 and fig 3 that more io3 was converted to ris in a mixed io3 i system than in a single io3 system it has been reported that ris plays a crucial role in i thm formation during the subsequent chlorination or chloramination process liu et al 2017 xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b therefore further i thm formation experiments were performed in the mixed io3 i system in the following section 3 4 3 2 proposed reaction mechanisms the direct photolysis of io3 has been reported to occur through absorbing the light emitted by low pressure hg uv lamps tian et al 2017 being transitioned to the excited state for further decomposition to some intermediates farkas and klein 1948 found that the photodecomposition products of bro3 under uv irradiation at the wavelength 190 260 nm were hypobromite bro bromide br and oxygen o2 in addition bromite bro2 was regarded as an intermediate photolysis product of bro3 under uv irradiation in other related studies jung et al 2014 siddiqui et al 1996 through literature review we found an iodine species iodite io2 was assumed to explain the sequential reactions of the two electron oxidant io3 and a two electron reductant bichsel and von gunten 2000b concialini and tubertini 1978 lambert and fina 1984 sharma and gupta 1971 considering the possible formation of other iodine intermediates speculated in the previous section 3 1 and the structural similarity between io3 and bro3 io2 might also be a photodegradation intermediate of io3 therefore in a the single io3 system io3 decomposition by direct photolysis might sequentially form io2 io and i eqs 1 3 which was consistent with other research results reporting that io3 photodegradation was not affected by ph but affected by uv intensity tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b in a mixed io3 i system in addition to the direct photolysis of io3 mentioned above photoreduction of io3 may also happen it has been reported that the reaction between eaq generated by uv irradiation of i and io3 can convert io3 into io at the first stage rahn 1997 however considering that the reaction between io3 and eaq may be similar to that between bromate and eaq which is a gradual reduction process io3 could first be converted to io2 and further transformed into io as presented in eqs 5 6 through eqs 7 9 io can be reduced to i2 and further to i3 in the presence of excess i eigen and kustin 1962 rahn 1997 rigg and weiss 1952 schwarz and bielski 1986 troy et al 1991 the overall reaction between i and io3 under uv irradiation can be expressed in eq 10 it is obvious that the degradation of io3 can be affected by uv intensity and ph in the overall reaction of the mixed io3 i system therefore the influence of uv intensity and ph on io3 photodegradation was further investigated in the following sections besides it is worth noting that the proposed mechanisms of the reactions in a mixed io3 i system indicated that the iodate iodide chemical actinometer at uv 254 nm is inaccurate because it only considers the ability of i to absorb

io3 photodegradation in a mixed io3 i system 3 3 1 effect of ph fig 4 a and fig s4 displays the effect of ph on io3 degradation in the mixed io3 i system with and without uv irradiation respectively it can be seen from fig s4 that io3 only slightly degraded under acid phs without uv irradiation which was consistent with the phenomenon in dushman reaction system dushman 1903 in fig 4 a it is obvious that io3 degradation efficiency increased from 17 8 to 70 4 as ph value decreased from 9 to 5 during uv irradiation it has been reported that direct photolysis of io3 and the electron photodetachment from i were not significantly influenced by ph sauer et al 2004 tian et al 2017 the strong ph dependence of io3 degradation in the presence of i could be explained by the strong effect of ph on the reactivity of eaq with io3 eq 10 io3 removal efficiency after 1 h uv irradiation at ph 5 was 4 1 times higher than that at ph 9 fig 4 a however there was almost no difference of the degradation rates between ph 6 and 5 which may due to that eaq could be quickly quenched by h with a rate constant of 2 3 1010 m 1s 1 rendering the competition of eaq between io3 and h eq 5 buxton et al 1988 fig 4 b displays the effect of initial ph values on i3 degradation in the presence of i during uv irradiation the yield of i3 at neutral and acidic ph value increased in the first 20 min and then gradually decreased while i3 yield kept increasing at ph 8 9 in addition i3 formation at ph 5 7 was faster than that at ph 8 9 in the first 20 min uv irradiation the possible reason for the different trends and formation rate of i3 between ph 5 7 and ph 8 9 could be that the overall reaction in a mixed io3 i system was faster under neutral and acidic ph values than under alkaline ph values resulting in faster consumption of i so that i3 can be generated quickly and reach peak point early under neutral and acidic ph values fig 4 b and eq 10 however the decrease of i3 accelerated with the decrease of ph from 7 to 5 during uv irradiation from 20 to 60 min the lower the ph the more eaq was quenched by io3 io2 and h resulting the faster consumption of i eqs 4 6 buxton et al 1988 therefore i3 was more converted into i2 and i with decreasing ph during later 20 to 60 min uv irradiation eq 9 troy et al 1991 3 3 2 effect of uv intensity the effect of uv intensity on io3 degradation in the mixed io3 i system was displayed in fig 4 c io3 degradation efficiency after 1 h uv irradiation were 34 8 45 2 and 65 0 at uv intensity of 132 194 and 870 Œºw cm2 respectively apparently high uv intensity has a positive effect on photodegradation rate of io3 this phenomenon could be explained by the enhancement of io3 direct photodissociation by photo and photoreduction by eaq which generate via increasing uv irradiation of i sun et al 2017b tian et al 2017 the enhancing degradation rate of io3 with increasing uv intensity confirmed the photosensitivity of the mixed io3 i system to uv irradiation and rationality of proposed reaction mechanism eqs 1 4 5 3 4 i thm formation in a mixed io3 i system during chloramination 3 4 1 effect of initial i concentration the effect of i concentration 0 25 Œºm on i thm formation in io3 containing ha synthetic water after uv irradiation followed by 3 days chloramination was studied and the results are illustrated in fig 5 a i thm formation in a single i or io3 system was also evaluated and presented in fig 5 a for comparing the effect of iodide iodate coexistence on i thm yields it is obvious that the initial concentration of i exerted a strong effect on i thm formation both in the single i and the mixed io3 i systems the mixed io3 i system and the sum of the single i and io3 systems gradually increased from 108 4 and 62 8 Œºg l at 2 5 Œºm i to 1076 1 and 940 0 Œºg l at 25 Œºm i respectively it is known that chloramine can oxidize i to ris which can easily react with nom and form i thms and et al 2004 and and gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000a therefore the increase of i concentration in the solution resulted in the increasing concentration of ris and inevitably led to the increase of i thms in both mixed io3 i and single i systems moreover it is worth noting that the i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system are higher than the sum of the i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems at each dosed i concentration after uv irradiation followed by chloramination the i thms difference between mixed io3 i system and the sum of single i and io3 systems was due to the difference of ris concentration which was depended on conversion rate of io3 according to the comparison of io3 uv degradation between the mixed io3 i and the single io3 systems mentioned above fig 1 fig 2 the reason might be that the mixed io3 i system irradiated by uv made more io3 converted into ris which could further react with ha and produced more i thms as shown in fig 5 a the i thms difference between mixed io3 i system and the sum of single i and io3 systems was increased with the increase of initial i concentration when the initial concentration of i was 25 Œºm the maximum difference of i thms between the mixed io3 i system and the sum of the single i and io3 systems reached 136 4 Œºg l this phenomenon implies that a higher i io3 molar ratio can lead to the higher risks of i thm formation i thm formation potential was higher in a mixed io3 i system than in a single iodine system in the post chloramine process after uv irradiation in order to verify the hazards of mixed io3 i system we conducted the similar i thm formation experiments under different i io3 molar ratio without uv irradiation and the results are presented in fig s5 as shown in fig s5 i thms were hardly generated in single io3 system and the formation of it in mixed io3 i system in each dosed i concentration condition was greater than that in single i system besides higher increase of i thms formation were obtained in mixed io3 i system than those in single i system when increase initial i concentration the reason may be that the stirring of the mixed io3 i solution that is the micromixing process made io3 and i undergo dushman reaction dushman 1903 k√∂lbl et al 2013 wenzel et al 2018 resulting in more ris formation than single i system it is obviously that the hazard of mixed io3 i system that produced more i thms was further amplified under uv irradiation fig 5 a uv irradiation made more i thms formed in mixed io3 i system under the same condition and made the i thms concentration difference between mixed io3 i system and the sum of single i and io3 systems more significant therefore special attention should be paid to the uv disinfection of raw water with coexistence of i and io3 3 4 2 effect of ph during uv irradiation the effect of ph during uv irradiation on the formation of i thms was studied with initial concentration of i and io3 as 5 and 10 Œºm respectively after uv irradiation followed by 3 days chloramination and the results are displayed in fig 5 b in order to eliminate the influence of ph in the post chloramination process all solutions were adjusted to ph 7 using naoh or h2so4 after uv irradiation as displayed in fig 5 b i thm formation in the mixed io3 i system and the sum of those in the single i and io3 systems gradually increased from 573 1 and 358 6 Œºg l at ph 5 to 645 1 and 479 4 Œºg l at ph 9 respectively however their difference decreased from 214 4 Œºg l at ph 5 to 165 7 Œºg l at ph 9 which consist with the impact of ph on io3 degradation in this study fig 4 a for the single i system the lower the ph the less i thm yield duirk et al 2011 hua and reckhow 2008 for the single io3 system ph almost has no effect on i thm yield tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b however the lower the ph the greater the conversion of io3 to ris discussed in section 3 3 1 which leaded to the relatively smaller decrease of i thm yield in the mixed io3 i system than in single i system as a result the i thm yield difference between the mixed io3 i system and the single i io3 systems decreased with increasing ph the increasing enhancement of i thm formation with increasing ph in mixed io3 i system and single i systems could be attributed to the following reasons firstly ha could be activated by uv and reacted with ris such as hoi i2 and i3 to form iodo derivatives and overall reactivity of ha could be enhanced by higher ph values avena et al 1999 saunders et al 2012 steinberg et al 2008 sun et al 2017a secondly i2 was the dominate species at acid phs and will be transformed to i3 in the presence of excess i which was a less reactive iodine species than hoi and i2 eqs 7 9 cripps et al 2003 liu et al 2017 thirdly the reaction rate between ris and nom decreased with the decreased of ph values lin et al 2008 warner et al 2000 3 4 3 effect of doc concentration the effect of dom concentration expressed as doc concentration on i thm formation in ha synthetic water after uv irradiation followed by 3 day chloramination was studied and the results are displayed in fig 5 c obviously statistically significant i thm yield decreases in single io3 system and single i system were detected as doc increase from 1 2 to 4 5 mg c l however the i thm yield in mixed io3 i system presented an increasing then decreasing trend as doc increased from 1 2 to 4 5 mg c l and reached a maximum of 830 6 Œºg l at doc of 2 5 mg c l the phenomenon may be because the increase in doc concentration can provide more organic precursors and reactive sites to promote the i thm formation however nh2cl will be consumed by exorbitant dom leading to a reduction of nh2cl for further oxidizing i to ris xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the i thm decrease of chi3 in high doc concentration which accounts for the main part of total i thm was due to the difficulty formation of triiodo dbps in the presence of excess dom liu et al 2017 also contributing to the total i thm reduction in addition i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system were higher than the sum of the i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems at doc of 2 5 4 5 mg c l which was consistent with the previous conclusion of this paper however it is worth noting that i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system were lower than the sum of i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems at doc of 1 2 mg c l this may because when doc concentration was 1 2 mg c l the precursors contained were not enough for the mixed io3 i system which could produce more ris however single io3 system and single i system had a total doc concentration of 2 4 mg c l 1 2 mg c l for each system which was higher than the mixed io3 i system even though they generated less ris 3 4 4 i thm formation from two raw waters the raw water from a dwtp rw1 and a surface water rw2 was collected and spiked 10 Œºm of io3 or 5 Œºm of i to evaluate i thm formation in mixed io3 i system under realistic water sources and uv dose treatment condition 40 mj cm2 criquet et al 2012 jones et al 2011 ha synthetic waters ha1 and ha2 prepared with the same doc concentration as rw1 and rw2 were also investigated under the same conditions to exclude the influence of doc concentration the results are illustrated in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 i thm formation in the mixed io3 i system and the sum of i thm in the single i and io3 systems were detected during monochloramination for 3 days as 52 1 and 50 1 Œºg l in surface water rw1 36 7 and 29 5 Œºg l in ha synthetic water ha1 28 8 and 34 7 Œºg l in dwtp raw water rw2 47 0 and 39 9 Œºg l in ha synthetic water ha2 i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system were higher than the sum of the i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems in rw1 ha1 and ha2 which was consistent with the previous conclusion of this paper however the opposite results were observed in rw2 these phenomena may be related to the characteristics of the four water sources the basic characteristics of these four water sources were summarized in table s2 and the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra of four water sources are illustrated in fig 7 to differentiate and characterize their structures it should be noted that the i thm formation in four water samples was not well correlated with suva table s2 indicating that suva value cannot be used as a suitable indicator for evaluating i thm formation wang et al 2014 xia et al 2018 eem spectra was operationally divided into five regions to differentiate various structures of dbp precursors tyrosine like the region i Œªex 250 nm Œªem 330 nm tryptophan like the region ii Œªex 250 nm 330 nm Œªem 380 nm fulvic acid like the region iii Œªex 250 nm Œªem 380 nm soluble microbial product like the region iv Œªex 250 nm Œªem 380 nm and humic acid like the region v Œªex 250 nm Œªem 380 nm regions chen et al 2003 in fig 7 rw1 ha1 and ha2 were similar and mainly have the region v humic acid like both rw1 and rw2 have a fluorophore in the region v and they differ in the region iv soluble microbial product like where rw2 has an eem center and rw1 exhibits an eem shoulder therefore the opposite results that i thms produced in the mixed io3 i system were lower than the sum of the i thms produced in the single i and io3 systems in rw2 might associated with its soluble microbial product like substances indicating that humic acid like substances was more active to form i thms in mixed io3 i system which had relatively high ris concentration wang et al 2014 4 conclusions this study proposed the reaction mechanism in a mixed io3 i system which consisted of direct photolysis of io3 and photoreduction of io3 by eaq generated by i that absorbed photos the results indicate that iodate iodide actinometer should consider photosensitivity of io3 the electron scavenger to uv irradiation in the coexistence of io3 and i uv disinfection converted more products into ris which could be further enhanced by decreasing ph value and increasing uv intensity and initial i io3 molar ratio i thms were identified in the subsequent chloramination process significantly increase of i thms was observed in the mixed io3 i system compared to those in a single io3 and i systems especially when using uv disinfection furthermore a high concentration of i and acid ph values could increase the difference of i thm formation between the two systems in addition doc concentration at 2 5 4 5 mg c l and dom with the principal components of humic acid like substances were the water background conditions for mixed io3 i system produced more i thms than single io3 and i systems overall this study clarified the reaction mechanisms in the iodate iodide containing water under uv irradiation and elucidated its potential risk and water dom conditions which could significantly enhancing i thm formation during subsequent chloramination therefore when io3 and i coexist in water with relatively high doc concentration and dom dominated by humic acid like substances uv irradiation should be applied carefully and uv and subsequent disinfection processes should be carried out at acid or nearly neutral ph values to control
