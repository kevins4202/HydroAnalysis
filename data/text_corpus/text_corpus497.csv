2485,of the many factors that affect heat flux water surface albedo can affect the heat flux and energy balance at the water atmosphere interface as a result lake water surface albedo can act on key climate change factors through its impact on lake atmosphere heat exchange most of the available global water cycle models however still use value specific water surface albedos and often produce estimation with relative errors of 5 15 due to time and location differences the lake albedo inversion model based on sentinel 2 msi sensor was obtained in this research from the perspective of energy transmission this research selects an inversion method of converting narrowband albedo to broadband albedo and using sentinel 2a spatial resolution image for the study area for 10 m lakes albedo product based on the measured albedo data using the determination coefficient r2 mean relative error mre and root mean square error rmse for validation the result of the inversion results show that the r2 is 0 62 mre is 0 25 rmse is 0 039 the values of lake albedo in the study area ranged from 0 to 0 45 with an average value of 0 14 the high value of lake albedo appears in the south of the songnen plain lake area with a size between 0 28 and 0 45 and the low value gathering area appears in the qiqihar lake group the central lake area of jilin also has a low value with a size between 0 and 0 10 from the west to the middle of jilin province the albedo value tends to decrease gradually and some areas have higher values in a typical lake the average albedo is arranged as follows yangsha lake shitoukoumen reservoir chagan lake moon lake erlong lake xinlicheng reservoir keywords lake water surface albedo lake albedo inversion model sentinel 2 image water atmosphere interface data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lake ecosystems are sensitive indicators of climate change and therefore there has been considerable research interest in understanding the drivers of their thermal regime cheng et al 2022 qin et al 2020 woolway et al 2020 compared to terrestrial landscapes lakes can store more solar radiation and provide a buffer to climate change lakes exert a substantial impact on regional climate through their intrinsic physical properties including evaporation heat storage capacity and thermal inertia of lakes water her et al 2019 minallah and steiner 2021 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 numerical simulations and observations have shown that the presence of a lake reduces the amplitude of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations in its surrounding region zan et al 2022 surface albedo a key factor in land atmosphere energy exchange and hydrological processes could play a pivotal role in regulating the impact of lakes on global and regional climate wang et al 2020 out of the many metrics of thermal conditions in a lake water surface albedo emerges as the essential factor controlling heat flux and energy balance at the water atmosphere interface and therefore warrants attention huang et al 2019 katsaros et al 1985 wang et al 2014 in most global hydrological models however a specific value is still used to express water surface albedo consequently resulting in estimates with relative errors of 5 15 due to failure to account for time and location differences dorman and sellers 1989 sellers et al 1996 water surface albedo is affected by several factors including solar altitude cloud cover wind speed and water quality the albedo of a surface is the ratio of the solar radiation reflected by the surface to the total incident solar radiation received in practice water surface albedo is calculated primarily based on radiation mainly downward and upward shortwave radiation measurements obtained from fixed platforms stroeve et al 2005 earlier studies examining the driving factors of water surface albedo have mostly focused on solar altitude and cloud cover cogley 1979 darzi and sima 2021 payne 1972 södergren et al 2018 water surface albedo is generally low at a high solar altitude and high at a low solar altitude in a given region annual variation in solar altitude follows a certain pattern high in summer resulting in a low albedo while the opposite is observed in winter cogley 1979 clouds affect water surface albedo by scattering and absorbing a portion of shortwave solar radiation södergren et al 2018 winds produce waves and as a result can alter the incident angle of shortwave solar radiation darzi and sima 2021 katsaros et al 1985 found that the ocean surface albedo decreases as wind speed increases on clear days and at solar altitudes below 30 at a solar altitude lower than 30 waves reduce the incident angle of solar radiation and therefore lower the surface albedo in contrast at a solar altitude higher than 30 waves increase the incident angle of solar radiation and consequently increase the albedo water quality a reflection of the physical and chemical conditions of a water body is another major factor that affects its surface albedo turbidity and chlorophyll chl a concentration are key parameters determining the optical conditions of a surface water body and therefore can increase its surface albedo caballero et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 warren et al 2021 although field measurements produce accurate values of lake water surface albedo field deployment of fixed observation platforms for monitoring of albedo over lake surfaces are hindered by construction and labor costs various weather related disturbances and the limited number of sampling points that can be covered from a fixed platform these factors collectively present a challenge to the wide adoption of this monitoring approach in large lakes xiao et al 2022 field measurements alone cannot provide continuous albedo data at the temporal and spatial scales necessary to meet the need of climate change research jian et al 2020 tian et al 2020 in comparison satellite observations can provide water surface albedo data with great accuracy high spatial resolution and adequate frequency several regional and global albedo products developed in recent decades are based on polar and geostationary satellite observations and most of these products only cover land surfaces chrysoulakis et al 2019 compared to land surfaces much less information is available regarding water surface albedo feng et al 2015 hogikyan et al 2020 a primary cause of this difference is that water surface albedo varies more significantly with time in comparison to land surface albedo making it a more difficult task to establish bidirectional reflectance distribution functions brdfs for water surfaces feng et al 2015 in addition water surfaces have a lower albedo than most types of land surface cover common remote sensing based water primarily ocean surface albedo products include 1 the clara clouds albedo and radiation surface albedo sal a surface albedo product that covers a 28 year period 1982 2009 and is derived from advanced very high resolution radiometer data avhrr riihelä et al 2013 2 the viirs visible infrared imaging radiometer suite land surface albedo product derived from the dark and bright pixel sub algorithms lucht et al 2000 3 the three component ocean water albedo product developed through decomposition of the ocean water albedo into three components whitecaps sun glints and water leaving reflectance and subsequently modelling of each component feng et al 2015 and 4 the global land surface satellite glass product version 2 liang et al 2013 ocean color sensors such as the coastal zone color scanner the sea viewing wide field of view sensor modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer viirs and the geostationary ocean color imager have the advantage of having short revisit periods high signal to noise ratios and high sensitivity to radiation singh and shanmugam 2016 wang and hu 2016 however their low spatial resolution several hundred meters to 1 km poses a challenge for an accurate representation of the spatial structure of monitored inland waters sentinel 2 is an earth observing satellite that can produce high resolution data and also has a high revisit frequency compared to other satellites that provide free remote sensing data in particular the 10 m visible vis and near infrared nir imagery as well as the 20 m red edge re and shortwave infrared imagery captured by the sentinel 2 sensor represent a major advance in the application of remote sensing data to inland waters research past applications of remote sensing technologies to examination of surface albedo have mostly focused on land surfaces in studies where water surface albedo was determined these studies were conducted in open ocean areas and mostly using satellite images of moderate spatial resolution therefore there is an urgent need to develop methodologies for the retrieval of accurate and fine resolution water surface albedo data from remote sensing imagery hence this study pursued two objectives 1 development and evaluation of methodology for effective retrieval of albedo data from sentinel 2 remote sensing imagery and 2 establishment of an albedo retrieval model applicable to inland waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lakes examined in this study are distributed within the jilin province 40 51 41 46 17 44 n 121 25 15 131 18 57 e which is in the geometric center of northeast asia bordering liaoning province inner mongolia and heilongjiang province fig 1 the changbai mountain is on the eastern edge of the jilin province it is characterized by high terrains dozens of snow rain fed rivers that flow through the songnen plain the region is characterized by a typical semi arid monsoon climate with mean annual temperature of 2 6 c and mean annual precipitation ranging between 350 and 700 mm lv et al 2000 in all 254 lakes were inventoried in the province in 2015 with an area of 1 990 km2 li et al 2020 of these there are 11 natural lakes and 93 artificial lakes in the central and eastern sections of the province these lakes tend to be small and shallow among the lakes on the songnen plain yueliangpao lake and chagan lake represent this physiographic region most exhibiting poor water quality and high salinity sui et al 2020 according to du et al 2020 a long term study from 1984 to 2018 showed that ctsm across the study area exhibited high in the west and low in the east meanwhile the secchi disk depth sdd of lakes in the study area was low in the west and high in the east as shown by tao et al 2022 therefore lakes with significant spatial heterogeneity were chosen for constructing the lwsa remote sensing inversion model du et al 2020 tao et al 2022 2 2 spectral reflectance and albedo measurements in situ remote sensing reflectance measurements were conducted using an asd fieldspec vnir spectrometer asd inc boulder co the details of in situ spectral measurements and instrumentation can be found in song et al 2012 we collected water leaving radiance at approximately 1 m above the water surface lsw radiance above a standard white spectralon labsphere inc north sutton nh at about 20 cm above reference panel lp and the collated skylight radiance lsky next the remote sensing reflectance rrs was calculated as 1 rrs ρ p l sw r l sky π l p where r is the reflectivity of skylight at the air water interface r 0 028 is acceptable for wind speed 5 ms 1 and ρp represents the reflectance of the white spectralon standard 99 using eq 1 the remote sensing reflectance rrs for each wavelength from 350 to 900 nm was derived song et al 2014 a total of 18 lakes across the jilin province were selected table 1 for a total 52 sampling sites 2 3 sites per lake at the time of water sampling gps coordinates of sampling sites were recorded for geolocalization and mapping the first sampling event was conducted from september 27 to september 30 2017 focusing on the songnen plain lakes mostly natural lakes in western jilin province a second sampling campaign was carried out from october 4 to october 7 2017 targeting water reservoirs mostly drinking water sources in the east central section of jilin province and heilongjiang province at all sites water samples were collected between 8 30 am and 16 00 pm local time and the distance between sampling points varied between 2 and 8 km depending on the size of the sampled lake howd 1998 the determination of water surface albedo was performed simultaneously with water samples collection albedo measurements were made using a cma6 sensor from kipp zonen which has a spectral range of 285 2800 nm a sensitivity of 5 20 µv w m2 a maximum radiation intensity of 2000 w m2 and a response time 95 of 18 s and is able to function at temperatures from 40 c to 80 c the upper sensor of the device measures incoming short wave solar radiation and the lower sensor measures the short wave radiation reflected by the water surface when making measurements the instrument was extended about 1 m out of the boat to minimize the impact of the boat shadow moreover the sensor probe needs to be vertically upward and downward which ensures that 90 of the signals collected by the sensor come from the water surface to reduce errors when measuring albedo data with kipp zonen s cma6 sensor the cma6 sensor manual requires an essentially cloud free sky and meteorological conditions that require no wind https www kippzonen com download 72 manual pyranometers cmp series english at each sampling point the instrument recorded data every 10 s to reduce measurement error the measurement deployment time at a given sampling point was about 10 min after elimination of outliers the remaining observations were used to determine the average albedo value at that sampling point albedo measurements on large lakes are easily affected by wind and waves therefore a stable environment was chosen as much as possible during the measurement the albedo meter was fixed to the boat s bow during the measurement however some abnormal measurement results are inevitable therefore abnormal results need to be eliminated the sampled data left can represent the actual situation of water surface albedo at the measurement moment which will also reduce the error of building the albedo model subsequently 2 3 remote sensing imagery data and their preprocessing 2 3 1 remote sensing imagery data sentinel 2a level 1c l1c data were used in this study satellite data were downloaded from the copernicus open access hub of the european space agency esa at each l1c product consists of an orthoimage of one scene covering an area 100 km2 in size the map coordinates of each image were corrected using a digital elevation model in addition each image product included land water and cloud masks layers high quality l1c images of seven scenes of the study area were obtained these images were captured at times close to the field sampling campaigns and on days with low cloud cover in september and october of 2017 table 2 2 3 2 preprocessing of remote sensing imagery data the downloaded sentinel 2a l1c data of the study area were processed using orthorectification and subpixel level fine geometric correction procedures teillet et al 2001 the radiometric calibration procedure for sentinel 2 data differs from that applied to other satellite data which typically involves a linear transformation as well as offset and gain in comparison the radiometric calibration of sentinel 2 data requires an inversion of radiance data the radiance of sentinel 2 l1c imagery is mathematically related to the atmospheric apparent reflectance through equation 1 and can therefore be calculated using equation 2 1 ρ λ π l λ d 2 esu n λ sin θ 2 l λ ρ λ e s u n λ sin θ π d 2 where lλ is the radiance radiant brightness w cm2 μm sr ρλ is the atmospheric apparent reflectance here referring to the original image file for each band unitless and d is the average distance between the earth and the sun unit astronomical unit fig 2 illustrates each sub task s specific functions in this research sen2cor the official atmospheric correction tool specifically designed by the esa for sentinel 2 satellite imagery was used in this study research has shown that sen2cor outperforms the simplified method for atmospheric corrections in terms of the atmospheric correction accuracy for sentinel 2 imagery main knorn et al 2015 additionally in previous studies sen2cor has been applied to water applications with reasonable results maciel et al 2019 martins et al 2017 pereira sandoval et al 2019 maciel et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the libradtran radiative transfer model is the core algorithm of sen2cor and can be expressed in the following equation 3 dl β d s l j where l is the radiance at location x y z β is the volume extinction coefficient and j is the source function with the following form 4 j ω 4 π p ω ω l d ω 1 ω b t where ω is the single scattering albedo p ω ω is the phase function from direction ω to direction ω and b t is the planck constant the pixel values of the water bodies in the atmospherically corrected version of sentinel 2a image in each band were extracted and compared with those extracted from its original version a comparison was made between spectral data of selected water bodies extracted from sentinel 2a image before and after atmospheric correction fig 3 the atmospheric correction resulted in a significant change in the pixel values in bands 1 2 and 8 of the sentinel 2a image in addition the spectrum extracted from the atmospherically corrected version of the image displayed marked features observed in reflectance spectra of typical lake waters including a low reflectance at 400 500 nm due to absorption and a reflectance peak near 705 nm this finding showed that the atmospheric correction procedure was effective and satisfied the study requirements in this study the envi 5 5 software was used to perform treatments e g resampling and registration of sentinel 2a data the nearest interpolation method was employed to resample the data the advantage of nearest interpolation is that the output image maintains the original spectral information and is simple and fast to process lyons et al 2018 the resampling procedure changed the resolution in bands 5 7 and 8a from 20 m to 10 m 2 4 lake water surface albedo retrieval modeling 2 4 1 basic principle of lake water surface albedo retrieval modeling from a quantitative remote sensing perspective the ratio of the radiation reflected by a certain surface along a specific band direction to the incident radiation on the surface is referred to as the albedo of the surface on the other hand the spectral albedo of a surface is the ratio of the radiant energy reflected by the surface to the total energy over the whole hemisphere that is the ratio of the total energy reflected by the surface to the total energy received by the surface as shown below 5 α λ f u λ f d λ where λ is the wavelength nm α λ is the spectral albedo and fu w m2 nm and fd w m2 nm are the reflected and incident spectral irradiances respectively lambertian reflectors in the strict sense are absent from natural underlying surfaces therefore the directional characteristic of light has an impact on albedo retrieval the bidirectional reflectance of vegetation and soils as well as its retrieval have been substantially studied by researchers around the world norman and welles 1983 yu et al 2022 some mature brdfs for non lambertian surfaces i e soils and vegetation canopies have been developed yu et al 2022 many researchers have also applied brdfs to the retrieval of land surface albedos for example roujean et al 2018 retrieved land surface albedo data from preprocessed fengyun 3c medium resolution spectral imager data using a brdf and subsequently confirmed a high accuracy in the retrieved data through cross validation against modis land surface albedo products as another example lucht et al 2000 established a more accurate brdf model than previous attempts to retrieve albedo data from gaofen 4 geostationary satellite imagery through the integration of surface classification information to assign initial values to the kernel factors as well as the introduction of powell s iterative algorithm for optimization purposes the large number of factors that affect the spectra of water bodies pose a challenge to brdf measurements or retrievals based on quantitative models however mobley et al 2003 drew an important conclusion that benthic brdfs have near lambertian characteristics in addition establishing a conventional brdf requires the assumption that the bidirectional reflectance of the land surface of interest remains constant within a short time period for example modis products are developed under the assumption that brdfs remain unchanged within 16 days this assumption however seldom holds in the real world in particular for water bodies their water quality differs considerably at spatial and temporal scales while their surface albedo varies fast as a result water surface albedo data retrieved using the aforementioned method contain large errors and have low accuracy in this study lake water surface albedo data were retrieved from sentinel 2 satellite imagery due to a lack of sufficient angle information and an accurate non lambertian brdf model for water bodies water surface was assumed to be lambertian reflectors moreover a narrowband to broadband albedo conversion method with a certain physical meaning was selected a large amount of measured spectral data for water bodies was introduced in to the narrowband albedo retrieval process this approach differs from the introduction of spectral data for multiple types of surface feature to the land surface albedo modeling process which leads to mutual interference and reduces the albedo retrieval accuracy for single surface features spectral data for single water bodies contain a great amount of optical information i e suspended matter and chl concentrations as well as chromophoric dissolved organic matter properties and therefore allow for the retrieval of lake water surface albedo with high accuracy conventionally because the oceans cover large areas ocean surface albedos are mostly retrieved directly that is through direct establishment of a regression relationship between the remote sensing reflectance and the ocean surface albedo however satellite data used in these albedo models have low spatial resolution as a result when these methods are applied to small inland lakes the small number of available pixels preclude accurate analysis furthermore the oceans differ considerably from inland lakes in terms of hydrodynamic and optical properties consequently these past albedo models have low robustness and not transferrable to inland waters in view of the foregoing this study sought to establish a water surface albedo model applicable to inland waters the model was derived from in situ lwsa measurement with many steps taken to eliminate as much as possible the effects of known sources of errors modeling and validation data at a ratio of 7 3 were used in the narrowband to broadband albedo conversion process 2 4 2 narrowband lake water surface albedo retrieval the narrowband albedo corresponds to a specific band of a sensor e g the thematic mapper band 2 albedo the modis band 3 albedo and the sentinel 2 band 4 albedo the albedo in a specific band can be obtained through integration of the spectral albedo over the wavelength range and is expressed as the ratio of the reflected radiant energy to the incident radiant energy over the wavelength range 6 α nb λ 1 λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 α λ f d λ d λ λ 1 λ 2 f d λ d λ where αnb is the narrowband albedo fd is the incident light energy i e the bottom of atmosphere downwelling radiant energy in the context of remote sensing w cm2 μm sr and λ1 nm and λ2 nm are the starting and ending wavelengths of the band respectively a quick inspection of equation 6 shows that only two parameters reflected and incident radiation densities in the band of interest are needed to estimate narrowband albedo from the sentinel 2a image 1 calculation of the reflected radiation density here water surfaces are assumed to be lambertian reflectors the reflected radiance of a water surface lg unit wm 2 nm 1 sr 1 is modified by the atmosphere through actions such as absorption and scattering before reaching the sensor onboard the satellite let l be the reflected radiance of the water surface received by the sensor which can be expressed as follows norman and welles 1983 7 l l p μ v l g μ v r μ v where lp μv is the atmospheric path radiance unitless μv is the cosine of the zenith angle of the satellite and r μv is the atmospheric transmittance between the water surface and the sensor unitless the parameter lg can be determined based on the spectrum of the water body measured synchronously in the field because spectral digital numbers are in fact obtained in field measurements they need to be converted to radiance values using the calibration file for the spectrometer in this study the asd viewspec pro software was used to process spectral data the calculated lg for the water bodies investigated are shown in fig 4 spectral resampling is required to ensure a match with the measured spectra this process resamples the measured spectrum of a surface feature to the bands of the remote sensor based on the corresponding spectral response function srf in this study the measured spectra were resampled using the spectral library resampling tool in the envi 5 5 software based on the srf of sentinel 2a sensors fig 5 based on the matching relationship between the measured spectra and the satellite images unknown parameters such as lp μv and r μv can be determined on this basis lg in each band can be obtained for a lambertian water surface its hemispherical reflected radiation density fu wm 2 nm 1 sr can be calculated using equation 8 8 f u l g π table 3 summarizes the equation for calculating the reflected radiation density in each band y is the reflected radiation density x is the radiometrically calibrated radiance 2 calculation of the incident radiation density assuming that a water surface is a lambertian reflector and that the atmosphere is isotropic the top of atmosphere spectral radiance l can be expressed using equation 9 liang et al 1999 9 l l p μ v ρ s 1 ρ s s μ s μ v e 0 r μ s r μ v where ρs is the land surface reflectance in the absence of the atmosphere unitless s is the downward bottom of atmosphere hemispherical reflectance unitless e0 is the top of atmosphere solar radiance wm 2 nm 1 sr μs is the cosine of the solar zenith angle and r μs is the atmospheric transmittance of downwelling radiation unitless for a lambertian water surface its incident radiant energy flux fd can be expressed as follows 10 f d f 0 ρ s 1 ρ s s π μ s e 0 r μ s combining equations 9 and 10 yield the following functional relationship between fd and l 11 f d f 0 l l p μ v π μ v r μ v the reflectance of the water body ρ unitless and lg wm 2 nm 1 sr can be determined from the synchronously measured spectral data for the water body in addition the fd of the surface feature can be calculated using equation 12 then based on the parameters obtained from equation 7 in conjunction with the matching relationship between the spectra and images of the water surface the incident radiation density of the water surface in each band can be calculated 12 f d l g π ρ table 4 summarizes the equation for calculating the incident radiation density in each band 2 4 3 broadband lake water surface albedo retrieval based on the definition of albedo broadband albedo refers to the percentage of the total solar radiant energy reflected by the surface of an object as the solar radiation that reaches the earth s surface is mostly distributed in the shortwave bands two shortwave ranges 0 25 5 and 0 3 3 μm are often used in the literatures abera et al 2020 liang 2001 due to the strong absorptivity of pure water in the nir bands the spectral features of water bodies are mostly concentrated at 400 900 nm therefore if unspecified the broadband albedo mentioned in most published studies often refers to the shortwave or vis and nir albedo liang et al 2002 when the downwelling atmospheric radiation is known only the integration of the spectral albedo is needed to yield an accurate broadband albedo however in practice most researchers tend to directly estimate the average broadband albedo based on the general atmospheric conditions when the narrowband albedo data are available dang et al 2015 feng et al 2015 liang 2001 liu et al 2017b qu et al 2015 song et al 2021 the multispectral instrument msi onboard sentinel 2 has eight bands in the vis nir spectral range there are three vis bands 2 4 three vegetation re bands 5 7 one broad nir band 8 and one narrow nir band 8a because band 8 is included in the spectral range of band 8a the albedo in band 8a does not need to be considered therefore the broadband albedo can be expressed using the following equation 13 α i α i f i i f i α vis f vis i f i α re f re i f i α nir f nir i f i where i f i is the downwelling radiant energy in band i wm 2 nm 1 sr fvis fre and fnir are the downwelling radiant energies in the vis vegetation re and nir bands respectively wm 2 nm 1 sr and α vis α re and α nir are the narrowband albedos in the vis vegetation re and nir bands respectively under specific atmospheric and surface conditions the ratio of the downwelling radiant energy to the total solar radiation in each band is fixed as a result the broadband albedo can be approximated as a linear function with respect to the albedos in bands 2 8 liang 2001 as shown below 14 α c 0 i 1 n c i a i where α is the broadband albedo unitless ai is the narrowband albedo in band i unitless n is the number of bands ci is the conversion coefficient for the corresponding band unitless and c0 is a constant term 3 results 3 1 conversion formulae in this study a multivariate linear regression analysis was performed on the measured albedo data and the narrowband albedo data using the spss 14 0 software to produce a narrowband to broadband lake water surface albedo conversion equation for sentinel 2a imagery as shown in equation 15 15 a msi 3 432 α 2 3 036 α 3 1 897 α 4 2 433 α 5 3 410 α 6 7 931 α 7 10 054 α 8 0 046 where amsi is the broadband lake water surface albedo and α 2 α 8 are the narrowband albedos in bands 2 8 derived from the sentinel 2a image fig 6 shows the 10 m lake water surface albedo data retrieved using equation 15 for the study area corresponding to 10 45 41 am cst on september 29 2017 image on the left hand side and 10 35 51 am cst on october 6 2017 image on the right hand side the lake water surface albedo in the study area ranged from 0 to 0 45 averaging 0 14 fig 6 specifically 12 21 20 28 11 5 3 and 1 of the lake surfaces have an albedo in the ranges of 0 0 05 0 05 0 10 0 10 0 15 0 15 0 22 0 22 0 28 0 28 0 33 0 33 0 39 and 0 33 0 39 respectively extremely high lake water surface albedos in the study area appear in the southern part of the songnen plain fig 6 left hand map in that area soils are predominantly saline alkaline lakes have high salinity and suspended matter concentrations and are generally small and shallow with high albedos low albedos are clustered in a group of lakes near qiqihar fig 6 upper part of map on the left hand side and also in the lake area in the central part of jilin fig 6 center image on the right hand side the spatial distribution pattern of lake surface albedo can be approximately summarized as follows lake water surface albedo is low in the northern part of the songnen plain than other parts but it gradually increases in the north to south direction going from the western to the central part of the jilin province the albedo gradually decreases with high values in some small areas 3 2 validation of the retrieved lake water surface albedo data in this study 43 field measured albedo data were used to establish a multivariate linear regression equation while 10 field measured albedo data was used to examine the accuracy of the established lake water surface albedo model in the validation and analysis processes the coefficient of determination r2 mean relative error mre and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the accuracy of the method used to estimate lake water surface albedo from sentinel 2a data the r2 mre and rmse between the measured and retrieved surface albedos of the lakes in the study area were 0 62 0 25 and 0 039 as shown as in fig 7 respectively li et al 2014 evidently the r2 between the measured and retrieved albedos was not inordinately high which can be primarily ascribed to the exclusion of the spatial scale effect of albedo in the validation process measuring points correspond to spatial scales of several to several tens of meters and therefore are often unrepresentative of the distribution of the albedo over a large area in addition spatial heterogeneity presents some problems to validation directly based on low resolution remote sensing ground point data products moreover a small number of validation points can also affect the r2 value however the low rmse suggests that the retrieved values deviate only to a small extent from the true values in summary a comprehensive analysis of the two evaluation metrics i e r2 and rmse reveals that the albedo retrieval model established in this study is effective at generating lake water surface albedo products with high accuracy through retrieval from remote sensing imagery which can meet the requirement of most investigations 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the difference in albedo among selected lakes in the study area to comprehensively analyze lake water surface albedo six typical lakes were selected because the ctsm in each lake showed a sizeable spatial heterogeneity which was convenient for comparative analysis of these three are natural lakes yangshapao yueliangpao and chagan lakes and three are artificial lakes erlong lake and the shitoukoumen and xinlicheng reservoirs fig 8 shows the albedo data for these six typical lakes located near the city of baicheng in western jilin province yangshapao lake is a shallow water body with an area of 31 67 km2 fig 8a due to the arid semiarid climate and low precipitation the volume of water in yangshapao lake is smaller than other lakes however as a result of large scale water conservancy projects e g the nen river baicheng region water transfer project implemented in recent years yangshapao lake has been transformed from a seasonal lake to a perennial lake in addition stronger winds in the surrounding region and concentration of total suspended matter tsm is relatively higher results of this study indicate that yangshapao lake has a generally high water surface albedo ranging from 0 16 to 0 45 mean 0 22 which indicates low water quality near the center of the lake estimated water surface albedo was extremely high but these results necessitate some caution as they involved a small number of pixels and may have been impacted by noise in the spectral signal and by a few cloud spots in the sentinel 2 image spatially water surface albedo of yangshaopao lake was uniform but from north to south surface albedo was found to increase and then decrease albeit inconspicuously fig 8a covering an area of 61 6 km2 the shitoukoumen reservoir is an important water source for the city of changchun capital of the jilin province and a driver of economic and social development intensive soil erosion within the surrounding catchment has resulted in a high content of suspended particulate matter in shitoukoumen reservoir in addition high level sedimentation has led to a year on year reduction in the reservoir s storage capacity and ultimately its service life following extensive measurements li et al 2009 drew a similar conclusion regarding water quality and sedimentation problems in shitoukoumen reservoir results fig 8b of the present study showed high surface albedo values range 0 06 0 23 mean 0 16 in shitoukoumen reservoir compared to drinking water reservoirs of similar class spatially low albedo values were recorded in the upstream source area which may be attributed to the good quality of waters delivered by the tributaries shuangyang yinma and chalu rivers and therefore may have diluted the concentration of optically active compounds spm algal particles in this portion of the reservoir when the sentinel 2 images were acquired low albedo values 0 13 occurred in the area close to the reservoir s dock outlet fig 8b situated in western jilin province chagan lake the province s largest freshwater lake is flat bottomed water body with an area of 296 41 km2 and an average depth of 2 52 m due to its large area the concentration of spm and chl in the lake undergoes marked seasonal variations in its spatial distribution wen et al 2022 estimates of water surface albedo in chagan lake ranged from 0 01 to 0 31 mean 0 15 the magnitude and spatial distribution of water surface albedo in that lake reflected the combined effect of several factors including precipitation wind regime fluvial hydrology and human activities the high albedo values range 0 17 0 25 recorded on the southeastern inlet of the lake can be attributed to among other factors i the low water volume in chagan lake in october of 2017 before acquisition of sentinel 2 images and ii discharge of untreated domestic sewage and sediment laden turbid water carried by the songhua river a chagan lake tributary as it passed through villages and erosion impacted cultivated areas upstream of chagan lake in contrast low albedo values range 0 04 0 14 were recorded near the southern inlet of chagan lake surface water albedo also varied in the east to west direction with high values 0 21 0 26 near the center and a gradual decrease from the center to either the eastern or the western shore range 0 02 0 06 located in an area characterized by strong winds in fall and winter bottom sediment resuspension is a common occurrence in this vast and shallow lake especially near the center of chagan lake where winds often blow with more intensity the combined effect of these natural and anthropogenic factors contributed to the observed spatial distribution in surface water albedo in chagan lake fig 8c also situated in the jilin province yueliangpao lake 126 75 km2 in area and 4 7 m in average depth is a reservoir built for freshwater pisciculture estimated surface albedo for yueliangpao lake ranged from 0 01 to 0 23 mean 0 14 fig 8d spatially surface water albedo was low 0 04 0 13 near the lake s western inlet likely a reflection of transparent water delivered by the taoer river to yueliangpao lake at the center of yueliangpao lake surface water albedo was high ranging from 0 14 to 0 23 the lowest albedo values 0 01 0 06 were recorded in a semi closed sub basin in the northern section of yueliangpao lake this long and narrow area is sheltered from strong winds and is largely unimpacted by bottom sediment resuspension thus resulting in low water surface albedo fig 8d located near the city of siping jilin and in the middle upper reaches of the eastern liao river catchment erlong lake is the water source for the residents of siping and is the largest provincially managed reservoir it encompasses an area of 101 72 km2 and has an average depth of 17 m erlong lake waters are mostly limpid and have a low albedo range 0 01 to 0 23 mean 0 08 small areas with high albedo were observed near at the upstream and downstream tips of erlong lake fig 8e with an area of 48 53 km2 and a normal water depth of 219 63 m the xinlicheng reservoir located at the center of the jilin province is another major water source for the city of changchun and is a completely closed level 1 water source conservation zone the implementation of various protection measures has to some extent improved the water quality in the xinlicheng reservoir in recent years very low values of surface water albedo were recorded throughout the xinlicheng reservoir range 0 01 to 0 08 mean 0 02 fig 8f these low albedo across the reservoir reflects the improved water quality in the xinlicheng reservoir overall there was no clear difference between natural and artificial lakes regarding water surface albedo fig 9 of the natural lakes yangshapao lake exhibited the highest average albedo followed by natural lakes chagan and yueliangpao of the artificial lakes the shitoukoumen reservoir had the highest average albedo located in a long narrow mountainous area the shitoukoumen reservoir is significantly affected by precipitation intense soil erosion within the surrounding catchment is a likely contributor to high ctsm and high albedo throughout shitoukoumen reservoir in contrast the waters of erlong lake and the xinlicheng reservoir are of high quality probably due to their geomorphology deeper than most lakes and reservouirs implementation of environmental protection measures within the surrounding catchment and adoption of stringent lake management practices 4 2 spatial relationship between the ctsm and water surface albedo due to the high spatial variability in water surface albedo lakes in this study area provide an interesting case study to further examine underlying factors of these variations in surface albedo and its relationship water quality parameters in northeast china we particularly focused on ctsm and chl a two water quality parameters that were also retrieved from sentinel 2 imagery for tsm the measured ctsm data and the sentinel 2 msi data from the lakes in the study area were employed to construct a remote sensing model of tsm concentration for the study area based on 33 measured albedo data and sentinel 2 msi multi band remote sensing data we constructed a remote sensing model of tsm concentration in the study area by adopting linear and nonlinear regression analysis with spss14 0 software fig 10 shows a good power exponential correlation between the fifth band reflectance of the sentinel 2a msi image and the measured ctsm data with an r2 of 0 73 the spatial distribution of ctsm in lakes of the study area was then derived from application of the model with sentinel 2 imagery in band 5 fig 11 the accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing predicted ctsm with measurements made in the lakes in the study area during the same period fig 12 an analysis of the results of the evaluation revealed a r2 of 0 90 and rmse of 40 mg l between the retrieved and measured values suggesting satisfactory performance of the ctsm model that was further evidenced by correlating water surface albedo and ctsm at 3500 random sites in the lakes of this study area fig 13 a strong positive relationship r2 0 85 between these two variables a certain degree of clustering was noted in the scatter plot and these points correspond primarily with the areas with low albedo values range 0 05 0 25 and low ctsm range 100 200 mg l while tsm in the range of 200 mg l albedo showed a slow growth fig 13 4 3 spatial relationship between cchl a and water surface albedo of chagan lake due to the complexity of the optical components of inland turbid water bodies atmospheric correction algorithm error bandwidth limitation the interaction between highly suspended inorganic particles and brdf and boundary conditions in optically shallow water areas by using high resolution satellite inversion of chlorophyll a concentration it is still challenging to obtain significant scale water body chlorophyll a inversion data of wen et al 2022 several empirical and semiempirical methods have extensively been used to retrieve cchl a from remote sensing data duan et al 2010 wen et al 2022 based on conventional mathematical statistics empirical methods directly establish a statistical relationship between remote sensing data and cchl a measurements based on a priori knowledge of the spectral features of chl a e g the adsorption peaks of phytoplankton in the infrared region or its fluorescence peaks in the near infrared region semiempirical methods have established functional relationships between remote sensing data and chl a using simple algebraic equations algorithms commonly used to retrieve cchl a from sentinel 2 imagery include the two band three band normalized difference chlindex and peak height algorithms buma and lee 2020 in this study the cchl a retrieval model developed by molkov et al 2019 for the gorky reservoir was used our analysis showed that using a power function and the three band algorithm of molkov et al 2019 the model can predict cchl a with high accuracy therefore the expression below eq 16 was used to retrieve cchl a for the chagan lake and examine its spatial distribution fig 14 16 chl a 4373 1 x 296 6 0 479 the accuracy of the model was evaluated through comparison of retrieved cchl a vs cchl a measured in chagan lake during the same period table 5 our analysis of the evaluation results revealed a relative difference of 18 between measured and retrieved values suggesting that the retrieval model performed reasonably well in the context of chagan lake relationship between albedo and cchl a at 740 random sites within chagan lake was examined results fig 15 revealed an unremarkable correlation between the two variables r2 0 47 suggesting a low level of consistency between them this finding is in accord with our previous statement section 3 that cchl a has a small impact on albedo 4 4 perspectives and significance considering the lack of a mature atmospheric correction procedure for inland waters in this study sentinel 2 images were atmospherically corrected using the sen2cor software although satisfactory results were obtained they inevitably contain some amount of error lindsay and rothrock 1994 found that the errors contained in the input parameters cause retrieval uncertainties during the atmospheric correction process for example a lack of data for the atmospheric moisture content can result in an error of 8 in the retrieved albedo while an absence of aerosol and ozone data can lead to uncertainties of 13 and 4 in the retrieved albedo respectively although accurate calculation of atmospheric composition using remote sensing methods is a formidably difficult task improvement of the accuracy of the atmospheric correction process should be a future research priority the temporal and spatial resolution of lake water surface albedo data needs to be improved the sentinel 2 imagery used in this study did not become available until 2015 while sentinel 2 imagery is advantageous in terms of its spatial resolution that allows for the depiction of a detailed spatial distribution of albedo its small coverage and low temporal resolution preclude it from supporting lake water surface albedo investigations over decadal time scales in addition the surface albedo of a water body can be affected by factors that vary considerably throughout the day therefore acquisition of satellite imagery at high temporal resolution is important to address this emerging research need geostationary satellites such as the fengyun 3c satellite high temporal resolution and the gaofen 4 satellite high temporal and spatial resolution are characterized by their ability to produce high temporal resolution imagery and also can be used to realize all weather multispectral and three dimensional observations of global atmospheric and geophysical elements wang et al 2018 you et al 2013 therefore future research would be warranted to demonstrate the application of these satellite data products to derive water surface albedo lake water surface temperature is a strong indicator of climate change water surface albedo has measurable impact on heat flux due to its effects on the radiation and energy balance at the water atmosphere interface in future research the lake water surface albedo retrieval model developed in this study can be employed to improve the available remote sensing lake temperature and heat flux models with the goal of facilitating the investigation of the response of lakes to climate change 4 5 limitation field sampling data need to be increased and the quality and representativeness of the measured data need to be improved in this study the number of sampling points and the representativeness is not enough to establish a strong and stable remote sensing inversion model moreover the sampling points are mainly concentrated in western jilin province in contrast most lakes in western jilin province have poor water quality and there are fewer sample points for lakes with better water quality the lack of lake data will affect the lake albedo modeling process and thus the albedo of lakes with better water quality is underestimated therefore in the next step of the research the lake data needs to be supplemented and the inversion model needs further improvement 5 conclusion currently studies examining the retrieval of broadband inland lake water surface albedos from remote sensing imagery are lacking in view of this absence a lake water surface albedo model for sentinel 2 satellite data is for the first time developed in this study based on theoretical knowledge and field measurements this model is subsequently used to retrieve lake water surface albedos specifically the sentinel 2 data are subjected to preprocessing treatments e g radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction to generate radiance and reflectance data suitable for the retrieval process an introduction is given to these treatments based on the measured spectral data for the water bodies in conjunction with the srf for the sentinel 2 msi the incident and reflected radiation densities are calculated on this basis the narrowband albedos are determined afterwards a multivariate regression analysis is performed to examine the linear relationship between the narrowband and broadband lake water surface albedos following on from this analysis a narrowband to broadband lake water surface albedo conversion equation for the sentinel 2 msi is established and subsequently used to obtain albedo data spatial resolution 10 m for the lakes in the study area validation analysis of the albedo data retrieved using the model against the measured albedo data reveals an r2 of 0 62 an mre of 0 25 and an rmse of 0 039 this finding suggests that the lake water surface albedo retrieval algorithm developed in this study is effective at generating lake water surface albedo products with high accuracy and spatial resolution which can satisfy the accuracy required by the analysis of the temporal and spatial patterns of albedo at regional scales as well as can serve as basic datasets

2485,of the many factors that affect heat flux water surface albedo can affect the heat flux and energy balance at the water atmosphere interface as a result lake water surface albedo can act on key climate change factors through its impact on lake atmosphere heat exchange most of the available global water cycle models however still use value specific water surface albedos and often produce estimation with relative errors of 5 15 due to time and location differences the lake albedo inversion model based on sentinel 2 msi sensor was obtained in this research from the perspective of energy transmission this research selects an inversion method of converting narrowband albedo to broadband albedo and using sentinel 2a spatial resolution image for the study area for 10 m lakes albedo product based on the measured albedo data using the determination coefficient r2 mean relative error mre and root mean square error rmse for validation the result of the inversion results show that the r2 is 0 62 mre is 0 25 rmse is 0 039 the values of lake albedo in the study area ranged from 0 to 0 45 with an average value of 0 14 the high value of lake albedo appears in the south of the songnen plain lake area with a size between 0 28 and 0 45 and the low value gathering area appears in the qiqihar lake group the central lake area of jilin also has a low value with a size between 0 and 0 10 from the west to the middle of jilin province the albedo value tends to decrease gradually and some areas have higher values in a typical lake the average albedo is arranged as follows

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lake ecosystems are sensitive indicators of climate change and therefore there has been considerable research interest in understanding the drivers of their thermal regime cheng et al 2022 qin et al 2020 woolway et al 2020 compared to terrestrial landscapes lakes can store more solar radiation and provide a buffer to climate change lakes exert a substantial impact on regional climate through their intrinsic physical properties including evaporation heat storage capacity and thermal inertia of lakes water her et al 2019 minallah and steiner 2021 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 numerical simulations and observations have shown that the presence of a lake reduces the amplitude of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations in its surrounding region zan et al 2022 surface albedo a key factor in land atmosphere energy exchange and hydrological processes could play a pivotal role in regulating the impact of lakes on global and regional climate wang et al 2020 out of the many metrics of thermal conditions in a lake water surface albedo emerges as the essential factor controlling heat flux and energy balance at the water atmosphere interface and therefore warrants attention huang et al 2019 katsaros et al 1985 wang et al 2014 in most global hydrological models however a specific value is still used to express water surface albedo consequently resulting in estimates with relative errors of 5 15 due to failure to account for time and location differences dorman and sellers 1989 sellers et al 1996 water surface albedo is affected by several factors including solar altitude cloud cover wind speed and water quality the albedo of a surface is the ratio of the solar radiation reflected by the surface to the total incident solar radiation received in practice water surface albedo is calculated primarily based on radiation mainly downward and upward shortwave radiation measurements obtained from fixed platforms stroeve et al 2005 earlier studies examining the driving factors of water surface albedo have mostly focused on solar altitude and cloud cover cogley 1979 darzi and sima 2021 payne 1972 södergren et al 2018 water surface albedo is generally low at a high solar altitude and high at a low solar altitude in a given region annual variation in solar altitude follows a certain pattern high in summer resulting in a low albedo while the opposite is observed in winter cogley 1979 clouds affect water surface albedo by scattering and absorbing a portion of shortwave solar radiation södergren et al 2018 winds produce waves and as a result can alter the incident angle of shortwave solar radiation darzi and sima 2021 katsaros et al 1985 found that the ocean surface albedo decreases as wind speed increases on clear days and at solar altitudes below 30 at a solar altitude lower than 30 waves reduce the incident angle of solar radiation and therefore lower the surface albedo in contrast at a solar altitude higher than 30 waves increase the incident angle of solar radiation and consequently increase the albedo water quality a reflection of the physical and chemical conditions of a water body is another major factor that affects its surface albedo turbidity and chlorophyll chl a concentration are key parameters determining the optical conditions of a surface water body and therefore can increase its surface albedo caballero et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 warren et al 2021 although field measurements produce accurate values of lake water surface albedo field deployment of fixed observation platforms for monitoring of albedo over lake surfaces are hindered by construction and labor costs various weather related disturbances and the limited number of sampling points that can be covered from a fixed platform these factors collectively present a challenge to the wide adoption of this monitoring approach in large lakes xiao et al 2022 field measurements alone cannot provide continuous albedo data at the temporal and spatial scales necessary to meet the need of climate change research jian et al 2020 tian et al 2020 in comparison satellite observations can provide water surface albedo data with great accuracy high spatial resolution and adequate frequency several regional and global albedo products developed in recent decades are based on polar and geostationary satellite observations and most of these products only cover land surfaces chrysoulakis et al 2019 compared to land surfaces much less information is available regarding water surface albedo feng et al 2015 hogikyan et al 2020 a primary cause of this difference is that water surface albedo varies more significantly with time in comparison to land surface albedo making it a more difficult task to establish bidirectional reflectance distribution functions brdfs for water surfaces feng et al 2015 in addition water surfaces have a lower albedo than most types of land surface cover common remote sensing based water primarily ocean surface albedo products include 1 the clara clouds albedo and radiation surface albedo sal a surface albedo product that covers a 28 year period 1982 2009 and is derived from advanced very high resolution radiometer data avhrr riihelä et al 2013 2 the viirs visible infrared imaging radiometer suite land surface albedo product derived from the dark and bright pixel sub algorithms lucht et al 2000 3 the three component ocean water albedo product developed through decomposition of the ocean water albedo into three components whitecaps sun glints and water leaving reflectance and subsequently modelling of each component feng et al 2015 and 4 the global land surface satellite glass product version 2 liang et al 2013 ocean color sensors such as the coastal zone color scanner the sea viewing wide field of view sensor modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer viirs and the geostationary ocean color imager have the advantage of having short revisit periods high signal to noise ratios and high sensitivity to radiation singh and shanmugam 2016 wang and hu 2016 however their low spatial resolution several hundred meters to 1 km poses a challenge for an accurate representation of the spatial structure of monitored inland waters sentinel 2 is an earth observing satellite that can produce high resolution data and also has a high revisit frequency compared to other satellites that provide free remote sensing data in particular the 10 m visible vis and near infrared nir imagery as well as the 20 m red edge re and shortwave infrared imagery captured by the sentinel 2 sensor represent a major advance in the application of remote sensing data to inland waters research past applications of remote sensing technologies to examination of surface albedo have mostly focused on land surfaces in studies where water surface albedo was determined these studies were conducted in open ocean areas and mostly using satellite images of moderate spatial resolution therefore there is an urgent need to develop methodologies for the retrieval of accurate and fine resolution water surface albedo data from remote sensing imagery hence this study pursued two objectives 1 development and evaluation of methodology for effective retrieval of albedo data from sentinel 2 remote sensing imagery and 2 establishment of an albedo retrieval model applicable to inland waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lakes examined in this study are distributed within the jilin province 40 51 41 46 17 44 n 121 25 15 131 18 57 e which is in the geometric center of northeast asia bordering liaoning province inner mongolia and heilongjiang province fig 1 the changbai mountain is on the eastern edge of the jilin province it is characterized by high terrains dozens of snow rain fed rivers that flow through the songnen plain the region is characterized by a typical semi arid monsoon climate with mean annual temperature of 2 6 c and mean annual precipitation ranging between 350 and 700 mm lv et al 2000 in all 254 lakes were inventoried in the province in 2015 with an area of 1 990 km2 li et al 2020 of these there are 11 natural lakes and 93 artificial lakes in the central and eastern sections of the province these lakes tend to be small and shallow among the lakes on the songnen plain yueliangpao lake and chagan lake represent this physiographic region most exhibiting poor water quality and high salinity sui et al 2020 according to du et al 2020 a long term study from 1984 to 2018 showed that ctsm across the study area exhibited high in the west and low in the east meanwhile the secchi disk depth sdd of lakes in the study area was low in the west and high in the east as shown by tao et al 2022 therefore lakes with significant spatial heterogeneity were chosen for constructing the lwsa remote sensing inversion model du et al 2020 tao et al 2022 2 2 spectral reflectance and albedo measurements in situ remote sensing reflectance measurements were conducted using an asd fieldspec vnir spectrometer asd inc boulder co the details of in situ spectral measurements and instrumentation can be found in song et al 2012 we collected water leaving radiance at approximately 1 m above the water surface lsw radiance above a standard white spectralon labsphere inc north sutton nh at about 20 cm above reference panel lp and the collated skylight radiance lsky next the remote sensing reflectance rrs was calculated as 1 rrs ρ p l sw r l sky π l p where r is the reflectivity of skylight at the air water interface r 0 028 is acceptable for wind speed 5 ms 1 and ρp represents the reflectance of the white spectralon standard 99 using eq 1 the remote sensing reflectance rrs for each wavelength from 350 to 900 nm was derived song et al 2014 a total of 18 lakes across the jilin province were selected table 1 for a total 52 sampling sites 2 3 sites per lake at the time of water sampling gps coordinates of sampling sites were recorded for geolocalization and mapping the first sampling event was conducted from september 27 to september 30 2017 focusing on the songnen plain lakes mostly natural lakes in western jilin province a second sampling campaign was carried out from october 4 to october 7 2017 targeting water reservoirs mostly drinking water sources in the east central section of jilin province and heilongjiang province at all sites water samples were collected between 8 30 am and 16 00 pm local time and the distance between sampling points varied between 2 and 8 km depending on the size of the sampled lake howd 1998 the determination of water surface albedo was performed simultaneously with water samples collection albedo measurements were made using a cma6 sensor from kipp zonen which has a spectral range of 285 2800 nm a sensitivity of 5 20 µv w m2 a maximum radiation intensity of 2000 w m2 and a response time 95 of 18 s and is able to function at temperatures from 40 c to 80 c the upper sensor of the device measures incoming short wave solar radiation and the lower sensor measures the short wave radiation reflected by the water surface when making measurements the instrument was extended about 1 m out of the boat to minimize the impact of the boat shadow moreover the sensor probe needs to be vertically upward and downward which ensures that 90 of the signals collected by the sensor come from the water surface to reduce errors when measuring albedo data with kipp zonen s cma6 sensor the cma6 sensor manual requires an essentially cloud free sky and meteorological conditions that require no wind https www kippzonen com download 72 manual pyranometers cmp series english at each sampling point the instrument recorded data every 10 s to reduce measurement error the measurement deployment time at a given sampling point was about 10 min after elimination of outliers the remaining observations were used to determine the average albedo value at that sampling point albedo measurements on large lakes are easily affected by wind and waves therefore a stable environment was chosen as much as possible during the measurement the albedo meter was fixed to the boat s bow during the measurement however some abnormal measurement results are inevitable therefore abnormal results need to be eliminated the sampled data left can represent the actual situation of water surface albedo at the measurement moment which will also reduce the error of building the albedo model subsequently 2 3 remote sensing imagery data and their preprocessing 2 3 1 remote sensing imagery data sentinel 2a level 1c l1c data were used in this study satellite data were downloaded from the copernicus open access hub of the european space agency esa at each l1c product consists of an orthoimage of one scene covering an area 100 km2 in size the map coordinates of each image were corrected using a digital elevation model in addition each image product included land water and cloud masks layers high quality l1c images of seven scenes of the study area were obtained these images were captured at times close to the field sampling campaigns and on days with low cloud cover in september and october of 2017 table 2 2 3 2 preprocessing of remote sensing imagery data the downloaded sentinel 2a l1c data of the study area were processed using orthorectification and subpixel level fine geometric correction procedures teillet et al 2001 the radiometric calibration procedure for sentinel 2 data differs from that applied to other satellite data which typically involves a linear transformation as well as offset and gain in comparison the radiometric calibration of sentinel 2 data requires an inversion of radiance data the radiance of sentinel 2 l1c imagery is mathematically related to the atmospheric apparent reflectance through equation 1 and can therefore be calculated using equation 2 1 ρ λ π l λ d 2 esu n λ sin θ 2 l λ ρ λ e s u n λ sin θ π d 2 where lλ is the radiance radiant brightness w cm2 μm sr ρλ is the atmospheric apparent reflectance here referring to the original image file for each band unitless and d is the average distance between the earth and the sun unit astronomical unit fig 2 illustrates each sub task s specific functions in this research sen2cor the official atmospheric correction tool specifically designed by the esa for sentinel 2 satellite imagery was used in this study research has shown that sen2cor outperforms the simplified method for atmospheric corrections in terms of the atmospheric correction accuracy for sentinel 2 imagery main knorn et al 2015 additionally in previous studies sen2cor has been applied to water applications with reasonable results maciel et al 2019 martins et al 2017 pereira sandoval et al 2019 maciel et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the libradtran radiative transfer model is the core algorithm of sen2cor and can be expressed in the following equation 3 dl β d s l j where l is the radiance at location x y z β is the volume extinction coefficient and j is the source function with the following form 4 j ω 4 π p ω ω l d ω 1 ω b t where ω is the single scattering albedo p ω ω is the phase function from direction ω to direction ω and b t is the planck constant the pixel values of the water bodies in the atmospherically corrected version of sentinel 2a image in each band were extracted and compared with those extracted from its original version a comparison was made between spectral data of selected water bodies extracted from sentinel 2a image before and after atmospheric correction fig 3 the atmospheric correction resulted in a significant change in the pixel values in bands 1 2 and 8 of the sentinel 2a image in addition the spectrum extracted from the atmospherically corrected version of the image displayed marked features observed in reflectance spectra of typical lake waters including a low reflectance at 400 500 nm due to absorption and a reflectance peak near 705 nm this finding showed that the atmospheric correction procedure was effective and satisfied the study requirements in this study the envi 5 5 software was used to perform treatments e g resampling and registration of sentinel 2a data the nearest interpolation method was employed to resample the data the advantage of nearest interpolation is that the output image maintains the original spectral information and is simple and fast to process lyons et al 2018 the resampling procedure changed the resolution in bands 5 7 and 8a from 20 m to 10 m 2 4 lake water surface albedo retrieval modeling 2 4 1 basic principle of lake water surface albedo retrieval modeling from a quantitative remote sensing perspective the ratio of the radiation reflected by a certain surface along a specific band direction to the incident radiation on the surface is referred to as the albedo of the surface on the other hand the spectral albedo of a surface is the ratio of the radiant energy reflected by the surface to the total energy over the whole hemisphere that is the ratio of the total energy reflected by the surface to the total energy received by the surface as shown below 5 α λ f u λ f d λ where λ is the wavelength nm α λ is the spectral albedo and fu w m2 nm and fd w m2 nm are the reflected and incident spectral irradiances respectively lambertian reflectors in the strict sense are absent from natural underlying surfaces therefore the directional characteristic of light has an impact on albedo retrieval the bidirectional reflectance of vegetation and soils as well as its retrieval have been substantially studied by researchers around the world norman and welles 1983 yu et al 2022 some mature brdfs for non lambertian surfaces i e soils and vegetation canopies have been developed yu et al 2022 many researchers have also applied brdfs to the retrieval of land surface albedos for example roujean et al 2018 retrieved land surface albedo data from preprocessed fengyun 3c medium resolution spectral imager data using a brdf and subsequently confirmed a high accuracy in the retrieved data through cross validation against modis land surface albedo products as another example lucht et al 2000 established a more accurate brdf model than previous attempts to retrieve albedo data from gaofen 4 geostationary satellite imagery through the integration of surface classification information to assign initial values to the kernel factors as well as the introduction of powell s iterative algorithm for optimization purposes the large number of factors that affect the spectra of water bodies pose a challenge to brdf measurements or retrievals based on quantitative models however mobley et al 2003 drew an important conclusion that benthic brdfs have near lambertian characteristics in addition establishing a conventional brdf requires the assumption that the bidirectional reflectance of the land surface of interest remains constant within a short time period for example modis products are developed under the assumption that brdfs remain unchanged within 16 days this assumption however seldom holds in the real world in particular for water bodies their water quality differs considerably at spatial and temporal scales while their surface albedo varies fast as a result water surface albedo data retrieved using the aforementioned method contain large errors and have low accuracy in this study lake water surface albedo data were retrieved from sentinel 2 satellite imagery due to a lack of sufficient angle information and an accurate non lambertian brdf model for water bodies water surface was assumed to be lambertian reflectors moreover a narrowband to broadband albedo conversion method with a certain physical meaning was selected a large amount of measured spectral data for water bodies was introduced in to the narrowband albedo retrieval process this approach differs from the introduction of spectral data for multiple types of surface feature to the land surface albedo modeling process which leads to mutual interference and reduces the albedo retrieval accuracy for single surface features spectral data for single water bodies contain a great amount of optical information i e suspended matter and chl concentrations as well as chromophoric dissolved organic matter properties and therefore allow for the retrieval of lake water surface albedo with high accuracy conventionally because the oceans cover large areas ocean surface albedos are mostly retrieved directly that is through direct establishment of a regression relationship between the remote sensing reflectance and the ocean surface albedo however satellite data used in these albedo models have low spatial resolution as a result when these methods are applied to small inland lakes the small number of available pixels preclude accurate analysis furthermore the oceans differ considerably from inland lakes in terms of hydrodynamic and optical properties consequently these past albedo models have low robustness and not transferrable to inland waters in view of the foregoing this study sought to establish a water surface albedo model applicable to inland waters the model was derived from in situ lwsa measurement with many steps taken to eliminate as much as possible the effects of known sources of errors modeling and validation data at a ratio of 7 3 were used in the narrowband to broadband albedo conversion process 2 4 2 narrowband lake water surface albedo retrieval the narrowband albedo corresponds to a specific band of a sensor e g the thematic mapper band 2 albedo the modis band 3 albedo and the sentinel 2 band 4 albedo the albedo in a specific band can be obtained through integration of the spectral albedo over the wavelength range and is expressed as the ratio of the reflected radiant energy to the incident radiant energy over the wavelength range 6 α nb λ 1 λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 α λ f d λ d λ λ 1 λ 2 f d λ d λ where αnb is the narrowband albedo fd is the incident light energy i e the bottom of atmosphere downwelling radiant energy in the context of remote sensing w cm2 μm sr and λ1 nm and λ2 nm are the starting and ending wavelengths of the band respectively a quick inspection of equation 6 shows that only two parameters reflected and incident radiation densities in the band of interest are needed to estimate narrowband albedo from the sentinel 2a image 1 calculation of the reflected radiation density here water surfaces are assumed to be lambertian reflectors the reflected radiance of a water surface lg unit wm 2 nm 1 sr 1 is modified by the atmosphere through actions such as absorption and scattering before reaching the sensor onboard the satellite let l be the reflected radiance of the water surface received by the sensor which can be expressed as follows norman and welles 1983 7 l l p μ v l g μ v r μ v where lp μv is the atmospheric path radiance unitless μv is the cosine of the zenith angle of the satellite and r μv is the atmospheric transmittance between the water surface and the sensor unitless the parameter lg can be determined based on the spectrum of the water body measured synchronously in the field because spectral digital numbers are in fact obtained in field measurements they need to be converted to radiance values using the calibration file for the spectrometer in this study the asd viewspec pro software was used to process spectral data the calculated lg for the water bodies investigated are shown in fig 4 spectral resampling is required to ensure a match with the measured spectra this process resamples the measured spectrum of a surface feature to the bands of the remote sensor based on the corresponding spectral response function srf in this study the measured spectra were resampled using the spectral library resampling tool in the envi 5 5 software based on the srf of sentinel 2a sensors fig 5 based on the matching relationship between the measured spectra and the satellite images unknown parameters such as lp μv and r μv can be determined on this basis lg in each band can be obtained for a lambertian water surface its hemispherical reflected radiation density fu wm 2 nm 1 sr can be calculated using equation 8 8 f u l g π table 3 summarizes the equation for calculating the reflected radiation density in each band y is the reflected radiation density x is the radiometrically calibrated radiance 2 calculation of the incident radiation density assuming that a water surface is a lambertian reflector and that the atmosphere is isotropic the top of atmosphere spectral radiance l can be expressed using equation 9 liang et al 1999 9 l l p μ v ρ s 1 ρ s s μ s μ v e 0 r μ s r μ v where ρs is the land surface reflectance in the absence of the atmosphere unitless s is the downward bottom of atmosphere hemispherical reflectance unitless e0 is the top of atmosphere solar radiance wm 2 nm 1 sr μs is the cosine of the solar zenith angle and r μs is the atmospheric transmittance of downwelling radiation unitless for a lambertian water surface its incident radiant energy flux fd can be expressed as follows 10 f d f 0 ρ s 1 ρ s s π μ s e 0 r μ s combining equations 9 and 10 yield the following functional relationship between fd and l 11 f d f 0 l l p μ v π μ v r μ v the reflectance of the water body ρ unitless and lg wm 2 nm 1 sr can be determined from the synchronously measured spectral data for the water body in addition the fd of the surface feature can be calculated using equation 12 then based on the parameters obtained from equation 7 in conjunction with the matching relationship between the spectra and images of the water surface the incident radiation density of the water surface in each band can be calculated 12 f d l g π ρ table 4 summarizes the equation for calculating the incident radiation density in each band 2 4 3 broadband lake water surface albedo retrieval based on the definition of albedo broadband albedo refers to the percentage of the total solar radiant energy reflected by the surface of an object as the solar radiation that reaches the earth s surface is mostly distributed in the shortwave bands two shortwave ranges 0 25 5 and 0 3 3 μm are often used in the literatures abera et al 2020 liang 2001 due to the strong absorptivity of pure water in the nir bands the spectral features of water bodies are mostly concentrated at 400 900 nm therefore if unspecified the broadband albedo mentioned in most published studies often refers to the shortwave or vis and nir albedo liang et al 2002 when the downwelling atmospheric radiation is known only the integration of the spectral albedo is needed to yield an accurate broadband albedo however in practice most researchers tend to directly estimate the average broadband albedo based on the general atmospheric conditions when the narrowband albedo data are available dang et al 2015 feng et al 2015 liang 2001 liu et al 2017b qu et al 2015 song et al 2021 the multispectral instrument msi onboard sentinel 2 has eight bands in the vis nir spectral range there are three vis bands 2 4 three vegetation re bands 5 7 one broad nir band 8 and one narrow nir band 8a because band 8 is included in the spectral range of band 8a the albedo in band 8a does not need to be considered therefore the broadband albedo can be expressed using the following equation 13 α i α i f i i f i α vis f vis i f i α re f re i f i α nir f nir i f i where i f i is the downwelling radiant energy in band i wm 2 nm 1 sr fvis fre and fnir are the downwelling radiant energies in the vis vegetation re and nir bands respectively wm 2 nm 1 sr and α vis α re and α nir are the narrowband albedos in the vis vegetation re and nir bands respectively under specific atmospheric and surface conditions the ratio of the downwelling radiant energy to the total solar radiation in each band is fixed as a result the broadband albedo can be approximated as a linear function with respect to the albedos in bands 2 8 liang 2001 as shown below 14 α c 0 i 1 n c i a i where α is the broadband albedo unitless ai is the narrowband albedo in band i unitless n is the number of bands ci is the conversion coefficient for the corresponding band unitless and c0 is a constant term 3 results 3 1 conversion formulae in this study a multivariate linear regression analysis was performed on the measured albedo data and the narrowband albedo data using the spss 14 0 software to produce a narrowband to broadband lake water surface albedo conversion equation for sentinel 2a imagery as shown in equation 15 15 a msi 3 432 α 2 3 036 α 3 1 897 α 4 2 433 α 5 3 410 α 6 7 931 α 7 10 054 α 8 0 046 where amsi is the broadband lake water surface albedo and α 2 α 8 are the narrowband albedos in bands 2 8 derived from the sentinel 2a image fig 6 shows the 10 m lake water surface albedo data retrieved using equation 15 for the study area corresponding to 10 45 41 am cst on september 29 2017 image on the left hand side and 10 35 51 am cst on october 6 2017 image on the right hand side the lake water surface albedo in the study area ranged from 0 to 0 45 averaging 0 14 fig 6 specifically 12 21 20 28 11 5 3 and 1 of the lake surfaces have an albedo in the ranges of 0 0 05 0 05 0 10 0 10 0 15 0 15 0 22 0 22 0 28 0 28 0 33 0 33 0 39 and 0 33 0 39 respectively extremely high lake water surface albedos in the study area appear in the southern part of the songnen plain fig 6 left hand map in that area soils are predominantly saline alkaline lakes have high salinity and suspended matter concentrations and are generally small and shallow with high albedos low albedos are clustered in a group of lakes near qiqihar fig 6 upper part of map on the left hand side and also in the lake area in the central part of jilin fig 6 center image on the right hand side the spatial distribution pattern of lake surface albedo can be approximately summarized as follows lake water surface albedo is low in the northern part of the songnen plain than other parts but it gradually increases in the north to south direction going from the western to the central part of the jilin province the albedo gradually decreases with high values in some small areas 3 2 validation of the retrieved lake water surface albedo data in this study 43 field measured albedo data were used to establish a multivariate linear regression equation while 10 field measured albedo data was used to examine the accuracy of the established lake water surface albedo model in the validation and analysis processes the coefficient of determination r2 mean relative error mre and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the accuracy of the method used to estimate lake water surface albedo from sentinel 2a data the r2 mre and rmse between the measured and retrieved surface albedos of the lakes in the study area were 0 62 0 25 and 0 039 as shown as in fig 7 respectively li et al 2014 evidently the r2 between the measured and retrieved albedos was not inordinately high which can be primarily ascribed to the exclusion of the spatial scale effect of albedo in the validation process measuring points correspond to spatial scales of several to several tens of meters and therefore are often unrepresentative of the distribution of the albedo over a large area in addition spatial heterogeneity presents some problems to validation directly based on low resolution remote sensing ground point data products moreover a small number of validation points can also affect the r2 value however the low rmse suggests that the retrieved values deviate only to a small extent from the true values in summary a comprehensive analysis of the two evaluation metrics i e r2 and rmse reveals that the albedo retrieval model established in this study is effective at generating lake water surface albedo products with high accuracy through retrieval from remote sensing imagery which can meet the requirement of most investigations 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the difference in albedo among selected lakes in the study area to comprehensively analyze lake water surface albedo six typical lakes were selected because the ctsm in each lake showed a sizeable spatial heterogeneity which was convenient for comparative analysis of these three are natural lakes yangshapao yueliangpao and chagan lakes and three are artificial lakes erlong lake and the shitoukoumen and xinlicheng reservoirs fig 8 shows the albedo data for these six typical lakes located near the city of baicheng in western jilin province yangshapao lake is a shallow water body with an area of 31 67 km2 fig 8a due to the arid semiarid climate and low precipitation the volume of water in yangshapao lake is smaller than other lakes however as a result of large scale water conservancy projects e g the nen river baicheng region water transfer project implemented in recent years yangshapao lake has been transformed from a seasonal lake to a perennial lake in addition stronger winds in the surrounding region and concentration of total suspended matter tsm is relatively higher results of this study indicate that yangshapao lake has a generally high water surface albedo ranging from 0 16 to 0 45 mean 0 22 which indicates low water quality near the center of the lake estimated water surface albedo was extremely high but these results necessitate some caution as they involved a small number of pixels and may have been impacted by noise in the spectral signal and by a few cloud spots in the sentinel 2 image spatially water surface albedo of yangshaopao lake was uniform but from north to south surface albedo was found to increase and then decrease albeit inconspicuously fig 8a covering an area of 61 6 km2 the shitoukoumen reservoir is an important water source for the city of changchun capital of the jilin province and a driver of economic and social development intensive soil erosion within the surrounding catchment has resulted in a high content of suspended particulate matter in shitoukoumen reservoir in addition high level sedimentation has led to a year on year reduction in the reservoir s storage capacity and ultimately its service life following extensive measurements li et al 2009 drew a similar conclusion regarding water quality and sedimentation problems in shitoukoumen reservoir results fig 8b of the present study showed high surface albedo values range 0 06 0 23 mean 0 16 in shitoukoumen reservoir compared to drinking water reservoirs of similar class spatially low albedo values were recorded in the upstream source area which may be attributed to the good quality of waters delivered by the tributaries shuangyang yinma and chalu rivers and therefore may have diluted the concentration of optically active compounds spm algal particles in this portion of the reservoir when the sentinel 2 images were acquired low albedo values 0 13 occurred in the area close to the reservoir s dock outlet fig 8b situated in western jilin province chagan lake the province s largest freshwater lake is flat bottomed water body with an area of 296 41 km2 and an average depth of 2 52 m due to its large area the concentration of spm and chl in the lake undergoes marked seasonal variations in its spatial distribution wen et al 2022 estimates of water surface albedo in chagan lake ranged from 0 01 to 0 31 mean 0 15 the magnitude and spatial distribution of water surface albedo in that lake reflected the combined effect of several factors including precipitation wind regime fluvial hydrology and human activities the high albedo values range 0 17 0 25 recorded on the southeastern inlet of the lake can be attributed to among other factors i the low water volume in chagan lake in october of 2017 before acquisition of sentinel 2 images and ii discharge of untreated domestic sewage and sediment laden turbid water carried by the songhua river a chagan lake tributary as it passed through villages and erosion impacted cultivated areas upstream of chagan lake in contrast low albedo values range 0 04 0 14 were recorded near the southern inlet of chagan lake surface water albedo also varied in the east to west direction with high values 0 21 0 26 near the center and a gradual decrease from the center to either the eastern or the western shore range 0 02 0 06 located in an area characterized by strong winds in fall and winter bottom sediment resuspension is a common occurrence in this vast and shallow lake especially near the center of chagan lake where winds often blow with more intensity the combined effect of these natural and anthropogenic factors contributed to the observed spatial distribution in surface water albedo in chagan lake fig 8c also situated in the jilin province yueliangpao lake 126 75 km2 in area and 4 7 m in average depth is a reservoir built for freshwater pisciculture estimated surface albedo for yueliangpao lake ranged from 0 01 to 0 23 mean 0 14 fig 8d spatially surface water albedo was low 0 04 0 13 near the lake s western inlet likely a reflection of transparent water delivered by the taoer river to yueliangpao lake at the center of yueliangpao lake surface water albedo was high ranging from 0 14 to 0 23 the lowest albedo values 0 01 0 06 were recorded in a semi closed sub basin in the northern section of yueliangpao lake this long and narrow area is sheltered from strong winds and is largely unimpacted by bottom sediment resuspension thus resulting in low water surface albedo fig 8d located near the city of siping jilin and in the middle upper reaches of the eastern liao river catchment erlong lake is the water source for the residents of siping and is the largest provincially managed reservoir it encompasses an area of 101 72 km2 and has an average depth of 17 m erlong lake waters are mostly limpid and have a low albedo range 0 01 to 0 23 mean 0 08 small areas with high albedo were observed near at the upstream and downstream tips of erlong lake fig 8e with an area of 48 53 km2 and a normal water depth of 219 63 m the xinlicheng reservoir located at the center of the jilin province is another major water source for the city of changchun and is a completely closed level 1 water source conservation zone the implementation of various protection measures has to some extent improved the water quality in the xinlicheng reservoir in recent years very low values of surface water albedo were recorded throughout the xinlicheng reservoir range 0 01 to 0 08 mean 0 02 fig 8f these low albedo across the reservoir reflects the improved water quality in the xinlicheng reservoir overall there was no clear difference between natural and artificial lakes regarding water surface albedo fig 9 of the natural lakes yangshapao lake exhibited the highest average albedo followed by natural lakes chagan and yueliangpao of the artificial lakes the shitoukoumen reservoir had the highest average albedo located in a long narrow mountainous area the shitoukoumen reservoir is significantly affected by precipitation intense soil erosion within the surrounding catchment is a likely contributor to high ctsm and high albedo throughout shitoukoumen reservoir in contrast the waters of erlong lake and the xinlicheng reservoir are of high quality probably due to their geomorphology deeper than most lakes and reservouirs implementation of environmental protection measures within the surrounding catchment and adoption of stringent lake management practices 4 2 spatial relationship between the ctsm and water surface albedo due to the high spatial variability in water surface albedo lakes in this study area provide an interesting case study to further examine underlying factors of these variations in surface albedo and its relationship water quality parameters in northeast china we particularly focused on ctsm and chl a two water quality parameters that were also retrieved from sentinel 2 imagery for tsm the measured ctsm data and the sentinel 2 msi data from the lakes in the study area were employed to construct a remote sensing model of tsm concentration for the study area based on 33 measured albedo data and sentinel 2 msi multi band remote sensing data we constructed a remote sensing model of tsm concentration in the study area by adopting linear and nonlinear regression analysis with spss14 0 software fig 10 shows a good power exponential correlation between the fifth band reflectance of the sentinel 2a msi image and the measured ctsm data with an r2 of 0 73 the spatial distribution of ctsm in lakes of the study area was then derived from application of the model with sentinel 2 imagery in band 5 fig 11 the accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing predicted ctsm with measurements made in the lakes in the study area during the same period fig 12 an analysis of the results of the evaluation revealed a r2 of 0 90 and rmse of 40 mg l between the retrieved and measured values suggesting satisfactory performance of the ctsm model that was further evidenced by correlating water surface albedo and ctsm at 3500 random sites in the lakes of this study area fig 13 a strong positive relationship r2 0 85 between these two variables a certain degree of clustering was noted in the scatter plot and these points correspond primarily with the areas with low albedo values range 0 05 0 25 and low ctsm range 100 200 mg l while tsm in the range of 200 mg l albedo showed a slow growth fig 13 4 3 spatial relationship between cchl a and water surface albedo of chagan lake due to the complexity of the optical components of inland turbid water bodies atmospheric correction algorithm error bandwidth limitation the interaction between highly suspended inorganic particles and brdf and boundary conditions in optically shallow water areas by using high resolution satellite inversion of chlorophyll a concentration it is still challenging to obtain significant scale water body chlorophyll a inversion data of wen et al 2022 several empirical and semiempirical methods have extensively been used to retrieve cchl a from remote sensing data duan et al 2010 wen et al 2022 based on conventional mathematical statistics empirical methods directly establish a statistical relationship between remote sensing data and cchl a measurements based on a priori knowledge of the spectral features of chl a e g the adsorption peaks of phytoplankton in the infrared region or its fluorescence peaks in the near infrared region semiempirical methods have established functional relationships between remote sensing data and chl a using simple algebraic equations algorithms commonly used to retrieve cchl a from sentinel 2 imagery include the two band three band normalized difference chlindex and peak height algorithms buma and lee 2020 in this study the cchl a retrieval model developed by molkov et al 2019 for the gorky reservoir was used our analysis showed that using a power function and the three band algorithm of molkov et al 2019 the model can predict cchl a with high accuracy therefore the expression below eq 16 was used to retrieve cchl a for the chagan lake and examine its spatial distribution fig 14 16 chl a 4373 1 x 296 6 0 479 the accuracy of the model was evaluated through comparison of retrieved cchl a vs cchl a measured in chagan lake during the same period table 5 our analysis of the evaluation results revealed a relative difference of 18 between measured and retrieved values suggesting that the retrieval model performed reasonably well in the context of chagan lake relationship between albedo and cchl a at 740 random sites within chagan lake was examined results fig 15 revealed an unremarkable correlation between the two variables r2 0 47 suggesting a low level of consistency between them this finding is in accord with our previous statement section 3 that cchl a has a small impact on albedo 4 4 perspectives and significance considering the lack of a mature atmospheric correction procedure for inland waters in this study sentinel 2 images were atmospherically corrected using the sen2cor software although satisfactory results were obtained they inevitably contain some amount of error lindsay and rothrock 1994 found that the errors contained in the input parameters cause retrieval uncertainties during the atmospheric correction process for example a lack of data for the atmospheric moisture content can result in an error of 8 in the retrieved albedo while an absence of aerosol and ozone data can lead to uncertainties of 13 and 4 in the retrieved albedo respectively although accurate calculation of atmospheric composition using remote sensing methods is a formidably difficult task improvement of the accuracy of the atmospheric correction process should be a future research priority the temporal and spatial resolution of lake water surface albedo data needs to be improved the sentinel 2 imagery used in this study did not become available until 2015 while sentinel 2 imagery is advantageous in terms of its spatial resolution that allows for the depiction of a detailed spatial distribution of albedo its small coverage and low temporal resolution preclude it from supporting lake water surface albedo investigations over decadal time scales in addition the surface albedo of a water body can be affected by factors that vary considerably throughout the day therefore acquisition of satellite imagery at high temporal resolution is important to address this emerging research need geostationary satellites such as the fengyun 3c satellite high temporal resolution and the gaofen 4 satellite high temporal and spatial resolution are characterized by their ability to produce high temporal resolution imagery and also can be used to realize all weather multispectral and three dimensional observations of global atmospheric and geophysical elements wang et al 2018 you et al 2013 therefore future research would be warranted to demonstrate the application of these satellite data products to derive water surface albedo lake water surface temperature is a strong indicator of climate change water surface albedo has measurable impact on heat flux due to its effects on the radiation and energy balance at the water atmosphere interface in future research the lake water surface albedo retrieval model developed in this study can be employed to improve the available remote sensing lake temperature and heat flux models with the goal of facilitating the investigation of the response of lakes to climate change 4 5 limitation field sampling data need to be increased and the quality and representativeness of the measured data need to be improved in this study the number of sampling points and the representativeness is not enough to establish a strong and stable remote sensing inversion model moreover the sampling points are mainly concentrated in western jilin province in contrast most lakes in western jilin province have poor water quality and there are fewer sample points for lakes with better water quality the lack of lake data will affect the lake albedo modeling process and thus the albedo of lakes with better water quality is underestimated therefore in the next step of the research the lake data needs to be supplemented and the inversion model needs further improvement 5 conclusion currently studies examining the retrieval of broadband inland lake water surface albedos from remote sensing imagery are lacking in view of this absence a lake water surface albedo model for sentinel 2 satellite data is for the first time developed in this study based on theoretical knowledge and field measurements this model is subsequently used to retrieve lake water surface albedos specifically the sentinel 2 data are subjected to preprocessing treatments e g radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction to generate radiance and reflectance data suitable for the retrieval process an introduction is given to these treatments based on the measured spectral data for the water bodies in conjunction with the srf for the sentinel 2 msi the incident and reflected radiation densities are calculated on this basis the narrowband albedos are determined afterwards a multivariate regression analysis is performed to examine the linear relationship between the narrowband and broadband lake water surface albedos following on from this analysis a narrowband to broadband lake water surface albedo conversion equation for the sentinel 2 msi is established and subsequently used to obtain albedo data spatial resolution 10 m for the lakes in the study area validation analysis of the albedo data retrieved using the model against the measured albedo data reveals an r2 of 0 62 an mre of 0 25 and an rmse of 0 039 this finding suggests that the lake water surface albedo retrieval algorithm developed in this study is effective at generating lake water surface albedo products with high accuracy and spatial resolution which can satisfy the accuracy required by the analysis of the temporal and spatial patterns of albedo at regional scales as well as can serve as basic datasets

2486,investigating the impact and response of precipitation on groundwater resources is critical to groundwater resource management because groundwater is primarily recharged by precipitation the large scale climatic patterns and climate change affecting groundwater resources and their response through precipitation are poorly understood therefore we propose a systematic method of time frequency correlation analysis combining independent component analysis ica and wavelet coherence analysis wtc this method derives independent components ics with precipitation features from groundwater depth to obtain more information from the time frequency perspective and prove its reliability and superiority compared with traditional methods ics with precipitation features icprecipitation with teleconnection factors of large scale climatic patterns were analyzed in time frequency revealing the effects of different patterns on groundwater depth changes through precipitation this result demonstrates the potential of the ica wtc method for research on climate precipitation groundwater physical response mechanisms compared with the traditional method this method removes the non precipitation influence in the groundwater depth variation to obtain the independent component factors with precipitation influence features in the groundwater depth variation this process demixes the groundwater depth response to all external influences to achieve an accurate extraction of the groundwater response to the precipitation influence so that the analysis can be specific to the influence and response process of groundwater and precipitation for the analysis results it uses a range to describe time lag of precipitation influenced groundwater instead a fixed value and the method visualize the time frequency response process of the large scale climatic patterns affecting groundwater through precipitation and provides a basis for further analysis this method was applied to the typical area of sanjiang plain in heilongjiang province northeast china one of the largest agricultural areas in china and one of the areas with the fastest groundwater decline due to groundwater mining for agricultural irrigation three icprecipitation of groundwater depth were obtained representing the annual period long term period and both the annual period and long term period of precipitation influence with time lags of precipitation influence on groundwater depth from 63 02 28 00 day to 176 99 28 63 day the wtc of the four large scale climatic patterns located in different directions from the study area with icprecipitation shows that the large scale climatic patterns affect groundwater mainly by influencing the long period of precipitation moreover the el niño southern oscillation pattern still is the most influential even though the study area is located in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere it is still more vital than other models closer to the study area keywords groundwater time frequency analysis wavelet coherence analysis independent component analysis precipitation climatic pattern data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction with social development although the hydrology of water resources research has been fast increasing there are still many limitations in the understanding and study of groundwater condon et al 2021 gleeson et al 2021 hartmann et al 2014 hashim et al 2011 taylor et al 2013 werner et al 2013 in this context the uncertainty of external influences still makes it challenging to depict groundwater accurately within the various recharge sources of groundwater including precipitation rivers and lakes precipitation is the largest source of recharge and the primary external stimulus in most areas aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 bierkens and wada 2019 dangar et al 2021 sophocleous 2002 wada et al 2017 therefore determining the influence of precipitation on groundwater depth is crucial for analyzing the relationship between precipitation and groundwater asoka et al 2017 hartmann et al 2014 in addition precipitation is closely related to large scale climatic patterns in the context of climate changes precipitation s influence on groundwater systems will follow this change diffenbaugh et al 2015 taylor et al 2013 thus investigating the affect and response of precipitation on groundwater depth in climate change background is essential for developing and utilizing regional groundwater resources table 1 many studies have used different methods to analyze the relationship between regional groundwater and precipitation for example li et al 2012 used sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of multiple external influences on groundwater depths in terms of temporal features in jinci spring in shanxi north china johnson et al 2012 analyzed the time frequency features of surface water and groundwater interactions using correlation analysis and fast fourier transform niu et al 2021 used cross wavelet to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of groundwater in the karst spring domain of jinan china regarding the relationship between climate change and groundwater tremblay et al 2011 using wtc analyzed the relationship between large scale climatic patterns and groundwater depths in three regions across canada demonstrating that interannual periods can be observed in local groundwater depths associated with large scale climate patterns kuss and gurdak 2014 used singular spectrum analysis wtc analysis and lag correlation to quantify the effects of large scale climatic patterns on precipitation and groundwater depths in major aquifers in the united states based on grace data carvalho resende et al 2019 investigated the link between climate variability and changes in total water volume and groundwater storage in large aquifer basins on the african continent through several methods including wavelet transform labat 2005 labat et al 2005 provided a comprehensive discussion of the prospects for hydrological applications of wavelet analysis analyzing the mutual time varying relationships between monthly flows of four large atlantic rivers and large scale climatic patterns and providing information on their influence and response precipitation is the primary physical factor in the process of large scale climatic patterns affecting groundwater chang et al 2019 liesch and wunsch 2019 malakar et al 2021 rust et al 2019 tanachaichoksirikun and seeboonruang 2020 tremblay et al 2011 zhu and zhang 2022 however these studies only explored the relationship between climate and precipitation climate and groundwater and precipitation and groundwater separately without integrating the climate precipitation groundwater relationship with a sequence instead analyzing the process of precipitation s affect on groundwater and groundwater response first then analyzing this process s relationship with large scale climatic patterns is one of the keys to elucidating the climate change influence on the process of precipitation recharge to groundwater to better analyze the influence and response of the sequential relationship climate precipitation groundwater extracting the precipitation affect to the groundwater depth is necessary one way to achieve this is to consider the groundwater depth variation from multiple observation wells as a signal set the signal set is decomposed into numerous source signals meaning that the groundwater depth variation is formed by these source signals which are considered as the reflection of external influences the correlation analysis is then used to analyze the source signals with specific external influences to determine each signal s corresponding specific influence many studies have used principal component analysis pca like methods to extract source signals from regional groundwater depth to analyze the regional spatial and temporal variation larochelle et al 2022 longuevergne et al 2007 yu and chu 2010 the mathematical assumption of the pca method for extracting specific features caused by specific external influences is that the individual source signals are uncorrelated which also means that the individual principal components are linearly independent of each other however external influences in nature are often nonlinear which also leads to the fact that the signals extracted by the pca method may not correspond well to specific external influences in contrast independent component analysis ica can decompose the original signals into several signals that are statistically independent of each other a property that includes both linearity and nonlinearity therefore it solves the shortcomings of pca and reflects the changes in groundwater depth caused by specific external influences feng et al 2022 in addition wavelet analysis especially wavelet coherence analysis wtc is a well performed correlation analysis tool for determining the corresponding specific external influences with the extracted independent components ics and can easily detect discontinuities or trends in time series and also wtc can better reflect the time lag effect between specific external influences with ics compensating for the shortcomings of correlation analysis and improving the accuracy of the results grinsted et al 2004 maraun and kurths 2004 qian et al 2014 tremblay et al 2011 therefore combining the ica method with the wtc method could be helpful in analyzing the sequential climate precipitation groundwater relationship s influence and response mechanisms in summary this study proposes a systematic method that simultaneously accomplishes time frequency domain correlation analysis using wtc based on ica and quantitatively reveals the spatial and temporal variation features of groundwater depth changes caused by local precipitation recharge using the typical area of sanjiang plain in northeast china as an example with the above wtc is performed between ics extracted from the groundwater depth with precipitation features and teleconnection factors representing large scale climatic patterns to analyze the variation between large scale climatic patterns precipitation and groundwater the method proposed in this study aims to provide more comprehensive time frequency information for the effects and responses of regional groundwater resources to external influences and a comprehensive perspective for studying the variation between groundwater and large scale climatic patterns 2 methodology fig 1 depicts the research procedure used in this study in this study based on the collected precipitation time series groundwater depth observations data and large scale climatic patterns with teleconnection factors first analyze the precipitation time series by performing theissen polygon weighted average and cumulative distance level processing to obtain the detrend precipitation time series which contains the period variation using the cwt method we determine the time frequency precipitation features in the study area the independent component factors were extracted by the ica method from groundwater depth then the independent component factor relative to precipitation is determined by the wtc method and defined as icprecipitation which measures precipitation s effect on groundwater depth for the large scale climate patterns the teleconnection factors of the patterns were firstly analyzed by cwt to obtain the time frequency features after that the time frequency response features between icprecipitation and the patterns were analyzed by the wtc method finally the time frequency results of the large scale climatic patterns affecting groundwater depth variation through precipitation are concluded these methods will be elaborated in the following subsections 2 1 independent component analysis ica ica is a blind source separation signal processing method that can be used to separate independent source components from the input time series mixed signal which has also obtained good performance in geophysical studies comon 1994 hyvärinen 1999 hyvärinen 2013 hyvärinen and oja 2000 middleton et al 2015a westra et al 2007 although the method has not been widely used in natural science research including hydrology the theoretical basis of its related research areas has been much discussed forootan and kusche 2013 liu and hsu 2015 middleton et al 2015b nahar et al 2018 in the research of blind source separation a cocktail party is a classic example place several microphones at cocktail parties the sound signal collected by the microphone can be expressed as follows 1 x a s where x is the known mixed signal matrix that is the mixed sound recorded by the microphone s is the unknown original signal and a is the mixed matrix describing the relationship between the original signal and the mixed signal which is also unknown the object of ica is to estimate them using known observations in x this process is obtained by acquiring the separation matrix w which has the inverse matrix properties of a as shown in the below 2 w a 1 therefore the matrix s of ics can be expressed as eq 3 when w is multiplied by x 3 s s w x if the matrix w is estimated the matrix s will be obtained in the above equation x is the regional observed groundwater depths a is a mixed matrix representing the regional spatio temporal condition each ic from the matrix s is considered as a specific external influence to groundwater depth variation in this study the fastica method was used to estimate w the advantage of fastica is its efficient computation in terms of convergence the result is relatively stable if the negative entropy is used as the objective function for estimating the matrix w the matlab tool fastica2 5 1 1 the matlab code of fastica can be downloaded at https research ics aalto fi ica fastica code dlcode shtml performed this process the main algorithm of fastica is a fixed point iterative method which can be found in hyvärinen 1999 hyvärinen and oja 2000 in these studies fastica is briefly summarized as follows fastica assumes that the probability distributions of all random variables i e the source signal are non gaussian and that the cumulative relative probability distributions of these random variables tend to be gaussian as the number of random variables increases central limit theorem based on this assumption fastica identifies ics the pattern of each source signal by maximizing the non gaussian properties of each ic and also the ica method including fastica requires as many groundwater time series as possible and as short observation time intervals as possible this study used suitably short observation time intervals 5 days and a sufficiently large time series 25 observation wells to achieve this it has exceeded the data precision and breadth of many previous studies on groundwater response to climate change for more information on the mathematical derivation of fastica and related content please refer to hyvärinen 1999 hyvärinen 2013 hyvärinen and oja 2000 2 2 continuous wavelet transform cwt currently the widely used cwt is based on the morlet wavelet transform which has achieved excellent results in geophysical and specific hydrology studies by transforming and analyzing time series grinsted et al 2004 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 labat 2005 labat 2008 labat et al 2000 torrence and compo 1998 wavelet s theoretical research of hydrological application has been widely developed and proves the reliability of this method huang et al 2017 maheswaran and khosa 2012 rhif et al 2019 sang 2013 vereecken et al 2014 cwt applies the wavelet as a bandpass filter to the time series the wavelet stretches in time by changing its scale and the cwt of a time series xn n 1 2 3 n with uniform time step δt is defined as the convolution of xn with the scaled and normalized wavelet 4 w n x s δ t s n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t s where n is the local time index n is the data series length s is the wavelet scale δt is the wavelet scale and ψ0 is the morlet wavelet the morlet wavelet is favored for its excellent frequency domain definition and similarity to geophysical time series signal patterns morlet is a complex wavelet defined as the product of sinusoidal and gaussian superposition which is mathematically defined by the following eq 5 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where ω0 is the dimensionless frequency and η is dimensionless time the morlet wavelet ω0 6 is a good choice because it provides a good balance between time and frequency localization because the wavelet is not completely localized in time the cwt transform has an edge pseudo effect therefore it is useful to introduce a cone of influence coi that cannot ignore edge effects here we take coi as the region where the wavelet power drops to the edge value e 2 due to edge discontinuities the wavelet power is defined as w n x s the background power spectrum pk is defined as 6 p k 1 α 2 1 α e 2 i π k 2 where k is the fourier frequency index the probability that the wavelet power of a process with a given power spectrum pk is greater than p is defined as 7 d w n x s 2 σ x 2 p 1 2 p k χ v 2 p where ν is equal to 1 for real wavelets and 2 for complex wavelets 2 3 wavelet coherence wtc the wtc could demonstrate the correlation between ics extracted from groundwater depth and specific external influences in the time frequency domain the analysis results of this method will include time domain information frequency domain information time frequency information lag time information and significance tests which can effectively determine the correspondence grinsted et al 2004 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 labat 2005 labat et al 2005 qian et al 2014 schaefli et al 2007 torrence and compo 1998 wtc is the coherence of the cross wavelet transform in time frequency space before introducing wtc it need first define the cross wavelet the cross wavelet transform of two time series xn and yn is defined as wxy wxwy where represents complex conjugation further it define the cross wavelet power for wxy the complex argument arg wxy can be interpreted as the local relative phase between xn and yn in time frequency space the theoretical power distribution of two time series cross wavelets with background power spectra p k x and p k y is defined as 8 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level associated with probability p for a probability density function defined by the square root of the product of two χ2 distributions based on the above definition define the wtc of two time series as 9 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where s is the smoothing operator note that this definition is very similar to the traditional definition of correlation coefficients according to grinsted et al 2004 it is useful to think of wtc as a local correlation coefficient in time frequency space s is defined as 10 s w s scale s time w n s where s scale refers to the smoothing along the wavelet scale axis and the s time smoothing it is natural to design a smoothing operator with a footprint similar to the wavelet used for the morlet wavelet a suitable smoothing operator is given 11 s time w s w n s c 1 t 2 2 s 2 s s time w s w n s c 2 π 0 6 s n where c 1 and c 2 are normalized constants and π is a rectangle function factor 0 6 is the empirically determined scale decorrelation length of the morlet wavelet torrence and compo 1998 the time frequency significance of the wtc is tested by the monte carlo method using a large amount of data with a distribution similar to that of the input datasets in the cwt and wtc analysis ics and precipitation will be input to the cwt analysis observing and determining their significant periods in the time frequency domain then ics and precipitation will be input to the wtc analysis to determine whether the ics are correlated with a certain frequency of precipitation which means that ic contains groundwater depth feature affected by precipitation if ics contain precipitation information it could further analyze ics with teleconnection factors representing large scale climatic patterns using wtc the results will reveal how large scale climate patterns and climate change affect groundwater through precipitation in traditional correlation analysis only an optimal time lag result is usually obtained however the fixed time lag does not match the variation in regional precipitation infiltration conditions that may exist in the actual situation qi et al 2018 shows that when the ground surface has a thick clay layer the groundwater recharge time lag can be up to months or even half a year and the recharge time lag effect can be up to months in the study area selected for this research the lag effect might change with time which is not captured by the intercorrelation calculation so it cannot fully indicate the correlation between precipitation and the independent component ic in the time frequency domain but the wtc method can solve this issue as shown in fig 5 i iii the arrow points to the phase angle difference on the local time frequency domain which can be further converted to a time lag since ic is extracted from groundwater depth groundwater depth negatively correlates with precipitation so when the arrow from right to left it shows that the two are in the reversed phase ic lags 2n periods from down to up represents ic lags 1 2 2n periods from left to right is in phase lags 1 2n periods and from up to down represents ic lags 3 2 2n periods combining the precipitation infiltration and the actual infiltration time variation we consider that n 0 here the detailed mathematical process above can be found in grinsted et al 2004 where the matlab wtc analysis 2 2 the matlab code of wavelet coherence can be downloaded at https noc ac uk business marine data products cross wavelet wavelet coherence toolbox matlabwavelet wavelet coherence toolbox matlab package toolbox is provided 3 study area and datasets 3 1 study area the typical area of the sanjiang plain was selected as the study area located in heilongjiang province china fig 2 sanjiang plain is one of the largest agricultural areas in china the typical area of sanjiang plain is the area with the most significant groundwater decline due to groundwater mining for agricultural irrigation the water system is developed in this typical area the area s northern eastern southern and northwestern boundaries are the heilongjiang river ussuri river naolihe river and songhua river respectively and the southwestern boundary is the administrative area of fujin city for the study area due to the practical research demands the geographical coordinates of the typical area range from 44 48 to 48 23 n 131 26 to 134 47 e and the total area are 22 100 km2 the study area has a clay layer of 0 18 m thickness on top of the sand layer which constitutes the unconfined and semiconfined aquifer the clay type includes powder clay and clayey soil powder clay is widely distributed in the plain area which is the main surface soil type and clayey soil is distributed on the mountain front terrace the aquifer is well developed in the central and eastern parts of the study area and the lithology is mainly powdered clay powdered sand and fine sand with an aquifer thickness ranging from 50 250 m 3 2 datasets to analyze the impact of precipitation influence on the groundwater depth variation of the study area and the affect and response with large scale climatic patterns ica and wtc method was combined to analyze the groundwater depths of the local five day measurements the wtc method was used to determine the precipitation time series with the ics extracted from groundwater depths by using the ica method to identify the ics with precipitation features icprecipitation after that icprecipitation was performed with teleconnection factors representing large scale climatic patterns for the time frequency analysis using the wtc method the groundwater depth data were collected from 25 groundwater depth monitoring stations provided by the heilongjiang hydrological bureau from 2007 to 2016 and the precipitation data and teleconnection factor were collected from noaa s public data 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the temporal frequency features of precipitation the sanjiang plain is a temperate humid and semi humid continental monsoon climate annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 650 mm with 75 85 concentrated from june to october fu et al 2016 showed that on the time scale within the context of a gradual increase in local temperature the precipitation monitoring data from different meteorological stations showed either increasing or decreasing trends but none of them was significant on the spatial scale multi year average precipitation shows a relatively uniform spatial distribution across the area the above indicates that the precipitation in the study area presents a stable condition and there is no significant variation trend we subjected the precipitation to a cumulative distance levelling process to obtain the periodic precipitation data first we summed the daily precipitation data collected from the precipitation stations in and around the study area determined the area weight of each representative station using the thiessen polygon method and performed an area weighted average as shown in fig 3 i subsequently the precipitation data during the study period were subjected to cumulative distance level processing to obtain the cumulative distance level precipitation with the trend removed as shown in fig 3 ii the time frequency pattern analysis of precipitation is performed using cwt as shown in fig 3 iii and iv compared with the fast fourier transform cwt can visually show the time frequency domain pattern of a certain time series and can be projected based on the period to see the main period and obtain the frequency domain results of the time series similar to the fourier transform according to grinsted et al 2004 the cwt combined with the ar1 test can obtain the significant period of each major period in the figure as shown in fig 3 iii and iv this precipitation time series has two high energy major periods an annual period of approximately 365 days and a long period of approximately 1112 days where the annual period passes the significance test both major periods are continuous and uninterrupted during the study period with the annual period dominating this result implies that the groundwater depth in the study area will be mainly affected by these two precipitation periods and this effect should be continuous and uninterrupted over a long term period therefore the ic corresponding to precipitation will be determined by the time frequency features obtained from the cwt analysis 4 2 determination of precipitation relative to independent components the groundwater depth time series were obtained from 25 observation wells in the study area which were input into the ica method and the dimensionality was downscaled to 5 dimensions the eigenvalue measure retained more than 90 of the information and 5 independent component factors were obtained from ic1 to ic5 the cwt time frequency spectra in fig 4 i v show that ic1 ic3 have long term stable significant periods throughout the study period which are closer to the time frequency features of precipitation the wavelet variance results of fig 4 vi also showed that ics 1 to ic3 were significantly higher where the significant periods were located with ic3 being the most significant and its annual period and long period wavelet variance was significantly higher than the other ics compared with fourier transform as a traditional method if only observed from the fourier transform like fig 4 vi wavelet variance frequency diagram there are many fallacies for example in the annual period ic2 ic4 and ic5 all rise and have similar amplitudes it is because the sum of the power is higher in this period but the time frequency spectra showed that ic4 and ic5 do not have significant continuous periods and the high power is scattered in individual parts which is very different from the time frequency features of precipitation therefore ic1 ic3 which has significant continuous periods throughout the study period will be the object of precipitation relative independent components the wtc spectra of fig 5 i iii shows that ic1 ic3 reflect a significant time frequency correlation with precipitation in the time frequency domain with ic1 corresponding to the long period time frequency feature of precipitation ic2 corresponding to the annual period time frequency feature and ic3 including both the annual period and long period time frequency features the results cover all the time frequency features of precipitation and the wtc results of fig 5 iv v with projection to the frequency domain show that the wtc coefficients of ic2 and ic3 with precipitation obtain the maximum value of wtc coefficients close to 0 9 around the annual period while ic1 and ic3 obtain stable wtc coefficients greater than 0 8 around the long term period the above results indicate that ic1 ic3 can represent the features of groundwater burial depth variation caused by precipitation icprecipitation to further discuss the efficiency of the ica wtc analysis method we compared it with the traditionally used correlation analysis which is more effective in determining the correlation between precipitation normalized data and ic1 ic3 than the correlation test using the mutual relationship number calculation table 2 shows a traditional lag correlation analysis with the precipitation and ic1 ic3 the correlation coefficient was maximum at the time lag of 85 175 d between 0 03 0 197 which does not reflect the correlation between precipitation and ics well according to grinsted et al 2004 the wtc coefficient can be defined as the correlation coefficient in a specific time frequency domain because the analysis method is different from the traditional correlation analysis extracting the wtc coefficient of the significant domain with significance levels exceeding 5 and comparing them with the whole time frequency domain s wtc coefficient it is possible to quantitatively analyze the specific significant time frequency domain s correlation compared to other parts the results in table 2 show that when the wtc coefficients in the whole time frequency domain were less than 0 5 the wtc coefficients in the significant domains were almost always greater than 0 8 which accurately implied the differences in the time frequency correlations in the significant domain compared to the whole domain moreover relevant studies also supported the method s reliability the time lag results are similar to the result of qi et al 2018 about the response relationship and time lag of precipitation and groundwater in the naoli river basin within this study area which also proved the effectiveness of the ica wtc method the above analysis in this chapter shows the advantages of the ica wtc method it can reflect the correlation in the time frequency domain by visualization comparing the correlation coefficients in the significant domain with the whole domain demonstrates the correlation in the significant time frequency domain the time lag results which exhibit a range of variation similar to the real situation also indicate the method s reliability in summary the wtc ica method makes the correlation analysis significance analysis and time lag analysis correspond to each other leading to a more comprehensive analysis which contributes to the study of the effect and response of precipitation on groundwater depth influence 4 3 icprecipitation response to large scale climatic patterns in this study it is considered four typical large scale climatic patterns teleconnection factors the multivariate enso index mei arctic oscillation ao west pacific wp and polar eurasia pattern pol the main locations of the four large scale climatic patterns are in the study area s south north east and west and all the influence range includes the study area which is part of northeastern china thus there is no doubt that there are effects of these large scale climatic patterns in the study area but it is difficult to quantitatively measure how these patterns affect groundwater through precipitation therefore after extracting icprecipitation from groundwater depth by ica wtc the time frequency relationship between icprecipitation and teleconnection factors can be obtained by using wtc it is possible to analyze how large scale climatic patterns affect groundwater depth through precipitation fig 6 shows the cwt spectra of the four teleconnection factors and the wtc spectra between them and three icprecipitation the figure indicated similar features and periods in the large scale climatic patterns could be observed from the icprecipitation extracted from the groundwater depth especially in the ic3 spectra the above analysis indicates that ic3 represents the groundwater depth response to the annual period and the long period of precipitation notably the y axis coordinates in fig 6 are different from those in fig 5 which need to be visually transformed to compare these two observations the continuous wavelet spectra in fig 6 i iv show that the mei representing enso has the strongest periods and power in the range of the study period the results for mei show that it has a significant time frequency domain over the study period of 4 32 months especially at long periods where the significant domain has a large extension which even extends to the coi this result indicates that the frequency of mei is mostly long period with reasonable assumptions even if input a longer mei time series the significant domain will develop in the long period the results also show that the significant period of mei from 6 to 28 months is mainly in the years 2008 2012 and the significance fades away if the time is extended forward and backward for ao wp and pol the cwt spectrum shows that they do not have continuous significant domains in the current time frequency domain these point to the conclusion that the enso pattern located in the southern hemisphere as the farthest large scale climatic pattern to the study area compared to other large scale climatic patterns closer to the study area has the strongest affect on the groundwater depth variation through precipitation in the study area however though ao wp and pol did not have continuous significant domains this result is also meaningful as the wavelet spectrum of ao indicates a period of approximately 32 months and the strong energy domain is not only located within the significant area but also indicates the potential for a longer period moreover the significant periods of mei ao wp and pol between 6 and 8 months dominate different periods of the study period i e mid 2009 to early 2011 early 2010 to late 2011 mid 2011 to late 2013 and mid 2013 to mid 2014 which indicates that the dominance of each climate model may change during the 10 year period figure 6 v xvi implicated the effects of the four climatic patterns on groundwater depths in the study area through precipitation ic1 has several significant correlation time frequency domains with mei reflected at approximately 8 16 and 32 months showing a multiplicative relationship between significant periods all of this occurred during the first half of the study period generally from early 2009 to later 2011 this result should not be a coincidence noting the high power gathering in the same time frequency domains of ic1 with ao wp and pol moreover ic1 contains precipitation features that are long periods for ic2 except for pol the wavelet coherence spectra do not have any obvious significant domain ic2 contains precipitation features that are annual periods the results for each teleconnection factor and ic3 are more intuitive and obvious wtc spectra exhibit significantly long periods of 32 months or longer and throughout the study period which is also consistent with the long period nature of the large scale climatic patterns this result also indicates that all large scale climatic patterns are linked to the long period features of groundwater influenced by precipitation in a time frequency manner which also implies that there must be long period effects of large scale climatic patterns on groundwater through precipitation dong et al 2015 zhu and zhang 2022 indicated that large scale climatic patterns affect groundwater mainly in a long period form analyzed together with ic3 and teleconnection factors results of the wtc spectra it suggests the mechanism of large scale climate patterns and their changes affect groundwater depth variation through precipitation accordingly the above analysis leads to the inference that there is a long period response of the large scale climatic pattern affecting groundwater through precipitation and a short period response of groundwater from the long period response attenuation to illustrate the opinion it could use mei with ic1 and ic3 wtc spectra there is a long period of time frequency response between all four climatic patterns and the precipitation features extracted from the groundwater depth across the study period results with ic1 and ic3 were particularly apparent for ic1 which contains the long period response features of groundwater depth from precipitation there are multiple short period significant domains that are multiplicatively related to the long period significant domain this phenomenon is most evident in the wtc spectrum with mei first we can determine that the annual period response with precipitation does not exist in ic1 this result indicates that the significant domain of the annual period in the cwt spectrum of ic1 is not from the annual period effect of precipitation but for another reason the results of the wtc analysis with mei provide a reasonable answer the short period response between ic1 and mei like the long period echo the long period information from climate is transmitted to groundwater through precipitation generating the long period response between precipitation and groundwater but it not make precipitation had a short response with ic1 because of the groundwater properties the external influences have extended and lagged long period effects leading to the overlapping of long period effects and forming short period responses in a certain duration which is expressed as a multiplicative relationship between ic1 and mei s significant domains ic3 contains both annual and long period response features of groundwater to precipitation and if the response of the short period feature between ic1 and mei is transmitted by precipitation then ic3 containing the annual period feature of precipitation should also be detected more commonly but the wtc spectrum shows that ic3 almost only has a long period response with climate patterns therefore the analysis between ic3 and each pattern is more intuitive to show how the large scale climatic pattern affects the groundwater depth variability from precipitation at long period scales this situation is particularly evident in the wtc spectra of mei with ic1 and ic3 therefore the analysis between ic3 and the patterns more intuitively shows that the influence of large scale climatic patterns on groundwater through precipitation is long period and this influence attenuates to short periods due to the groundwater properties 5 conclusion this study proposes a systematic method that integrates ica and wtc analysis demonstrating the superiority and accuracy of the method by analyzing the response of groundwater depths to precipitation influence in the study area by extracting ics from groundwater depths and using wtc to determine ics with precipitation features icprecipitation compared with traditional correlation analysis this method not only obtains time lags in the time domain similar to lag correlation analysis but also obtains time lag variations in the time frequency domain which can be analogous to the spatial and temporal variations between precipitation and groundwater depth moreover the correlations in the time frequency domain can be compared based on the fourier transform like frequency analysis the corresponding time domain information is obtained which further effectively obtains the multiple period response features and time lag relationships between groundwater depth and precipitation therefore the method provides a more comprehensive view of groundwater and external influence affects and responses to the time frequency relationship moreover the physical mechanisms of climate groundwater impacts and responses have been relatively ambiguous precipitation as the primary physical influence of groundwater affected by large scale climatic patterns and climate change could provide more essential reference information for research on the physical mechanisms of the impact and response between climate and groundwater through wtc analysis of icprecipitation extracted from the groundwater depth and teleconnection factors representing large scale climatic patterns in summary this study proposes a systematic method for studying the effects and responses of external influences on groundwater depth which could be used as a method for exploring time frequency information on the regional water cycle while also having the potential to be used as a method for exploring the physical mechanisms of interaction between large scale climatic patterns and regional groundwater resources similar to the common limitations present in current groundwater studies wang et al 2020 because the groundwater depth time series used in this paper is only 10 years this study can only detect a period of 1280 d compared to the decades long period present in climatic patterns but it does not affect the reliability of the information detected in this paper due to the cwt feature out of the cone of influence coi the gray area on both sides of the wavelet fig the pseudo effect range of the wavelet transform without pseudo effect the time frequency information is reliable and the significance test further demonstrates the reliability of this time and period information therefore the 10 year time series length does not affect the reliability of the already detected significant time frequency information which is also the basis for the paper s conclusions accuracy so it should be specified that the limitations talked about are mainly prospective for the next step of the study and this limitation will be addressed in future work as time progresses moreover there are numerous application prospects in future research based on the ica wtc method including the application to different types of groundwater depth prediction e g neural networks etc through ics with different external influence features extracted from groundwater depth data which will give a corresponding physical meaning to the prediction process moreover the analysis of the physical response mechanism between the change in the large scale climatic pattern and the groundwater system provides a quantitative analysis

2486,investigating the impact and response of precipitation on groundwater resources is critical to groundwater resource management because groundwater is primarily recharged by precipitation the large scale climatic patterns and climate change affecting groundwater resources and their response through precipitation are poorly understood therefore we propose a systematic method of time frequency correlation analysis combining independent component analysis ica and wavelet coherence analysis wtc this method derives independent components ics with precipitation features from groundwater depth to obtain more information from the time frequency perspective and prove its reliability and superiority compared with traditional methods ics with precipitation features icprecipitation with teleconnection factors of large scale climatic patterns were analyzed in time frequency revealing the effects of different patterns on groundwater depth changes through precipitation this result demonstrates the potential of the ica wtc method for research on climate precipitation groundwater physical response mechanisms compared with the traditional method this method removes the non precipitation influence in the groundwater depth variation to obtain the independent component factors with precipitation influence features in the groundwater depth variation this process demixes the groundwater depth response to all external influences to achieve an accurate extraction of the groundwater response to the precipitation influence so that the analysis can be specific to the influence and response process of groundwater and precipitation for the analysis results it uses a range to describe time lag of precipitation influenced groundwater instead a fixed value and the method visualize the time frequency response process of the large scale climatic patterns affecting groundwater through precipitation and provides a basis for further analysis this method was applied to the typical area of sanjiang plain in heilongjiang province northeast china one of the largest agricultural areas in china and one of the areas with the fastest groundwater decline due to groundwater mining for agricultural irrigation three icprecipitation of groundwater depth were obtained representing the annual period long term period and both the annual period and long term period of precipitation influence with time lags of precipitation influence on groundwater depth from 63 02 28 00 day to 176 99 28 63 day the wtc of the four large scale climatic patterns located in different directions from the study area with icprecipitation shows that the large scale climatic patterns affect groundwater mainly by influencing the long period of precipitation moreover the el niño southern oscillation pattern still is the most influential even though the study area is located in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere it is still more vital than other models closer to the study area keywords groundwater time frequency analysis wavelet coherence analysis independent component analysis precipitation climatic pattern data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction with social development although the hydrology of water resources research has been fast increasing there are still many limitations in the understanding and study of groundwater condon et al 2021 gleeson et al 2021 hartmann et al 2014 hashim et al 2011 taylor et al 2013 werner et al 2013 in this context the uncertainty of external influences still makes it challenging to depict groundwater accurately within the various recharge sources of groundwater including precipitation rivers and lakes precipitation is the largest source of recharge and the primary external stimulus in most areas aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 bierkens and wada 2019 dangar et al 2021 sophocleous 2002 wada et al 2017 therefore determining the influence of precipitation on groundwater depth is crucial for analyzing the relationship between precipitation and groundwater asoka et al 2017 hartmann et al 2014 in addition precipitation is closely related to large scale climatic patterns in the context of climate changes precipitation s influence on groundwater systems will follow this change diffenbaugh et al 2015 taylor et al 2013 thus investigating the affect and response of precipitation on groundwater depth in climate change background is essential for developing and utilizing regional groundwater resources table 1 many studies have used different methods to analyze the relationship between regional groundwater and precipitation for example li et al 2012 used sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of multiple external influences on groundwater depths in terms of temporal features in jinci spring in shanxi north china johnson et al 2012 analyzed the time frequency features of surface water and groundwater interactions using correlation analysis and fast fourier transform niu et al 2021 used cross wavelet to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of groundwater in the karst spring domain of jinan china regarding the relationship between climate change and groundwater tremblay et al 2011 using wtc analyzed the relationship between large scale climatic patterns and groundwater depths in three regions across canada demonstrating that interannual periods can be observed in local groundwater depths associated with large scale climate patterns kuss and gurdak 2014 used singular spectrum analysis wtc analysis and lag correlation to quantify the effects of large scale climatic patterns on precipitation and groundwater depths in major aquifers in the united states based on grace data carvalho resende et al 2019 investigated the link between climate variability and changes in total water volume and groundwater storage in large aquifer basins on the african continent through several methods including wavelet transform labat 2005 labat et al 2005 provided a comprehensive discussion of the prospects for hydrological applications of wavelet analysis analyzing the mutual time varying relationships between monthly flows of four large atlantic rivers and large scale climatic patterns and providing information on their influence and response precipitation is the primary physical factor in the process of large scale climatic patterns affecting groundwater chang et al 2019 liesch and wunsch 2019 malakar et al 2021 rust et al 2019 tanachaichoksirikun and seeboonruang 2020 tremblay et al 2011 zhu and zhang 2022 however these studies only explored the relationship between climate and precipitation climate and groundwater and precipitation and groundwater separately without integrating the climate precipitation groundwater relationship with a sequence instead analyzing the process of precipitation s affect on groundwater and groundwater response first then analyzing this process s relationship with large scale climatic patterns is one of the keys to elucidating the climate change influence on the process of precipitation recharge to groundwater to better analyze the influence and response of the sequential relationship climate precipitation groundwater extracting the precipitation affect to the groundwater depth is necessary one way to achieve this is to consider the groundwater depth variation from multiple observation wells as a signal set the signal set is decomposed into numerous source signals meaning that the groundwater depth variation is formed by these source signals which are considered as the reflection of external influences the correlation analysis is then used to analyze the source signals with specific external influences to determine each signal s corresponding specific influence many studies have used principal component analysis pca like methods to extract source signals from regional groundwater depth to analyze the regional spatial and temporal variation larochelle et al 2022 longuevergne et al 2007 yu and chu 2010 the mathematical assumption of the pca method for extracting specific features caused by specific external influences is that the individual source signals are uncorrelated which also means that the individual principal components are linearly independent of each other however external influences in nature are often nonlinear which also leads to the fact that the signals extracted by the pca method may not correspond well to specific external influences in contrast independent component analysis ica can decompose the original signals into several signals that are statistically independent of each other a property that includes both linearity and nonlinearity therefore it solves the shortcomings of pca and reflects the changes in groundwater depth caused by specific external influences feng et al 2022 in addition wavelet analysis especially wavelet coherence analysis wtc is a well performed correlation analysis tool for determining the corresponding specific external influences with the extracted independent components ics and can easily detect discontinuities or trends in time series and also wtc can better reflect the time lag effect between specific external influences with ics compensating for the shortcomings of correlation analysis and improving the accuracy of the results grinsted et al 2004 maraun and kurths 2004 qian et al 2014 tremblay et al 2011 therefore combining the ica method with the wtc method could be helpful in analyzing the sequential climate precipitation groundwater relationship s influence and response mechanisms in summary this study proposes a systematic method that simultaneously accomplishes time frequency domain correlation analysis using wtc based on ica and quantitatively reveals the spatial and temporal variation features of groundwater depth changes caused by local precipitation recharge using the typical area of sanjiang plain in northeast china as an example with the above wtc is performed between ics extracted from the groundwater depth with precipitation features and teleconnection factors representing large scale climatic patterns to analyze the variation between large scale climatic patterns precipitation and groundwater the method proposed in this study aims to provide more comprehensive time frequency information for the effects and responses of regional groundwater resources to external influences and a comprehensive perspective for studying the variation between groundwater and large scale climatic patterns 2 methodology fig 1 depicts the research procedure used in this study in this study based on the collected precipitation time series groundwater depth observations data and large scale climatic patterns with teleconnection factors first analyze the precipitation time series by performing theissen polygon weighted average and cumulative distance level processing to obtain the detrend precipitation time series which contains the period variation using the cwt method we determine the time frequency precipitation features in the study area the independent component factors were extracted by the ica method from groundwater depth then the independent component factor relative to precipitation is determined by the wtc method and defined as icprecipitation which measures precipitation s effect on groundwater depth for the large scale climate patterns the teleconnection factors of the patterns were firstly analyzed by cwt to obtain the time frequency features after that the time frequency response features between icprecipitation and the patterns were analyzed by the wtc method finally the time frequency results of the large scale climatic patterns affecting groundwater depth variation through precipitation are concluded these methods will be elaborated in the following subsections 2 1 independent component analysis ica ica is a blind source separation signal processing method that can be used to separate independent source components from the input time series mixed signal which has also obtained good performance in geophysical studies comon 1994 hyvärinen 1999 hyvärinen 2013 hyvärinen and oja 2000 middleton et al 2015a westra et al 2007 although the method has not been widely used in natural science research including hydrology the theoretical basis of its related research areas has been much discussed forootan and kusche 2013 liu and hsu 2015 middleton et al 2015b nahar et al 2018 in the research of blind source separation a cocktail party is a classic example place several microphones at cocktail parties the sound signal collected by the microphone can be expressed as follows 1 x a s where x is the known mixed signal matrix that is the mixed sound recorded by the microphone s is the unknown original signal and a is the mixed matrix describing the relationship between the original signal and the mixed signal which is also unknown the object of ica is to estimate them using known observations in x this process is obtained by acquiring the separation matrix w which has the inverse matrix properties of a as shown in the below 2 w a 1 therefore the matrix s of ics can be expressed as eq 3 when w is multiplied by x 3 s s w x if the matrix w is estimated the matrix s will be obtained in the above equation x is the regional observed groundwater depths a is a mixed matrix representing the regional spatio temporal condition each ic from the matrix s is considered as a specific external influence to groundwater depth variation in this study the fastica method was used to estimate w the advantage of fastica is its efficient computation in terms of convergence the result is relatively stable if the negative entropy is used as the objective function for estimating the matrix w the matlab tool fastica2 5 1 1 the matlab code of fastica can be downloaded at https research ics aalto fi ica fastica code dlcode shtml performed this process the main algorithm of fastica is a fixed point iterative method which can be found in hyvärinen 1999 hyvärinen and oja 2000 in these studies fastica is briefly summarized as follows fastica assumes that the probability distributions of all random variables i e the source signal are non gaussian and that the cumulative relative probability distributions of these random variables tend to be gaussian as the number of random variables increases central limit theorem based on this assumption fastica identifies ics the pattern of each source signal by maximizing the non gaussian properties of each ic and also the ica method including fastica requires as many groundwater time series as possible and as short observation time intervals as possible this study used suitably short observation time intervals 5 days and a sufficiently large time series 25 observation wells to achieve this it has exceeded the data precision and breadth of many previous studies on groundwater response to climate change for more information on the mathematical derivation of fastica and related content please refer to hyvärinen 1999 hyvärinen 2013 hyvärinen and oja 2000 2 2 continuous wavelet transform cwt currently the widely used cwt is based on the morlet wavelet transform which has achieved excellent results in geophysical and specific hydrology studies by transforming and analyzing time series grinsted et al 2004 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 labat 2005 labat 2008 labat et al 2000 torrence and compo 1998 wavelet s theoretical research of hydrological application has been widely developed and proves the reliability of this method huang et al 2017 maheswaran and khosa 2012 rhif et al 2019 sang 2013 vereecken et al 2014 cwt applies the wavelet as a bandpass filter to the time series the wavelet stretches in time by changing its scale and the cwt of a time series xn n 1 2 3 n with uniform time step δt is defined as the convolution of xn with the scaled and normalized wavelet 4 w n x s δ t s n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t s where n is the local time index n is the data series length s is the wavelet scale δt is the wavelet scale and ψ0 is the morlet wavelet the morlet wavelet is favored for its excellent frequency domain definition and similarity to geophysical time series signal patterns morlet is a complex wavelet defined as the product of sinusoidal and gaussian superposition which is mathematically defined by the following eq 5 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where ω0 is the dimensionless frequency and η is dimensionless time the morlet wavelet ω0 6 is a good choice because it provides a good balance between time and frequency localization because the wavelet is not completely localized in time the cwt transform has an edge pseudo effect therefore it is useful to introduce a cone of influence coi that cannot ignore edge effects here we take coi as the region where the wavelet power drops to the edge value e 2 due to edge discontinuities the wavelet power is defined as w n x s the background power spectrum pk is defined as 6 p k 1 α 2 1 α e 2 i π k 2 where k is the fourier frequency index the probability that the wavelet power of a process with a given power spectrum pk is greater than p is defined as 7 d w n x s 2 σ x 2 p 1 2 p k χ v 2 p where ν is equal to 1 for real wavelets and 2 for complex wavelets 2 3 wavelet coherence wtc the wtc could demonstrate the correlation between ics extracted from groundwater depth and specific external influences in the time frequency domain the analysis results of this method will include time domain information frequency domain information time frequency information lag time information and significance tests which can effectively determine the correspondence grinsted et al 2004 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 labat 2005 labat et al 2005 qian et al 2014 schaefli et al 2007 torrence and compo 1998 wtc is the coherence of the cross wavelet transform in time frequency space before introducing wtc it need first define the cross wavelet the cross wavelet transform of two time series xn and yn is defined as wxy wxwy where represents complex conjugation further it define the cross wavelet power for wxy the complex argument arg wxy can be interpreted as the local relative phase between xn and yn in time frequency space the theoretical power distribution of two time series cross wavelets with background power spectra p k x and p k y is defined as 8 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level associated with probability p for a probability density function defined by the square root of the product of two χ2 distributions based on the above definition define the wtc of two time series as 9 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where s is the smoothing operator note that this definition is very similar to the traditional definition of correlation coefficients according to grinsted et al 2004 it is useful to think of wtc as a local correlation coefficient in time frequency space s is defined as 10 s w s scale s time w n s where s scale refers to the smoothing along the wavelet scale axis and the s time smoothing it is natural to design a smoothing operator with a footprint similar to the wavelet used for the morlet wavelet a suitable smoothing operator is given 11 s time w s w n s c 1 t 2 2 s 2 s s time w s w n s c 2 π 0 6 s n where c 1 and c 2 are normalized constants and π is a rectangle function factor 0 6 is the empirically determined scale decorrelation length of the morlet wavelet torrence and compo 1998 the time frequency significance of the wtc is tested by the monte carlo method using a large amount of data with a distribution similar to that of the input datasets in the cwt and wtc analysis ics and precipitation will be input to the cwt analysis observing and determining their significant periods in the time frequency domain then ics and precipitation will be input to the wtc analysis to determine whether the ics are correlated with a certain frequency of precipitation which means that ic contains groundwater depth feature affected by precipitation if ics contain precipitation information it could further analyze ics with teleconnection factors representing large scale climatic patterns using wtc the results will reveal how large scale climate patterns and climate change affect groundwater through precipitation in traditional correlation analysis only an optimal time lag result is usually obtained however the fixed time lag does not match the variation in regional precipitation infiltration conditions that may exist in the actual situation qi et al 2018 shows that when the ground surface has a thick clay layer the groundwater recharge time lag can be up to months or even half a year and the recharge time lag effect can be up to months in the study area selected for this research the lag effect might change with time which is not captured by the intercorrelation calculation so it cannot fully indicate the correlation between precipitation and the independent component ic in the time frequency domain but the wtc method can solve this issue as shown in fig 5 i iii the arrow points to the phase angle difference on the local time frequency domain which can be further converted to a time lag since ic is extracted from groundwater depth groundwater depth negatively correlates with precipitation so when the arrow from right to left it shows that the two are in the reversed phase ic lags 2n periods from down to up represents ic lags 1 2 2n periods from left to right is in phase lags 1 2n periods and from up to down represents ic lags 3 2 2n periods combining the precipitation infiltration and the actual infiltration time variation we consider that n 0 here the detailed mathematical process above can be found in grinsted et al 2004 where the matlab wtc analysis 2 2 the matlab code of wavelet coherence can be downloaded at https noc ac uk business marine data products cross wavelet wavelet coherence toolbox matlabwavelet wavelet coherence toolbox matlab package toolbox is provided 3 study area and datasets 3 1 study area the typical area of the sanjiang plain was selected as the study area located in heilongjiang province china fig 2 sanjiang plain is one of the largest agricultural areas in china the typical area of sanjiang plain is the area with the most significant groundwater decline due to groundwater mining for agricultural irrigation the water system is developed in this typical area the area s northern eastern southern and northwestern boundaries are the heilongjiang river ussuri river naolihe river and songhua river respectively and the southwestern boundary is the administrative area of fujin city for the study area due to the practical research demands the geographical coordinates of the typical area range from 44 48 to 48 23 n 131 26 to 134 47 e and the total area are 22 100 km2 the study area has a clay layer of 0 18 m thickness on top of the sand layer which constitutes the unconfined and semiconfined aquifer the clay type includes powder clay and clayey soil powder clay is widely distributed in the plain area which is the main surface soil type and clayey soil is distributed on the mountain front terrace the aquifer is well developed in the central and eastern parts of the study area and the lithology is mainly powdered clay powdered sand and fine sand with an aquifer thickness ranging from 50 250 m 3 2 datasets to analyze the impact of precipitation influence on the groundwater depth variation of the study area and the affect and response with large scale climatic patterns ica and wtc method was combined to analyze the groundwater depths of the local five day measurements the wtc method was used to determine the precipitation time series with the ics extracted from groundwater depths by using the ica method to identify the ics with precipitation features icprecipitation after that icprecipitation was performed with teleconnection factors representing large scale climatic patterns for the time frequency analysis using the wtc method the groundwater depth data were collected from 25 groundwater depth monitoring stations provided by the heilongjiang hydrological bureau from 2007 to 2016 and the precipitation data and teleconnection factor were collected from noaa s public data 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the temporal frequency features of precipitation the sanjiang plain is a temperate humid and semi humid continental monsoon climate annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 650 mm with 75 85 concentrated from june to october fu et al 2016 showed that on the time scale within the context of a gradual increase in local temperature the precipitation monitoring data from different meteorological stations showed either increasing or decreasing trends but none of them was significant on the spatial scale multi year average precipitation shows a relatively uniform spatial distribution across the area the above indicates that the precipitation in the study area presents a stable condition and there is no significant variation trend we subjected the precipitation to a cumulative distance levelling process to obtain the periodic precipitation data first we summed the daily precipitation data collected from the precipitation stations in and around the study area determined the area weight of each representative station using the thiessen polygon method and performed an area weighted average as shown in fig 3 i subsequently the precipitation data during the study period were subjected to cumulative distance level processing to obtain the cumulative distance level precipitation with the trend removed as shown in fig 3 ii the time frequency pattern analysis of precipitation is performed using cwt as shown in fig 3 iii and iv compared with the fast fourier transform cwt can visually show the time frequency domain pattern of a certain time series and can be projected based on the period to see the main period and obtain the frequency domain results of the time series similar to the fourier transform according to grinsted et al 2004 the cwt combined with the ar1 test can obtain the significant period of each major period in the figure as shown in fig 3 iii and iv this precipitation time series has two high energy major periods an annual period of approximately 365 days and a long period of approximately 1112 days where the annual period passes the significance test both major periods are continuous and uninterrupted during the study period with the annual period dominating this result implies that the groundwater depth in the study area will be mainly affected by these two precipitation periods and this effect should be continuous and uninterrupted over a long term period therefore the ic corresponding to precipitation will be determined by the time frequency features obtained from the cwt analysis 4 2 determination of precipitation relative to independent components the groundwater depth time series were obtained from 25 observation wells in the study area which were input into the ica method and the dimensionality was downscaled to 5 dimensions the eigenvalue measure retained more than 90 of the information and 5 independent component factors were obtained from ic1 to ic5 the cwt time frequency spectra in fig 4 i v show that ic1 ic3 have long term stable significant periods throughout the study period which are closer to the time frequency features of precipitation the wavelet variance results of fig 4 vi also showed that ics 1 to ic3 were significantly higher where the significant periods were located with ic3 being the most significant and its annual period and long period wavelet variance was significantly higher than the other ics compared with fourier transform as a traditional method if only observed from the fourier transform like fig 4 vi wavelet variance frequency diagram there are many fallacies for example in the annual period ic2 ic4 and ic5 all rise and have similar amplitudes it is because the sum of the power is higher in this period but the time frequency spectra showed that ic4 and ic5 do not have significant continuous periods and the high power is scattered in individual parts which is very different from the time frequency features of precipitation therefore ic1 ic3 which has significant continuous periods throughout the study period will be the object of precipitation relative independent components the wtc spectra of fig 5 i iii shows that ic1 ic3 reflect a significant time frequency correlation with precipitation in the time frequency domain with ic1 corresponding to the long period time frequency feature of precipitation ic2 corresponding to the annual period time frequency feature and ic3 including both the annual period and long period time frequency features the results cover all the time frequency features of precipitation and the wtc results of fig 5 iv v with projection to the frequency domain show that the wtc coefficients of ic2 and ic3 with precipitation obtain the maximum value of wtc coefficients close to 0 9 around the annual period while ic1 and ic3 obtain stable wtc coefficients greater than 0 8 around the long term period the above results indicate that ic1 ic3 can represent the features of groundwater burial depth variation caused by precipitation icprecipitation to further discuss the efficiency of the ica wtc analysis method we compared it with the traditionally used correlation analysis which is more effective in determining the correlation between precipitation normalized data and ic1 ic3 than the correlation test using the mutual relationship number calculation table 2 shows a traditional lag correlation analysis with the precipitation and ic1 ic3 the correlation coefficient was maximum at the time lag of 85 175 d between 0 03 0 197 which does not reflect the correlation between precipitation and ics well according to grinsted et al 2004 the wtc coefficient can be defined as the correlation coefficient in a specific time frequency domain because the analysis method is different from the traditional correlation analysis extracting the wtc coefficient of the significant domain with significance levels exceeding 5 and comparing them with the whole time frequency domain s wtc coefficient it is possible to quantitatively analyze the specific significant time frequency domain s correlation compared to other parts the results in table 2 show that when the wtc coefficients in the whole time frequency domain were less than 0 5 the wtc coefficients in the significant domains were almost always greater than 0 8 which accurately implied the differences in the time frequency correlations in the significant domain compared to the whole domain moreover relevant studies also supported the method s reliability the time lag results are similar to the result of qi et al 2018 about the response relationship and time lag of precipitation and groundwater in the naoli river basin within this study area which also proved the effectiveness of the ica wtc method the above analysis in this chapter shows the advantages of the ica wtc method it can reflect the correlation in the time frequency domain by visualization comparing the correlation coefficients in the significant domain with the whole domain demonstrates the correlation in the significant time frequency domain the time lag results which exhibit a range of variation similar to the real situation also indicate the method s reliability in summary the wtc ica method makes the correlation analysis significance analysis and time lag analysis correspond to each other leading to a more comprehensive analysis which contributes to the study of the effect and response of precipitation on groundwater depth influence 4 3 icprecipitation response to large scale climatic patterns in this study it is considered four typical large scale climatic patterns teleconnection factors the multivariate enso index mei arctic oscillation ao west pacific wp and polar eurasia pattern pol the main locations of the four large scale climatic patterns are in the study area s south north east and west and all the influence range includes the study area which is part of northeastern china thus there is no doubt that there are effects of these large scale climatic patterns in the study area but it is difficult to quantitatively measure how these patterns affect groundwater through precipitation therefore after extracting icprecipitation from groundwater depth by ica wtc the time frequency relationship between icprecipitation and teleconnection factors can be obtained by using wtc it is possible to analyze how large scale climatic patterns affect groundwater depth through precipitation fig 6 shows the cwt spectra of the four teleconnection factors and the wtc spectra between them and three icprecipitation the figure indicated similar features and periods in the large scale climatic patterns could be observed from the icprecipitation extracted from the groundwater depth especially in the ic3 spectra the above analysis indicates that ic3 represents the groundwater depth response to the annual period and the long period of precipitation notably the y axis coordinates in fig 6 are different from those in fig 5 which need to be visually transformed to compare these two observations the continuous wavelet spectra in fig 6 i iv show that the mei representing enso has the strongest periods and power in the range of the study period the results for mei show that it has a significant time frequency domain over the study period of 4 32 months especially at long periods where the significant domain has a large extension which even extends to the coi this result indicates that the frequency of mei is mostly long period with reasonable assumptions even if input a longer mei time series the significant domain will develop in the long period the results also show that the significant period of mei from 6 to 28 months is mainly in the years 2008 2012 and the significance fades away if the time is extended forward and backward for ao wp and pol the cwt spectrum shows that they do not have continuous significant domains in the current time frequency domain these point to the conclusion that the enso pattern located in the southern hemisphere as the farthest large scale climatic pattern to the study area compared to other large scale climatic patterns closer to the study area has the strongest affect on the groundwater depth variation through precipitation in the study area however though ao wp and pol did not have continuous significant domains this result is also meaningful as the wavelet spectrum of ao indicates a period of approximately 32 months and the strong energy domain is not only located within the significant area but also indicates the potential for a longer period moreover the significant periods of mei ao wp and pol between 6 and 8 months dominate different periods of the study period i e mid 2009 to early 2011 early 2010 to late 2011 mid 2011 to late 2013 and mid 2013 to mid 2014 which indicates that the dominance of each climate model may change during the 10 year period figure 6 v xvi implicated the effects of the four climatic patterns on groundwater depths in the study area through precipitation ic1 has several significant correlation time frequency domains with mei reflected at approximately 8 16 and 32 months showing a multiplicative relationship between significant periods all of this occurred during the first half of the study period generally from early 2009 to later 2011 this result should not be a coincidence noting the high power gathering in the same time frequency domains of ic1 with ao wp and pol moreover ic1 contains precipitation features that are long periods for ic2 except for pol the wavelet coherence spectra do not have any obvious significant domain ic2 contains precipitation features that are annual periods the results for each teleconnection factor and ic3 are more intuitive and obvious wtc spectra exhibit significantly long periods of 32 months or longer and throughout the study period which is also consistent with the long period nature of the large scale climatic patterns this result also indicates that all large scale climatic patterns are linked to the long period features of groundwater influenced by precipitation in a time frequency manner which also implies that there must be long period effects of large scale climatic patterns on groundwater through precipitation dong et al 2015 zhu and zhang 2022 indicated that large scale climatic patterns affect groundwater mainly in a long period form analyzed together with ic3 and teleconnection factors results of the wtc spectra it suggests the mechanism of large scale climate patterns and their changes affect groundwater depth variation through precipitation accordingly the above analysis leads to the inference that there is a long period response of the large scale climatic pattern affecting groundwater through precipitation and a short period response of groundwater from the long period response attenuation to illustrate the opinion it could use mei with ic1 and ic3 wtc spectra there is a long period of time frequency response between all four climatic patterns and the precipitation features extracted from the groundwater depth across the study period results with ic1 and ic3 were particularly apparent for ic1 which contains the long period response features of groundwater depth from precipitation there are multiple short period significant domains that are multiplicatively related to the long period significant domain this phenomenon is most evident in the wtc spectrum with mei first we can determine that the annual period response with precipitation does not exist in ic1 this result indicates that the significant domain of the annual period in the cwt spectrum of ic1 is not from the annual period effect of precipitation but for another reason the results of the wtc analysis with mei provide a reasonable answer the short period response between ic1 and mei like the long period echo the long period information from climate is transmitted to groundwater through precipitation generating the long period response between precipitation and groundwater but it not make precipitation had a short response with ic1 because of the groundwater properties the external influences have extended and lagged long period effects leading to the overlapping of long period effects and forming short period responses in a certain duration which is expressed as a multiplicative relationship between ic1 and mei s significant domains ic3 contains both annual and long period response features of groundwater to precipitation and if the response of the short period feature between ic1 and mei is transmitted by precipitation then ic3 containing the annual period feature of precipitation should also be detected more commonly but the wtc spectrum shows that ic3 almost only has a long period response with climate patterns therefore the analysis between ic3 and each pattern is more intuitive to show how the large scale climatic pattern affects the groundwater depth variability from precipitation at long period scales this situation is particularly evident in the wtc spectra of mei with ic1 and ic3 therefore the analysis between ic3 and the patterns more intuitively shows that the influence of large scale climatic patterns on groundwater through precipitation is long period and this influence attenuates to short periods due to the groundwater properties 5 conclusion this study proposes a systematic method that integrates ica and wtc analysis demonstrating the superiority and accuracy of the method by analyzing the response of groundwater depths to precipitation influence in the study area by extracting ics from groundwater depths and using wtc to determine ics with precipitation features icprecipitation compared with traditional correlation analysis this method not only obtains time lags in the time domain similar to lag correlation analysis but also obtains time lag variations in the time frequency domain which can be analogous to the spatial and temporal variations between precipitation and groundwater depth moreover the correlations in the time frequency domain can be compared based on the fourier transform like frequency analysis the corresponding time domain information is obtained which further effectively obtains the multiple period response features and time lag relationships between groundwater depth and precipitation therefore the method provides a more comprehensive view of groundwater and external influence affects and responses to the time frequency relationship moreover the physical mechanisms of climate groundwater impacts and responses have been relatively ambiguous precipitation as the primary physical influence of groundwater affected by large scale climatic patterns and climate change could provide more essential reference information for research on the physical mechanisms of the impact and response between climate and groundwater through wtc analysis of icprecipitation extracted from the groundwater depth and teleconnection factors representing large scale climatic patterns in summary this study proposes a systematic method for studying the effects and responses of external influences on groundwater depth which could be used as a method for exploring time frequency information on the regional water cycle while also having the potential to be used as a method for exploring the physical mechanisms of interaction between large scale climatic patterns and regional groundwater resources similar to the common limitations present in current groundwater studies wang et al 2020 because the groundwater depth time series used in this paper is only 10 years this study can only detect a period of 1280 d compared to the decades long period present in climatic patterns but it does not affect the reliability of the information detected in this paper due to the cwt feature out of the cone of influence coi the gray area on both sides of the wavelet fig the pseudo effect range of the wavelet transform without pseudo effect the time frequency information is reliable and the significance test further demonstrates the reliability of this time and period information therefore the 10 year time series length does not affect the reliability of the already detected significant time frequency information which is also the basis for the paper s conclusions accuracy so it should be specified that the limitations talked about are mainly prospective for the next step of the study and this limitation will be addressed in future work as time progresses moreover there are numerous application prospects in future research based on the ica wtc method including the application to different types of groundwater depth prediction e g neural networks etc through ics with different external influence features extracted from groundwater depth data which will give a corresponding physical meaning to the prediction process moreover the analysis of the physical response mechanism between the change in the large scale climatic pattern and the groundwater system provides a quantitative analysis

2487,the desert riparian vegetation zone is an important part of the riparian ecosystem it is significant for river evolution and to channel beds owing to the reinforcement effect of the vegetation roots on the bank and resistance to erosion the quantitative effects on toe erosion and bank collapse were first investigated to determine how vegetation roots affect the continuous retreat process of riverbanks under different water levels the case study is the tarim river the degrees of riverbank stability at eight sampling sites during the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years were calculated using

erosion from 0 4 to 68 4 with peak effects during the dry season and recession stages b the presence of near bank vegetation roots can strongly influence bank collapse particularly during the recession stage when water level drops rapidly and c most of the calculated fs with the roots of all six plant species studied were higher than those without roots during four stages moreover it was greater than the critical value of 1 3 in most cases the results also indicate that banks with pe roots had the highest fs values by contrast banks with nt and gu roots had the smallest fs as the rar

stability of the desert riparian ecosystem naiman et al 1993 ervin et al 1998 davies and gibling 2011 riparian vegetation can increase bank strength and the stability of channel margins through mechanical hydrologic and hydraulic effects however several studies have suggested that vegetation may also decrease bank stability owing to increased infiltration rates and additional weight on banks

increasing rar yu et al 2020 wynn 2004 found that an increase in the volume of roots with diameters of 2 20 mm or the length of roots with diameters of 0 5 2 0 mm reduced soil erodibility therefore it is crucial to determine how vegetation affects the riverbank retreat process to understand how vegetation changes the riverbed morphology adjustment process this is essential for evaluating the impact of vegetation on stream morphology for effective stream and river management egger et al 2015 vargas luna et al 2019 direct fluvial erosion by near bank flows at the bank toe combined with bank collapse in response to geotechnical instability is responsible for riverbank retreat julian torres 2006 karmaker dutta 2015 however riverbank erosion is highly complex and is influenced by numerous factors at different spatiotemporal scales which should be predicted in terms of geotechnical slope stability or based on fluvial and gravitational forces that overcome the resisting forces of friction interlocking and cohesion amiri tokaldany et al 2003 midgley et al 2012 osman thorne 1988 partheniades 1965 simon et al 2000 thorne tovey 1981 laboratory experiments exploring the interaction between flow sediments and vegetation have confirmed that vegetation can control bank erosion channel width and river planform evolution van dijk et al 2013 in vegetated floodplains plants have a positive feedback on riverbank stability through their roots thereby reducing the frequency of bank failure gasser et al 2019 the strengthening effect of plant roots and the presence of fine sediments provide cohesion to the bank sediment which may affect bank erosion thorne 1990 considering the significance of plant roots in riverbank erosion all these factors should be considered in bank erosion models thus accurately predicting the effect of vegetation on the bank retreat process is challenging because of the complicated mechanisms of the interaction between vegetation roots and riverbank soil several models for simulating the effects of riparian vegetation on riverbank erosion have been developed in recent years despite limitations such as treating plants as rigid cylinders vargas luna et al 2015 2016 giadrossich et al 2017 pollen and simon 2005 the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem proposed by the usda ars national sedimentation laboratory considers the impact of bank toe erosion usda 2016 and different compositions of bank soil and vegetation coverage on bank stability this model has been widely used to simulate the process of bank collapse in recent years zong et al 2017 simon et al 2000 2009 many researchers have demonstrated that bstem can effectively predict bank retreat processes associated with multilayered riverbanks in different river systems particularly the effect of riparian vegetation on stream bank stability daly et al 2015 gran et al 2015 li et al 2016 stover et al 2018 yu et al 2020 used bstem to quantitatively estimate the effects of different root conditions on channel bank strength they confirmed that roots provide effective reinforcement to unconsolidated banks control bank erosion and enhance bank stability however the above studies only analyzed the effects of three vegetation roots populus euphratica pe tamarix ramosissima tr and phragmites australis pa on riverbank stability these studies did not involve more dominant vegetation roots alhagi sparsifolia as nitraria tangutorum nt and glycyrrhiza uralensis gu or their quantitative effects on riverbank erosion processes under different water levels e g dry season level rising stage flood season and recession stage therefore quantifying and predicting the bank retreat process associated with vegetation and their effect on slope stability remain a challenge particularly because of their process effects e g root influence on the riverbank retreat process under different water levels in a hydrological year additionally field studies focused on investigating the influence of vegetation on stream bank behavior are also limited accounting for both different hydrological processes and vegetation species and less specifically for sandy soils the typical soil type in the tarim river this study aims to quantify the quantitative influence of vegetation roots on the continuous retreat process of riverbanks with predominantly noncohesive sediment material this study used the bstem 5 4 to predict the effect of riparian vegetation roots on the riverbank retreat process under different hydrological processes and desert vegetation species krzeminska et al 2019 to comprehensively evaluate the effect of vegetation roots on bank stability eight sections with six dominant riparian vegetation species were selected as the study region because of severe bank erosion and the significance of vegetation roots the bank retreat processes at eight typical sections over a 2 year period were simulated using the bstem based on the interpolated hydrological data measured cross sectional profile and effect of vegetation roots on riverbank soil erosion parameters critical shear stress and erodibility coefficient and shear strength cohesive taking the bank of one sampling site as an example the quantitative effects of vegetation species and rar on bank stability were also analyzed based on the calculated results of the bank stability fs and collapse process for the roots of six vegetation species with different rars 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tarim river 39 28 n 88 19 e is the longest inland river in china and is located at the northern edge of the tarim basin in southern xinjiang its mainstream length and basin area is 1321 km and 17 600 km2 respectively the tarim river is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches according to their geographic environmental and hydrological characteristics the upper reach is 495 km from xiaojiake at the confluence of the three rivers to yingbaza ybz the middle reach is 398 km from ybz to qiala ql and the lower reach is 428 km from ql to taitema lake yu et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 there are five hydrometric stations along the mainstream alaer al xinqiman xqm ybz wusiman wsm and ql the al station is a control station for the upper stream because it records the characteristics of water and sediment representing the hydrological conditions entering the tarim river chen et al 2009 the upper and middle parts of the upper reach of the tarim river main stream from al to qumaogejin qmgj are meandering or transitional river channels with large swings and frequent changes in the river regime the lower part of the upper reach and the middle and lower reaches are meander channels reaching below qmgj the river regime is relatively stable however the riverbank is primarily composed of sandy soil causing the riverbank to easily be scoured and retreated in addition the river regime is changed continuously during river swings riverbed scour and riverbank erosion cause the riverbank to collapse and retreat field surveys of riverbank erosion in the tarim river show that the collapsed sandy soil block would be broken down by the flow without the influence of vegetation plant roots simultaneously the failed block would be deposited temporarily in the basal zone owing to the influence of plant roots and soil forming root soil composites as shown in fig 2 a and b however the majority of root soil composites can be easily disintegrated under fluvial flow therefore a failed block with roots may influence the rate of bank erosion this will be considered in the roots affecting soil erosion parameters but cannot prevent bank failure in the tarim river also found in the jingjiang reach of the yangtze river zong et al 2017 2 2 field sampling and measurements field surveys were conducted in may 22 25 2016 and april 24 27 2017 to analyze the composition and mechanical properties of riverbank soils these surveys included investigations of soil types root distribution cross sectional profiles hydraulic conditions and sediment conditions a stratified sampling method was used for all riverbank soil layers according to the differences in soil composition and physical properties laboratory results yielded a series of indicators including soil specific gravity limiting water content soil density water content and shear strength with and without roots under undisturbed conditions these soil and composition properties were determined using the geotechnical test method nhri 1999a and procedure nhri 1999b fig 2 c and d show the vertical stratification structure of the riverbank soil composition at site ii alar new bridge and site vi shaya bridge the riverbank soil was composed of silty and loose soil structures primarily comprising silty sand and fine grained soil sand according to the results of layered sampling the soil layer near site ii was mainly composed of silty sand ss sand with fine grained soil sf and poorly graded sand sp the fine grained soil particle size less than 0 075 mm contents were 52 3 32 8 and 3 3 as shown in appendix a with thicknesses at 0 3 m 0 6 m and 2 3 m respectively the riverbank soil near site vi was primarily composed of ss and sf with fine grained soil contents of 21 5 and 6 3 and thicknesses of 0 60 m and 0 3 m respectively therefore the riverbank soil of the tarim river mainstream is sandy soil primarily composed of ss and sf the field investigations showed that the natural forest in the tarim river mainstream is dominated by pe shrubs are mainly tr as and nt and herbs are dominated by pa gu among others six typical riparian plant root samplings were conducted in may 2016 and april 2017 along the tarim river mainstream table 1 a total of 28 soil samples were obtained of which 17 were root soil composites at each sampling site two types of soil samples root soil composite and soil without roots were obtained with a cylindrical iron sampling barrel with a diameter of 0 11 m and height of 0 15 m for comparison experiments root samples were also taken from the root soil composite in the laboratory to determine root parameters root length diameter and rar rar was computed as a r a where a r is the total cross sectional area of all roots in the composite and a is the area of the root soil composite to effectively compare the effects of the six plant species in terms of bank stability enhancement sampling sites were chosen on a channel with a single plant species or two dominant species site i was dominated by as sites ii and vii by tr site iii by pa and as site iv by tr and gu site v by pa and sites vi and viii by pe and pa table 2 the roots were largely composed of very fine roots all roots were less than 10 mm in diameter except for gu at site iv soil erodibility was most significantly influenced by fine roots kamyab swanson 1990 particle size distribution was tested using a standard method of analysis by sieving the mean median diameter ranged from 0 08 mm to 0 13 mm for ss 0 12 mm to 0 14 mm for sf and 0 14 mm to 0 32 mm for sp as shown in appendix a the shear strength of the root soil composite was measured using a strain controlled direct shearapparatus shearing speed 0 01 2 4 mm min 1 under the conditions of normal stress of 100 kpa 200 kpa 300 kpa and 400 kpa the same horizontal shear force was applied to the root soil composite sample and the direct shear test was performed as roots have little effect on the internal friction angle of soils operstein and frydman 2000 tron et al 2015 the effect of the roots on the soil shear strength can be considered as follows 1 δ τ τ r τ 0 σ t a n φ c r c 0 σ t a n φ δ c where δ τ is the additional shear strength provided by the roots kpa τ r is the shear strength of the root soil composite kpa τ 0 is the soil shear strength kpa σ is the positive stress on the shear plane kpa φ is the internal friction angle of the root soil composite or soil c r is the cohesion of the root soil composite kpa c 0 is the soil cohesion kpa and δ c is the additional cohesion provided by the roots kpa additionally regardless of the effect of the roots on the internal friction angle of the soil wu et al 1979 found that δ c can be calculated as follows 2 δ c t r a r a s i n θ c o s θ t a n φ t r r a r s i n θ c o s θ t a n φ where t r is the tensile strength per unit area of the roots kpa a r is the total cross sectional area of all roots m2 a is the area of soil in the sample m2 rar is the root density and θ is the relative vertical deviation angle of roots subjected to shear deformation in eq 2 the values of s i n θ c o s θ t a n φ were determined to be 1 0 1 3 with a mean of 1 2 wu et al 1979 root tensile strength is primarily influenced by plant species and root diameter and has been shown to decrease with increasing root diameter by many experimental results nilaweera and nutalaya 1999 mattia et al 2005 norris 2005 tosi 2007 yu et al 2020 the tensile strength t r was measured using an lwk 500 microcomputer controlled electronic tensile testing machine with 0 5 measuring accuracy tensile tests were conducted on roots from different vegetation types and the data were recorded moreover a tensile force was applied at a fixed rate 0 25 mm min 1 on a single root giadrossich et al 2017 the quantitative relationship between t r and the diameter d can be expressed by the following power function 3 t r k d b where k and b are empirical constants that depend on the plant species the values of k and b for different plant species can be found in feng et al 2019 the correlation coefficient r2 was not high at 0 47 0 55 which will cause the calculated result of the additional cohesive provided by the roots using eq 2 to be relatively large as the bank vegetation and protection submodel in the bstem can optionally input the number of added cohesiveness due to roots or input the own data of permissible shear stress pollen bankhead and simon 2009 the measured additional cohesive values were used in the calculation process this is based on the premise that the effect of the roots on the internal friction angle is not considered however the effect of the roots on the internal friction angle cannot be ignored in some cases sites iv tr vi pe viii pa and viii nt therefore the measured values of the cohesive and internal friction angles provided by the roots were input into the bank material submodel of the bstem 2 3 calculation of soil erosion parameters influenced by roots to accurately assess the riverbank and toe erosion of the tarim river bank with and without riparian plant roots the critical shear stress τ c and erodibility coefficient k d were determined from previous studies existing field surveys conducted in the tarim river indicate that bank soil is primarily composed of unconsolidated soil yu et al 2020 an empirical formula proposed by hanson and simon 2001 was used to calculate the critical shear stress of bank soil in the bstem when the mean media diameter d 50 was less than 2 0 mm 4 τ c 0 044 16 2 d 50 where d 50 is the mean media diameter mm and τ c is the critical shear stress n m 2 as shown in appendix a the critical shear stress calculated using eq 4 ranged 0 057 0 228 n m 2 and d 50 ranged 0 08 0 32 mm for the bank soil in the tarim river these results differed from the results calculated by yu et al 2020 with τ c ranging 0 008 0 088 n m 2 owing to the difference in sampled soil particle size an empirical model developed by arulanandan et al 1980 was used to determine the erodibility coefficient 5 k d 0 1 τ c 0 5 where k d is the erodibility coefficient cm3 n s 1 the calculated result of the erodibility coefficient using equation 5 ranged 0 209 0 419 cm3 n s 1 for the noncohesive bank soil by contrast yu et al 2020 had results ranging 0 336 1 087 cm3 n s 1 the results differed primarily because of the sampled soil particle size according to laboratory flume results the critical shear stress with roots is higher than that of the non vegetated flow and the erodibility coefficient is lower watanabe et al 2002 kothyari et al 2009 as there were no in situ results of desert riparian plant roots on bank soil erodibility in the tarim river the critical shear stress τ c and erodibility coefficient k d were estimated to a particular time of the values without riparian plant roots based on the experimental results the measured critical shear stress of the tr roots ranged 1 35 1 60 times that without roots 1 32 1 57 times for pe and 1 27 1 53 times for pa therefore the critical shear stress affected by roots is typically 1 50 times that of no roots regardless of the difference for different riparian plants the measured erodibility coefficient of tr roots ranged 0 62 0 74 times that of no roots 0 67 0 76 times for pe and 0 69 0 78 times for pa therefore the erodibility coefficient affected by roots is typically 0 70 times that of no roots thus it is estimated that the critical shear stress τ c and erodibility coefficient k d influenced by roots were 1 5 and 0 7 times the values without roots respectively 2 4 bank geometry the bank height and slope were obtained by combining field samples and channel topography measured from the stations along the meandering reaches for example the right bank profile at site ii measured in october 2016 see fig 3 a was taken as the initial boundary according to this profile the bank full level was 1006 7 m at site ii with a corresponding top level of 1006 4 m and 1005 8 m for the ss and sp soil layers respectively based on the method by zong et al 2017 the elevation of the bank toe was calculated as 1004 7 m thus the slope below it was considered part of the riverbed based on soil type and the bstem the riverbank was divided into five distinct soil layers taking site ii as an example the corresponding descriptions and geotechnical properties of the different layers are shown in fig 3a thus different types of soils can be used as separate soil layers the no 1 and 2 layers were the ss and sf soils with heights of 0 3 m and 0 6 m respectively the no 3 4 and 5 layers were sp soil with a height of 2 3 m the soil with a height of 2 0 m is located below the average water stage during the dry season and can be divided into two or three layers depending on the location of the water table for example if the water table is 1005 5 m the no 3 layer is the sp soil with a height of 0 3 m and the no 4 and 5 layers are the sp soils both with a height of 1 0 m if the water table is at the interface between sf and sp layers 3 4 and 5 are sp soil with height of 0 76 m 0 77 m and 0 77 m respectively furthermore because of the high permeability of sandy soil it was assumed that there was no lag in the water table that is the elevation of the water table at different flow levels and moments was consistent with that of the water level yu et al 2020 as the riverbank along the tarim river mainstream is mainly composed of relatively uniform silty sand and fine sand the bank at each site was divided into five layers the first or the first to second layers were set above a constant water level appendix b lists the stratification and mechanical properties of bank soils as the soil below the water table was considered saturated the mechanical parameters of saturated soil were used for the soil layer below the water table for different vegetation species and corresponding different root rars the mechanical parameters of the root soil composite including the cohesive c and internal friction angle φ were also used for the soil layer influenced by the roots 2 5 hydrological data the average flow discharge of the tarim river mainstream is primarily concentrated from june to september reaches its maximum in august and typically has minimum values in april may and november the distribution of the flow discharge during the hydrological year was relatively concentrated according to the measured data from the alar hydrological station the largest flood flow occurred in 1999 with a peak flow of 2280 m3 s 1 august 5 this was close to the return period of the 20 year flood flow of 2200 m3 s 1 and less than the return period of the 50 year flood flow of 2530 m3 s 1 fig 4 shows the average monthly flow discharge for many years and for one year from 1999 to 2017 at the alar hydrological station for alar hydrological station the flow from june to september accounted for 80 2 82 41 from 2010 to 2017 of the whole year from 1999 to 2009 of which august accounted for 38 0 38 6 from 2010 to 2017 the peak monthly flow discharge in 2009 was the smallest with 144 0 m3 s 1 in august and the peak in 2010 was the largest with 1110 0 m3 s 1 from 1999 to 2017 in this study the riverbank erosion process influenced by roots was modeled for two consecutive hydrological years 2016 and 2017 for each stage the water level hydrographs at sites i viii were approximated by a series of stepped hydrographs with constant levels fig 5 shows the generalized water stage at site ii for the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years as shown in the figure the water stage hydrographs were generalized to 10 and 11 time intervals in 2016 and 2017 respectively the periodic changes in bank failure in a hydrological year can be divided into four stages dry season level rising stage flood season and recession stage xia et al 2014 therefore based on the interpolated hydrographs at site ii a water level hydrograph over a hydrological year can be divided into four different stages the dry season december 16 to april 15 level rising stage april 16 to june 15 flood season june 16 to august 31 and recession stage september 1 to december 15 the hydrological data at sites i viii can be interpolated using the measured data from two hydrometric stations and neighboring water gauge stations for example water levels ranged 1005 20 1006 62 m in 2016 and 1005 10 1006 90 m in 2017 at site ii during the dry season in fig 5 the water levels were relatively low averaging 1005 46 m in 2016 and 1005 33 in 2017 owing to the low mean discharges of 38 31 m3 s 1 in 2016 and 32 27 m3 s 1 in 2017 the maximum water level increased to 1006 62 m with a high mean discharge of 578 34 m3 s 1 in 2016 1006 90 m and 634 91 m3 s 1 in 2017 during the flood season during the recession stage the water levels decreased to an average of 1005 32 m in 2016 and 1005 47 m in 2017 2 6 numerical simulation the bank stability model of the bstem combines three limit equilibrium method models that calculate the fs for multilayer streambanks these models primarily simulate planar and cantilever failures of undercut bank types that generally occur at riverbanks composed of cohesive soil the riverbank in the study reach is mainly composed of sandy soil consisting of silty sand and fine grained soil sand however the soil still has a certain degree of cohesion the cohesion value of each soil layer is non zero appendix b this fully demonstrates that the bstem can be used for the bank stability calculation of the tarim river the bstem was also applied to calculate the bank stability of the tarim river in yu et al 2020 the mechanical effects of bank top vegetation on bank stability can be simulated using a root reinforcement model in the bstem simon et al 2011 in this study the effect of riparian plant roots on riverbank stability in the tarim river was simulated using the bstem the collapsed sandy soil block would be broken down by the flow immediately and there was no lag in the water table because of the high permeability of bank soils primarily silty and fine sands yu et al 2020 therefore the elevation of the water table during different flow events was consistent with that of the water level when the flow events were simulated using the bstem if the fs was greater than 1 3 the bank was considered stable if the fs was less than 1 0 the bank was considered unstable if the fs was between 1 0 and 1 3 the bank was also considered unstable because bank failure is likely to occur in this condition fig 3b 3 results 3 1 root soil composite mechanical properties and shear characteristics table 1 lists the physical and mechanical properties of the eight sampling sites the measured water content of the undisturbed soil of the upper ss ranged 24 42 32 06 with a dry density ranging 1 37 1 48 103 kg m 3 this demonstrates that the upper soil is a loose soil structure the water content of sf ranged 24 11 30 21 with a dry density ranging 1 37 1 46 103 kg m 3 the dry density of sp ranged 1 42 1 54 103 kg m 3 slightly larger than the other two types of soils with the water content ranging 26 81 30 43 therefore the riverbank soil in the tarim river reach is relatively loose owing to its sandy structure fig 6 shows the relationship between the shear strength and normal stress under different riparian plant roots and rars according to the experimental results the cohesion of the composite increased with increasing rar for the same plant root and soil for example when the rar of as increased from 0 00 to 1 72 at site iii the cohesion increased from 9 64 kpa to 19 73 kpa an increase of 104 7 when the rar of tr at site ii increased from 0 00 to 0 99 the cohesion increased from 8 55 kpa to 25 26 kpa increase of 195 4 when the rar of pa at site v increased from 0 00 to 1 25 the cohesion increased from 7 07 kpa to 28 55 kpa an increase of 303 8 fig 7 shows the relationship between the root tensile strength and the diameter of the six desert plant species in the tarim river the figure shows that the root tensile strength t r primarily decreases with increasing root diameter the t r of nt exceeded that of other plant species under the same root diameter and the t r of pa had the smallest value the order according to the t r value was nt tr gu pe as pa 3 2 effect of plant roots on toe erosion toe erosion was calculated using the toe erosion model in the bstem the eroded area maximum lateral retreat and average applied boundary shear stress were obtained before running the bank stability model to calculate the riverbank stability the toe erosion model was first run to calculate toe erosion the flow duration was set as the actual action time of the water flow in fig 5 subsequently the new eroded profile after toe erosion was exported into the model as the initial shape in the next step of the bank stability calculation when calculating toe erosion the effective stress acting on each grain was considered and the average value of the manning s roughness coefficient ranged 0 02 0 03 in bstem the duration of flow for each event in appendix c was calculated in hours according to the actual duration time of the water flow in fig 5 the reach slope was calculated based on the water level difference from upstream to downstream of the sections the toe erosion and bank stability at each water level of the eight sections in 2016 and 2017 were analyzed appendix c shows the toe erosion and bank stability results for site ii in 2016 and 2017 it shows that the total amount of lateral erosion and collapsed soil at site ii was 1487 5 m3 100 m in two consecutive hydrological years without vegetation roots with tr roots with rar 0 21 and rar 0 99 the collapsed soil was 1364 7 m3 100 m and 1308 5 m3 100 m respectively this demonstrates the protective effect of vegetation roots against toe erosion furthermore the results demonstrate that riparian plant roots may increase the roughness of near bank flow and prevent toe erosion because of the mechanical reinforcement derived from root networks pollen bankhead and simon 2009 without vegetation roots the toe erosion volume and bank collapse accounted for 95 9 and 4 1 of the total volume respectively when vegetation roots tr at site ii were used the amount of toe erosion accounted for 96 7 and 97 7 of the total volume for rar 0 21 and rar 0 99 respectively this also shows that vegetation roots can more effectively reduce bank collapse it should be noted that the calculated bank toe erosion width and failure width in appendix c are the lateral maximum retreat and the lateral maximum value of the collapsed soil in the toe model output and bank model output of the bstem thus a large bank toe erosion width or bank failure width may correspond to a small bank toe erosion volume or bank failure volume for example the calculated total bank toe erosion width 9 26 m and total bank retreat width 13 65 m in the condition with rar 0 21 were larger those 9 01 m and 12 29 m in the condition with rar 0 to avoid such a contradiction in the conclusion that vegetation roots can more effectively reduce bank collapse considering the width the bank toe erosion width was replaced with the average erosion width calculated from the volume in two consecutive hydrological years accordingly the calculated average toe erosion widths were 5 92 m 5 44 m and 5 19 m for rar 0 0 rar 0 21 and rar 0 99 respectively therefore the total volume of toe erosion decreases with an increase in rar and the corresponding average toe erosion width also decreases this proves that the roots can effectively reduce bank erosion simultaneously the soil erosion parameters the critical shear stress and erodibility coefficient with different rars did not change because of the lack of corresponding test results the volume of toe erosion for different rars was the same unless the bank profile changed owing to bank collapse fig 8 shows the toe erosion volume at eight sites with and without roots based on the bstem simulations for two consecutive hydrological years the figure shows that the amount of toe erosion was relatively the same for different rars except for tr at site ii gu at site iv and pa at site v where the bank profile changed owing to bank collapse because the dry season is long 122 days per year at site ii there is still a certain toe erosion during the dry season accounting for an average of 20 0 with different rars 23 0 without roots of the total erosion at site ii however the amount of toe erosion was still the largest during the flood season accounting for an average of 54 1 55 9 without roots and only 16 0 and 9 8 during the level rising and recession stages respectively 14 0 and 7 1 without roots furthermore different vegetation species also have different effects on toe erosion for each water stage fig 9 shows the effect of the roots of different vegetation species on toe erosion reduction during different water stages in the 2016 hydrological years compared with no roots the effect of roots can reduce toe erosion from 2 4 tr to 63 2 nt in the dry season 0 5 pa to 60 1 nt in the level rising stage 2 1 pa to 48 7 nt during the flood season and 1 9 gu to 67 0 nt during the recession stage in general the roots had the most significant impact on toe erosion during the dry and recession stages therefore it can be concluded that vegetation roots can prevent toe erosion during the dry and recession stages among the six vegetation roots studied the nt roots had the largest reinforcing effect on toe erosion followed by the tr as pe pa and gu roots consistent with previous results of root effects on shear and tensile strength notably when the bank profile changes significantly owing to bank failure the effect of roots in reducing toe erosion cannot be compared with that without roots because the initial bank profile of toe erosion has changed for example in appendix c because of bank failure during the last water level event 10 in 2016 it was not possible to compare the effect of the roots on reducing toe erosion from the first water level event 1 in 2017 therefore only the comparison results before bank failure 2016 hydrological year are shown in fig 9 3 3 effect of plant roots on bank collapse the bank collapse widths and corresponding number of bank failure events were obtained from eight sites with and without six vegetation species during different water level periods the calculated results show that there were no bank collapses in the first three water level periods dry season level rising stage and flood season of 2016 and two intermediate periods level rising stage and flood season of 2017 these can also be seen in the bank failure results of site ii in appendix c therefore the bank failure events primarily occurred during the recession stage and dry season of the next hydrological year fig 10 shows the comparison of the widths and number of failure events between the roots of the six vegetation species during the recession stage and dry season the figure shows that the total failure widths in 2016 and 2017 without roots were from 1 12 pa at site v to 1 84 gu at site iv times larger than that with roots bank failure widths with roots were smaller than those without roots there were five events corresponding to the failure width of zero with roots as at site iii tr at site iv gu at site iv pe and nt at site viii the total failure widths without roots were 1 95 m 2 95 m 2 95 m 3 02 m and 3 02 m respectively during the two consecutive hydrological years significant bank collapses occurred during the recession stages in 2016 and 2017 twenty four bank failure events occurred at eight typical sites in the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years 17 events occurred during the recession stages and seven events occurred in the dry season of 2017 during the recession stages of 2016 and 2017 there were only six bank failure events with vegetation roots compared with 11 events without roots during the dry season of 2017 there were four bank failure events with roots compared with three events without roots therefore the presence of near bank plant roots can strongly influence bank collapse particularly during the recession stage when the water level drops rapidly riverbank soils and riparian vegetation can form high strength root soil composites consequently the flow velocity and fluvial erosion rate are slowed by the increased roughness and root networks 3 4 effects of plant roots on riverbank stability degrees during different stages the stability degrees of the riverbank at eight typical sites during the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years were calculated with and without plant roots using the bstem a total of 168 model runs were conducted to simulate the bank collapse process of a 100 meter long reach at eight sampling sites in two consecutive hydrological years with and without plant roots fig 11 shows the calculation results of the safety factor of bank satiability at site ii during different stages the bank stability degrees at site ii during the different stages are discussed as follows ① during the dry season the water levels changed slightly in the tarim river mainstream because the incoming discharges were relatively small and stable for example the near bank flow shear stress at site ii was relatively small τ f 0 09 0 14 n m 2 however it was still greater than the critical shear stress of the silty sand soil τ c 0 06 n m 2 therefore there is a particular amount of erosion in the lower soil layer of the riverbank the calculated unit length toe erosion volumes were 2 55 m3 m 1 and 2 79 m3 m 1 for rar 0 99 and rar 0 21 3 42 m3 m 1 without roots respectively during the dry season of 2016 the calculated bank stability fs with tr roots reached more than 10 0 the fs values without vegetation cover were lower than those in scenarios with vegetation but still much higher than the critical value of 1 3 fig 11 however the fs was 1 0 1 4 in the dry season of 2017 furthermore there are three bank failure events under the conditions of no roots tr roots with rar 0 21 and rar 0 99 this was because the bank toe has been scoured by the flow in the 2016 hydrological year the bank profile was unstable and failure occurred in this stage or the previous stage the recession stage of 2016 at this stage the roots had an apparent impact on toe erosion and bank stability where fs with roots are higher than those without roots and vegetation roots can prevent toe erosion and maintain bank stability ② during the level rising stage before the flood season the near bank flow shear stress increased τf 0 09 0 16 n m 2 owing to high discharges and higher water stages compared with the dry season the stability of the riverbank with and without tr roots decreased except that the fs without roots increased owing to the bank collapse in the dry season of 2017 however it was still greater than 1 3 owing to the rising water stage bank failure did not occur during this stage because of the relatively low intensity of bank erosion the roots may further improve the riverbank stability the fs values with roots are higher than that without roots increasing by 14 8 and 6 6 times in 2016 and 2017 respectively ③ during the flood season the peak discharge was large with high water stages lasting for a long period the mean discharge at site ii was 578 34 m3 s 1 and 634 91 m3 s 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively during this stage the maximum shear stress reached 0 53 n m 2 which was substantially greater than the critical shear stress of the lower sandy soil significant basal erosion occurred with the bank toe erosion volumes of 7 21 m3 m 1 and 7 31 m3 m 1 8 32 m3 m 1 without roots for rar 0 99 and rar 0 21 respectively the calculated fs with rar 0 99 dropped sharply by 1 6 1 4 with rar 0 21 and without tr after a rapid rise to a maximum value of 66 2 35 0 with rar 0 21 and 17 4 without tr during the flood season of 2016 the same change in fs was observed in the flood season of the 2017 hydrological year in general most fs values with tr roots during this stage were higher than those without roots with a critical value of 1 3 therefore no bank failures occurred during this stage in 2016 and 2017 the roots further improved the riverbank stability and the fs with rar 0 99 was up to 4 2 times higher than that without roots ④ during the recession stage the in channel water level decreased significantly the soil shear strength decreased owing to the long term submergence of riverbank soil resulting in bank failure as shown in fig 11 there was one bank failure event with tr roots and one without tr roots during the recession stage in 2016 at site ii therefore the intensity of the bank failure was severe during this stage because of the lower water level during the recession stage of 2017 there was no failure and the fs values with tr were higher than those without it up to 2 4 times higher than that without roots in general most of the calculated fs values with roots of all six studied plant species were higher than those without roots during the four different stages moreover it was greater than the critical value of 1 3 in most cases although different vegetation roots show different effects on the fs of riverbank stability the same influence law on riverbank stability during different stages also exists in the other five vegetation species including as pe gu pa and nt at the other seven sampling sites 4 discussion 4 1 effects of vegetation species on riverbank stability to analyze the effects of vegetation species on riverbank stability the right bank profile at site ii measured in october 2016 see fig 3 was taken as the initial shape boundary and the 2016 hydrological year was used as the water level calculation process the bank stability fs and collapse process for the roots of six vegetation species with different rars were calculated fig 12 shows the mean fs of different vegetation species during four stages under essentially the same rar the figure shows that the mean fs with roots was greater than that without roots at each water level however different vegetation roots under different water levels showed different effects on the riverbank stability fs during the dry season the order of the mean fs corresponding to the different vegetation roots was tr pe pa gu as nt during the flood season the order of the mean fs influenced by different vegetation roots was pe pa tr gu as nt during the level rising and recession stages tr and pe had the highest degree of enhancement on bank stability however the corresponding fs of tr was lower because of bank collapse during the recession stage whereas pa and gu had the smallest mean fs from the average fs for the whole hydrological year the mean fs with pe was the largest 34 68 followed by tr 28 22 pa 19 57 and as 20 25 the fs with nt 18 66 and gu 15 96 were the smallest compared with the results calculated by yu et al 2020 the fs of pa roots was the largest followed by the pe and tr roots different from the results of this study this is because of the difference in riverbank heights the banks with pa roots were shorter 2 3 m in height in the study by yu et al 2020 than the bank in this study 3 2 m furthermore the banks with pe and tr roots were 3 4 m high according to yu et al 2020 similar to the calculated height 3 2 m and order pe tr in this study 4 2 effects of root density rar on riverbank stability mean rar at eight sites for different vegetation species including grass shrubs and trees was determined the rars of riverbank with pa and gu were 0 49 1 25 and 1 40 1 45 with mean values of 0 77 and 1 43 respectively the rars with as and nt were 0 12 1 72 mean value 0 87 and 0 91 respectively the values for tr and pe were 0 10 1 43 mean value 0 55 and 0 92 1 27 mean value 1 07 fig 13 shows the relationship between the rar and δc for different vegetation species the figure shows that the δc of the four species of riparian plants increased with increasing rar within a certain range the δc of tr and as increased at the highest and lowest rate with increasing rar respectively consistent with the results of yu et al 2020 as the δc of the roots increased with increasing rar the bank stability fs should also increase with increasing rar as shown in fig 14 the figure shows that the mean fs of a hydrological year increased linearly with increasing rar for each vegetation species however the increasing rates are different pe had the highest rate of increase followed by tr and pa and as additionally the trend lines of the four vegetation species in the figure intersect at different rars when the rar was greater than the critical value of 0 9 the order of the rate of increase in fs for four vegetation species was as follows pe tr as pa notably although the δc and fs generally increased with increasing rar the variations in these two parameters did not match well given the large variability in root density found in this and other studies future studies should include many root samples taken at the bank face results based on a few samples or limited areas may be misleading and may not be applicable beyond a localized environment the results of this study also illustrate the order of fs for different vegetation species to enhance the bank stability under a particular range of rar 0 9 rar less than 1 8 in the order pe tr nt as pa gu 5 conclusions this study investigated the quantitative effects of desert vegetation roots on toe erosion and bank collapse moreover the degrees of riverbank stability during different stages at eight typical sites in the tarim river mainstream were calculated using the bstem the effects of vegetation species and the rar on riverbank stability were quantified by combining field measurements with the bstem the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the results of this study suggest that desert vegetation plays a major role in regulating stream bank soil strength by providing additional cohesive reinforcement and reducing toe erosion and bank collapse in the tarim river region compared with no roots the effect of different vegetation roots can reduce toe erosion from 0 4 to 68 4 the superiority of preventing toe erosion can be exhibited during the dry season and the recession stage therefore near bank vegetation roots can strongly influence bank collapse especially during the recession stage when the water level drops rapidly 2 the stability degrees of the riverbank at eight typical sites during the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years were calculated with and without plant roots using the bstem most of the calculated fs with roots of all six studied plant species were higher than those without roots during the four different stages moreover it was greater than the critical value of 1 3 in most cases despite different vegetation roots showing different degrees of effect on the riverbank stability fs 3 based on the calculated results of the bank stability fs and collapse process under six vegetation species roots with different rars the effects of vegetation species on riverbank stability were analyzed banks with pe roots had the highest fs values the fs of tr root bearing banks were slightly higher than those of the pa and as root bearing banks and the fs values of nt and gu were the smallest 4 in this study an analysis was performed to determine the quantitative effect of rar on the degree of bank stability the calculated results of the fs indicated that the fs values of a hydrological year increased linearly with increasing rar for each vegetation species the fs of different vegetation species increased at different rates with an increase in rar the order of the rate of increase for six vegetation species was as follows pe tr nt as pa gu with rar greater than the critical value of 0 9 credit authorship contribution statement quanli zong conceptualization data curation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

2487,the desert riparian vegetation zone is an important part of the riparian ecosystem it is significant for river evolution and to channel beds owing to the reinforcement effect of the vegetation roots on the bank and resistance to erosion the quantitative effects on toe erosion and bank collapse were first investigated to determine how vegetation roots affect the continuous retreat process of riverbanks under different water levels the case study is the tarim river the degrees of riverbank stability at eight sampling sites during the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years were calculated using the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem furthermore the effects of six vegetation species populus euphratica pe tamarix ramosissima tr alhagi sparsifolia as nitraria tangutorum nt phragmites australis pa and glycyrrhiza uralensis gu on riverbank stability were discussed taking the right bank of sampling site ii alar new bridge as an example the bank stability safety factor fs and collapse process under the roots of six vegetation species with different root area ratios rars were calculated the following conclusions were drawn from the results a different vegetation roots can reduce toe erosion from 0 4 to 68 4 with peak effects during the dry season and recession stages b the presence of near bank vegetation roots can strongly influence bank collapse particularly during the recession stage when water level drops rapidly and c most of the calculated fs with the roots of all six plant species studied were higher than those without roots during four stages moreover it was greater than the critical value of 1 3 in most cases the results also indicate that banks with pe roots had the highest fs values by contrast banks with nt and gu roots had the smallest fs as the rar increased the fs values in a hydrological year increased linearly for each vegetation specie the rate of increase order was as follows pe tr nt as pa gu under a particular range of rar 0 9 rar 1 8

vegetation zone is an essential part of the river corridor it is an important blocking force that prevents riverbank erosion and wind sand hazards preventing these is a necessary prerequisite for the stability of the desert riparian ecosystem naiman et al 1993 ervin et al 1998 davies and gibling 2011 riparian vegetation can increase bank strength and the stability of channel margins through mechanical hydrologic and hydraulic effects however several studies have suggested that vegetation may also decrease bank stability owing to increased infiltration rates and additional weight on banks

increasing rar yu et al 2020 wynn 2004 found that an increase in the volume of roots with diameters of 2 20 mm or the length of roots with diameters of 0 5 2 0 mm reduced soil erodibility therefore it is crucial to determine how vegetation affects the riverbank retreat process to understand how vegetation changes the riverbed morphology adjustment process this is essential for evaluating the impact of vegetation on stream morphology for effective stream and river management egger et al 2015 vargas luna et al 2019 direct fluvial erosion by near bank flows at the bank toe combined with bank collapse in response to geotechnical instability is responsible for riverbank retreat julian torres 2006 karmaker dutta 2015 however riverbank erosion is highly complex and is influenced by numerous factors at different spatiotemporal scales which should be predicted in terms of geotechnical slope stability or based on fluvial and gravitational forces that overcome the resisting forces of friction interlocking and cohesion amiri tokaldany et al 2003 midgley et al 2012 osman thorne 1988 partheniades 1965 simon et al 2000 thorne tovey 1981 laboratory experiments exploring the interaction between flow sediments and vegetation have confirmed that vegetation can control bank erosion channel width and river planform evolution van dijk et al 2013 in vegetated floodplains plants have a positive feedback on riverbank stability through their roots thereby reducing the frequency of bank failure gasser et al 2019 the strengthening effect of plant roots and the presence of fine sediments provide cohesion to the bank sediment which may affect bank erosion thorne 1990 considering the significance of plant roots in riverbank erosion all these factors should be considered in bank erosion models thus accurately predicting the effect of vegetation on the bank retreat process is challenging because of the complicated mechanisms of the interaction between vegetation roots and riverbank soil several models for simulating the effects of riparian vegetation on riverbank erosion have been developed in recent years despite limitations such as treating plants as rigid cylinders vargas luna et al 2015 2016 giadrossich et al 2017 pollen and simon 2005 the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem proposed by the usda ars national sedimentation laboratory considers the impact of bank toe erosion usda 2016 and different compositions of bank soil and vegetation coverage on bank stability this model has been widely used to simulate the process of bank collapse in recent years zong et al 2017 simon et al 2000 2009 many researchers have demonstrated that bstem can effectively predict bank retreat processes associated with multilayered riverbanks in different river systems particularly the effect of riparian vegetation on stream bank stability daly et al 2015 gran et al 2015 li et al 2016 stover et al 2018 yu et al 2020 used bstem to quantitatively estimate the effects of different root conditions on channel bank strength they confirmed that roots provide effective reinforcement to unconsolidated banks control bank erosion and enhance bank stability however the above studies only analyzed the effects of three vegetation roots populus euphratica pe tamarix ramosissima tr and phragmites australis pa on riverbank stability these studies did not involve more dominant vegetation roots alhagi sparsifolia as nitraria tangutorum nt and glycyrrhiza uralensis gu or their quantitative effects on riverbank erosion processes under different water levels e g dry season level rising stage flood season and recession stage therefore quantifying and predicting the bank retreat process associated with vegetation and their effect on slope stability remain a challenge particularly because of their process effects e g root influence on the riverbank retreat process under different water levels in a hydrological year additionally field studies focused on investigating the influence of vegetation on stream bank behavior are also limited accounting for both different hydrological processes and vegetation species and less specifically for sandy soils the typical soil type in the tarim river this study aims to quantify the quantitative influence of vegetation roots on the continuous retreat process of riverbanks with predominantly noncohesive sediment material this study used the bstem 5 4 to predict the effect of riparian vegetation roots on the riverbank retreat process under different hydrological processes and desert vegetation species krzeminska et al 2019 to comprehensively evaluate the effect of vegetation roots on bank stability eight sections with six dominant riparian vegetation species were selected as the study region because of severe bank erosion and the significance of vegetation roots the bank retreat processes at eight typical sections over a 2 year period were simulated using the bstem based on the interpolated hydrological data measured cross sectional profile and effect of vegetation roots on riverbank soil erosion parameters critical shear stress and erodibility coefficient and shear strength cohesive taking the bank of one sampling site as an example the quantitative effects of vegetation species and rar on bank stability were also analyzed based on the calculated results of the bank stability fs and collapse process for the roots of six vegetation species with different rars 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tarim river 39 28 n 88 19 e is the longest inland river in china and is located at the northern edge of the tarim basin in southern xinjiang its mainstream length and basin area is 1321 km and 17 600 km2 respectively the tarim river is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches according to their geographic environmental and hydrological characteristics the upper reach is 495 km from xiaojiake at the confluence of the three rivers to yingbaza ybz the middle reach is 398 km from ybz to qiala ql and the lower reach is 428 km from ql to taitema lake yu et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 there are five hydrometric stations along the mainstream alaer al xinqiman xqm ybz wusiman wsm and ql the al station is a control station for the upper stream because it records the characteristics of water and sediment representing the hydrological conditions entering the tarim river chen et al 2009 the upper and middle parts of the upper reach of the tarim river main stream from al to qumaogejin qmgj are meandering or transitional river channels with large swings and frequent changes in the river regime the lower part of the upper reach and the middle and lower reaches are meander channels reaching below qmgj the river regime is relatively stable however the riverbank is primarily composed of sandy soil causing the riverbank to easily be scoured and retreated in addition the river regime is changed continuously during river swings riverbed scour and riverbank erosion cause the riverbank to collapse and retreat field surveys of riverbank erosion in the tarim river show that the collapsed sandy soil block would be broken down by the flow without the influence of vegetation plant roots simultaneously the failed block would be deposited temporarily in the basal zone owing to the influence of plant roots and soil forming root soil composites as shown in fig 2 a and b however the majority of root soil composites can be easily disintegrated under fluvial flow therefore a failed block with roots may influence the rate of bank erosion this will be considered in the roots affecting soil erosion parameters but cannot prevent bank failure in the tarim river also found in the jingjiang reach of the yangtze river zong et al 2017 2 2 field sampling and measurements field surveys were conducted in may 22 25 2016 and april 24 27 2017 to analyze the composition and mechanical properties of riverbank soils these surveys included investigations of soil types root distribution cross sectional profiles hydraulic conditions and sediment conditions a stratified sampling method was used for all riverbank soil layers according to the differences in soil composition and physical properties laboratory results yielded a series of indicators including soil specific gravity limiting water content soil density water content and shear strength with and without roots under undisturbed conditions these soil and composition properties were determined using the geotechnical test method nhri 1999a and procedure nhri 1999b fig 2 c and d show the vertical stratification structure of the riverbank soil composition at site ii alar new bridge and site vi shaya bridge the riverbank soil was composed of silty and loose soil structures primarily comprising silty sand and fine grained soil sand according to the results of layered sampling the soil layer near site ii was mainly composed of silty sand ss sand with fine grained soil sf and poorly graded sand sp the fine grained soil particle size less than 0 075 mm contents were 52 3 32 8 and 3 3 as shown in appendix a with thicknesses at 0 3 m 0 6 m and 2 3 m respectively the riverbank soil near site vi was primarily composed of ss and sf with fine grained soil contents of 21 5 and 6 3 and thicknesses of 0 60 m and 0 3 m respectively therefore the riverbank soil of the tarim river mainstream is sandy soil primarily composed of ss and sf the field investigations showed that the natural forest in the tarim river mainstream is dominated by pe shrubs are mainly tr as and nt and herbs are dominated by pa gu among others six typical riparian plant root samplings were conducted in may 2016 and april 2017 along the tarim river mainstream table 1 a total of 28 soil samples were obtained of which 17 were root soil composites at each sampling site two types of soil samples root soil composite and soil without roots were obtained with a cylindrical iron sampling barrel with a diameter of 0 11 m and height of 0 15 m for comparison experiments root samples were also taken from the root soil composite in the laboratory to determine root parameters root length diameter and rar rar was computed as a r a where a r is the total cross sectional area of all roots in the composite and a is the area of the root soil composite to effectively compare the effects of the six plant species in terms of bank stability enhancement sampling sites were chosen on a channel with a single plant species or two dominant species site i was dominated by as sites ii and vii by tr site iii by pa and as site iv by tr and gu site v by pa and sites vi and viii by pe and pa table 2 the roots were largely composed of very fine roots all roots were less than 10 mm in diameter except for gu at site iv soil erodibility was most significantly influenced by fine roots kamyab swanson 1990 particle size distribution was tested using a standard method of analysis by sieving the mean median diameter ranged from 0 08 mm to 0 13 mm for ss 0 12 mm to 0 14 mm for sf and 0 14 mm to 0 32 mm for sp as shown in appendix a the shear strength of the root soil composite was measured using a strain controlled direct shearapparatus shearing speed 0 01 2 4 mm min 1 under the conditions of normal stress of 100 kpa 200 kpa 300 kpa and 400 kpa the same horizontal shear force was applied to the root soil composite sample and the direct shear test was performed as roots have little effect on the internal friction angle of soils operstein and frydman 2000 tron et al 2015 the effect of the roots on the soil shear strength can be considered as follows 1 δ τ τ r τ 0 σ t a n φ c r c 0 σ t a n φ δ c where δ τ is the additional shear strength provided by the roots kpa τ r is the shear strength of the root soil composite kpa τ 0 is the soil shear strength kpa σ is the positive stress on the shear plane kpa φ is the internal friction angle of the root soil composite or soil c r is the cohesion of the root soil composite kpa c 0 is the soil cohesion kpa and δ c is the additional cohesion provided by the roots kpa additionally regardless of the effect of the roots on the internal friction angle of the soil wu et al 1979 found that δ c can be calculated as follows 2 δ c t r a r a s i n θ c o s θ t a n φ t r r a r s i n θ c o s θ t a n φ where t r is the tensile strength per unit area of the roots kpa a r is the total cross sectional area of all roots m2 a is the area of soil in the sample m2 rar is the root density and θ is the relative vertical deviation angle of roots subjected to shear deformation in eq 2 the values of s i n θ c o s θ t a n φ were determined to be 1 0 1 3 with a mean of 1 2 wu et al 1979 root tensile strength is primarily influenced by plant species and root diameter and has been shown to decrease with increasing root diameter by many experimental results nilaweera and nutalaya 1999 mattia et al 2005 norris 2005 tosi 2007 yu et al 2020 the tensile strength t r was measured using an lwk 500 microcomputer controlled electronic tensile testing machine with 0 5 measuring accuracy tensile tests were conducted on roots from different vegetation types and the data were recorded moreover a tensile force was applied at a fixed rate 0 25 mm min 1 on a single root giadrossich et al 2017 the quantitative relationship between t r and the diameter d can be expressed by the following power function 3 t r k d b where k and b are empirical constants that depend on the plant species the values of k and b for different plant species can be found in feng et al 2019 the correlation coefficient r2 was not high at 0 47 0 55 which will cause the calculated result of the additional cohesive provided by the roots using eq 2 to be relatively large as the bank vegetation and protection submodel in the bstem can optionally input the number of added cohesiveness due to roots or input the own data of permissible shear stress pollen bankhead and simon 2009 the measured additional cohesive values were used in the calculation process this is based on the premise that the effect of the roots on the internal friction angle is not considered however the effect of the roots on the internal friction angle cannot be ignored in some cases sites iv tr vi pe viii pa and viii nt therefore the measured values of the cohesive and internal friction angles provided by the roots were input into the bank material submodel of the bstem 2 3 calculation of soil erosion parameters influenced by roots to accurately assess the riverbank and toe erosion of the tarim river bank with and without riparian plant roots the critical shear stress τ c and erodibility coefficient k d were determined from previous studies existing field surveys conducted in the tarim river indicate that bank soil is primarily composed of unconsolidated soil yu et al 2020 an empirical formula proposed by hanson and simon 2001 was used to calculate the critical shear stress of bank soil in the bstem when the mean media diameter d 50 was less than 2 0 mm 4 τ c 0 044 16 2 d 50 where d 50 is the mean media diameter mm and τ c is the critical shear stress n m 2 as shown in appendix a the critical shear stress calculated using eq 4 ranged 0 057 0 228 n m 2 and d 50 ranged 0 08 0 32 mm for the bank soil in the tarim river these results differed from the results calculated by yu et al 2020 with τ c ranging 0 008 0 088 n m 2 owing to the difference in sampled soil particle size an empirical model developed by arulanandan et al 1980 was used to determine the erodibility coefficient 5 k d 0 1 τ c 0 5 where k d is the erodibility coefficient cm3 n s 1 the calculated result of the erodibility coefficient using equation 5 ranged 0 209 0 419 cm3 n s 1 for the noncohesive bank soil by contrast yu et al 2020 had results ranging 0 336 1 087 cm3 n s 1 the results differed primarily because of the sampled soil particle size according to laboratory flume results the critical shear stress with roots is higher than that of the non vegetated flow and the erodibility coefficient is lower watanabe et al 2002 kothyari et al 2009 as there were no in situ results of desert riparian plant roots on bank soil erodibility in the tarim river the critical shear stress τ c and erodibility coefficient k d were estimated to a particular time of the values without riparian plant roots based on the experimental results the measured critical shear stress of the tr roots ranged 1 35 1 60 times that without roots 1 32 1 57 times for pe and 1 27 1 53 times for pa therefore the critical shear stress affected by roots is typically 1 50 times that of no roots regardless of the difference for different riparian plants the measured erodibility coefficient of tr roots ranged 0 62 0 74 times that of no roots 0 67 0 76 times for pe and 0 69 0 78 times for pa therefore the erodibility coefficient affected by roots is typically 0 70 times that of no roots thus it is estimated that the critical shear stress τ c and erodibility coefficient k d influenced by roots were 1 5 and 0 7 times the values without roots respectively 2 4 bank geometry the bank height and slope were obtained by combining field samples and channel topography measured from the stations along the meandering reaches for example the right bank profile at site ii measured in october 2016 see fig 3 a was taken as the initial boundary according to this profile the bank full level was 1006 7 m at site ii with a corresponding top level of 1006 4 m and 1005 8 m for the ss and sp soil layers respectively based on the method by zong et al 2017 the elevation of the bank toe was calculated as 1004 7 m thus the slope below it was considered part of the riverbed based on soil type and the bstem the riverbank was divided into five distinct soil layers taking site ii as an example the corresponding descriptions and geotechnical properties of the different layers are shown in fig 3a thus different types of soils can be used as separate soil layers the no 1 and 2 layers were the ss and sf soils with heights of 0 3 m and 0 6 m respectively the no 3 4 and 5 layers were sp soil with a height of 2 3 m the soil with a height of 2 0 m is located below the average water stage during the dry season and can be divided into two or three layers depending on the location of the water table for example if the water table is 1005 5 m the no 3 layer is the sp soil with a height of 0 3 m and the no 4 and 5 layers are the sp soils both with a height of 1 0 m if the water table is at the interface between sf and sp layers 3 4 and 5 are sp soil with height of 0 76 m 0 77 m and 0 77 m respectively furthermore because of the high permeability of sandy soil it was assumed that there was no lag in the water table that is the elevation of the water table at different flow levels and moments was consistent with that of the water level yu et al 2020 as the riverbank along the tarim river mainstream is mainly composed of relatively uniform silty sand and fine sand the bank at each site was divided into five layers the first or the first to second layers were set above a constant water level appendix b lists the stratification and mechanical properties of bank soils as the soil below the water table was considered saturated the mechanical parameters of saturated soil were used for the soil layer below the water table for different vegetation species and corresponding different root rars the mechanical parameters of the root soil composite including the cohesive c and internal friction angle φ were also used for the soil layer influenced by the roots 2 5 hydrological data the average flow discharge of the tarim river mainstream is primarily concentrated from june to september reaches its maximum in august and typically has minimum values in april may and november the distribution of the flow discharge during the hydrological year was relatively concentrated according to the measured data from the alar hydrological station the largest flood flow occurred in 1999 with a peak flow of 2280 m3 s 1 august 5 this was close to the return period of the 20 year flood flow of 2200 m3 s 1 and less than the return period of the 50 year flood flow of 2530 m3 s 1 fig 4 shows the average monthly flow discharge for many years and for one year from 1999 to 2017 at the alar hydrological station for alar hydrological station the flow from june to september accounted for 80 2 82 41 from 2010 to 2017 of the whole year from 1999 to 2009 of which august accounted for 38 0 38 6 from 2010 to 2017 the peak monthly flow discharge in 2009 was the smallest with 144 0 m3 s 1 in august and the peak in 2010 was the largest with 1110 0 m3 s 1 from 1999 to 2017 in this study the riverbank erosion process influenced by roots was modeled for two consecutive hydrological years 2016 and 2017 for each stage the water level hydrographs at sites i viii were approximated by a series of stepped hydrographs with constant levels fig 5 shows the generalized water stage at site ii for the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years as shown in the figure the water stage hydrographs were generalized to 10 and 11 time intervals in 2016 and 2017 respectively the periodic changes in bank failure in a hydrological year can be divided into four stages dry season level rising stage flood season and recession stage xia et al 2014 therefore based on the interpolated hydrographs at site ii a water level hydrograph over a hydrological year can be divided into four different stages the dry season december 16 to april 15 level rising stage april 16 to june 15 flood season june 16 to august 31 and recession stage september 1 to december 15 the hydrological data at sites i viii can be interpolated using the measured data from two hydrometric stations and neighboring water gauge stations for example water levels ranged 1005 20 1006 62 m in 2016 and 1005 10 1006 90 m in 2017 at site ii during the dry season in fig 5 the water levels were relatively low averaging 1005 46 m in 2016 and 1005 33 in 2017 owing to the low mean discharges of 38 31 m3 s 1 in 2016 and 32 27 m3 s 1 in 2017 the maximum water level increased to 1006 62 m with a high mean discharge of 578 34 m3 s 1 in 2016 1006 90 m and 634 91 m3 s 1 in 2017 during the flood season during the recession stage the water levels decreased to an average of 1005 32 m in 2016 and 1005 47 m in 2017 2 6 numerical simulation the bank stability model of the bstem combines three limit equilibrium method models that calculate the fs for multilayer streambanks these models primarily simulate planar and cantilever failures of undercut bank types that generally occur at riverbanks composed of cohesive soil the riverbank in the study reach is mainly composed of sandy soil consisting of silty sand and fine grained soil sand however the soil still has a certain degree of cohesion the cohesion value of each soil layer is non zero appendix b this fully demonstrates that the bstem can be used for the bank stability calculation of the tarim river the bstem was also applied to calculate the bank stability of the tarim river in yu et al 2020 the mechanical effects of bank top vegetation on bank stability can be simulated using a root reinforcement model in the bstem simon et al 2011 in this study the effect of riparian plant roots on riverbank stability in the tarim river was simulated using the bstem the collapsed sandy soil block would be broken down by the flow immediately and there was no lag in the water table because of the high permeability of bank soils primarily silty and fine sands yu et al 2020 therefore the elevation of the water table during different flow events was consistent with that of the water level when the flow events were simulated using the bstem if the fs was greater than 1 3 the bank was considered stable if the fs was less than 1 0 the bank was considered unstable if the fs was between 1 0 and 1 3 the bank was also considered unstable because bank failure is likely to occur in this condition fig 3b 3 results 3 1 root soil composite mechanical properties and shear characteristics table 1 lists the physical and mechanical properties of the eight sampling sites the measured water content of the undisturbed soil of the upper ss ranged 24 42 32 06 with a dry density ranging 1 37 1 48 103 kg m 3 this demonstrates that the upper soil is a loose soil structure the water content of sf ranged 24 11 30 21 with a dry density ranging 1 37 1 46 103 kg m 3 the dry density of sp ranged 1 42 1 54 103 kg m 3 slightly larger than the other two types of soils with the water content ranging 26 81 30 43 therefore the riverbank soil in the tarim river reach is relatively loose owing to its sandy structure fig 6 shows the relationship between the shear strength and normal stress under different riparian plant roots and rars according to the experimental results the cohesion of the composite increased with increasing rar for the same plant root and soil for example when the rar of as increased from 0 00 to 1 72 at site iii the cohesion increased from 9 64 kpa to 19 73 kpa an increase of 104 7 when the rar of tr at site ii increased from 0 00 to 0 99 the cohesion increased from 8 55 kpa to 25 26 kpa increase of 195 4 when the rar of pa at site v increased from 0 00 to 1 25 the cohesion increased from 7 07 kpa to 28 55 kpa an increase of 303 8 fig 7 shows the relationship between the root tensile strength and the diameter of the six desert plant species in the tarim river the figure shows that the root tensile strength t r primarily decreases with increasing root diameter the t r of nt exceeded that of other plant species under the same root diameter and the t r of pa had the smallest value the order according to the t r value was nt tr gu pe as pa 3 2 effect of plant roots on toe erosion toe erosion was calculated using the toe erosion model in the bstem the eroded area maximum lateral retreat and average applied boundary shear stress were obtained before running the bank stability model to calculate the riverbank stability the toe erosion model was first run to calculate toe erosion the flow duration was set as the actual action time of the water flow in fig 5 subsequently the new eroded profile after toe erosion was exported into the model as the initial shape in the next step of the bank stability calculation when calculating toe erosion the effective stress acting on each grain was considered and the average value of the manning s roughness coefficient ranged 0 02 0 03 in bstem the duration of flow for each event in appendix c was calculated in hours according to the actual duration time of the water flow in fig 5 the reach slope was calculated based on the water level difference from upstream to downstream of the sections the toe erosion and bank stability at each water level of the eight sections in 2016 and 2017 were analyzed appendix c shows the toe erosion and bank stability results for site ii in 2016 and 2017 it shows that the total amount of lateral erosion and collapsed soil at site ii was 1487 5 m3 100 m in two consecutive hydrological years without vegetation roots with tr roots with rar 0 21 and rar 0 99 the collapsed soil was 1364 7 m3 100 m and 1308 5 m3 100 m respectively this demonstrates the protective effect of vegetation roots against toe erosion furthermore the results demonstrate that riparian plant roots may increase the roughness of near bank flow and prevent toe erosion because of the mechanical reinforcement derived from root networks pollen bankhead and simon 2009 without vegetation roots the toe erosion volume and bank collapse accounted for 95 9 and 4 1 of the total volume respectively when vegetation roots tr at site ii were used the amount of toe erosion accounted for 96 7 and 97 7 of the total volume for rar 0 21 and rar 0 99 respectively this also shows that vegetation roots can more effectively reduce bank collapse it should be noted that the calculated bank toe erosion width and failure width in appendix c are the lateral maximum retreat and the lateral maximum value of the collapsed soil in the toe model output and bank model output of the bstem thus a large bank toe erosion width or bank failure width may correspond to a small bank toe erosion volume or bank failure volume for example the calculated total bank toe erosion width 9 26 m and total bank retreat width 13 65 m in the condition with rar 0 21 were larger those 9 01 m and 12 29 m in the condition with rar 0 to avoid such a contradiction in the conclusion that vegetation roots can more effectively reduce bank collapse considering the width the bank toe erosion width was replaced with the average erosion width calculated from the volume in two consecutive hydrological years accordingly the calculated average toe erosion widths were 5 92 m 5 44 m and 5 19 m for rar 0 0 rar 0 21 and rar 0 99 respectively therefore the total volume of toe erosion decreases with an increase in rar and the corresponding average toe erosion width also decreases this proves that the roots can effectively reduce bank erosion simultaneously the soil erosion parameters the critical shear stress and erodibility coefficient with different rars did not change because of the lack of corresponding test results the volume of toe erosion for different rars was the same unless the bank profile changed owing to bank collapse fig 8 shows the toe erosion volume at eight sites with and without roots based on the bstem simulations for two consecutive hydrological years the figure shows that the amount of toe erosion was relatively the same for different rars except for tr at site ii gu at site iv and pa at site v where the bank profile changed owing to bank collapse because the dry season is long 122 days per year at site ii there is still a certain toe erosion during the dry season accounting for an average of 20 0 with different rars 23 0 without roots of the total erosion at site ii however the amount of toe erosion was still the largest during the flood season accounting for an average of 54 1 55 9 without roots and only 16 0 and 9 8 during the level rising and recession stages respectively 14 0 and 7 1 without roots furthermore different vegetation species also have different effects on toe erosion for each water stage fig 9 shows the effect of the roots of different vegetation species on toe erosion reduction during different water stages in the 2016 hydrological years compared with no roots the effect of roots can reduce toe erosion from 2 4 tr to 63 2 nt in the dry season 0 5 pa to 60 1 nt in the level rising stage 2 1 pa to 48 7 nt during the flood season and 1 9 gu to 67 0 nt during the recession stage in general the roots had the most significant impact on toe erosion during the dry and recession stages therefore it can be concluded that vegetation roots can prevent toe erosion during the dry and recession stages among the six vegetation roots studied the nt roots had the largest reinforcing effect on toe erosion followed by the tr as pe pa and gu roots consistent with previous results of root effects on shear and tensile strength notably when the bank profile changes significantly owing to bank failure the effect of roots in reducing toe erosion cannot be compared with that without roots because the initial bank profile of toe erosion has changed for example in appendix c because of bank failure during the last water level event 10 in 2016 it was not possible to compare the effect of the roots on reducing toe erosion from the first water level event 1 in 2017 therefore only the comparison results before bank failure 2016 hydrological year are shown in fig 9 3 3 effect of plant roots on bank collapse the bank collapse widths and corresponding number of bank failure events were obtained from eight sites with and without six vegetation species during different water level periods the calculated results show that there were no bank collapses in the first three water level periods dry season level rising stage and flood season of 2016 and two intermediate periods level rising stage and flood season of 2017 these can also be seen in the bank failure results of site ii in appendix c therefore the bank failure events primarily occurred during the recession stage and dry season of the next hydrological year fig 10 shows the comparison of the widths and number of failure events between the roots of the six vegetation species during the recession stage and dry season the figure shows that the total failure widths in 2016 and 2017 without roots were from 1 12 pa at site v to 1 84 gu at site iv times larger than that with roots bank failure widths with roots were smaller than those without roots there were five events corresponding to the failure width of zero with roots as at site iii tr at site iv gu at site iv pe and nt at site viii the total failure widths without roots were 1 95 m 2 95 m 2 95 m 3 02 m and 3 02 m respectively during the two consecutive hydrological years significant bank collapses occurred during the recession stages in 2016 and 2017 twenty four bank failure events occurred at eight typical sites in the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years 17 events occurred during the recession stages and seven events occurred in the dry season of 2017 during the recession stages of 2016 and 2017 there were only six bank failure events with vegetation roots compared with 11 events without roots during the dry season of 2017 there were four bank failure events with roots compared with three events without roots therefore the presence of near bank plant roots can strongly influence bank collapse particularly during the recession stage when the water level drops rapidly riverbank soils and riparian vegetation can form high strength root soil composites consequently the flow velocity and fluvial erosion rate are slowed by the increased roughness and root networks 3 4 effects of plant roots on riverbank stability degrees during different stages the stability degrees of the riverbank at eight typical sites during the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years were calculated with and without plant roots using the bstem a total of 168 model runs were conducted to simulate the bank collapse process of a 100 meter long reach at eight sampling sites in two consecutive hydrological years with and without plant roots fig 11 shows the calculation results of the safety factor of bank satiability at site ii during different stages the bank stability degrees at site ii during the different stages are discussed as follows ① during the dry season the water levels changed slightly in the tarim river mainstream because the incoming discharges were relatively small and stable for example the near bank flow shear stress at site ii was relatively small τ f 0 09 0 14 n m 2 however it was still greater than the critical shear stress of the silty sand soil τ c 0 06 n m 2 therefore there is a particular amount of erosion in the lower soil layer of the riverbank the calculated unit length toe erosion volumes were 2 55 m3 m 1 and 2 79 m3 m 1 for rar 0 99 and rar 0 21 3 42 m3 m 1 without roots respectively during the dry season of 2016 the calculated bank stability fs with tr roots reached more than 10 0 the fs values without vegetation cover were lower than those in scenarios with vegetation but still much higher than the critical value of 1 3 fig 11 however the fs was 1 0 1 4 in the dry season of 2017 furthermore there are three bank failure events under the conditions of no roots tr roots with rar 0 21 and rar 0 99 this was because the bank toe has been scoured by the flow in the 2016 hydrological year the bank profile was unstable and failure occurred in this stage or the previous stage the recession stage of 2016 at this stage the roots had an apparent impact on toe erosion and bank stability where fs with roots are higher than those without roots and vegetation roots can prevent toe erosion and maintain bank stability ② during the level rising stage before the flood season the near bank flow shear stress increased τf 0 09 0 16 n m 2 owing to high discharges and higher water stages compared with the dry season the stability of the riverbank with and without tr roots decreased except that the fs without roots increased owing to the bank collapse in the dry season of 2017 however it was still greater than 1 3 owing to the rising water stage bank failure did not occur during this stage because of the relatively low intensity of bank erosion the roots may further improve the riverbank stability the fs values with roots are higher than that without roots increasing by 14 8 and 6 6 times in 2016 and 2017 respectively ③ during the flood season the peak discharge was large with high water stages lasting for a long period the mean discharge at site ii was 578 34 m3 s 1 and 634 91 m3 s 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively during this stage the maximum shear stress reached 0 53 n m 2 which was substantially greater than the critical shear stress of the lower sandy soil significant basal erosion occurred with the bank toe erosion volumes of 7 21 m3 m 1 and 7 31 m3 m 1 8 32 m3 m 1 without roots for rar 0 99 and rar 0 21 respectively the calculated fs with rar 0 99 dropped sharply by 1 6 1 4 with rar 0 21 and without tr after a rapid rise to a maximum value of 66 2 35 0 with rar 0 21 and 17 4 without tr during the flood season of 2016 the same change in fs was observed in the flood season of the 2017 hydrological year in general most fs values with tr roots during this stage were higher than those without roots with a critical value of 1 3 therefore no bank failures occurred during this stage in 2016 and 2017 the roots further improved the riverbank stability and the fs with rar 0 99 was up to 4 2 times higher than that without roots ④ during the recession stage the in channel water level decreased significantly the soil shear strength decreased owing to the long term submergence of riverbank soil resulting in bank failure as shown in fig 11 there was one bank failure event with tr roots and one without tr roots during the recession stage in 2016 at site ii therefore the intensity of the bank failure was severe during this stage because of the lower water level during the recession stage of 2017 there was no failure and the fs values with tr were higher than those without it up to 2 4 times higher than that without roots in general most of the calculated fs values with roots of all six studied plant species were higher than those without roots during the four different stages moreover it was greater than the critical value of 1 3 in most cases although different vegetation roots show different effects on the fs of riverbank stability the same influence law on riverbank stability during different stages also exists in the other five vegetation species including as pe gu pa and nt at the other seven sampling sites 4 discussion 4 1 effects of vegetation species on riverbank stability to analyze the effects of vegetation species on riverbank stability the right bank profile at site ii measured in october 2016 see fig 3 was taken as the initial shape boundary and the 2016 hydrological year was used as the water level calculation process the bank stability fs and collapse process for the roots of six vegetation species with different rars were calculated fig 12 shows the mean fs of different vegetation species during four stages under essentially the same rar the figure shows that the mean fs with roots was greater than that without roots at each water level however different vegetation roots under different water levels showed different effects on the riverbank stability fs during the dry season the order of the mean fs corresponding to the different vegetation roots was tr pe pa gu as nt during the flood season the order of the mean fs influenced by different vegetation roots was pe pa tr gu as nt during the level rising and recession stages tr and pe had the highest degree of enhancement on bank stability however the corresponding fs of tr was lower because of bank collapse during the recession stage whereas pa and gu had the smallest mean fs from the average fs for the whole hydrological year the mean fs with pe was the largest 34 68 followed by tr 28 22 pa 19 57 and as 20 25 the fs with nt 18 66 and gu 15 96 were the smallest compared with the results calculated by yu et al 2020 the fs of pa roots was the largest followed by the pe and tr roots different from the results of this study this is because of the difference in riverbank heights the banks with pa roots were shorter 2 3 m in height in the study by yu et al 2020 than the bank in this study 3 2 m furthermore the banks with pe and tr roots were 3 4 m high according to yu et al 2020 similar to the calculated height 3 2 m and order pe tr in this study 4 2 effects of root density rar on riverbank stability mean rar at eight sites for different vegetation species including grass shrubs and trees was determined the rars of riverbank with pa and gu were 0 49 1 25 and 1 40 1 45 with mean values of 0 77 and 1 43 respectively the rars with as and nt were 0 12 1 72 mean value 0 87 and 0 91 respectively the values for tr and pe were 0 10 1 43 mean value 0 55 and 0 92 1 27 mean value 1 07 fig 13 shows the relationship between the rar and δc for different vegetation species the figure shows that the δc of the four species of riparian plants increased with increasing rar within a certain range the δc of tr and as increased at the highest and lowest rate with increasing rar respectively consistent with the results of yu et al 2020 as the δc of the roots increased with increasing rar the bank stability fs should also increase with increasing rar as shown in fig 14 the figure shows that the mean fs of a hydrological year increased linearly with increasing rar for each vegetation species however the increasing rates are different pe had the highest rate of increase followed by tr and pa and as additionally the trend lines of the four vegetation species in the figure intersect at different rars when the rar was greater than the critical value of 0 9 the order of the rate of increase in fs for four vegetation species was as follows pe tr as pa notably although the δc and fs generally increased with increasing rar the variations in these two parameters did not match well given the large variability in root density found in this and other studies future studies should include many root samples taken at the bank face results based on a few samples or limited areas may be misleading and may not be applicable beyond a localized environment the results of this study also illustrate the order of fs for different vegetation species to enhance the bank stability under a particular range of rar 0 9 rar less than 1 8 in the order pe tr nt as pa gu 5 conclusions this study investigated the quantitative effects of desert vegetation roots on toe erosion and bank collapse moreover the degrees of riverbank stability during different stages at eight typical sites in the tarim river mainstream were calculated using the bstem the effects of vegetation species and the rar on riverbank stability were quantified by combining field measurements with the bstem the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the results of this study suggest that desert vegetation plays a major role in regulating stream bank soil strength by providing additional cohesive reinforcement and reducing toe erosion and bank collapse in the tarim river region compared with no roots the effect of different vegetation roots can reduce toe erosion from 0 4 to 68 4 the superiority of preventing toe erosion can be exhibited during the dry season and the recession stage therefore near bank vegetation roots can strongly influence bank collapse especially during the recession stage when the water level drops rapidly 2 the stability degrees of the riverbank at eight typical sites during the 2016 and 2017 hydrological years were calculated with and without plant roots using the bstem most of the calculated fs with roots of all six studied plant species were higher than those without roots during the four different stages moreover it was greater than the critical value of 1 3 in most cases despite different vegetation roots showing different degrees of effect on the riverbank stability fs 3 based on the calculated results of the bank stability fs and collapse process under six vegetation species roots with different rars the effects of vegetation species on riverbank stability were analyzed banks with pe roots had the highest fs values the fs of tr root bearing banks were slightly higher than those of the pa and as root bearing banks and the fs values of nt and gu were the smallest 4 in this study an analysis was performed to determine the quantitative effect of rar on the degree of bank stability the calculated results of the fs indicated that the fs values of a hydrological year increased linearly with increasing rar for each vegetation species the fs of different vegetation species increased at different rates with an increase in rar the order of the rate of increase for six vegetation species was as follows pe tr nt as pa gu with rar greater than the critical value of 0 9 credit authorship contribution statement quanli zong conceptualization data curation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

2488,risk assessment is necessary to understand whether a levee is safe and able to prevent flood invasion most previous assessment methods attempted to quantitatively assess the risks posed by hydraulic structures using probabilistic analysis from a research perspective the kind of method depends on the probability density function of factors but sometimes difficult to determine either a priori or posteriori in practice on the other hand current semi quantitative methods despite the convenience are somewhat subjective in their implementation this study sought to rectify the shortcomings of previous quantitative and semi quantitative approaches to assessing the risk of levee failure wherein the uncertainty of risk factors is presented within a semi quantitative framework in accordance with iso assessment procedures the risk of levee failure discussed in this work is mainly related to overtopping and erosion of its foundation this study proposed a semi quantitative approach to maintain the exactness and objectivity of the risk assessment of levees and use puzih river in taiwan as a case study in this study we tried to add uncertainty facts and developed a risk assessment framework for levee management using a risk map according to our semi quantitative methods this study firstly defines the risk and associated factors within the context of government regulations then implement a series of risk assessment tasks using the widely used hydraulic and sedimentation transport model hec ras to simulate the risk of inundation where hydrological events are used as a proxy for uncertainty this study considers that consequence of levee failure and compute representative qualitative indices by which to evaluate hazards using a risk map and risk matrix in order to illustrate potential economic losses under given flood scenarios after gaining the levee assessment results the risk map is also built which can be applied on the practical engineering works our results reveal that the most secure levees along puzih river should be able to withstand flood events with a 100 year return period however the levees in a several areas fail to provide suitable protection accordingly this work developed a risk map and corresponding flood prevention strategies to decrease the risk in specific regions for the consideration of rive management administration

other hand the uncertainty of assessing the levee failure was also discussed in mazzoleni et al 2014a s study in their work the monte carlo approach was used to cope with the uncertainty however this method is complex to the field work engineers apel et al 2004 proposed a probabilistic model in which risk uncertainty attributable to natural causes and incomplete knowledge are respectively computed within a monte carlo framework hui et al 2016 developed a levee assessment model that considers geotechnical limitations as well as hydrology and hydraulic conditions many researchers have sought to qualitatively assess the risks imposed by hydraulic structures using probabilistic analysis based on the product of vulnerability and hazard functions cançado et al 2008 karmakar et al 2010 malakeel et al 2021 united states army corps of engineers usace 2018 described the risk of levees within a specific probability distribution as a function of hazard levee performance and consequences the quantitative assessment of risk in the above studies depends on the probability density function of factors used in risk equations despite the difficulty in determining precise probability values a priori or a posteriori in practice tung and mays 1981 fukuoka and tabata 2021 pointed out that uncertainty is inevitable when seeking to determine the probability of failure scientifically unfortunately the detailed and comprehensive probability levee failure assessment is difficult many practical situations only allow engineerings to collect limited parameters influencing the structure safety thererfore some physical related alternatives were developed to assist field works thus methods might establish some indices expressed such as aging history floodind envents or foundation erorsion for the practicality the indices could be semi quantitatively expressed for example mckay et al 1999 reported on the use of the condition index ci by the usace to assess the likelihood of levee failure based on the age of the structure and projections of future events the consequences of potential failures are then used to prioritize situations according to the need for upgrading based on a ci number since 2006 usace has been developing the levee safety program by which to assess the usability of levees they established a database and online levee assessment system based on five discrete classes indicating the need for immediate action usace 2020 serre et al 2008 developed a semi quantitative approach to levee assessment in which levee performance is divided into eleven levels based on geotechnical assessment criteria for use in prioritizing projects according to risk despite their convenience semi quantitative methods are somewhat subjective in their implementation stein et al 1999 the proposed scheme of this study is illustrated using a case study of the puzih watershed system in taiwan this study tries to add uncertain facts to the semi quantitative framework to avoid the complexity of quantitative approaches and subjectivity of traditional semi quantitative assessments in accordance with iso assessment procedures we also developed a risk map and corresponding flood prevention strategies to decrease the risk in specific regions for the consideration of rive management administration the risk map is provided to the decision makers which allows them to set up suitable policies although various strategies might diminish the flood risk castellarin et al 2011 mazzoleni et al 2014b the management effects were not focused on in this paper 2 study area in this project we selected as a case study the puzih river in taiwan which is 75 87 km in length with an average slope of 1 2 100 as shown in fig 2 the river drains a watershed measuring 426 6 km2 in the current study the upstream boundary of puzih river is jinfu bridge cross section 134 the reader could refer this location from fig 4 and the downstream boundary is at the estuary cross section 0 the river encompasses upstream midstream and downstream sections the upstream extends from niuchouxi bridge cross section 74 to jinfu bridge cross section 134 with a sinuosity of 1 12 the midstream section extends from xinpi drainage intersection cross section 34 to niuchouxi bridge cross section 75 with a sinuosity of 1 51 the downstream section extends from the estuary cross section 0 to xinpi drainage intersection cross section 34 with sinuosity of 1 51 the average slopes from upstream to downstream are 1 44 1 119 and 1 128 respectively recent observations have revealed obvious indications of channel deposition in midstream and downstream sections with significant erosion in the upstream side section wra 2019 note that sediment transport rate from upstream can be attributed primarily to a steep channel slope note also that water carrying a high sediment concentration tends to induce strong shear stress on the foundation of hydraulic structures leading to erosion a decrease in the slope of the channel after passing zhuqi valley reduces water velocity resulting in deposition variations in the thalweg and the formation of sand bars which tends to increase the velocity of water flow adjacent to the banks the corresponding bank erosion can also trigger landslides thereby rendering structures along the puzih river susceptible to failure regular inspection of levees along the puzih river revealed a number of age related failures including gengliao levee xibei levee wannei levee puzih levee and guogou levee these failures do not necessarily represent critical hazards however the long term effects cannot be disregarded in any risk assessment heavy rainfall has also been shown to cause occasional flooding associated with levee failure most of these events can be attributed to river meandering channel deposition tidal effects land subsidence due to over pumping and extreme rainfall in the results section of this paper we also indicate the areas and times of levee repair after flooding in 1991 and 2014 3 methodology in this study we developed a risk assessment framework for levee management using risk identification risk analysis and risk evaluation as outlined in iso 31000 2018 e hutchins 2018 risk identification refers to the process of finding recognizing and describing risks risk analysis refers to the process by which one identifies the nature and severity of the identified risks risk evaluation refers to the process of determining whether the magnitude of the identified risk is tolerable generally this process leads to a series of actions by which to mediate eliminate risks and or deal with the consequences in the proposed framework we first define the risk and associated factors within the context of government regulations we then implement a series of risk assessment tasks using a numerical model to simulate the risk of inundation where hydrological events are used as a proxy for uncertainty we also compute representative qualitative indices by which to evaluate hazards using a risk map and risk matrix in order to illustrate potential economic losses under given flood scenarios simulated by hec ras our hec ras computation used 5 5 m digital elevation model provided by the ministry of interior taiwan the upstream boundary condition was discharge for events with a 100 year return period and the downstream boundary condition was the normal depth we assumed that levee failure would occur roughly 1 5 h after the flood peak fig 1 presents a flowchart of this study 3 1 risk definition risk is widely treated as the product of hazard and vulnerability united nations department of humanitarian affairs undha 1992 schneider 2002 kron 2005 here hazard refers to the probability and severity of flood occurrence whereas vulnerability refers to the potential for economic damage in flood prone areas and recovery capacity based on the assumption that hazard and vulnerability can both be assessed qualitatively we adopted the same approach to assessing risk through the procedures of risk identification risk analysis risk evaluation and risk treatment 3 2 risk identification the fact that levee failures tend to be multi factorial underlines the importance of identifying and categorizing risk factors as hazard related and vulnerability related the risk identification is to determine the hazard and vulnerability that we focused on in this study note that any risk factors that are not identified at this stage are omitted from analysis as shown in table 1 we inventoried hazard and vulnerability factors commonly identified suggested in taiwan water resources agency wra 2019 table 1 also lists the methods used to analyze and quantitatively assess the various factors in order to facilitate semi qualitative risk analysis 3 3 risk analysis risk analysis in the current study was used to estimate the probability of an event occurring and determine whether the risks could be assessed quantitatively based on objective measurements or qualitatively based on subjective judgment and experience note that qualitative analysis can be used to estimate the relative likelihood of an event inducing levee failure however this approach does not involve the rigorous assessment of physical mechanisms thereby making it difficult to compare the results from other regions nonetheless this approach provides a simple tool by which to assess risk quickly and easily using basic survey data of the study area quantitative analysis involves the rigorous application of mathematical physical and statistical principles to measured data to enable the formulation of numerical models by which to derive flow rates water velocity and shear stress note however that quantitative analysis must also account for uncertainty pertaining to the probability of levee failure and corresponding economic losses quantitative methods are ostensibly objective however inevitable simplifications in the formulation of numerical models can lead to erroneous results a numerical model with overly conservative assumptions would render simulation results that are of no practical value to policy makers furthermore such assumptions render the results highly susceptible to risk factor estimates and the selection of numerical models thus it is essential that prediction models account for uncertainty in the current study we employed the hydraulic and sediment transportation model hec ras which is widely used worldwide hec ras has proven effective in modeling 1 d and 2 d simulations of hydraulic and inundation problems we first used the hec ras model to simulate the entire channel in order to identify the conditions under which the levee would be unable to fulfill its intended function we then used the model to study specific locations subject to inundation or overtopping in the current study we included uncertainty in our qualitative analysis specifically we described water discharge using return periods of 2 5 10 20 25 100 and 200 years and rainfall durations of 24 and 48 h as model inputs to simulate potential climate changes we also considered an intermediate period 5 10 year scenario during which hydrology conditions and channel evolution could increase the risk of flooding along the puzih river this work applied the rating curve between water discharge and sediment flux as the upstream boundary condition of sediment flux due to the fact that it varies with the flow rate this also made it possible to evaluate sediment transport uncertainty during modeling we performed hec ras simulations to determine the water level flow velocity and its shear stress which helped us to determine the likelihood of levee collapse or overtopping we also used the hec ras model to simulate inundation depth in the event of overtopping inundation area was analyzed via vulnerability analysis the final hydraulic simulations helped to identify the locations in which the levee was the weakest due to a lack of height width or strength we then ran the hec ras model again focusing on these weak locations to elucidate the extent to which flooding would affect the property this made it possible to identify the most important locations for consideration rather than running additional simulations for the entire river the proposed model provides semi quantitative analysis of hazards and vulnerability factors we classified the factors in table 1 and clustered similar factors into groups using an index for ranking risk 3 3 1 semi qualitative hazard factors our analysis of semi qualitative hazard factors considered three groups of risk factors a likelihood of inundation b existing protective measures and c likelihood of flushing group a includes factors related to water level variability in water levels and the depth of erosion or deposition indices were assigned to each component in group a based on the criteria listed in table 2 a after evaluating each component in group a we defined the hazard index of group a as i a based on the product of every component index by using the concept of multiplicative utility functions so did next group b and c keeney 1974 we also divided i a into three levels low inundation likelihood with i a 0 1 intermediate inundation likelihood with i a 2 6 and high inundation likelihood with i a 8 12 note that the numbers in table 2 represent only the relative significance of these factors the assignment of these numbers could vary in accordance with the situation the components in group b indicate whether a given river section is protected by levees and the historical frequency of damage to these structures component indices in group b were assigned in accordance with the criteria in table 2 b after evaluating each component in group b we defined the hazard index as i b based on the product of every component index we also divided i b into three levels no flaws in protection with i b 0 intermediate flaws in protection with i b 1 and significant flaws in protection with i b 2 the component indices in group c were assigned in accordance with the criteria in table 2 c these components include the flow velocity froud number bed scouring depth degree of channel meandering channel curvature ratio between width and depth and width of flood plain the degree of channel meandering was derived as the ratio of river length to valley length curvature was derived as the curvature radius to channel width the other components were derived from model results we designated flow velocity froude number and bed scouring depth to group c1 with the other components designated as c 2 index c1 was defined as the maximum index value of a c1 component we then selected a larger index value c2a from the degree of channel meandering and channel curvature and a still larger value c2b from the ratio between width and depth divided by the width of a flood plain the index of group c i c was defined as the product of c1 and larger value of c2a and c2b similar i c was divided into three levels low level flushing with i c 0 2 intermediate level flushing with i c 3 6 and high level flushing with i c 8 12 3 3 2 semi qualitative vulnerability factors quantitative analysis of vulnerability was based on potential economic losses including the loss of building structures business and agriculture as well as the budget required to compensate for damage vulnerability was further represented using the following terms residential population underprivileged population the existence of major infrastructure local economic and business conditions the existence of flood shelters and the availability of local flood information during the event vulnerability scores were estimated using these factors with predetermined weights for use in ranking the factors in terms of their effect on vulnerability table 3 lists the criteria used in scoring the factors and ranking them low vulnerability indicates limited damage due to levee failure or inundation intermediate vulnerability indicates that an area included a small number of valuable factories or that residents in that area should be able to find shelter despite levee failure high vulnerability indicates that an area included a large number of valuable factories or that residents would be unlikely to find shelter throughout a flood event 3 4 risk evaluation after ranking the factors of hazard and vulnerability we combined them to evaluate the overall risk associated with levees this was achieved using the 3 3 risk matrix in fig 3 where rows in the matrix represent vulnerability and columns represent the hazard level from the bottom left element in this matrix the vulnerability and hazard ranking increase intuitively combining high vulnerability with high hazard level would produce a very high overall risk associated with that levee colors are used to express the risk level as follows red very high levee risk and yellow intermediate levee risk overall levee risk could be used in prioritizing engineering projects as follows very high risk high risk intermediate risk low risk and very low risk when dealing with projects with a comparable level of risk it is recommended that those with a higher risk level be given priority due to the fact that it is more important to deal with hazards than their economic consequences we also constructed a risk map in which color is used to express the various levels of risk in order to facilitate the evaluation of a given study region 3 5 risk treatment risk treatment involves identifying solutions by which to resolve potential problems and presenting them within the context of policy risk treatment is governed by general rules avoiding risk reducing risk reducing the negative effects of risk transferring risk and protecting key areas policy makers should seek to balance the cost and benefits of candidate solutions as well as the efficiency of proposals note that treatment strategies include engineering as well as non engineering methods consider the following example where bridge components are low enough to be affected by flood waters an engineering approach would involve span modification or dredging a non engineering approach would focus on evacuation plans or land use adjustment strategies for decreasing flood risk are briefly outlined in section 4 4 results 4 1 risk analysis results hazard factors we propose a number of methods that could be used to determine hazard factors as reference for risk management as can be seen table 1 a lists each hazard factor and the corresponding methods the details of which are outlined below 4 1 1 water level flushing rainfall effects in this section we used field measurement data wra 2015 and the peak flow derived from 24 and 48 hour dimensionless hydrographs for the hec ras model we used the peak input flow for return periods of 2 5 10 25 100 and 200 years one dimensional hydraulic simulations were conducted using the standard step method based on the water level at the downstream boundary 2 6 m and the estuary of puzih river as starting points for computation wra 2015 manning coefficients for the river from wra 2015 are listed in table 4 note the safety criteria used in managing the puzih river corresponds to a 100 year return period wra 2015 we adopted flood conditions for the same return period in determining whether existing levees function as intended below we briefly summarize hydraulic simulation results from downstream to upstream selected cross sections and corresponding modeling results are listed in table 5 the whole simulation results could be available from table s1 in the downstream segment cross section 0 52 the average width was 200 1400 m and the mean slope was 1 2 128 flow in this section was subcritical with a froude number between 0 14 0 45 for a return period of less than 100 years the average flow velocity was 1 67 m s and the water level was 2 60 15 82 m our simulation results suggest that all cross sections in the downstream section except no 40 would be able to withstand flooding with a 100 year return period the height of levees at cross sections 25 30 was insufficient to prevent the inundation of the flood plain in this region in the midstream segment cross sections 52 85 the average width was 40 570 m and the mean slope was 1 1 000 flow in this region was subcritical with a froude number of 0 15 0 62 for a return period of less than 100 years the average flow velocity was 2 63 m s and the water level was between 15 82 30 12 m our simulation results suggest that for a return period exceeding 100 years inundation is likely at several cross sections both banks 53 59 61 64 64 68 right bank 60 60 1 and 65 67 and left bank 63 and 71 note that this can be attributed to a lower slope in these areas it is expected that all other cross sections would be able to resist flood invasion under peak flow with a 100 year return period in the upstream segment cross sections 85 134 the average width was 40 400 m and the mean slope was 1 78 flow in this area was subcritical or supercritical with froude numbers between 0 24 3 73 for a return period of less than 100 years the average flow velocity was 5 78 m s and water level was 30 12 216 48 m our simulation results revealed that most the cross sections would be able to withstand the peak flow of 100 year return period events nonetheless several cross sections would only withstand the peak flow of 50 year return period events left bank 86 and 100 right bank 104 and 110 and both banks 112 4 1 2 historical flood events a number of historical flood events compromised the ability of the levees to function as intended and must therefore be taken into account in levee risk assessment as shown in table 6 using data from the water resources agency of taiwan and local governmental databases we categorized historical levees failure events at the following points left bank puzih levee shuangxi levee guogou levee and right bank dongshi levee xiaji levee xiashuangxi levee anhe levee and fuxing levee no 1 and 2 4 1 3 flood plain width and meandering effects data related to flood plain width was obtained from the ministry of the interior taiwan we employed the index of sinuosity si and radius of curvature rc to estimate the effects of meandering methods used to obtain si and rc values can be found in leopold and langbein 1966 and rosgen 2001 4 1 4 erosion or deposition effects we used hec ras to model channel evolution based on 24 and 48 h dimensionless hydrographs with return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 years we adopted the edit quasi unsteady flow model in hec ras to avoid overly complex hydraulic interactions in computing erosion and deposition results most of the material in the channel bed was sand wra 2015 therefore we adopted the sediment transport formula proposed by wilcock and crowe 2003 in our simulations note that the maximum erosion depth was limited to 10 m to ensure model stability 4 1 5 hydraulic structures the wra for 2019 was used in our risk factor assessment puzih river is intersected by 9 bridges of inadequate length 15 bridges that are below the elevation of the levee and 4 bridges that are below the elevation of in plain flood water levels 4 2 semi qualitative hazard factor analysis semi qualitative hazard factors were obtained using the methods previously used to derive indexes a b and c section 2 based on the hazard factors mentioned above see figs 4 6 overall the regions with the greatest hazards were adjacent to zhongyangzi industrial park at the following cross sections right bank 50 2 68 and left bank 50 2 64 and 90 101 note that average flood levels adjacent to the industrial park are 0 36 1 5 m higher than the elevation of the banks according to index a the average flood level along the left bank at cross section 54 57 was 0 53 2 61 m higher than the elevation of the banks the likelihood of inundation in most other regions along the puzih river was low or acceptable according to index b current protection some locations were lack of levee protection right bank 2 3 2 24 31 34 1 35 37 1 37 2 46 46 1 85 1 85 2 109 109 1 and left bank 2 4 37 1 37 2 46 1 46 the width of the flood plain at cross sections 24 31 exceeded 500 m however the levees in this area are old and there is insufficient room for reinforcement it is likely therefore that the current levee will be unable to withstand flooding in the future according to index c flushing likelihood median erosion is likely to occur at cross sections 58 and 60 2 due to the high average flow velocities 1 33 and 2 03 m s erosion is also likely to occur on the left bank at cross sections 59 and 61 due to the fact that the levees in this area are unlikely to withstand flooding events with a 100 year return period the hazard distribution revealed high index a and index c values for cross sections 22 23 and 29 35 however existing levees appear to be sufficient to withstand most flooding and erosion 4 3 risk analysis results vulnerability factors vulnerability refers to the loss of assets which can be estimated as a function of inundation area or the degree of erosion deposition hec ras was used to conduct two dimensional flood simulations under specific flood scenarios simulations pertaining to vulnerability were performed only for areas with high index a b or c values our modeling results are presented in fig 7 based on three levels no vulnerability low vulnerability and high vulnerability no vulnerability refers to negligible risk of inundation low vulnerability refers to situations in which inundation affects a few assets and a small number of people with sufficient shelters for all residents high vulnerability refers to situations in which considerable assets and a large number of people are affected by inundation with insufficient shelters for all residents the river sections of high vulnerability were at the following cross sections right bank 21 23 24 31 37 2 37 1 50 2 68 and 74 1 78 and left bank 19 21 24 50 2 64 74 75 and 90 101 the ranked vulnerability maps are presented in fig 8 5 discussion the presented work applied various return period as the model input to simulate the flooding this approach could imply the hydrologic uncertainty while this factor my influence the evaluation of disaster scale and the survivors the public or property distribution that is the hazard and vulnerability would be related to this uncertainty and so were the risk assessment results this paper could combine this uncertainty to consider what the risk would be rather than discussing any fixed scenario 5 1 implications for puzih river the simulation results obtained in this study can be used by policy makers to obtain risk estimates along puzih river fig 9 presents the corresponding risk matrix with hazard and vulnerability factors divided into three qualitative levels which can be combined to produce five risk levels extremely high high moderate low and extremely low the preferred criteria used to arrange the levels are easily obtained from fig 1 note that the risk matrix fig 9 can be used to create a risk map fig 10 or a diagram of problematic levees along puzih river policy makers can use figs 9 and 10 to identify levees that pose a potential danger combining figs 9 and 10 the middle and downstream segments cross sections 0 75 the left bank has one segment of extremely high risk two sections of high risk four segments of moderate risk and one segment of low risk whereas the right bank has one segment of extremely high risk three segments of high risk three segments of moderate risk and two segments of low risk the width of the flood plain adjacent to the middle and downstream segments was enough to accommodate the flow during flood events however in some areas water flow is normal to the bank such that the thalweg position is close to the riverbank resulting in excessive erosion or deposition i e moderate or high risk along with the middle and downstream segments both banks near zhong yang zi industrial area and the left bank near the community of ma yu liao lack sufficient levee protection to prevent inundation such that these areas are designated as areas of high vulnerability some of the river sections were deemed high risk e g xia shuang levee due to the aging of levees and a lack of land for reconstruction the thalweg positions near the puzih shuangxi and gengliao levees render the city centers of puzih and chiayi areas of high risk and high vulnerability the area adjacent to wai shuangxi levee has a relatively low population however it also houses the national palace museum leading to its designation as moderate risk taken together the middle and downstream segments of puzih river should be targeted for flood prevention measures due to a large population important industries and museum collections in the upstream segment cross sections 75 134 the left bank has one section of extremely high risk zero sections of high risk two sections of moderate risk and one section of low risk whereas the right bank has zero sections of extremely high risk one section of high risk two sections of moderate risk and three sections of low risk the region near zhongxing weir is designated as extremely high risk due to significant erosion resulting from high flow velocity at a river bend along the left bank at cross section 95 and a thalweg position close to the bank note also that a community adjacent to this site renders it highly vulnerable to economic loss the minxiong levee is also under high risk due to the fact that the flood plain is not wide enough to deal with the flow during flood events furthermore flow is normal to the bank and the top of the levee and bottom of local bridges are too low rendering jinxing xiulin and houzhuang village and minxiong and houhu industrial parks vulnerable to large economic losses taken together the risk associated with levees in this area is moderate to high 5 2 strategies to ameliorate the risk of flooding flood risk amelioration should begin with the management of channel levees protecting the land from flooding is straightforward as long as it is possible to determine where levee weaknesses are located levee upgrading includes blocking gaps in the levees increasing the width or height strengthening levees and installing new structures it is also important to prevent channel erosion and sediment deposition puzih river is a stable but meandering stream path with a notable channel thalweg which has not migrated considerably in recent years wra 2019 nonetheless there are a number of concave channel sections which are susceptible to further erosion and subsequent levee failure the upstream bed material of puzih river is composed of fragile mudstone which is prone to erosion under the effects of flushing which can lead to sedimentation in flatter downstream sections note that sediment deposition is the primary factor contributing to levee overtopping thus it is important to decrease the volume of sediment transported downstream by the river through watershed management including forest restoration the preservation of vegetation landslide protection and soil conservation note that these efforts should focus particularly on small streams high in the watershed as they are the primary source of sediment it is important to accept the fact that whatever measures are performed in place climate change and extreme weather events make flooding inevitable along most of the river thus policy makers must consider the likelihood of flooding the depth of urban development and the impact of construction projects in the implementation of runoff sharing they must also take inventory of land in the basin as a space for flood sharing and improve regional protection standards to reduce the possibility of disasters 5 3 vulnerability reduction in accordance with our definition of vulnerability our amelioration strategies focus on protecting lives and property through the establishment or improvement of flood warning systems the flood warning system may help to reduce exposure to flooding hence a robust warning system allows policy makers to determine what actions should be taken when it is likely that the levee may not resist the incoming flood the warning system should include the delimitation of potential flooding areas the monitoring of water levels in puzih river the monitoring of rainfall intensity in the puzih river watershed and the monitoring of closed circuit television cctv cameras trained on crucial bridges levees and other structures in the event that flooding cannot be avoided it is important to have well conceived evacuation plans with a list of settlements in the affected area strategies for the transport of equipment and established evacuation routes it is also important for governmental agencies to announce the actions that are expected of citizens and the actions to be implemented by rescue workers during flood events 6 conclusions in this study we sought to semi qualitatively predict the degree of uncertainty in estimating the risk of flooding based on the ranking of risk factors we believe that our simulation results accurately reflect the situation in the study area our results reveal that the most secure levees along puzih river should be able to withstand flood events with a 100 year return period however the levees in several areas fail to provide suitable protection note that in some areas that are unprotected by levees the topography of the surrounding mountains would prevent flooding onto the flood plain overall we did not observe notable thalweg migration such that the flow is limited to the channel rather than either of the banks under these conditions efforts to shore up the levees should proceed under the assumption that the flow direction is normal to the levee with suitable consideration of threats pertaining to foundation erosion it must be remembered that inundation is always a possibility the risk matrix and risk map presented in this study can be used to prioritize levee improvement projects when dealing with multiple situations of comparable risk level we recommend prioritizing situations with a higher risk level due to the fact that preventing disasters is more important than dealing with the consequences flooding is a possibility in some areas where the bridge decks and levees are too low and in other areas where there is a large bend in the river it is important to consider the potential losses that could ensue were flooding to occur in downtown or industrial areas we therefore recommend that policy makers prioritize projects in accordance with the risk map in fig 10 this paper also presents strategies by which to enhance flood protection we recommend that subsequent research focus on the effects of these strategies to improve river management execution credit authorship contribution statement chia chu chu writing original draft writing

2488,risk assessment is necessary to understand whether a levee is safe and able to prevent flood invasion most previous assessment methods attempted to quantitatively assess the risks posed by hydraulic structures using probabilistic analysis from a research perspective the kind of method depends on the probability density function of factors but sometimes difficult to determine either a priori or posteriori in practice on the other hand current semi quantitative methods despite the convenience are somewhat subjective in their implementation this study sought to rectify the shortcomings of previous quantitative and semi quantitative approaches to assessing the risk of levee failure wherein the uncertainty of risk factors is presented within a semi quantitative framework in accordance with iso assessment procedures the risk of levee failure discussed in this work is mainly related to overtopping and erosion of its foundation this study proposed a semi quantitative approach to maintain the exactness and objectivity of the risk assessment of levees and use puzih river in taiwan as a case study in this study we tried to add uncertainty facts and developed a risk assessment framework for levee management using a risk map according to our semi quantitative methods this study firstly defines the risk and associated factors within the context of government regulations then implement a series of risk assessment tasks using the widely used hydraulic and sedimentation transport model hec ras to simulate the risk of inundation where hydrological events are used as a proxy for uncertainty this study considers that consequence of levee failure and compute representative qualitative indices by which to evaluate hazards using a risk map and risk matrix in order to illustrate potential economic losses under given flood scenarios after gaining the levee assessment results the risk map is also built which can be applied on the practical engineering works our results reveal that the most secure levees along puzih river should be able to withstand flood events with a 100 year return period however the levees in a several areas fail to provide suitable protection accordingly this work developed a risk map and corresponding flood prevention strategies to decrease the risk in specific regions for the consideration of rive management administration

of failure via overtopping as a function of hydrology and hydraulic conditions they proposed a probabilistic levee assessment model from the perspective of uncertainty using a poisson process on the other hand the uncertainty of assessing the levee failure was also discussed in mazzoleni et al 2014a s study in their work the monte carlo approach was used to cope with the uncertainty however this method is complex to the field work engineers apel et al 2004 proposed a probabilistic model in which risk uncertainty attributable to natural causes and incomplete knowledge are respectively computed within a monte carlo framework hui et al 2016 developed a levee assessment model that considers geotechnical limitations as well as hydrology and hydraulic conditions many researchers have sought to qualitatively assess the risks imposed by hydraulic structures using probabilistic analysis based on the product of vulnerability and hazard functions cançado et al 2008 karmakar et al 2010 malakeel et al 2021 united states army corps of engineers usace 2018 described the risk of levees within a specific probability distribution as a function of hazard levee performance and consequences the quantitative assessment of risk in the above studies depends on the probability density function of factors used in risk equations despite the difficulty in determining precise probability values a priori or a posteriori in practice tung and mays 1981 fukuoka and tabata 2021 pointed out that uncertainty is inevitable when seeking to determine the probability of failure scientifically unfortunately the detailed and comprehensive probability levee failure assessment is difficult many practical situations only allow engineerings to collect limited parameters influencing the structure safety thererfore some physical related alternatives were developed to assist field works thus methods might establish some indices expressed such as aging history floodind envents or foundation erorsion for the practicality the indices could be semi quantitatively expressed for example mckay et al 1999 reported on the use of the condition index ci by the usace to assess the likelihood of levee failure based on the age of the structure and projections of future events the consequences of potential failures are then used to prioritize situations according to the need for upgrading based on a ci number since 2006 usace has been developing the levee safety program by which to assess the usability of levees they established a database and online levee assessment system based on five discrete classes indicating the need for immediate action usace 2020 serre et al 2008 developed a semi quantitative approach to levee assessment in which levee performance is divided into eleven levels based on geotechnical assessment criteria for use in prioritizing projects according to risk despite their convenience semi quantitative methods are somewhat subjective in their implementation stein et al 1999 the proposed scheme of this study is illustrated using a case study of the puzih watershed system in taiwan this study tries to add uncertain facts to the semi quantitative framework to avoid the complexity of quantitative approaches and subjectivity of traditional semi quantitative assessments in accordance with iso assessment procedures we also developed a risk map and corresponding flood prevention strategies to decrease the risk in specific regions for the consideration of rive management administration the risk map is provided to the decision makers which allows them to set up suitable policies although various strategies might diminish the flood risk castellarin et al 2011 mazzoleni et al 2014b the management effects were not focused on in this paper 2 study area in this project we selected as a case study the puzih river in taiwan which is 75 87 km in length with an average slope of 1 2 100 as shown in fig 2 the river drains a watershed measuring 426 6 km2 in the current study the upstream boundary of puzih river is jinfu bridge cross section 134 the reader could refer this location from fig 4 and the downstream boundary is at the estuary cross section 0 the river encompasses upstream midstream and downstream sections the upstream extends from niuchouxi bridge cross section 74 to jinfu bridge cross section 134 with a sinuosity of 1 12 the midstream section extends from xinpi drainage intersection cross section 34 to niuchouxi bridge cross section 75 with a sinuosity of 1 51 the downstream section extends from the estuary cross section 0 to xinpi drainage intersection cross section 34 with sinuosity of 1 51 the average slopes from upstream to downstream are 1 44 1 119 and 1 128 respectively recent observations have revealed obvious indications of channel deposition in midstream and downstream sections with significant erosion in the upstream side section wra 2019 note that sediment transport rate from upstream can be attributed primarily to a steep channel slope note also that water carrying a high sediment concentration tends to induce strong shear stress on the foundation of hydraulic structures leading to erosion a decrease in the slope of the channel after passing zhuqi valley reduces water velocity resulting in deposition variations in the thalweg and the formation of sand bars which tends to increase the velocity of water flow adjacent to the banks the corresponding bank erosion can also trigger landslides thereby rendering structures along the puzih river susceptible to failure regular inspection of levees along the puzih river revealed a number of age related failures including gengliao levee xibei levee wannei levee puzih levee and guogou levee these failures do not necessarily represent critical hazards however the long term effects cannot be disregarded in any risk assessment heavy rainfall has also been shown to cause occasional flooding associated with levee failure most of these events can be attributed to river meandering channel deposition tidal effects land subsidence due to over pumping and extreme rainfall in the results section of this paper we also indicate the areas and times of levee repair after flooding in 1991 and 2014 3 methodology in this study we developed a risk assessment framework for levee management using risk identification risk analysis and risk evaluation as outlined in iso 31000 2018 e hutchins 2018 risk identification refers to the process of finding recognizing and describing risks risk analysis refers to the process by which one identifies the nature and severity of the identified risks risk evaluation refers to the process of determining whether the magnitude of the identified risk is tolerable generally this process leads to a series of actions by which to mediate eliminate risks and or deal with the consequences in the proposed framework we first define the risk and associated factors within the context of government regulations we then implement a series of risk assessment tasks using a numerical model to simulate the risk of inundation where hydrological events are used as a proxy for uncertainty we also compute representative qualitative indices by which to evaluate hazards using a risk map and risk matrix in order to illustrate potential economic losses under given flood scenarios simulated by hec ras our hec ras computation used 5 5 m digital elevation model provided by the ministry of interior taiwan the upstream boundary condition was discharge for events with a 100 year return period and the downstream boundary condition was the normal depth we assumed that levee failure would occur roughly 1 5 h after the flood peak fig 1 presents a flowchart of this study 3 1 risk definition risk is widely treated as the product of hazard and vulnerability united nations department of humanitarian affairs undha 1992 schneider 2002 kron 2005 here hazard refers to the probability and severity of flood occurrence whereas vulnerability refers to the potential for economic damage in flood prone areas and recovery capacity based on the assumption that hazard and vulnerability can both be assessed qualitatively we adopted the same approach to assessing risk through the procedures of risk identification risk analysis risk evaluation and risk treatment 3 2 risk identification the fact that levee failures tend to be multi factorial underlines the importance of identifying and categorizing risk factors as hazard related and vulnerability related the risk identification is to determine the hazard and vulnerability that we focused on in this study note that any risk factors that are not identified at this stage are omitted from analysis as shown in table 1 we inventoried hazard and vulnerability factors commonly identified suggested in taiwan water resources agency wra 2019 table 1 also lists the methods used to analyze and quantitatively assess the various factors in order to facilitate semi qualitative risk analysis 3 3 risk analysis risk analysis in the current study was used to estimate the probability of an event occurring and determine whether the risks could be assessed quantitatively based on objective measurements or qualitatively based on subjective judgment and experience note that qualitative analysis can be used to estimate the relative likelihood of an event inducing levee failure however this approach does not involve the rigorous assessment of physical mechanisms thereby making it difficult to compare the results from other regions nonetheless this approach provides a simple tool by which to assess risk quickly and easily using basic survey data of the study area quantitative analysis involves the rigorous application of mathematical physical and statistical principles to measured data to enable the formulation of numerical models by which to derive flow rates water velocity and shear stress note however that quantitative analysis must also account for uncertainty pertaining to the probability of levee failure and corresponding economic losses quantitative methods are ostensibly objective however inevitable simplifications in the formulation of numerical models can lead to erroneous results a numerical model with overly conservative assumptions would render simulation results that are of no practical value to policy makers furthermore such assumptions render the results highly susceptible to risk factor estimates and the selection of numerical models thus it is essential that prediction models account for uncertainty in the current study we employed the hydraulic and sediment transportation model hec ras which is widely used worldwide hec ras has proven effective in modeling 1 d and 2 d simulations of hydraulic and inundation problems we first used the hec ras model to simulate the entire channel in order to identify the conditions under which the levee would be unable to fulfill its intended function we then used the model to study specific locations subject to inundation or overtopping in the current study we included uncertainty in our qualitative analysis specifically we described water discharge using return periods of 2 5 10 20 25 100 and 200 years and rainfall durations of 24 and 48 h as model inputs to simulate potential climate changes we also considered an intermediate period 5 10 year scenario during which hydrology conditions and channel evolution could increase the risk of flooding along the puzih river this work applied the rating curve between water discharge and sediment flux as the upstream boundary condition of sediment flux due to the fact that it varies with the flow rate this also made it possible to evaluate sediment transport uncertainty during modeling we performed hec ras simulations to determine the water level flow velocity and its shear stress which helped us to determine the likelihood of levee collapse or overtopping we also used the hec ras model to simulate inundation depth in the event of overtopping inundation area was analyzed via vulnerability analysis the final hydraulic simulations helped to identify the locations in which the levee was the weakest due to a lack of height width or strength we then ran the hec ras model again focusing on these weak locations to elucidate the extent to which flooding would affect the property this made it possible to identify the most important locations for consideration rather than running additional simulations for the entire river the proposed model provides semi quantitative analysis of hazards and vulnerability factors we classified the factors in table 1 and clustered similar factors into groups using an index for ranking risk 3 3 1 semi qualitative hazard factors our analysis of semi qualitative hazard factors considered three groups of risk factors a likelihood of inundation b existing protective measures and c likelihood of flushing group a includes factors related to water level variability in water levels and the depth of erosion or deposition indices were assigned to each component in group a based on the criteria listed in table 2 a after evaluating each component in group a we defined the hazard index of group a as i a based on the product of every component index by using the concept of multiplicative utility functions so did next group b and c keeney 1974 we also divided i a into three levels low inundation likelihood with i a 0 1 intermediate inundation likelihood with i a 2 6 and high inundation likelihood with i a 8 12 note that the numbers in table 2 represent only the relative significance of these factors the assignment of these numbers could vary in accordance with the situation the components in group b indicate whether a given river section is protected by levees and the historical frequency of damage to these structures component indices in group b were assigned in accordance with the criteria in table 2 b after evaluating each component in group b we defined the hazard index as i b based on the product of every component index we also divided i b into three levels no flaws in protection with i b 0 intermediate flaws in protection with i b 1 and significant flaws in protection with i b 2 the component indices in group c were assigned in accordance with the criteria in table 2 c these components include the flow velocity froud number bed scouring depth degree of channel meandering channel curvature ratio between width and depth and width of flood plain the degree of channel meandering was derived as the ratio of river length to valley length curvature was derived as the curvature radius to channel width the other components were derived from model results we designated flow velocity froude number and bed scouring depth to group c1 with the other components designated as c 2 index c1 was defined as the maximum index value of a c1 component we then selected a larger index value c2a from the degree of channel meandering and channel curvature and a still larger value c2b from the ratio between width and depth divided by the width of a flood plain the index of group c i c was defined as the product of c1 and larger value of c2a and c2b similar i c was divided into three levels low level flushing with i c 0 2 intermediate level flushing with i c 3 6 and high level flushing with i c 8 12 3 3 2 semi qualitative vulnerability factors quantitative analysis of vulnerability was based on potential economic losses including the loss of building structures business and agriculture as well as the budget required to compensate for damage vulnerability was further represented using the following terms residential population underprivileged population the existence of major infrastructure local economic and business conditions the existence of flood shelters and the availability of local flood information during the event vulnerability scores were estimated using these factors with predetermined weights for use in ranking the factors in terms of their effect on vulnerability table 3 lists the criteria used in scoring the factors and ranking them low vulnerability indicates limited damage due to levee failure or inundation intermediate vulnerability indicates that an area included a small number of valuable factories or that residents in that area should be able to find shelter despite levee failure high vulnerability indicates that an area included a large number of valuable factories or that residents would be unlikely to find shelter throughout a flood event 3 4 risk evaluation after ranking the factors of hazard and vulnerability we combined them to evaluate the overall risk associated with levees this was achieved using the 3 3 risk matrix in fig 3 where rows in the matrix represent vulnerability and columns represent the hazard level from the bottom left element in this matrix the vulnerability and hazard ranking increase intuitively combining high vulnerability with high hazard level would produce a very high overall risk associated with that levee colors are used to express the risk level as follows red very high levee risk and yellow intermediate levee risk overall levee risk could be used in prioritizing engineering projects as follows very high risk high risk intermediate risk low risk and very low risk when dealing with projects with a comparable level of risk it is recommended that those with a higher risk level be given priority due to the fact that it is more important to deal with hazards than their economic consequences we also constructed a risk map in which color is used to express the various levels of risk in order to facilitate the evaluation of a given study region 3 5 risk treatment risk treatment involves identifying solutions by which to resolve potential problems and presenting them within the context of policy risk treatment is governed by general rules avoiding risk reducing risk reducing the negative effects of risk transferring risk and protecting key areas policy makers should seek to balance the cost and benefits of candidate solutions as well as the efficiency of proposals note that treatment strategies include engineering as well as non engineering methods consider the following example where bridge components are low enough to be affected by flood waters an engineering approach would involve span modification or dredging a non engineering approach would focus on evacuation plans or land use adjustment strategies for decreasing flood risk are briefly outlined in section 4 4 results 4 1 risk analysis results hazard factors we propose a number of methods that could be used to determine hazard factors as reference for risk management as can be seen table 1 a lists each hazard factor and the corresponding methods the details of which are outlined below 4 1 1 water level flushing rainfall effects in this section we used field measurement data wra 2015 and the peak flow derived from 24 and 48 hour dimensionless hydrographs for the hec ras model we used the peak input flow for return periods of 2 5 10 25 100 and 200 years one dimensional hydraulic simulations were conducted using the standard step method based on the water level at the downstream boundary 2 6 m and the estuary of puzih river as starting points for computation wra 2015 manning coefficients for the river from wra 2015 are listed in table 4 note the safety criteria used in managing the puzih river corresponds to a 100 year return period wra 2015 we adopted flood conditions for the same return period in determining whether existing levees function as intended below we briefly summarize hydraulic simulation results from downstream to upstream selected cross sections and corresponding modeling results are listed in table 5 the whole simulation results could be available from table s1 in the downstream segment cross section 0 52 the average width was 200 1400 m and the mean slope was 1 2 128 flow in this section was subcritical with a froude number between 0 14 0 45 for a return period of less than 100 years the average flow velocity was 1 67 m s and the water level was 2 60 15 82 m our simulation results suggest that all cross sections in the downstream section except no 40 would be able to withstand flooding with a 100 year return period the height of levees at cross sections 25 30 was insufficient to prevent the inundation of the flood plain in this region in the midstream segment cross sections 52 85 the average width was 40 570 m and the mean slope was 1 1 000 flow in this region was subcritical with a froude number of 0 15 0 62 for a return period of less than 100 years the average flow velocity was 2 63 m s and the water level was between 15 82 30 12 m our simulation results suggest that for a return period exceeding 100 years inundation is likely at several cross sections both banks 53 59 61 64 64 68 right bank 60 60 1 and 65 67 and left bank 63 and 71 note that this can be attributed to a lower slope in these areas it is expected that all other cross sections would be able to resist flood invasion under peak flow with a 100 year return period in the upstream segment cross sections 85 134 the average width was 40 400 m and the mean slope was 1 78 flow in this area was subcritical or supercritical with froude numbers between 0 24 3 73 for a return period of less than 100 years the average flow velocity was 5 78 m s and water level was 30 12 216 48 m our simulation results revealed that most the cross sections would be able to withstand the peak flow of 100 year return period events nonetheless several cross sections would only withstand the peak flow of 50 year return period events left bank 86 and 100 right bank 104 and 110 and both banks 112 4 1 2 historical flood events a number of historical flood events compromised the ability of the levees to function as intended and must therefore be taken into account in levee risk assessment as shown in table 6 using data from the water resources agency of taiwan and local governmental databases we categorized historical levees failure events at the following points left bank puzih levee shuangxi levee guogou levee and right bank dongshi levee xiaji levee xiashuangxi levee anhe levee and fuxing levee no 1 and 2 4 1 3 flood plain width and meandering effects data related to flood plain width was obtained from the ministry of the interior taiwan we employed the index of sinuosity si and radius of curvature rc to estimate the effects of meandering methods used to obtain si and rc values can be found in leopold and langbein 1966 and rosgen 2001 4 1 4 erosion or deposition effects we used hec ras to model channel evolution based on 24 and 48 h dimensionless hydrographs with return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 years we adopted the edit quasi unsteady flow model in hec ras to avoid overly complex hydraulic interactions in computing erosion and deposition results most of the material in the channel bed was sand wra 2015 therefore we adopted the sediment transport formula proposed by wilcock and crowe 2003 in our simulations note that the maximum erosion depth was limited to 10 m to ensure model stability 4 1 5 hydraulic structures the wra for 2019 was used in our risk factor assessment puzih river is intersected by 9 bridges of inadequate length 15 bridges that are below the elevation of the levee and 4 bridges that are below the elevation of in plain flood water levels 4 2 semi qualitative hazard factor analysis semi qualitative hazard factors were obtained using the methods previously used to derive indexes a b and c section 2 based on the hazard factors mentioned above see figs 4 6 overall the regions with the greatest hazards were adjacent to zhongyangzi industrial park at the following cross sections right bank 50 2 68 and left bank 50 2 64 and 90 101 note that average flood levels adjacent to the industrial park are 0 36 1 5 m higher than the elevation of the banks according to index a the average flood level along the left bank at cross section 54 57 was 0 53 2 61 m higher than the elevation of the banks the likelihood of inundation in most other regions along the puzih river was low or acceptable according to index b current protection some locations were lack of levee protection right bank 2 3 2 24 31 34 1 35 37 1 37 2 46 46 1 85 1 85 2 109 109 1 and left bank 2 4 37 1 37 2 46 1 46 the width of the flood plain at cross sections 24 31 exceeded 500 m however the levees in this area are old and there is insufficient room for reinforcement it is likely therefore that the current levee will be unable to withstand flooding in the future according to index c flushing likelihood median erosion is likely to occur at cross sections 58 and 60 2 due to the high average flow velocities 1 33 and 2 03 m s erosion is also likely to occur on the left bank at cross sections 59 and 61 due to the fact that the levees in this area are unlikely to withstand flooding events with a 100 year return period the hazard distribution revealed high index a and index c values for cross sections 22 23 and 29 35 however existing levees appear to be sufficient to withstand most flooding and erosion 4 3 risk analysis results vulnerability factors vulnerability refers to the loss of assets which can be estimated as a function of inundation area or the degree of erosion deposition hec ras was used to conduct two dimensional flood simulations under specific flood scenarios simulations pertaining to vulnerability were performed only for areas with high index a b or c values our modeling results are presented in fig 7 based on three levels no vulnerability low vulnerability and high vulnerability no vulnerability refers to negligible risk of inundation low vulnerability refers to situations in which inundation affects a few assets and a small number of people with sufficient shelters for all residents high vulnerability refers to situations in which considerable assets and a large number of people are affected by inundation with insufficient shelters for all residents the river sections of high vulnerability were at the following cross sections right bank 21 23 24 31 37 2 37 1 50 2 68 and 74 1 78 and left bank 19 21 24 50 2 64 74 75 and 90 101 the ranked vulnerability maps are presented in fig 8 5 discussion the presented work applied various return period as the model input to simulate the flooding this approach could imply the hydrologic uncertainty while this factor my influence the evaluation of disaster scale and the survivors the public or property distribution that is the hazard and vulnerability would be related to this uncertainty and so were the risk assessment results this paper could combine this uncertainty to consider what the risk would be rather than discussing any fixed scenario 5 1 implications for puzih river the simulation results obtained in this study can be used by policy makers to obtain risk estimates along puzih river fig 9 presents the corresponding risk matrix with hazard and vulnerability factors divided into three qualitative levels which can be combined to produce five risk levels extremely high high moderate low and extremely low the preferred criteria used to arrange the levels are easily obtained from fig 1 note that the risk matrix fig 9 can be used to create a risk map fig 10 or a diagram of problematic levees along puzih river policy makers can use figs 9 and 10 to identify levees that pose a potential danger combining figs 9 and 10 the middle and downstream segments cross sections 0 75 the left bank has one segment of extremely high risk two sections of high risk four segments of moderate risk and one segment of low risk whereas the right bank has one segment of extremely high risk three segments of high risk three segments of moderate risk and two segments of low risk the width of the flood plain adjacent to the middle and downstream segments was enough to accommodate the flow during flood events however in some areas water flow is normal to the bank such that the thalweg position is close to the riverbank resulting in excessive erosion or deposition i e moderate or high risk along with the middle and downstream segments both banks near zhong yang zi industrial area and the left bank near the community of ma yu liao lack sufficient levee protection to prevent inundation such that these areas are designated as areas of high vulnerability some of the river sections were deemed high risk e g xia shuang levee due to the aging of levees and a lack of land for reconstruction the thalweg positions near the puzih shuangxi and gengliao levees render the city centers of puzih and chiayi areas of high risk and high vulnerability the area adjacent to wai shuangxi levee has a relatively low population however it also houses the national palace museum leading to its designation as moderate risk taken together the middle and downstream segments of puzih river should be targeted for flood prevention measures due to a large population important industries and museum collections in the upstream segment cross sections 75 134 the left bank has one section of extremely high risk zero sections of high risk two sections of moderate risk and one section of low risk whereas the right bank has zero sections of extremely high risk one section of high risk two sections of moderate risk and three sections of low risk the region near zhongxing weir is designated as extremely high risk due to significant erosion resulting from high flow velocity at a river bend along the left bank at cross section 95 and a thalweg position close to the bank note also that a community adjacent to this site renders it highly vulnerable to economic loss the minxiong levee is also under high risk due to the fact that the flood plain is not wide enough to deal with the flow during flood events furthermore flow is normal to the bank and the top of the levee and bottom of local bridges are too low rendering jinxing xiulin and houzhuang village and minxiong and houhu industrial parks vulnerable to large economic losses taken together the risk associated with levees in this area is moderate to high 5 2 strategies to ameliorate the risk of flooding flood risk amelioration should begin with the management of channel levees protecting the land from flooding is straightforward as long as it is possible to determine where levee weaknesses are located levee upgrading includes blocking gaps in the levees increasing the width or height strengthening levees and installing new structures it is also important to prevent channel erosion and sediment deposition puzih river is a stable but meandering stream path with a notable channel thalweg which has not migrated considerably in recent years wra 2019 nonetheless there are a number of concave channel sections which are susceptible to further erosion and subsequent levee failure the upstream bed material of puzih river is composed of fragile mudstone which is prone to erosion under the effects of flushing which can lead to sedimentation in flatter downstream sections note that sediment deposition is the primary factor contributing to levee overtopping thus it is important to decrease the volume of sediment transported downstream by the river through watershed management including forest restoration the preservation of vegetation landslide protection and soil conservation note that these efforts should focus particularly on small streams high in the watershed as they are the primary source of sediment it is important to accept the fact that whatever measures are performed in place climate change and extreme weather events make flooding inevitable along most of the river thus policy makers must consider the likelihood of flooding the depth of urban development and the impact of construction projects in the implementation of runoff sharing they must also take inventory of land in the basin as a space for flood sharing and improve regional protection standards to reduce the possibility of disasters 5 3 vulnerability reduction in accordance with our definition of vulnerability our amelioration strategies focus on protecting lives and property through the establishment or improvement of flood warning systems the flood warning system may help to reduce exposure to flooding hence a robust warning system allows policy makers to determine what actions should be taken when it is likely that the levee may not resist the incoming flood the warning system should include the delimitation of potential flooding areas the monitoring of water levels in puzih river the monitoring of rainfall intensity in the puzih river watershed and the monitoring of closed circuit television cctv cameras trained on crucial bridges levees and other structures in the event that flooding cannot be avoided it is important to have well conceived evacuation plans with a list of settlements in the affected area strategies for the transport of equipment and established evacuation routes it is also important for governmental agencies to announce the actions that are expected of citizens and the actions to be implemented by rescue workers during flood events 6 conclusions in this study we sought to semi qualitatively predict the degree of uncertainty in estimating the risk of flooding based on the ranking of risk factors we believe that our simulation results accurately reflect the situation in the study area our results reveal that the most secure levees along puzih river should be able to withstand flood events with a 100 year return period however the levees in several areas fail to provide suitable protection note that in some areas that are unprotected by levees the topography of the surrounding mountains would prevent flooding onto the flood plain overall we did not observe notable thalweg migration such that the flow is limited to the channel rather than either of the banks under these conditions efforts to shore up the levees should proceed under the assumption that the flow direction is normal to the levee with suitable consideration of threats pertaining to foundation erosion it must be remembered that inundation is always a possibility the risk matrix and risk map presented in this study can be used to prioritize levee improvement projects when dealing with multiple situations of comparable risk level we recommend prioritizing situations with a higher risk level due to the fact that preventing disasters is more important than dealing with the consequences flooding is a possibility in some areas where the bridge decks and levees are too low and in other areas where there is a large bend in the river it is important to consider the potential losses that could ensue were flooding to occur in downtown or industrial areas we therefore recommend that policy makers prioritize projects in accordance with the risk map in fig 10 this paper also presents strategies by which to enhance flood protection we recommend that subsequent research focus on the effects of these strategies to improve river management execution credit authorship contribution statement chia chu chu writing original draft writing

et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 and the impact of policies has recently received extensive attention e g socio hydrology has made great efforts to answer this question sivapalan et al 2012 sivapalan et al 2014 varis et al 2019 york et al 2019 many policies have been proposed to protect the environment and ensure the sustainable development of the social economy for example to avoid the costly pendulum swings between water resource development and environmental protection a directed government interventionist policy was conducted to achieve environmentally sustainable outcomes in themurrumbidgeeriverbasin easternaustralia circa 2007 kandasamy et al 2014 similar policies were also proposed in the kissimmee river basin in florida and the dommel basin in belgium and the netherlands in approximately 1990 chen et al 2016 mostert 2018 in china after rapid economic development from 1978 to 2000 which came at the expense of the environment the chinese government officially proposed the ecological civilization policy zhang et al 2018 the ecological civilization policy is a stricter environmental policy that aims to build a social form with the primary purpose of harmonious coexistence a virtuous circle overall development and sustainable prosperity between humans and nature pan 2012 xiao and zhao 2017 sha and iop 2018 lu et al 2019 due to the crucial role of water in ecosystem stability and supporting human development falkenmark 2001 ceola et al 2016 the ecological civilization policy is committed to solving the shortage of water resources deterioration of the water environment and other water problems which will inevitably affect the hwr zhou et al 2018 tian et al 2021 most studies on ecological civilization policy focus on constructing an evaluation index system and most indicators mainly consist of changes in water systems tian et al 2021 yang et al 2021a however it is still unclear how related policies such as the ecological civilization policy advocated by the chinese government affect the hwr analysing the long term evolution of the hwr is one of the critical methods used to reveal the impact of policies on the hwr sivapalan et al 2012 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 currently some scholars have tried to overcome the limitations of relying on detailed statistical and hydrological data in researching the short term evolution of the hwr they have studied the long term evolution of the hwr over more than one thousand years using historical literature palaeoclimate reconstruction and classical hydrological methods ahmad et al 2018 bao and zou 2018 zhao et al 2020 zuo et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 zuo et al 2022 for example liu et al 2014 used the tarim river basin in western china as an example they discussed the historical evolution of the human water coupling system in three stable periods in the past 2000 years and defined four general types of social hydrological systems based on the taiji tire model lu et al 2015 reconstructed the water balance of the heihe river basin in northern china over the past 2000 years according to transition theory and the change rate of population human water consumption and natural oasis area are used to quantitatively analyse the evolution of the hwr wang et al 2017 took china from 722 bce to 1911 ce as an example studied the three contradictory relations of the human water coupling system climate change and war conditions productivity and production relationships from the perspective of contradiction and coevolution and divided the coevolution process of these three contradictions into three stages wu et al 2020 took the loess plateau of china as an example and proposed a method to determine the stage change of the social ecosystems according to the difference in the relationship between population cultivated land area and forestland area in the social ecosystems in the past 1000 years and comprehensively considered the influence of driving factors such as temperature precipitation drought and flood disasters and war generally the above studies that analyse the long term evolution of the hwr mainly express the changes in water systems in the hwr using various indicators such as temperature dry and wet climate or precipitation in addition runoff is also an important part of the water cycle process its amounts are affected by many factors such as precipitation temperature and land use cover change lucc which can more directly and comprehensively reflect the evolution of the hwr sivapalan et al 2003 lu et al 2015 therefore the impact of policies on the hwr can be effectively revealed through the analysis of the long term evolution of the hwr by reconstructing the water cycle process tunpu is a unique area in guizhou province china with a unique culture and a 600 year history of water resource development in 1902 the japanese scholar torii ryuzo discovered hundreds of tunpu villages with a history of 600 years in the mountainous area of central guizhou province ge et al 2022 which is inhabited by hundreds of thousands of han immigrants from nanjing in the lower reaches of the yangtze river furthermore tun and pu in chinese translate to inhabited places of immigrants and military castles respectively which were built for military operations and immigration policy of the ming dynasty 1368 1644 known as transferring the north to conquer the south as tunpu is located in the southwest mountain area of china and has been isolated for a long time they retained the clothing and culture of the ming dynasty and were not affected by the qing dynasty 1644 1912 therefore tunpu formed a precious and characteristic culture and is referred to as the living fossil of human social development and has been protected by the state nie 2017 for example due to advanced farming technology and the ability to build water conservation projects of the han nationality immigrants the tunpu people could efficiently utilize water resources and maintain a harmonious hwr as far back as 600 years ago zhang and pang 2007 today china faces severe resource constraints serious environmental pollution and ecosystem degradation caused by accelerated socioeconomic development tunpu and its location in guizhou province china s national ecological civilization experimental area have implemented a series of ecological civilization policies jiang et al 2014 overall tunpu represents the history of water conservancy development in the mountainous areas of southwestern china and is suitable for studying the long term evolution of the hwr to reveal the impact of policies based on an improved water balance formula and a new technology known as remote sensing hydrological station rshs we reconstructed the water cycle process spanning nearly 600 years in the typical tunpu village named baojia tun and its basin and revealed the long term evolution of the hwr and the impact of policies on the hwr the main research contents include three points 1 historical and modern water cycle processes at the village scale are reconstructed 2 then 600 years of lucc was retrieved using historical data and remote sensing data and the water cycle process at the basin scale was reconstructed over the past 600 years 3 based on transition theory the key time nodes of the evolution of the hwr are determined and the impact of policies such as the ecological civilization policy on the hwr is revealed 2 study area a typical tunpu village named baojia tun and its basin are taken as the study area which is located on the anshun plain guizhou province china 105 975 e 106 366 e 26 159 n 26 463 n tunpu is mainly located in the yangchang river basin which belongs to the wujiang river system with a drainage area of 721 78 km2 fig 1 a the basin has a north subtropical monsoon humid climate with an annual average temperature of 14 15 c and annual precipitation of 1200 1300 mm karst is widely distributed in the yangchang river basin resulting in the extensive development of underground cracks pipelines caves and underground streams the water conservation capacity is poor and the surface water permeability is high leading to a deficiency in surface water resources significant soil erosion and rocky desertification bai et al 2013 dubois et al 2014 qin et al 2015 as early as 1382 baojia tun was inhabited by many han immigrants they were distinct from the surrounding ethnic minorities and han nationalities in their clothing language architecture customs and culture fig 1b moreover small water conservancy projects such as backwater weirs fish mouth water diversion water powered rollers and water mills were built and have been well preserved these projects could efficiently utilize their water resources which included irrigating paddy fields at different altitudes effectively resisting drought and flood discharges and providing domestic water and hydropower for the entire village these projects combine aesthetic and hydraulic theories to form a highly integrated picture of the artificial and natural environments effectively maintaining the surrounding natural eco environment and symbolising a harmonious hwr fig 1c and fig 1d 3 methods and data 1 reconstruction of the water cycle process at the village scale to analyse the changes in the water cycle process at the village scale an improved water balance formula that considers irrigation water and domestic water is constructed for historical the ming dynasty 1470 and modern 2020 times the formula is as follows 1 p e t δ w d w r where p is the precipitation m3 et is the actual evapotranspiration m3 δw is the change in basin water storage which means the fluctuation of soil moisture and can be regarded as 0 during the multiyear analysis lu et al 2015 dw refers to the total domestic water consumption which is set as 100 l capita day 1 according to the water resources bulletin of anshun city guizhou province china and r is the total runoff m3 the acquisition of land use cover data is necessary for completing water balance calculations historical village land use cover data can usually be obtained from old pictures in the literature zhou and xu 2018 modern land use cover data can be obtained using widely used datasets such as global 30 m land use cover data provided by the national geomatics center of china available at https g1c30 tianditu com the formula for calculating actual evapotranspiration is based on the budyko hypothesis proposed by fu 1981 formula 2 in addition cultivated lands are divided into paddy fields and dry lands and the water sources for evapotranspiration from paddy fields include not only precipitation but also irrigation water formula 3 furthermore the change in the impact of human irrigation water intake on the water cycle process can also be calculated by controlling the parameters of the budyko formula formula 4 2 et p 1 et 0 p 1 et 0 p w 1 w 3 p paddy p i 4 i δ et paddy i b where et 0 is the potential evapotranspiration m3 w is the basin scale model parameter p paddy is the quantity of water resources that can be used for evapotranspiration in paddy fields m3 i and ib are the irrigation water and irrigation backwater amounts m3 where i is set as 795 mm per year according to the water resources bulletin of anshun city guizhou province china and δ et paddy is the difference between evapotranspiration with irrigation and that without irrigation m3 it is noteworthy that temperature is one of the most influential factors of et 0 and et 0 increases by 7 08 mm a 1 for a 1 c increase in temperature zhang et al 2014 thus et 0 can be reconstructed from 1470 to 2000 according to the temperature reconstruction in southeastern china in the past 2000 years wen et al 2021 and is set as 1464 41 and 1470 345 mm in 1470 and 2020 respectively furthermore the research of lu et al 2015 directly set w to 3 5 in an arid basin and it does not apply to the research of humid basins therefore w of forestland cultivated land grassland and construction land are set to 2 5 1 6 1 55 and 1 35 respectively and the et of water bodies is equal to et 0 as a result the et ranking of different land use cover types water body forestland cultivated land grassland construction land was the same as that proposed by liu et al 2010 and the average calculated et from 2001 to 2020 was 716 65 mm which is mostly consistent with the average et derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data from 2001 to 2020 of 719 03 mm huang et al 2021 2 reconstruction of the water cycle process at the basin scale the water balance formula for reconstructing the water cycle process at the basin scale is the same as that of the village scale the measured surface runoff data can be used to analyse the reliability of the runoff calculated by the water balance formula due to the small size of the basin and lack of continuous hydrological observation data in the yangchang river basin rshs technology can be used to address the difficulty of obtaining surface runoff data in ungauged basins yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 lou et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 wufu et al 2021 yang et al 2021b the rshs method uses an unmanned aerial vehicle uav to assist field surveys in generating a digital river model with terrain data accuracies as small as the centimetre level then the long term river width data can be inverted according to the subpixel decomposition method and the multisource satellite remote sensing normalized difference water index ndwi data in the google earth engine formula 5 finally based on the manning formula the long term surface runoff data can be estimated by calculating hydraulic parameters such as overflow area hydraulic radius and wetted perimeter length to a specific river width formula 6 5 w i 1 x pa vl ndwi i n d w i wt ndwi i n d w i lt ndw i wt n d w i lt pa vl n d w i lt ndwi i n d w i wt 0 ndwi i n d w i lt 6 r w v a k n hr 2 3 j 1 2 a h r l a where w is the average river width of the selected river valley m x is the total number of pixels in the selected river valley ndwi i is the ndwi of pixel i ndw i lt and ndw i wt are the ndwi thresholds of land and water respectively pa is the area of each pixel m2 vl is the length of the selected river valley m r w is the estimated runoff corresponding to river width w m3 v is the flow velocity m s 1 k is the conversion constant k 1 n is the roughness which comprehensively reflects the impacts of the river channel roughness on river runoff n 0 035 hr is the hydraulic radius m j is the slope measured by uav remote sensing image l is the wetted perimeter length m and a is the overflow area m2 hr l and a are calculated based on the river width and digital river model in addition the method for calculating evapotranspiration is generally the same as that for the village scale and only the part that obtains the land use cover data is distinct the lucc before 1980 consisted mainly of transformations of cultivated land and forestland pan 2021 so if the changes in cultivated land areas from 1470 to 1980 are obtained the land use cover data in the historical period can be reconstructed furthermore the spatial distribution of lucc is of great significance for studying the evolution of the hwr and an index called the cultivated land expansion index clei is constructed to reflect the sequence of cultivated land expansion formula 7 7 clei α 1 n h d α 2 n r d α 3 n s n h d h d hd max hd min n r d r d rd max rd min a s 00 s 0 25 10 25 s 1 where clei is the cultivated land expansion index clei 0 1 the closer clei is to 0 and the more likely this pixel is to be developed into cultivated land earlier nhd nrd and as are the normalized habitation distance normalized river distance and adjusted slope respectively α 1 α 2 and α 3 are weight coefficients α 1 α 2 α 3 1 3 hd rd and s are the habitation distance river distance and slope of one pixel respectively and hd max hd min rd max and rd min are the maximum habitation distance minimum habitation distance maximum river distance and minimum river distance of the whole basin respectively m 3 generation of historical precipitation the generation of historical precipitation is important for reconstructing the water cycle process there is an atlas named atlas with yearly charts of dryness wetness in china for the last 500 year period according to the chinese historical documents covering the 120 documented sites this atlas systematically reproduces the general characteristics of the annual dryness and wetness distributions for the 531 years from 1470 to 2000 institute of meteorological sciences 1981 zhang and liu 1993 zhang et al 2003 this atlas uses five dryness wetness index dwi categories as the dividing indicators to classify drought and flood events with 1 being the wettest year and 5 being the driest year this atlas is available at https www sslibrary com page 239443 show and is widely used in palaeoclimate research in china song 2000 qian et al 2003a ren et al 2010 gong et al 2011 feng et al 2013 lee et al 2015 lu et al 2015 yang et al 2016 zheng et al 2021 wang et al 2022 to further verify the reliability of this atlas it will also be compared with the palaeoclimatic monsoon asian drought atlas mada dataset cook et al 2010 and a gridded dwi grid dwi dataset yang et al 2013 mada is the reconstruction of the palmerdroughtseverityindex pdsi from 1300 to 2000 based on the tree ring chronology network and the spatial resolution remains at 2 5 2 5 available at https www ncei noaa gov access paleo search grid dwi is a 2 5 2 5 grid dataset interpolated from the atlas with yearly charts of dryness wetness in china for the last 500 year period for 1470 2000 available in the supplemental material of yang et al 2013 it is noteworthy that the higher the pdsi value of mada is the wetter the year which is contrary to the dwi used in this manuscript so we also need to multiply the pdsi value of mada by 1 before comparison after determining the dwi in the yangchang river basin from 1470 to 2000 using the atlas the areal precipitation is calculated according to the measured precipitation data of the national meteorological stations from 1959 to 2000 then the annual precipitation anomaly percentages that correspond to each dwi within an appropriate range are determined table 1 in addition the intensity of the asian monsoon is one of the main factors that affect the precipitation in the basin the study area also experienced the little ice age 1470 1633 a strong monsoon period 1634 1950 and a weak monsoon period 1951 2020 from 1470 to 2020 cai et al 2001 zhao 2011 therefore when extending the precipitation series according to the corresponding relationship between the dwi and precipitation it is necessary to refer to the analysis of asian monsoon change and precipitation reconstruction results in china fang et al 2011 yi et al 2012 the precipitation of the little ice age and weak monsoon period were multiplied by 0 98 0 96 and 0 96 1 02 respectively with gradually changing correction coefficients cai et al 2001 zhao 2011 4 key time nodes of the evolution of the hwr transition theory is one of the most suitable methods to understand the evolution of socioeconomic systems and support sustainable development management tàbara and ilhan 2008 lu et al 2015 in this research the per capita water resources human water consumption forestland areas and populations are selected as indicators to understand the evolution of the hwr in the yangchang river basin over the past 600 years among these indicators the per capita water resources reflect the changes in the background conditions of water resources human water consumption reflects the impact of socioeconomic development on the water cycle process formula 8 the forestland area reflects the eco environmental quality which can maintain the healthy operation of the water system by increasing the water conservation capacity the population reflects the degree of socioeconomic development finally according to these four indicators directions and rates of change the hwr can be divided into four development stages predevelopment take off acceleration and rebalancing 8 pcwr r p o p h w c i d w where pcwr is the per capita water resources m3 per capital pop is the population and hwc is the total human water consumption m3 5 data collection and processing three types of data are collected and used to analyse the evolution of the hwr table 2 the first category is land use cover data at the village scale the historical land use cover data are determined using the restored map of baojia tun zhou and xu 2018 the modern land use cover data are determined using the 2020 global 30 m land use cover data and unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing images obtained by a dji mavic air 2 drone at the basin scale the historical period s land use cover data consist of the cultivated land areas in the study area that were sorted and estimated from the relevant documents describing the agricultural development in guizhou province and anshun city from 1980 to 2020 the china multi period 30 m land use cover remote sensing monitoring dataset are used the years without data use the land use cover data from the closest year the second category consists of the data used to reconstruct the precipitation and evapotranspiration in the water cycle process and some validation data the atlas with yearly charts of dryness wetness in china for the last 500 year period is applied to determine the dwi from 1470 to 2000 the palaeoclimatic mada dataset cook et al 2010 and grid dwi yang et al 2013 are used to validate the reliability of dwi based on the measured precipitation data from meteorological stations from 1958 to 2000 the correlation between precipitation and dwi can be established for the precipitation data obtained from meteorological stations from 2001 to 2020 the inverse distance weight method is used to calculate the areal precipitation the modis terra net evapotranspiration product mod16a2 006 in the google earth engine is processed to provide the annual average potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration levels for the yangchang river basin landsat 7 landsat 8 and sentinel 2 surface reflectance are used to calculate ndwi and invert long term river width data uav remote sensing images can be used to generate a digital river model for rshs technology the third category consists of data used to analyse the evolution of the hwr including population changes per capita domestic water consumption levels and irrigation quotas which are obtained from the historical literature and statistical data 4 results 4 1 validation of the method for reconstructing the water cycle process over the past 600 years the dwi precipitation and runoff results calculated during the reconstruction of the water cycle process are validated for reliability first the dwi extracted from the atlas with yearly charts of dryness wetness in china for the last 500 year period was compared with grid dwi yang et al 2013 and mada cook et al 2010 fig 2 a the multiyear average values of the two kinds of dwi data from 1470 to 2000 were very close 3 06 and 3 03 respectively these values also have the same change trend and excellent consistency p 0 05 with the mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape root mean squared error rmse correlation coefficient r coefficientofdetermination r 2 and slope of the linear fitting line k of 0 23 8 30 0 37 0 89 0 80 and 1 05 respectively for mada in the five documented historical drought periods of 1481 1487 qian et al 2003b 1586 1589 shen et al 2007 1637 1643 zhang 2008 1790 1796 strathern 2012 and 1873 1876 cook et al 2010 both mada and the two kinds of dwi data captured drought events by observing the 10 year moving average results it can also be found that mada has a similar change trend with the two kinds of dwi data nevertheless the timing of extreme drought or flood often differs which may be related to the lack of measured tree ring data of mada in southeastern china other studies also compared grid dwi with mada and other commonly used palaeoclimate datasets yang et al 2013 compared the grid dwi with the dai pdsi dataset based on temperature and precipitation data dai et al 2004 and mada cook et al 2010 there was significant consistency between dai pdsi and grid dwi from 1900 to 2000 mada and grid dwi showed a similar pattern in southeastern china during four documented historical drought periods in general the above results show that the dwi extracted in this manuscript is consistent with grid dwi and both dwi datasets exhibit good correlation with the commonly used palaeoclimatic data mada which means that dwi can be used as an indicator to measure whether floods and droughts occur to reconstruct the historical precipitation then by comparing the measured precipitation and the precipitation reconstructed by the dwi fig 2b it is found that the precipitation corresponding to each dwi category is reasonably set and suitable to reconstruct historical precipitation as shown in fig 2b the multiyear average values of the measured precipitation and the precipitation reconstructed by the dwi from 1959 to 2000 were very close 1126 50 and 1090 01 mm respectively there is also a clear positive correlation between them p 0 05 all points are distributed around the 1 1 line in the correlation analysis graph with mae mape rmse nash efficiency coefficient nse r r 2 and k values of 84 30 mm 7 58 105 92 mm 0 57 0 79 0 62 and 0 93 respectively finally the digital river model was constructed based on rshs technology and multisource remote sensing ndwi data uav landsat 7 landsat 8 sentinel 1 sentinel 2 and the surface runoff was constructed from 2001 to 2020 and calculated according to the manning formula fig 2c e the results show that the runoff calculated by the water balance formula has the same change trend as the surface runoff calculated by rshs which can reflect the change trend of water resources in the basin to a certain extent as shown in fig 2c e the accuracy of surface runoff estimated by rshs is reliable and the multiyear average runoff values calculated by rshs and the water balance formula were relatively close i e 2 80 and 2 37 108 m3 respectively in addition the correlation analysis chart shows a clear positive correlation between the two kinds of runoff p 0 05 with mae mape rmse r and r 2 values of 0 60 108 m3 22 42 0 51 108 m3 0 87 and 0 76 respectively however the total runoff calculated by the water balance formula fluctuates greatly it is sometimes less than the surface runoff calculated by rshs which is because the research time span is close to 600 years and the water balance formula method can only set the change in basin water storage δw to 0 resulting in the neglect of the interannual change in basin water storage 4 2 the water cycle process at the village scale over the past 600 years using the restored map of baojia tun zhou and xu 2018 and the global 30 m land use cover data of 2020 the change in the water cycle process during historical the ming dynasty 1470 and modern times 2020 at the village scale was analysed based on the water balance and budyko formula with continuous socioeconomic development the composition of water use units in the water cycle process at the village scale has generally remained stable only the precipitation percentages that are accounted for by various elements in the water cycle process have changed fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the population of baojia tun increased from 529 to 2870 while the socioeconomic development model still represented a small scale peasant economy from 1470 to 2020 the human impacts on the water cycle process were still dominated by irrigation water first cumulative evapotranspiration accounted for 70 72 of precipitation during the ming dynasty in comparison the evapotranspiration levels of forest and grassland 34 69 and cultivated land 34 20 were similar and the evapotranspiration level of construction land was very small 1 82 in modern times due to the expansion of cities and towns and cultivated land large amounts of deforestation have occurred and the forestland area has been reduced from 0 262 km2 to 0 072 km2 as a result the evapotranspiration levels of cultivated and construction land increased to 41 99 and 9 91 respectively the evapotranspiration of forest and grassland decreased sharply to 9 08 and the total evapotranspiration also decreased to 60 99 regarding the impacts of human activities on the water cycle process irrigation water consumption has increased from 35 90 to 43 97 and the amount of irrigation return water has also increased from 27 76 to 33 96 although the proportion of domestic water consumption in precipitation is very small its increase range is as high as 542 55 the final factor is runoff because forestland is the most important water conservation land use cover type the deforestation of forestland has led to runoff increases that range from 29 25 to 38 85 although the total runoff has increased significantly the surface runoff will not increase significantly due to the simultaneous increase in irrigation water levels which will lead to more surface runoff being converted into interflow or underground runoff 4 3 variations in water resources at the basin scale over the past 600 years based on the dwi and changes in the asian monsoon the precipitation series was extended to 1470 2020 then according to the budyko formula and the reconstructed land use cover data of the yangchang river basin the evapotranspiration and runoff series were reconstructed at the basin scale from 1470 to 2020 fig 4 a under the joint influence of precipitation and evapotranspiration the runoff exhibited a significant increasing trend p 0 05 with an average annual runoff of 2 18 108 m3 and an overall rate of increase of 9 12 104 m3 a 1 from 1470 to 2020 through further analysis of the changes in the water cycle process during different stages it can be found that the trend of runoff shifted from a slow decrease to an accelerated increase with the change rate increasing from 6 21 104 m3 a 1 in the ming dynasty 1470 1636 to 48 78 104 m3 a 1 in the china stage 1949 2020 fig 4b from the ming dynasty to the qing dynasty 1636 1912 the annual average precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff increased by 0 29 0 11 and 0 18 108 m3 respectively this indicated that the impact of human activities on the water cycle process at this stage was still minor and the changes in various elements in the water cycle process mainly resulted from increased precipitation from the qing dynasty to the republic of china stage 1912 1949 the mode of change shifted mostly due to large scale cultivated land development that occurred during this stage additionally the amount of forestland greatly decreased thus decreasing the evapotranspiration by 0 11 108 m3 however the annual average precipitation also decreased by 0 10 108 m3 resulting in a decrease in runoff of 0 01 108 m3 from the republic of china to china stage 1949 2000 for an annual average precipitation reduction of 0 01 108 m3 the impact of human activities on the water cycle process remained stable but at higher levels which resulted in a 0 37 108 m3 decrease in evapotranspiration and a 0 33 108 m3 increase in runoff from the china 1949 2000 to china 2000 2020 stages due to the joint impacts of forestland restoration and construction land expansion the impacts of human activities on the water cycle process have changed the reduction in evapotranspiration caused by human activities has been suppressed resulting in the evapotranspiration decreasing by 0 09 108 m3 and runoff increasing by 0 07 108 m3 then the precipitation exhibited a periodic change trend of decrease increase decrease increase from 1470 to 1633 there was a little ice age with a dry and cold climate and the average annual precipitation was only 7 69 108 m3 and showed a decreasing rate of 1 22 105 m3 a 1 from 1634 to 1949 there was a strong monsoon period with a warm humid climate and average annual precipitation of 7 97 108 m3 and the precipitation during this period exhibited an increasing rate of 5 87 104 m3 a 1 from 1950 to 2020 there was a weak monsoon period with an average annual precipitation of only 7 87 108 m3 although there was a small precipitation reduction at the beginning of this period the precipitation also exhibited an obvious increasing rate of 4 54 105 m3 a 1 which is consistent with the increased precipitation in recent decades caused by climate warming finally the evapotranspiration changes exhibited an increase decrease trend from 1470 to 1912 the annual average evapotranspiration was 5 74 108 m3 and the evapotranspiration finally exhibited an increasing trend with a rate of 4 20 104 m3 a 1 due to the increased precipitation it is noteworthy that the proportion of evapotranspiration for cultivated land in the total evapotranspiration gradually increased from 1 22 to 6 32 due to the increased cultivated land area fig 4c from 1913 to 2020 the average annual evapotranspiration was 5 41 108 m3 and exhibited an obvious decreasing trend with a rate of 5 71 105 m3 a 1 this decreasing trend is due to the decrease in evapotranspiration caused by human activities being greater than the increase in precipitation resulting in the rapid increase in the proportion of evapotranspiration of cultivated and construction land in the total evapotranspiration during this period which peaked at 50 37 and 2 41 in 2010 2020 respectively 4 4 human actions in this 600 year area according to the changes in cultivated land area in historical literature the temporal statistical lucc in the yangchang river basin from 1470 to 1980 was reconstructed and the spatial distribution of cultivated land area expansion was estimated by calculating the clei fig 5 a as shown in fig 5a from 1470 to 1980 human activities were mainly characterized by the expansion of cultivated land until 1636 the end of the ming dynasty the maximum cultivated land area was only 20 19 km2 by 1912 the end of the qing dynasty the cultivated land area had increased to 49 87 km2 then the increase in the cultivated land area accelerated reaching 217 55 km2 and 355 51 km2 in 1949 and 1980 respectively it is also found that the clei continued to rise due to its distal proximity to villages and rivers especially for areas with higher slopes the three most appropriate thresholds were selected to cause the cultivated land area in each period to be as close as possible to the literature results which are 0 0 032 20 12 km2 0 032 0 053 28 49 km2 0 053 0 162 169 31 km2 and 0 162 0 855 137 59 km2 respectively for human actions from 1980 to 2020 30 m land use cover data from the chinese academy of sciences in 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were used for analysis fig 5b d fig 5b d shows that the lucc from 1980 to 2020 consisted mainly of expanding construction land supplemented by a few forestland restoration efforts among them the area of construction land increased slowly from 1980 to 2000 and showed a rapid increasing trend after 2000 from 75 95 km2 in 2000 to 216 56 km2 in 2015 with an increase of 285 13 for cultivated land the area of dry land generally remained stable while the area of paddy fields continued to decrease from 245 79 km2 to 238 07 km2 a decrease of 3 14 the total area of grassland decreased from 94 93 km2 in 1980 to 81 00 km2 in 2015 and the total area of forestland increased from 260 88 km2 in 2000 to 268 77 km2 in 2015 4 5 evolution of the hwr at the 600 year scale based on the reconstruction of the water cycle process at the basin scale and transition theory the change slopes and average values of the per capita water resources human water consumption forest areas and population are used to determine the key time nodes of the evolution of the hwr in the yangchang river basin from 1470 to 2020 the results show that the hwr developed from the initial resource rich balanced stage to an extensive development unbalanced stage and finally transformed into a rebalancing stage which can be divided into the following four stages predevelopment 1470 1685 take off 1685 1912 acceleration 1912 2000 and rebalancing 2000 2020 fig 6 the predevelopment stage 1470 1685 occurred from the mid ming dynasty to the early qing dynasty for this stage the socioeconomic development level of the basin was slow and the water and forest resources were rich the tunpu people built small water conservancy projects which had little impact on the environment making the hwr a resource rich balanced stage in detail the population growth was slow 16 people a 1 and the per capita water resources exhibited a rapid decreasing trend pcwr k1 0 073 thousand m3 a 1 under the influence of precipitation change and population growth the per capita water resources were relatively abundant with an average of 29 30 thousand m3 capita year 1 and the short stage of growth of the per capita water resources was due to the population decline from 1620 to 1637 when war was frequent during the transition of dynasties sheng et al 2019 although human water consumption showed an insignificant increasing trend hwc k1 0 03 106 m3 a 1 the average annual human water consumption was 13 37 106 m3 which accounted for only 6 62 of the average runoff at this stage at the same time the basin was rich in forest resources with an average forest area of 599 93 km2 which accounted for 83 of the total basin area and the decreasing trend was not obvious fa k1 0 92 km2 a 1 the take off stage 1685 1912 occurred in the middle and late qing dynasty with the decrease in warfare and gradual stabilization of society socioeconomic development began to promote during this stage the human impact on the water cycle process was still slight and the water and forest resources were still at relatively rich levels however the hwr began to shift towards an imbalance at this stage the population increased 106 people a 1 the decreasing rate of the per capita water resources was slightly lower than that of the predevelopment stage due to the increased precipitation caused by the strong monsoon period during this stage pcwr k2 0 044 thousand m3 a 1 nevertheless its average value was 9 59 thousand m3 capita year 1 only 32 75 of the value during the predevelopment stage to meet the agricultural needs of the increased population the area of cultivated land expanded slightly which resulted in a 300 increasing rate of human water consumption compared to that of the predevelopment stage hwc k2 0 09 106 m3 a 1 however its proportion of runoff was only 15 66 although the forest resources have decreased slightly they are still relatively abundant the forestland area accounts for 79 45 of the total basin area but its reduction rate is 415 22 of that of the predevelopment stage fa k2 3 82 km2 a 1 the acceleration stage 1912 2000 occurred during the transition from the republic of china to new china with the changes in the socioeconomic system and the liberation of productive forces socioeconomic development accelerated extensively the utilization degree of water resources reached a high level and the number of water resources in the basin struggled to support higher intensity development meanwhile with the reduction in forestland the eco environmental quality increasingly declined and the hwr entered an extensive development unbalanced stage during this stage the population growth rate increased further 1711 people a 1 which resulted in a faster decrease in per capita water resources pcwr k3 0 049 thousand m3 a 1 with the average value decreasing to 3 09 thousand m3 capita year 1 due to the surge in cultivated land irrigation and human domestic water demand human water consumption increased rapidly hwc k3 2 19 106 m3 a 1 accounting for 57 86 of the total runoff on average and peaked at 94 10 in 1985 meanwhile to provide the necessary land for the expansion of cultivated and construction land the forestland area rapidly decreased fa k3 70 52 km2 a 1 reaching its lowest value of 244 47 km2 in 1999 the rebalancing stage 2000 2020 occurred during the china period due to the impact of ecological civilization policy the basin maintained a rapid level of socioeconomic development but also considered the protection of water resources and restoration of the eco environment making the hwr transition to a rebalancing stage with high consumption and high output at this stage the population growth rate reached its highest level 2737 people a 1 although the average per capita value of water resources was as low as 1 20 thousand m3 capita year 1 its decreasing trend was alleviated to some extent pcwr k4 0 007 thousand m3 a 1 due to the reduced area of cultivated land human water consumption exhibited a significant decrease after increasing during the first three stages hwc k4 0 21 106 m3 a 1 and accounted for 77 81 of the runoff on average this result means that the yangchang river basin relied on less water to feed more humans than before at the same time the forest area exhibited an increasing trend for the first time fa k4 1 11 km2 a 1 which suggests improved eco environmental quality and water conservation capacity 5 discussion 5 1 why has the water cycle process remained stable at the village scale over the past six centuries although the population and construction land area of baojia tun have grown continuously over the past 600 years the socioeconomic development mode is mainly a small scale peasant economy resulting in the composition of water use units in the water cycle process at the village scale remaining stable human water consumption is still dominated by irrigation water however the percentages of the various elements in the water cycle process have transformed fig 3 from the lucc of the whole basin the cultivated land area in the basin has increased significantly since 1470 the ming dynasty except for the large scale expansion of construction land around cities and towns after 2000 the lucc around other small residential areas is similar to that around baojia tun thus the socioeconomic development mode in the basin is still dominated by a small scale peasant economy therefore it can be inferred that the mode of human influence on the water cycle process in the basin has not changed and the water cycle process in baojia tun can be extended to the analysis of the evolution of the hwr at the basin scale the main reasons why the water cycle process in tunpu has generally remained stable include natural and cultural factors among them the natural factors are mainly related to the fact that tunpu in the yangchang river basin is located on the anshun plain which has open terrain fertile soil and excellent climatic conditions the unique climate results in seldom hot summers and cold winters which are suitable for the growth of crops therefore tunpu has become an important grain production region in guizhou province chen 2016 the specific cultural factor is that tunpu culture has extraordinary academic and cultural value to fully protect tunpu villages the local government focuses on developing industries such as the culture and tourism of tunpu villages this development led to the entire basin s socioeconomic development mode still being dominated by a small scale peasant economy thus no large scale industrial developments have been carried out chen 2018 5 2 what are the driving forces of the runoff changes at the basin scale from 1470 to 2020 the runoff trend shifted from a slow decrease to an accelerated increase under the joint impacts of climate change and human activities the rate of change increased from 6 21 104 m3 a 1 in the ming dynasty 1470 1636 to 48 78 104 m3 a 1 during the china period e g 1949 2020 fig 4 regarding climate change precipitation has the greatest impact on runoff there is an obvious positive correlation between precipitation and runoff r 2 0 91 consistent with the existing research conclusions yuan et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 in addition human activities can be divided into irrigation water intake and lucc to determine the extent of the impacts of different human activities on the water cycle process runoff calculations can be conducted by controlling the land use cover or irrigation water volume fig 7 fig 7 shows that the increased runoff in the basin results from the offsetting impacts of two different human activities on the water cycle process the increased runoff caused by lucc is greater than the decreased runoff caused by irrigation water intake compared with the scenario where no human activities are considered the change rate of runoff increased significantly from 0 71 105 m3 a 1 to 1 54 105 m3 a 1 under the lucc from 1470 to 2020 meanwhile the lucc in each stage leads to runoff increases but their impacts are distinct from the predevelopment to acceleration stage the degree of impact of the lucc gradually increases from 0 93 to 22 26 and the lucc modes consist mainly of the transformation from forestland to cultivated land which will reduce the total evapotranspiration during this period and increase the runoff du et al 2018 during the rebalancing stage the impact degree of the lucc is only 1 36 the main lucc modes consist of the expansion of construction land and restoration of forestland and the increase in runoff caused by the impermeability of construction land is less than the decrease in runoff caused by the increase in evapotranspiration of forestland zhao et al 2016 then under a scenario that considers both lucc and irrigation at the same time from 1470 to 2020 the change rate of runoff decreased significantly from 1 54 105 m3 a 1 to 0 92 105 m3 a 1 it can also be found that irrigation always causes reductions in the runoff and the impact of irrigation gradually increased from 1 54 in the predevelopment stage to 17 12 in the rebalancing stage due to the continuous increase in the average cultivated land area 5 3 how does ecological civilization policy affect the evolution of the hwr the hwr developed from the initial resource rich balanced stage to the extensive development unbalanced stage and finally transformed into the rebalancing stage after 2000 fig 5 which is similar to the conclusions of studies of the tarim river basin liu et al 2014 heihe river basin lu et al 2015 and loess plateau wu et al 2020 the main reason for the rebalancing of the hwr is likely because china recognizes that the extensive development mode is unsustainable and needs to complete the transformation from industrial civilization to ecological civilization pan 2012 lu et al 2019 tunpu and its location in guizhou province have responded positively and taken a series of ecological civilization policies which are not just slogans or visions but are ongoing processes pan 2012 for example since the state council of china passed the regulations on grain for green in 2002 guizhou province has completed the task of the grain for green project of 20 47 thousand km2 and the forest coverage rate in the entire province has increased from 22 8 in 1975 to 59 95 in 2020 the value of the annual ecological benefit that was created by the grain for green project reached 84 072 billion yuan and the soil erosion modulus decreased from 3325 t km2 a 1 in 2000 to 631 4 t km2 a 1 in 2017 xiao et al 2015 zhang and yang 2021 in addition since the state council of china passed the outline of comprehensive control plan for rocky desertification in southwestern china in 2008 78 karst counties in guizhou province officially launched the comprehensive control project of rocky desertification which is planned for 45 years at the cost of 76 029 billion yuan to complete the comprehensive control area of 7 million hectares of rocky desertification in 2012 the no 2 document of the state council of china regarded the construction of an important ecological security barrier in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and pearl river as one of the five strategic positions of guizhou in the future in 2016 guizhou province was established as a national ecological civilization pilot area with the overall goal of building a colourful guizhou park province jiang et al 2014 taking an early ecological civilization policy the grain for green project as an example this policy plans to transform sloping and degraded farmland or wasteland into forests or grasslands xie et al 2018 thus the improved vegetation cover can improve eco environmental quality water conservation capacity soil erosion and biodiversity griscom et al 2017 newmark et al 2017 zinda et al 2017 bastin et al 2019 lu et al 2020 peng et al 2022 yan et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 for further analysis we used satellite remote sensing mod13a1 006 terra vegetation indices 500 m aerial remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing of the yangchang river basin it can be more clearly observed that whether in natural areas or areas with human activities the yangchang river basin is paying attention to restoring the eco environment while promoting socioeconomic development good eco environmental quality can maintain the healthy operation of the water system by increasing the water conservation capacity fig 8 for the entire basin the average normalized difference vegetation index ndvi exhibited an obvious increasing trend with a rate of 0 002 a 1 from 2001 to 2020 p 0 05 this indicates that the entire basin is turning green and is consistent with the previous land use cover results fig 5 regarding the spatial distribution the ndvi of 79 04 of the basin exhibits an increasing trend and is mainly distributed in the middle and southern portions of the basin the land use cover types in these areas consist mainly of cultivated land forest and grassland which are the main areas for the grain for green project by comparing the aerial remote sensing images and unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing images of areas a and b shown in fig 8 it is clear that the conversion from sloping farmland to forestland has significantly improved the level of forestland coverage meanwhile the remaining 20 96 of the basin with a decreased ndvi is mainly distributed near the cities and towns in the basin where the construction land expansion was concentrated in the basin from 2001 to 2020 however as shown in fig 8 the transformation from cultivated land to forestland can still be found and the low coverage grasslands on the mountains are also changing to forestland with high coverage in the images of areas c and d in general the synchronous promotion of socioeconomic development and ecological civilization policy has realized the unity of socioeconomic and ecological benefits making the hwr exhibit a good sign of rebalancing these ecological civilization policies proposed by the state council of china such as the grain for green project comprehensive management of rocky desertification and the construction of an important ecological security barrier in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and pearl river effectively improved vegetation cover and ecological environment quality in the study area and across guizhou province which is conducive to improving water conservation capacity 6 conclusion to reveal the impact of policies on the hwr the reconstruction of the water cycle process based on an improved water balance formula and rshs technology was validated using mada grid dwi measured precipitation and runoff through the reconstruction of the water cycle process over nearly 600 years the long term evolution of the hwr in baojia tun and its basin has been revealed the main results are as follows the hwr developed from the initial resource rich balanced stage to the extensive development unbalanced stage and finally transformed into the rebalancing stage the four stages are predevelopment 1470 1685 take off 1685 1912 acceleration 1912 2000 and rebalancing 2000 2020 at the village scale due to the suitable geographical conditions and cultural value the composition of water use units in the water cycle process has generally remained stable over nearly 600 years from the ming dynasty to modern times the human impacts on the water cycle process were dominated by irrigation water only the deforestation caused by the expansion of towns and cultivated land increased the proportion of runoff in precipitation by 9 60 at the basin scale due to the fluctuating growth of precipitation and the increased runoff caused by lucc being greater than the decreased runoff caused by irrigation water intake the runoff trend changed from a slow decrease to an accelerated increase from 1470 to 2020 the change rate of runoff increased from 6 21 104 m3 a 1 in the ming dynasty 1470 1636 and gradually increased to 47 78 104 m3 a 1 in the china stage 1949 2020 the synchronous promotion of socioeconomic development and the ecological civilization policy has realized the unity of socioeconomic and ecological benefits making the hwr exhibit a good sign of rebalancing these ecological civilization policies proposed by the state council of china such as the grain for green project comprehensive management of rocky desertification and the construction of an important ecological security barrier in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and pearl river effectively improved vegetation cover and ecological environment quality in the study area and across guizhou province which is conducive to improving water conservation capacity this research reveals the positive effect of ecological civilization policy on the development of tunpu through the analysis of the long term evolution of the hwr which can eliminate the unfavourable factors in the previous development model and adjust it to a sustainable development model providing significant enlightenment for long term planning and policy formulation for sustainable high quality development in other countries or regions in the future while ensuring the synchronous promotion of socioeconomic development and the ecological civilization policy it is noteworthy that massive vegetation restoration caused by ecological civilization policy will enhance the interception of surface runoff thus more attention should be given to finding reasonable ways to exploit the increasing soil moisture and improve the efficiency of water resource utilization rather than extensive and greedy methods in addition to irrigation and domestic water factors such as war human ideology and consciousness proposed in the social sciences can affect the evolution of the hwr which needs to be examined

2489,the human water relationship hwr has shifted from the simple utilization of water resources to a complex spatial redistribution process through powerful human activities such as water conservancy projects and policies water conservancy projects have changed the hwr however it is still unclear how related policies such as the ecological civilization policy recently advocated by the chinese government affect the hwr here a nearly 600 year typical tunpu village named baojia tun was taken as the study area based on an improved water balance formula and a new technology known as remote sensing hydrological station rshs the water cycle process over nearly 600 years in the typical tunpu village named baojia tun and its basin was reconstructed and the long term evolution of the hwr over different space and time spans was revealed the results show that 1 the hwr developed from an initial resource rich balanced stage to an extensive development unbalanced stage and finally transformed into a rebalancing stage the four stages of the hwr are predevelopment take off acceleration and rebalancing 2 at the village scale due to the suitable geographical conditions and cultural value the composition of water use units in the water cycle process of baojia tun has generally remained stable from the ming dynasty to modern times 3 at the basin scale due to the increased runoff caused by land use cover change being more significant than the decreased runoff caused by irrigation water intake the trend of runoff shifted from slowly decreasing to accelerated increases with the

water relationship hwr is one of the most important critical aspects of the relationship between humans and nature during the intensification of climate change and socioeconomic development the hwr has shifted from the simple utilization of water resources to changing the spatial distributions and distribution proportions of water resources through powerful human activities such as water conservancy projects and policies elshafei et al 2014 liu et al 2014 breyer et al 2018 essenfelder et al 2018 although a consensus has formed regarding water conservancy projects changing the hwr li et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 and the impact of policies has recently received extensive attention e g socio hydrology has made great efforts to answer this question sivapalan et al 2012 sivapalan et al 2014 varis et al 2019 york et al 2019 many policies have been proposed to protect the environment and ensure the sustainable development of the social economy for example to avoid the costly pendulum swings between water resource development and environmental protection a directed government interventionist policy was conducted to achieve environmentally sustainable outcomes in themurrumbidgeeriverbasin easternaustralia circa 2007 kandasamy et al 2014 similar policies were also proposed in the kissimmee river basin in florida and the dommel basin in belgium and the netherlands in approximately 1990 chen et al 2016 mostert 2018 in china after rapid economic development from 1978 to 2000 which came at the expense of the environment the chinese government officially proposed the ecological civilization policy zhang et al 2018 the ecological civilization policy is a stricter environmental policy that aims to build a social form with the primary purpose of harmonious coexistence a virtuous circle overall development and sustainable prosperity between humans and nature pan 2012 xiao and zhao 2017 sha and iop 2018 lu et al 2019 due to the crucial role of water in ecosystem stability and supporting human development falkenmark 2001 ceola et al 2016 the ecological civilization policy is committed to solving the shortage of water resources deterioration of the water environment and other water problems which will inevitably affect the hwr zhou et al 2018 tian et al 2021 most studies on ecological civilization policy focus on constructing an evaluation index system and most indicators mainly consist of changes in water systems tian et al 2021 yang et al 2021a however it is still unclear how related policies such as the ecological civilization policy advocated by the chinese government affect the hwr analysing the long term evolution of the hwr is one of the critical methods used to reveal the impact of policies on the hwr sivapalan et al 2012 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 currently some scholars have tried to overcome the limitations of relying on detailed statistical and hydrological data in researching the short term evolution of the hwr they have studied the long term evolution of the hwr over more than one thousand years using historical literature palaeoclimate reconstruction and classical hydrological methods ahmad et al 2018 bao and zou 2018 zhao et al 2020 zuo et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 zuo et al 2022 for example liu et al 2014 used the tarim river basin in western china as an example they discussed the historical evolution of the human water coupling system in three stable periods in the past 2000 years and defined four general types of social hydrological systems based on the taiji tire model lu et al 2015 reconstructed the water balance of the heihe river basin in northern china over the past 2000 years according to transition theory and the change rate of population human water consumption and natural oasis area are used to quantitatively analyse the evolution of the hwr wang et al 2017 took china from 722 bce to 1911 ce as an example studied the three contradictory relations of the human water coupling system climate change and war conditions productivity and production relationships from the perspective of contradiction and coevolution and divided the coevolution process of these three contradictions into three stages wu et al 2020 took the loess plateau of china as an example and proposed a method to determine the stage change of the social ecosystems according to the difference in the relationship between population cultivated land area and forestland area in the social ecosystems in the past 1000 years and comprehensively considered the influence of driving factors such as temperature precipitation drought and flood disasters and war generally the above studies that analyse the long term evolution of the hwr mainly express the changes in water systems in the hwr using various indicators such as temperature dry and wet climate or precipitation in addition runoff is also an important part of the water cycle process its amounts are affected by many factors such as precipitation temperature and land use cover change lucc which can more directly and comprehensively reflect the evolution of the hwr sivapalan et al 2003 lu et al 2015 therefore the impact of policies on the hwr can be effectively revealed through the analysis of the long term evolution of the hwr by reconstructing the water cycle process tunpu is a unique area in guizhou province china with a unique culture and a 600 year history of water resource development in 1902 the japanese scholar torii ryuzo discovered hundreds of tunpu villages with a history of 600 years in the mountainous area of central guizhou province ge et al 2022 which is inhabited by hundreds of thousands of han immigrants from nanjing in the lower reaches of the yangtze river furthermore tun and pu in chinese translate to inhabited places of immigrants and military castles respectively which were built for military operations and immigration policy of the ming dynasty 1368 1644 known as transferring the north to conquer the south as tunpu is located in the southwest mountain area of china and has been isolated for a long time they retained the clothing and culture of the ming dynasty and were not affected by the qing dynasty 1644 1912 therefore tunpu formed a precious and characteristic culture and is referred to as the living fossil of human social development and has been protected by the state nie 2017 for example due to advanced farming technology and the ability to build water conservation projects of the han nationality immigrants the tunpu people could efficiently utilize water resources and maintain a harmonious hwr as far back as 600 years ago zhang and pang 2007 today china faces severe resource constraints serious environmental pollution and ecosystem degradation caused by accelerated socioeconomic development tunpu and its location in guizhou province china s national ecological civilization experimental area have implemented a series of ecological civilization policies jiang et al 2014 overall tunpu represents the history of water conservancy development in the mountainous areas of southwestern china and is suitable for studying the long term evolution of the hwr to reveal the impact of policies based on an improved water balance formula and a new technology known as remote sensing hydrological station rshs we reconstructed the water cycle process spanning nearly 600 years in the typical tunpu village named baojia tun and its basin and revealed the long term evolution of the hwr and the impact of policies on the hwr the main research contents include three points 1 historical and modern water cycle processes at the village scale are reconstructed 2 then 600 years of lucc was retrieved using historical data and remote sensing data and the water cycle process at the basin scale was reconstructed over the past 600 years 3 based on transition theory the key time nodes of the evolution of the hwr are determined and the impact of policies such as the ecological civilization policy on the hwr is revealed 2 study area a typical tunpu village named baojia tun and its basin are taken as the study area which is located on the anshun plain guizhou province china 105 975 e 106 366 e 26 159 n 26 463 n tunpu is mainly located in the yangchang river basin which belongs to the wujiang river system with a drainage area of 721 78 km2 fig 1 a the basin has a north subtropical monsoon humid climate with an annual average temperature of 14 15 c and annual precipitation of 1200 1300 mm karst is widely distributed in the yangchang river basin resulting in the extensive development of underground cracks pipelines caves and underground streams the water conservation capacity is poor and the surface water permeability is high leading to a deficiency in surface water resources significant soil erosion and rocky desertification bai et al 2013 dubois et al 2014 qin et al 2015 as early as 1382 baojia tun was inhabited by many han immigrants they were distinct from the surrounding ethnic minorities and han nationalities in their clothing language architecture customs and culture fig 1b moreover small water conservancy projects such as backwater weirs fish mouth water diversion water powered rollers and water mills were built and have been well preserved these projects could efficiently utilize their water resources which included irrigating paddy fields at different altitudes effectively resisting drought and flood discharges and providing domestic water and hydropower for the entire village these projects combine aesthetic and hydraulic theories to form a highly integrated picture of the artificial and natural environments effectively maintaining the surrounding natural eco environment and symbolising a harmonious hwr fig 1c and fig 1d 3 methods and data 1 reconstruction of the water cycle process at the village scale to analyse the changes in the water cycle process at the village scale an improved water balance formula that considers irrigation water and domestic water is constructed for historical the ming dynasty 1470 and modern 2020 times the formula is as follows 1 p e t δ w d w r where p is the precipitation m3 et is the actual evapotranspiration m3 δw is the change in basin water storage which means the fluctuation of soil moisture and can be regarded as 0 during the multiyear analysis lu et al 2015 dw refers to the total domestic water consumption which is set as 100 l capita day 1 according to the water resources bulletin of anshun city guizhou province china and r is the total runoff m3 the acquisition of land use cover data is necessary for completing water balance calculations historical village land use cover data can usually be obtained from old pictures in the literature zhou and xu 2018 modern land use cover data can be obtained using widely used datasets such as global 30 m land use cover data provided by the national geomatics center of china available at https g1c30 tianditu com the formula for calculating actual evapotranspiration is based on the budyko hypothesis proposed by fu 1981 formula 2 in addition cultivated lands are divided into paddy fields and dry lands and the water sources for evapotranspiration from paddy fields include not only precipitation but also irrigation water formula 3 furthermore the change in the impact of human irrigation water intake on the water cycle process can also be calculated by controlling the parameters of the budyko formula formula 4 2 et p 1 et 0 p 1 et 0 p w 1 w 3 p paddy p i 4 i δ et paddy i b where et 0 is the potential evapotranspiration m3 w is the basin scale model parameter p paddy is the quantity of water resources that can be used for evapotranspiration in paddy fields m3 i and ib are the irrigation water and irrigation backwater amounts m3 where i is set as 795 mm per year according to the water resources bulletin of anshun city guizhou province china and δ et paddy is the difference between evapotranspiration with irrigation and that without irrigation m3 it is noteworthy that temperature is one of the most influential factors of et 0 and et 0 increases by 7 08 mm a 1 for a 1 c increase in temperature zhang et al 2014 thus et 0 can be reconstructed from 1470 to 2000 according to the temperature reconstruction in southeastern china in the past 2000 years wen et al 2021 and is set as 1464 41 and 1470 345 mm in 1470 and 2020 respectively furthermore the research of lu et al 2015 directly set w to 3 5 in an arid basin and it does not apply to the research of humid basins therefore w of forestland cultivated land grassland and construction land are set to 2 5 1 6 1 55 and 1 35 respectively and the et of water bodies is equal to et 0 as a result the et ranking of different land use cover types water body forestland cultivated land grassland construction land was the same as that proposed by liu et al 2010 and the average calculated et from 2001 to 2020 was 716 65 mm which is mostly consistent with the average et derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data from 2001 to 2020 of 719 03 mm huang et al 2021 2 reconstruction of the water cycle process at the basin scale the water balance formula for reconstructing the water cycle process at the basin scale is the same as that of the village scale the measured surface runoff data can be used to analyse the reliability of the runoff calculated by the water balance formula due to the small size of the basin and lack of continuous hydrological observation data in the yangchang river basin rshs technology can be used to address the difficulty of obtaining surface runoff data in ungauged basins yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 lou et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 wufu et al 2021 yang et al 2021b the rshs method uses an unmanned aerial vehicle uav to assist field surveys in generating a digital river model with terrain data accuracies as small as the centimetre level then the long term river width data can be inverted according to the subpixel decomposition method and the multisource satellite remote sensing normalized difference water index ndwi data in the google earth engine formula 5 finally based on the manning formula the long term surface runoff data can be estimated by calculating hydraulic parameters such as overflow area hydraulic radius and wetted perimeter length to a specific river width formula 6 5 w i 1 x pa vl ndwi i n d w i wt ndwi i n d w i lt ndw i wt n d w i lt pa vl n d w i lt ndwi i n d w i wt 0 ndwi i n d w i lt 6 r w v a k n hr 2 3 j 1 2 a h r l a where w is the average river width of the selected river valley m x is the total number of pixels in the selected river valley ndwi i is the ndwi of pixel i ndw i lt and ndw i wt are the ndwi thresholds of land and water respectively pa is the area of each pixel m2 vl is the length of the selected river valley m r w is the estimated runoff corresponding to river width w m3 v is the flow velocity m s 1 k is the conversion constant k 1 n is the roughness which comprehensively reflects the impacts of the river channel roughness on river runoff n 0 035 hr is the hydraulic radius m j is the slope measured by uav remote sensing image l is the wetted perimeter length m and a is the overflow area m2 hr l and a are calculated based on the river width and digital river model in addition the method for calculating evapotranspiration is generally the same as that for the village scale and only the part that obtains the land use cover data is distinct the lucc before 1980 consisted mainly of transformations of cultivated land and forestland pan 2021 so if the changes in cultivated land areas from 1470 to 1980 are obtained the land use cover data in the historical period can be reconstructed furthermore the spatial distribution of lucc is of great significance for studying the evolution of the hwr and an index called the cultivated land expansion index clei is constructed to reflect the sequence of cultivated land expansion formula 7 7 clei α 1 n h d α 2 n r d α 3 n s n h d h d hd max hd min n r d r d rd max rd min a s 00 s 0 25 10 25 s 1 where clei is the cultivated land expansion index clei 0 1 the closer clei is to 0 and the more likely this pixel is to be developed into cultivated land earlier nhd nrd and as are the normalized habitation distance normalized river distance and adjusted slope respectively α 1 α 2 and α 3 are weight coefficients α 1 α 2 α 3 1 3 hd rd and s are the habitation distance river distance and slope of one pixel respectively and hd max hd min rd max and rd min are the maximum habitation distance minimum habitation distance maximum river distance and minimum river distance of the whole basin respectively m 3 generation of historical precipitation the generation of historical precipitation is important for reconstructing the water cycle process there is an atlas named atlas with yearly charts of dryness wetness in china for the last 500 year period according to the chinese historical documents covering the 120 documented sites this atlas systematically reproduces the general characteristics of the annual dryness and wetness distributions for the 531 years from 1470 to 2000 institute of meteorological sciences 1981 zhang and liu 1993 zhang et al 2003 this atlas uses five dryness wetness index dwi categories as the dividing indicators to classify drought and flood events with 1 being the wettest year and 5 being the driest year this atlas is available at https www sslibrary com page 239443 show and is widely used in palaeoclimate research in china song 2000 qian et al 2003a ren et al 2010 gong et al 2011 feng et al 2013 lee et al 2015 lu et al 2015 yang et al 2016 zheng et al 2021 wang et al 2022 to further verify the reliability of this atlas it will also be compared with the palaeoclimatic monsoon asian drought atlas mada dataset cook et al 2010 and a gridded dwi grid dwi dataset yang et al 2013 mada is the reconstruction of the palmerdroughtseverityindex pdsi from 1300 to 2000 based on the tree ring chronology network and the spatial resolution remains at 2 5 2 5 available at https www ncei noaa gov access paleo search grid dwi is a 2 5 2 5 grid dataset interpolated from the atlas with yearly charts of dryness wetness in china for the last 500 year period for 1470 2000 available in the supplemental material of yang et al 2013 it is noteworthy that the higher the pdsi value of mada is the wetter the year which is contrary to the dwi used in this manuscript so we also need to multiply the pdsi value of mada by 1 before comparison after determining the dwi in the yangchang river basin from 1470 to 2000 using the atlas the areal precipitation is calculated according to the measured precipitation data of the national meteorological stations from 1959 to 2000 then the annual precipitation anomaly percentages that correspond to each dwi within an appropriate range are determined table 1 in addition the intensity of the asian monsoon is one of the main factors that affect the precipitation in the basin the study area also experienced the little ice age 1470 1633 a strong monsoon period 1634 1950 and a weak monsoon period 1951 2020 from 1470 to 2020 cai et al 2001 zhao 2011 therefore when extending the precipitation series according to the corresponding relationship between the dwi and precipitation it is necessary to refer to the analysis of asian monsoon change and precipitation reconstruction results in china fang et al 2011 yi et al 2012 the precipitation of the little ice age and weak monsoon period were multiplied by 0 98 0 96 and 0 96 1 02 respectively with gradually changing correction coefficients cai et al 2001 zhao 2011 4 key time nodes of the evolution of the hwr transition theory is one of the most suitable methods to understand the evolution of socioeconomic systems and support sustainable development management tàbara and ilhan 2008 lu et al 2015 in this research the per capita water resources human water consumption forestland areas and populations are selected as indicators to understand the evolution of the hwr in the yangchang river basin over the past 600 years among these indicators the per capita water resources reflect the changes in the background conditions of water resources human water consumption reflects the impact of socioeconomic development on the water cycle process formula 8 the forestland area reflects the eco environmental quality which can maintain the healthy operation of the water system by increasing the water conservation capacity the population reflects the degree of socioeconomic development finally according to these four indicators directions and rates of change the hwr can be divided into four development stages predevelopment take off acceleration and rebalancing 8 pcwr r p o p h w c i d w where pcwr is the per capita water resources m3 per capital pop is the population and hwc is the total human water consumption m3 5 data collection and processing three types of data are collected and used to analyse the evolution of the hwr table 2 the first category is land use cover data at the village scale the historical land use cover data are determined using the restored map of baojia tun zhou and xu 2018 the modern land use cover data are determined using the 2020 global 30 m land use cover data and unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing images obtained by a dji mavic air 2 drone at the basin scale the historical period s land use cover data consist of the cultivated land areas in the study area that were sorted and estimated from the relevant documents describing the agricultural development in guizhou province and anshun city from 1980 to 2020 the china multi period 30 m land use cover remote sensing monitoring dataset are used the years without data use the land use cover data from the closest year the second category consists of the data used to reconstruct the precipitation and evapotranspiration in the water cycle process and some validation data the atlas with yearly charts of dryness wetness in china for the last 500 year period is applied to determine the dwi from 1470 to 2000 the palaeoclimatic mada dataset cook et al 2010 and grid dwi yang et al 2013 are used to validate the reliability of dwi based on the measured precipitation data from meteorological stations from 1958 to 2000 the correlation between precipitation and dwi can be established for the precipitation data obtained from meteorological stations from 2001 to 2020 the inverse distance weight method is used to calculate the areal precipitation the modis terra net evapotranspiration product mod16a2 006 in the google earth engine is processed to provide the annual average potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration levels for the yangchang river basin landsat 7 landsat 8 and sentinel 2 surface reflectance are used to calculate ndwi and invert long term river width data uav remote sensing images can be used to generate a digital river model for rshs technology the third category consists of data used to analyse the evolution of the hwr including population changes per capita domestic water consumption levels and irrigation quotas which are obtained from the historical literature and statistical data 4 results 4 1 validation of the method for reconstructing the water cycle process over the past 600 years the dwi precipitation and runoff results calculated during the reconstruction of the water cycle process are validated for reliability first the dwi extracted from the atlas with yearly charts of dryness wetness in china for the last 500 year period was compared with grid dwi yang et al 2013 and mada cook et al 2010 fig 2 a the multiyear average values of the two kinds of dwi data from 1470 to 2000 were very close 3 06 and 3 03 respectively these values also have the same change trend and excellent consistency p 0 05 with the mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape root mean squared error rmse correlation coefficient r coefficientofdetermination r 2 and slope of the linear fitting line k of 0 23 8 30 0 37 0 89 0 80 and 1 05 respectively for mada in the five documented historical drought periods of 1481 1487 qian et al 2003b 1586 1589 shen et al 2007 1637 1643 zhang 2008 1790 1796 strathern 2012 and 1873 1876 cook et al 2010 both mada and the two kinds of dwi data captured drought events by observing the 10 year moving average results it can also be found that mada has a similar change trend with the two kinds of dwi data nevertheless the timing of extreme drought or flood often differs which may be related to the lack of measured tree ring data of mada in southeastern china other studies also compared grid dwi with mada and other commonly used palaeoclimate datasets yang et al 2013 compared the grid dwi with the dai pdsi dataset based on temperature and precipitation data dai et al 2004 and mada cook et al 2010 there was significant consistency between dai pdsi and grid dwi from 1900 to 2000 mada and grid dwi showed a similar pattern in southeastern china during four documented historical drought periods in general the above results show that the dwi extracted in this manuscript is consistent with grid dwi and both dwi datasets exhibit good correlation with the commonly used palaeoclimatic data mada which means that dwi can be used as an indicator to measure whether floods and droughts occur to reconstruct the historical precipitation then by comparing the measured precipitation and the precipitation reconstructed by the dwi fig 2b it is found that the precipitation corresponding to each dwi category is reasonably set and suitable to reconstruct historical precipitation as shown in fig 2b the multiyear average values of the measured precipitation and the precipitation reconstructed by the dwi from 1959 to 2000 were very close 1126 50 and 1090 01 mm respectively there is also a clear positive correlation between them p 0 05 all points are distributed around the 1 1 line in the correlation analysis graph with mae mape rmse nash efficiency coefficient nse r r 2 and k values of 84 30 mm 7 58 105 92 mm 0 57 0 79 0 62 and 0 93 respectively finally the digital river model was constructed based on rshs technology and multisource remote sensing ndwi data uav landsat 7 landsat 8 sentinel 1 sentinel 2 and the surface runoff was constructed from 2001 to 2020 and calculated according to the manning formula fig 2c e the results show that the runoff calculated by the water balance formula has the same change trend as the surface runoff calculated by rshs which can reflect the change trend of water resources in the basin to a certain extent as shown in fig 2c e the accuracy of surface runoff estimated by rshs is reliable and the multiyear average runoff values calculated by rshs and the water balance formula were relatively close i e 2 80 and 2 37 108 m3 respectively in addition the correlation analysis chart shows a clear positive correlation between the two kinds of runoff p 0 05 with mae mape rmse r and r 2 values of 0 60 108 m3 22 42 0 51 108 m3 0 87 and 0 76 respectively however the total runoff calculated by the water balance formula fluctuates greatly it is sometimes less than the surface runoff calculated by rshs which is because the research time span is close to 600 years and the water balance formula method can only set the change in basin water storage δw to 0 resulting in the neglect of the interannual change in basin water storage 4 2 the water cycle process at the village scale over the past 600 years using the restored map of baojia tun zhou and xu 2018 and the global 30 m land use cover data of 2020 the change in the water cycle process during historical the ming dynasty 1470 and modern times 2020 at the village scale was analysed based on the water balance and budyko formula with continuous socioeconomic development the composition of water use units in the water cycle process at the village scale has generally remained stable only the precipitation percentages that are accounted for by various elements in the water cycle process have changed fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the population of baojia tun increased from 529 to 2870 while the socioeconomic development model still represented a small scale peasant economy from 1470 to 2020 the human impacts on the water cycle process were still dominated by irrigation water first cumulative evapotranspiration accounted for 70 72 of precipitation during the ming dynasty in comparison the evapotranspiration levels of forest and grassland 34 69 and cultivated land 34 20 were similar and the evapotranspiration level of construction land was very small 1 82 in modern times due to the expansion of cities and towns and cultivated land large amounts of deforestation have occurred and the forestland area has been reduced from 0 262 km2 to 0 072 km2 as a result the evapotranspiration levels of cultivated and construction land increased to 41 99 and 9 91 respectively the evapotranspiration of forest and grassland decreased sharply to 9 08 and the total evapotranspiration also decreased to 60 99 regarding the impacts of human activities on the water cycle process irrigation water consumption has increased from 35 90 to 43 97 and the amount of irrigation return water has also increased from 27 76 to 33 96 although the proportion of domestic water consumption in precipitation is very small its increase range is as high as 542 55 the final factor is runoff because forestland is the most important water conservation land use cover type the deforestation of forestland has led to runoff increases that range from 29 25 to 38 85 although the total runoff has increased significantly the surface runoff will not increase significantly due to the simultaneous increase in irrigation water levels which will lead to more surface runoff being converted into interflow or underground runoff 4 3 variations in water resources at the basin scale over the past 600 years based on the dwi and changes in the asian monsoon the precipitation series was extended to 1470 2020 then according to the budyko formula and the reconstructed land use cover data of the yangchang river basin the evapotranspiration and runoff series were reconstructed at the basin scale from 1470 to 2020 fig 4 a under the joint influence of precipitation and evapotranspiration the runoff exhibited a significant increasing trend p 0 05 with an average annual runoff of 2 18 108 m3 and an overall rate of increase of 9 12 104 m3 a 1 from 1470 to 2020 through further analysis of the changes in the water cycle process during different stages it can be found that the trend of runoff shifted from a slow decrease to an accelerated increase with the change rate increasing from 6 21 104 m3 a 1 in the ming dynasty 1470 1636 to 48 78 104 m3 a 1 in the china stage 1949 2020 fig 4b from the ming dynasty to the qing dynasty 1636 1912 the annual average precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff increased by 0 29 0 11 and 0 18 108 m3 respectively this indicated that the impact of human activities on the water cycle process at this stage was still minor and the changes in various elements in the water cycle process mainly resulted from increased precipitation from the qing dynasty to the republic of china stage 1912 1949 the mode of change shifted mostly due to large scale cultivated land development that occurred during this stage additionally the amount of forestland greatly decreased thus decreasing the evapotranspiration by 0 11 108 m3 however the annual average precipitation also decreased by 0 10 108 m3 resulting in a decrease in runoff of 0 01 108 m3 from the republic of china to china stage 1949 2000 for an annual average precipitation reduction of 0 01 108 m3 the impact of human activities on the water cycle process remained stable but at higher levels which resulted in a 0 37 108 m3 decrease in evapotranspiration and a 0 33 108 m3 increase in runoff from the china 1949 2000 to china 2000 2020 stages due to the joint impacts of forestland restoration and construction land expansion the impacts of human activities on the water cycle process have changed the reduction in evapotranspiration caused by human activities has been suppressed resulting in the evapotranspiration decreasing by 0 09 108 m3 and runoff increasing by 0 07 108 m3 then the precipitation exhibited a periodic change trend of decrease increase decrease increase from 1470 to 1633 there was a little ice age with a dry and cold climate and the average annual precipitation was only 7 69 108 m3 and showed a decreasing rate of 1 22 105 m3 a 1 from 1634 to 1949 there was a strong monsoon period with a warm humid climate and average annual precipitation of 7 97 108 m3 and the precipitation during this period exhibited an increasing rate of 5 87 104 m3 a 1 from 1950 to 2020 there was a weak monsoon period with an average annual precipitation of only 7 87 108 m3 although there was a small precipitation reduction at the beginning of this period the precipitation also exhibited an obvious increasing rate of 4 54 105 m3 a 1 which is consistent with the increased precipitation in recent decades caused by climate warming finally the evapotranspiration changes exhibited an increase decrease trend from 1470 to 1912 the annual average evapotranspiration was 5 74 108 m3 and the evapotranspiration finally exhibited an increasing trend with a rate of 4 20 104 m3 a 1 due to the increased precipitation it is noteworthy that the proportion of evapotranspiration for cultivated land in the total evapotranspiration gradually increased from 1 22 to 6 32 due to the increased cultivated land area fig 4c from 1913 to 2020 the average annual evapotranspiration was 5 41 108 m3 and exhibited an obvious decreasing trend with a rate of 5 71 105 m3 a 1 this decreasing trend is due to the decrease in evapotranspiration caused by human activities being greater than the increase in precipitation resulting in the rapid increase in the proportion of evapotranspiration of cultivated and construction land in the total evapotranspiration during this period which peaked at 50 37 and 2 41 in 2010 2020 respectively 4 4 human actions in this 600 year area according to the changes in cultivated land area in historical literature the temporal statistical lucc in the yangchang river basin from 1470 to 1980 was reconstructed and the spatial distribution of cultivated land area expansion was estimated by calculating the clei fig 5 a as shown in fig 5a from 1470 to 1980 human activities were mainly characterized by the expansion of cultivated land until 1636 the end of the ming dynasty the maximum cultivated land area was only 20 19 km2 by 1912 the end of the qing dynasty the cultivated land area had increased to 49 87 km2 then the increase in the cultivated land area accelerated reaching 217 55 km2 and 355 51 km2 in 1949 and 1980 respectively it is also found that the clei continued to rise due to its distal proximity to villages and rivers especially for areas with higher slopes the three most appropriate thresholds were selected to cause the cultivated land area in each period to be as close as possible to the literature results which are 0 0 032 20 12 km2 0 032 0 053 28 49 km2 0 053 0 162 169 31 km2 and 0 162 0 855 137 59 km2 respectively for human actions from 1980 to 2020 30 m land use cover data from the chinese academy of sciences in 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were used for analysis fig 5b d fig 5b d shows that the lucc from 1980 to 2020 consisted mainly of expanding construction land supplemented by a few forestland restoration efforts among them the area of construction land increased slowly from 1980 to 2000 and showed a rapid increasing trend after 2000 from 75 95 km2 in 2000 to 216 56 km2 in 2015 with an increase of 285 13 for cultivated land the area of dry land generally remained stable while the area of paddy fields continued to decrease from 245 79 km2 to 238 07 km2 a decrease of 3 14 the total area of grassland decreased from 94 93 km2 in 1980 to 81 00 km2 in 2015 and the total area of forestland increased from 260 88 km2 in 2000 to 268 77 km2 in 2015 4 5 evolution of the hwr at the 600 year scale based on the reconstruction of the water cycle process at the basin scale and transition theory the change slopes and average values of the per capita water resources human water consumption forest areas and population are used to determine the key time nodes of the evolution of the hwr in the yangchang river basin from 1470 to 2020 the results show that the hwr developed from the initial resource rich balanced stage to an extensive development unbalanced stage and finally transformed into a rebalancing stage which can be divided into the following four stages predevelopment 1470 1685 take off 1685 1912 acceleration 1912 2000 and rebalancing 2000 2020 fig 6 the predevelopment stage 1470 1685 occurred from the mid ming dynasty to the early qing dynasty for this stage the socioeconomic development level of the basin was slow and the water and forest resources were rich the tunpu people built small water conservancy projects which had little impact on the environment making the hwr a resource rich balanced stage in detail the population growth was slow 16 people a 1 and the per capita water resources exhibited a rapid decreasing trend pcwr k1 0 073 thousand m3 a 1 under the influence of precipitation change and population growth the per capita water resources were relatively abundant with an average of 29 30 thousand m3 capita year 1 and the short stage of growth of the per capita water resources was due to the population decline from 1620 to 1637 when war was frequent during the transition of dynasties sheng et al 2019 although human water consumption showed an insignificant increasing trend hwc k1 0 03 106 m3 a 1 the average annual human water consumption was 13 37 106 m3 which accounted for only 6 62 of the average runoff at this stage at the same time the basin was rich in forest resources with an average forest area of 599 93 km2 which accounted for 83 of the total basin area and the decreasing trend was not obvious fa k1 0 92 km2 a 1 the take off stage 1685 1912 occurred in the middle and late qing dynasty with the decrease in warfare and gradual stabilization of society socioeconomic development began to promote during this stage the human impact on the water cycle process was still slight and the water and forest resources were still at relatively rich levels however the hwr began to shift towards an imbalance at this stage the population increased 106 people a 1 the decreasing rate of the per capita water resources was slightly lower than that of the predevelopment stage due to the increased precipitation caused by the strong monsoon period during this stage pcwr k2 0 044 thousand m3 a 1 nevertheless its average value was 9 59 thousand m3 capita year 1 only 32 75 of the value during the predevelopment stage to meet the agricultural needs of the increased population the area of cultivated land expanded slightly which resulted in a 300 increasing rate of human water consumption compared to that of the predevelopment stage hwc k2 0 09 106 m3 a 1 however its proportion of runoff was only 15 66 although the forest resources have decreased slightly they are still relatively abundant the forestland area accounts for 79 45 of the total basin area but its reduction rate is 415 22 of that of the predevelopment stage fa k2 3 82 km2 a 1 the acceleration stage 1912 2000 occurred during the transition from the republic of china to new china with the changes in the socioeconomic system and the liberation of productive forces socioeconomic development accelerated extensively the utilization degree of water resources reached a high level and the number of water resources in the basin struggled to support higher intensity development meanwhile with the reduction in forestland the eco environmental quality increasingly declined and the hwr entered an extensive development unbalanced stage during this stage the population growth rate increased further 1711 people a 1 which resulted in a faster decrease in per capita water resources pcwr k3 0 049 thousand m3 a 1 with the average value decreasing to 3 09 thousand m3 capita year 1 due to the surge in cultivated land irrigation and human domestic water demand human water consumption increased rapidly hwc k3 2 19 106 m3 a 1 accounting for 57 86 of the total runoff on average and peaked at 94 10 in 1985 meanwhile to provide the necessary land for the expansion of cultivated and construction land the forestland area rapidly decreased fa k3 70 52 km2 a 1 reaching its lowest value of 244 47 km2 in 1999 the rebalancing stage 2000 2020 occurred during the china period due to the impact of ecological civilization policy the basin maintained a rapid level of socioeconomic development but also considered the protection of water resources and restoration of the eco environment making the hwr transition to a rebalancing stage with high consumption and high output at this stage the population growth rate reached its highest level 2737 people a 1 although the average per capita value of water resources was as low as 1 20 thousand m3 capita year 1 its decreasing trend was alleviated to some extent pcwr k4 0 007 thousand m3 a 1 due to the reduced area of cultivated land human water consumption exhibited a significant decrease after increasing during the first three stages hwc k4 0 21 106 m3 a 1 and accounted for 77 81 of the runoff on average this result means that the yangchang river basin relied on less water to feed more humans than before at the same time the forest area exhibited an increasing trend for the first time fa k4 1 11 km2 a 1 which suggests improved eco environmental quality and water conservation capacity 5 discussion 5 1 why has the water cycle process remained stable at the village scale over the past six centuries although the population and construction land area of baojia tun have grown continuously over the past 600 years the socioeconomic development mode is mainly a small scale peasant economy resulting in the composition of water use units in the water cycle process at the village scale remaining stable human water consumption is still dominated by irrigation water however the percentages of the various elements in the water cycle process have transformed fig 3 from the lucc of the whole basin the cultivated land area in the basin has increased significantly since 1470 the ming dynasty except for the large scale expansion of construction land around cities and towns after 2000 the lucc around other small residential areas is similar to that around baojia tun thus the socioeconomic development mode in the basin is still dominated by a small scale peasant economy therefore it can be inferred that the mode of human influence on the water cycle process in the basin has not changed and the water cycle process in baojia tun can be extended to the analysis of the evolution of the hwr at the basin scale the main reasons why the water cycle process in tunpu has generally remained stable include natural and cultural factors among them the natural factors are mainly related to the fact that tunpu in the yangchang river basin is located on the anshun plain which has open terrain fertile soil and excellent climatic conditions the unique climate results in seldom hot summers and cold winters which are suitable for the growth of crops therefore tunpu has become an important grain production region in guizhou province chen 2016 the specific cultural factor is that tunpu culture has extraordinary academic and cultural value to fully protect tunpu villages the local government focuses on developing industries such as the culture and tourism of tunpu villages this development led to the entire basin s socioeconomic development mode still being dominated by a small scale peasant economy thus no large scale industrial developments have been carried out chen 2018 5 2 what are the driving forces of the runoff changes at the basin scale from 1470 to 2020 the runoff trend shifted from a slow decrease to an accelerated increase under the joint impacts of climate change and human activities the rate of change increased from 6 21 104 m3 a 1 in the ming dynasty 1470 1636 to 48 78 104 m3 a 1 during the china period e g 1949 2020 fig 4 regarding climate change precipitation has the greatest impact on runoff there is an obvious positive correlation between precipitation and runoff r 2 0 91 consistent with the existing research conclusions yuan et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 in addition human activities can be divided into irrigation water intake and lucc to determine the extent of the impacts of different human activities on the water cycle process runoff calculations can be conducted by controlling the land use cover or irrigation water volume fig 7 fig 7 shows that the increased runoff in the basin results from the offsetting impacts of two different human activities on the water cycle process the increased runoff caused by lucc is greater than the decreased runoff caused by irrigation water intake compared with the scenario where no human activities are considered the change rate of runoff increased significantly from 0 71 105 m3 a 1 to 1 54 105 m3 a 1 under the lucc from 1470 to 2020 meanwhile the lucc in each stage leads to runoff increases but their impacts are distinct from the predevelopment to acceleration stage the degree of impact of the lucc gradually increases from 0 93 to 22 26 and the lucc modes consist mainly of the transformation from forestland to cultivated land which will reduce the total evapotranspiration during this period and increase the runoff du et al 2018 during the rebalancing stage the impact degree of the lucc is only 1 36 the main lucc modes consist of the expansion of construction land and restoration of forestland and the increase in runoff caused by the impermeability of construction land is less than the decrease in runoff caused by the increase in evapotranspiration of forestland zhao et al 2016 then under a scenario that considers both lucc and irrigation at the same time from 1470 to 2020 the change rate of runoff decreased significantly from 1 54 105 m3 a 1 to 0 92 105 m3 a 1 it can also be found that irrigation always causes reductions in the runoff and the impact of irrigation gradually increased from 1 54 in the predevelopment stage to 17 12 in the rebalancing stage due to the continuous increase in the average cultivated land area 5 3 how does ecological civilization policy affect the evolution of the hwr the hwr developed from the initial resource rich balanced stage to the extensive development unbalanced stage and finally transformed into the rebalancing stage after 2000 fig 5 which is similar to the conclusions of studies of the tarim river basin liu et al 2014 heihe river basin lu et al 2015 and loess plateau wu et al 2020 the main reason for the rebalancing of the hwr is likely because china recognizes that the extensive development mode is unsustainable and needs to complete the transformation from industrial civilization to ecological civilization pan 2012 lu et al 2019 tunpu and its location in guizhou province have responded positively and taken a series of ecological civilization policies which are not just slogans or visions but are ongoing processes pan 2012 for example since the state council of china passed the regulations on grain for green in 2002 guizhou province has completed the task of the grain for green project of 20 47 thousand km2 and the forest coverage rate in the entire province has increased from 22 8 in 1975 to 59 95 in 2020 the value of the annual ecological benefit that was created by the grain for green project reached 84 072 billion yuan and the soil erosion modulus decreased from 3325 t km2 a 1 in 2000 to 631 4 t km2 a 1 in 2017 xiao et al 2015 zhang and yang 2021 in addition since the state council of china passed the outline of comprehensive control plan for rocky desertification in southwestern china in 2008 78 karst counties in guizhou province officially launched the comprehensive control project of rocky desertification which is planned for 45 years at the cost of 76 029 billion yuan to complete the comprehensive control area of 7 million hectares of rocky desertification in 2012 the no 2 document of the state council of china regarded the construction of an important ecological security barrier in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and pearl river as one of the five strategic positions of guizhou in the future in 2016 guizhou province was established as a national ecological civilization pilot area with the overall goal of building a colourful guizhou park province jiang et al 2014 taking an early ecological civilization policy the grain for green project as an example this policy plans to transform sloping and degraded farmland or wasteland into forests or grasslands xie et al 2018 thus the improved vegetation cover can improve eco environmental quality water conservation capacity soil erosion and biodiversity griscom et al 2017 newmark et al 2017 zinda et al 2017 bastin et al 2019 lu et al 2020 peng et al 2022 yan et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 for further analysis we used satellite remote sensing mod13a1 006 terra vegetation indices 500 m aerial remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing of the yangchang river basin it can be more clearly observed that whether in natural areas or areas with human activities the yangchang river basin is paying attention to restoring the eco environment while promoting socioeconomic development good eco environmental quality can maintain the healthy operation of the water system by increasing the water conservation capacity fig 8 for the entire basin the average normalized difference vegetation index ndvi exhibited an obvious increasing trend with a rate of 0 002 a 1 from 2001 to 2020 p 0 05 this indicates that the entire basin is turning green and is consistent with the previous land use cover results fig 5 regarding the spatial distribution the ndvi of 79 04 of the basin exhibits an increasing trend and is mainly distributed in the middle and southern portions of the basin the land use cover types in these areas consist mainly of cultivated land forest and grassland which are the main areas for the grain for green project by comparing the aerial remote sensing images and unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing images of areas a and b shown in fig 8 it is clear that the conversion from sloping farmland to forestland has significantly improved the level of forestland coverage meanwhile the remaining 20 96 of the basin with a decreased ndvi is mainly distributed near the cities and towns in the basin where the construction land expansion was concentrated in the basin from 2001 to 2020 however as shown in fig 8 the transformation from cultivated land to forestland can still be found and the low coverage grasslands on the mountains are also changing to forestland with high coverage in the images of areas c and d in general the synchronous promotion of socioeconomic development and ecological civilization policy has realized the unity of socioeconomic and ecological benefits making the hwr exhibit a good sign of rebalancing these ecological civilization policies proposed by the state council of china such as the grain for green project comprehensive management of rocky desertification and the construction of an important ecological security barrier in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and pearl river effectively improved vegetation cover and ecological environment quality in the study area and across guizhou province which is conducive to improving water conservation capacity 6 conclusion to reveal the impact of policies on the hwr the reconstruction of the water cycle process based on an improved water balance formula and rshs technology was validated using mada grid dwi measured precipitation and runoff through the reconstruction of the water cycle process over nearly 600 years the long term evolution of the hwr in baojia tun and its basin has been revealed the main results are as follows the hwr developed from the initial resource rich balanced stage to the extensive development unbalanced stage and finally transformed into the rebalancing stage the four stages are predevelopment 1470 1685 take off 1685 1912 acceleration 1912 2000 and rebalancing 2000 2020 at the village scale due to the suitable geographical conditions and cultural value the composition of water use units in the water cycle process has generally remained stable over nearly 600 years from the ming dynasty to modern times the human impacts on the water cycle process were dominated by irrigation water only the deforestation caused by the expansion of towns and cultivated land increased the proportion of runoff in precipitation by 9 60 at the basin scale due to the fluctuating growth of precipitation and the increased runoff caused by lucc being greater than the decreased runoff caused by irrigation water intake the runoff trend changed from a slow decrease to an accelerated increase from 1470 to 2020 the change rate of runoff increased from 6 21 104 m3 a 1 in the ming dynasty 1470 1636 and gradually increased to 47 78 104 m3 a 1 in the china stage 1949 2020 the synchronous promotion of socioeconomic development and the ecological civilization policy has realized the unity of socioeconomic and ecological benefits making the hwr exhibit a good sign of rebalancing these ecological civilization policies proposed by the state council of china such as the grain for green project comprehensive management of rocky desertification and the construction of an important ecological security barrier in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and pearl river effectively improved vegetation cover and ecological environment quality in the study area and across guizhou province which is conducive to improving water conservation capacity this research reveals the positive effect of ecological civilization policy on the development of tunpu through the analysis of the long term evolution of the hwr which can eliminate the unfavourable factors in the previous development model and adjust it to a sustainable development model providing significant enlightenment for long term planning and policy formulation for sustainable high quality development in other countries or regions in the future while ensuring the synchronous promotion of socioeconomic development and the ecological civilization policy it is noteworthy that massive vegetation restoration caused by ecological civilization policy will enhance the interception of surface runoff thus more attention should be given to finding reasonable ways to exploit the increasing soil moisture and improve the efficiency of water resource utilization rather than extensive and greedy methods in addition to irrigation and domestic water factors such as war human ideology and consciousness proposed in the social sciences can affect the evolution of the hwr which needs to be examined
