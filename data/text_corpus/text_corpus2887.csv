14435,the ion exchange method has great potential for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions in this study after the pre selection experiments among 14 medicinal herb wastes the ion exchange capacity of the raw chicory waste and its modified forms were evaluated for the removal of pb2 and cd2 from aqueous solutions furthermore kinetics equilibrium isotherms and column studies were conducted modification of the raw chicory waste by cacl2 increased the cation exchange capacity as well as the pb2 and cd2 removal efficiency the maximum adsorption capacities were increased from 103 1 and 53 8 mg g 1 by raw chicory waste to 123 5 and 64 5 mg g 1 by modified chicory waste for pb2 and cd2 respectively exchange of pb2 and cd2 ions with alkali metals na and k and alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 onto the waste surface during the removal experiments indicated that the ion exchange could be the dominant mechanism for the removal of pb2 and cd2 in addition the regeneration of raw and modified chicory waste loaded by pb2 and cd2 with distilled water was not possible while eluting the waste using cacl2 nacl and hno3 could effectively recover both metals it was concluded that the prepared bio ion exchanger from chicory waste could be a promising and low cost alternative to synthetic resins for the removal of heavy metals from the water and wastewater keywords ion exchange chemical modification biowaste heavy metals water treatment 1 introduction heavy metals hms are amongst the most crucial water pollutants in the environment and thus limit natural water usage unlike organic compounds hms are not decomposable through chemical and biological processes in the environment they are highly toxic and also can be accumulated in plants animals and humans 1 2 among hms lead pb and cadmium cd listed as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 3 are of such high concern that they are considered to be toxic and dangerous even in low concentrations therefore they are of critical importance and must be removed from the aquatic environment 4 the major sources of pb and cd pollution are industrial wastewaters including wastewaters of mining paint pigments electroplating metal smelting wood preservation manufacturing of batteries and agricultural activities through the application of fertilizers and pesticides and urban wastewaters 5 6 the ion exchange process is a very efficient method due to its high capacity efficiency speed selectivity and low amount of sludge production 7 in this process the cations and anions are separated from the solution and enter the exchanger surface at the same time different ions with the same charge are released from the exchanger to the solution 8 9 there are several types of materials that can exchange ions and hence be used for the purification of polluted aqueous solutions and the softening of hard waters these ion exchangers can be natural based e g zeolite vermiculite polysaccharide protein and carbonaceous materials or synthetic e g zeolites titanates and silicotitans polystyrene divinylbenzene phenol and acrylic 10 11 resins are among the most practical cation and anion exchangers most of the resins are synthetic materials and despite their excellent performance in the removal of hms they are costly on the other hand the synthetic ion exchangers may have harmful effects on the environment due to the high use of chemicals in their production process for instance bisphenol a is used as a basic raw chemical for the production of epoxy resins 12 13 but can mimic the hormones of humans and animals and cause a detrimental effect on human health reproduction of wildlife embryonic development and the induction of genetic aberrations 14 furthermore exposure to epichlorohydrin another known compound used for production of ion exchangers has shown skin tumors 15 genetic damage on male reproductive function and animal infertility 16 as well as possible carcinogenic effects 17 mutagenic effects on fungi bacteria and plant 18 and respiratory and dermal toxicity in animals and humans 19 the use of natural materials can not only decrease the production costs by as much as one tenth of the synthetic ones but also reduce the hazards of chemicals significantly 20 natural wastes and by products have the great potential to remove the hms from aquatic environments they are renewable low cost biodegradable environmentally friendly and highly efficient 21 medicinal herb wastes are by products of distillation factories which can be used in this regard cichorium intybus l commonly known as chicory as a medicinal herb belongs to the asteraceae family it is a native plant of europe west asia and north africa 22 23 however it has a broad geographic distribution all over the world with many commercial uses e g medicinal herb coffee substitute vegetable crop and occasionally for animal forage and for ethanol production by direct fermentation 24 the food and agriculture organization fao reported that the world production of lettuce and chicory was about 26 8 million tons in 2016 an estimated 530 000 tons of which were produced in iran 25 because of its particular chemical compositions and physiological bioactivities extracts of chicory are used as salubrious beverages functional foods additives and as natural medicine drugs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus coronary heart disease chronic liverish disease allergic or infective disease inflammation and even types of cancer 24 generally a large amount of chicory waste is produced in essence extraction factories of which its management is very important particularly in iran as one of the leading producers of medicinal plants in the world at the moment most of these waste materials are disposed of at considerable expense consequently their valorization is of great importance for sustainable waste management in this regards synthesis of an ion exchanger with high added value from chicory wastes as cheap and available materials for the removal of heavy metals from water is justifiable both from the environmental and the economic perspectives although most of the natural materials used to remove hms have been considered as an adsorbent in the biosorption process 26 less attention has been paid to their application as an ion exchanger additionally the few published studies concerning the production of bio ion exchangers have often focused on the use of marine macroalgae such as laminaria hyperborea fucus spiralis pelvetia caniculata and ascophyllum nodosum 20 therefore this work aimed to investigate the possibility of using raw and modified chicory waste cw generated in essence extraction factories as a new cationic bioexchanger for the removal of pb2 and cd2 from aqueous solutions according to our knowledge these medicinal plant wastes have not been used as ion exchangers before we hypothesize that the material characteristics such as surface functional groups could act as active sites for pb and cd cation removal through the ion exchange mechanism it seems that the surface modification of the cw via different chemical treatments may improve their ion exchange efficiency in this regard the raw and modified chicories were characterized using different methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 hm solutions the stock solutions of pb2 and cd 2 1000 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving 160 mg and 180 mg of pb no3 2 4h2o and cdcl2 h2o respectively in 1 l of distilled water different concentrations of pb2 and cd2 were obtained by diluting the stock solution the ph of the solutions was adjusted at 5 using 0 1 m solutions of hcl and naoh all the chemicals used were of the analytical grade obtained from merck company germany 2 2

2300 were used to obtain the cation exchange capacity cec 0 5 g of cw were mixed with 16 ml of 1 n sodium acetate solution for five minutes and then separated by centrifugation hettich rotina 380 for 5 min at 3000 rpm this step was repeated three times the same process was then performed using 96 ethyl alcohol instead of sodium acetate consequently ammonium acetate 1 n was used as an extractant and the solution was then centrifuged this step was repeated three times and the supernatant solutions were collected in each time in 50 ml volumetric flask and then mixed with ammonium acetate solution to reach 50 ml the concentration of sodium in this solution was measured by a flame photometer cole parmer pfp7 and then cec was calculated the concentrations of hms pb2 and cd2 alkali metals na and k and alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 in dry samples of rcw were measured using dry ash method 35 one gram of exchanger was converted to ash in a furnace at 550 c for 4 h next the ash was digested by 5 ml of hno3 25 v v and the volume reached to 25 ml the amount of pb2 cd2 ca2 and mg2 in acid digested solutions were measured using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas perkinelmer aanalyst700 a flame photometer was used to measure the concentration of na and k in these solutions the ph of the rcw was measured using ph meter jenway 3330 1 g of biomass was placed in an erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 100 ml of distilled water and boiled for 5 min the solution was diluted to 200 ml by adding distilled water and cooled at room temperature then it was stirred and the ph was determined 31 2 4 bio ion exchanger modification to find out the most efficient form of cw for removal of pb2 and cd2 from aqueous solutions different types of particle size number of washing and using hot water

then replaced by 250 ml of new distilled water and the replacement process was repeated for three times next the biomass was filtered and dried at 60 c for 24 h 2 4 3 hot water 0 5 g of rcw was added into 250 ml flasks poured with distilled water with different temperatures 50 c 70 c and 100 c and kept for 30 min in these conditions then the solutions were filtered by whatman filter paper no 42 and biomasses were dried in an oven at 60 c for 24 h 2 4 4 dry heating oven 0 5 g of rcw was placed onto 3 glass plates separately the glass plates were kept in an oven at 50 c 70 c and 10 c for 4 h and then cooled at room temperature 2 4 5 wet heating autoclaving 0 5 g of rcw was added into 250 ml beakers separately the beakers were put in an autoclave under pressure of 15 bars at 50 c 70 c and 100 c for 2 h after the autoclaving process and cooling the samples were removed and used for the experiments 2 4 6 chemical modification to improve the cation exchange capacity of rcw modification of biomass were performed in calcium sodium and hydrogen forms 250 ml 1 m of various solutions including ca2 solution cacl2 na solutions nacl na2so4 ch3coona nac12h25so4 and naoh and h solutions hno3 hcl h2so4 h3po4 c6h8o6 and ch3cooh were separately poured in 500 ml flasks in each container 2 g of biomass was added and the containers were then placed at 25 2 c for two 12 hour cycles at an incubator shaker at 150 rpm after each cycle the old solution was replaced with a new one 30 the solutions were passed through whatman filter paper no 42 and washed several times with distilled water to decrease the ec and the ph of the outlet solution to the neutral value 2 4 7 rcw sodium alginate bead immobilized beads was prepared by mixing sodium alginate and rcw in different ratios of 1 1 1 3 and 1 6 biomass g sodium alginate g different amounts of sodium alginate were completely dissolved in 50 ml distilled water by stirring then 1 5 g of biomass was added to the solution and they were mixed to provide a homogenized suspension it was shaken for about 1 h to eliminate the resulting bubbles and slowly poured into 1 m solution of cacl2 by syringe the prepared beads were kept in the cacl2 solution for 24 h for hardening and then they were filtered washed with distilled water several times and dried at ambient temperature for 24 h 2 5 batch experiments 2 5 1 medicinal herb waste selection 0 05 g of each medicinal herb waste was placed in 100 ml flasks separately in contact with 50 ml of 50 mg l 1 pb2 and cd2 solution separately equivalent to 0 48 meq l 1 pb2 and 0 89 meq l 1 cd2 at ph 5 for 60 min on a rotary shaker at 300 rpm metal solutions were ﬁltered by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 5 min and the residual pb2 and cd2 concentrations were measured using faas all the experiments were performed in duplicate and the mean value of the results was reported 2 5 2 modification selection and optimization batch experiments were also performed to determine the effect of cacl2 modifications on pb2 and cd2 removal efficiency from aqueous solutions for this purpose the removal experiments as described in the previous section were performed with 0 05 g 1 g l 1 of each pretreated cw the pretreated sample with highest efficiency of pb2 and cd2 removal was selected for further experiments to optimize the effect of temperature 25 50 and 100 c and the modifier solution concentration 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 m the biomass modified in the optimum conditions was called mcw modified chicory waste mcw was characterized using ft ir and sem edax analyses 2 5 3 ion exchange process before doing the experiment the ion exchangers were washed several times to decrease the ec to an acceptable level to prevent the interferences of the ions in washing the extracts of the biomass structure with pb2 and cd2 exchange the ion exchange experiments by rcw and mcw were done using the same removal method as described in the section of 2 5 1 next the concentration of hms pb2 and cd2 alkali metals na and k and alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 were measured in the solution phase simultaneously the concentration of these metals in the solid phase bio ion exchanger were calculated for mass balance study using dry ash method 35 accordingly the mechanism of heavy metals removal through ion exchange was investigated by comparing the amount of hms alkali and alkaline earth metals in solid and solution phases as the matrix effect is an important problem in the removal of metal ions in real samples the effect of interference was studied in the synthetic solutions and industrial wastewater sample for selected mcw standard solutions of ni mo ag mn as al cu k cd pb mg po4 zn and cr were added separately to 50 mg l 1 of pb2 or cd2 solutions in binary model and the proposed batch procedure was applied to determine the effects of the competition between the ions on the metal removal to evaluate the efficiency of the bio ion exchanger in wastewater treatment an industrial wastewater obtained from a local galvanizing company the process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron was used the wastewater ph and ec was 6 0 and 3 8 ms cm 1 respectively the pb and cd concentration was less than the instrumental detection limit 15 and 0 8 μg l 1 whereas the concentrations of ni cu and cr were 0 069 0 065 and 0 072 mg l 1 respectively the ph of the wastewater sample was adjusted to 5 0 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions before the experiments furthermore the initial concentrations of pb2 and cd2 in the wastewater were increased to 10 30 and 50 mg l 1 by adding the metal solutions and the removal experiments were carried out under the same conditions for the synthetic solutions 2 6 regeneration experiments 0 05 g of saturated bio ion exchangers rcw and mcw containing pb2 and cd2 were separately shaken in contact with 50 ml eluent solutions of 1 m nacl cacl2 hno3 and distilled water in the end the concentrations of the recovered pb2 and cd2 in the solutions were measured the recovery efficiency of pb2 and cd2 was calculated using the following equation 36 10 d q e r e c o v e r y q e s o r p t i o n 100 where d is the hm recovery efficiency qe recovery and qe sorption are the hm recovery and sorption capacity mg g 1 respectively the hm recovery capacity was calculated as follows 11 q e r e c o v e r y v c f m where qe recovery is the amount of hm recovered from one gram of saturated ion exchanger mg g 1 cf is the hm concentration in the recovery solution mg l 1 v is the recovery solution volume l and m is the hm saturated ion exchanger weight g 50 ml of different concentrations 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 m of the eluent solution were placed in contact with the saturated bio ion exchangers containing pb2 and cd2 to examine the optimum concentration of the eluent for the regeneration process 2 7 column experiments a continuous flow ion exchange experiment was conducted using a teflon column 150 height 30 diameter mm to avoid biomass loss a small amount of glass wool was plugged at the bottom of the column then the column was packed with 0 1 g of mcw before loading the pb2 and cd2 solutions the column was washed with distilled water the continuous experiments were carried out by separately pumping 500 ml of pb2 and cd2 solution 50 mg l 1 into the column using a peristaltic pump sina lab equipment sp15 iran with 1 5 ml min 1 flow rate each experiment ran for approximately 430 min to ensure the formation of a complete breakthrough curve and 21 samples were taken at different time intervals during this period 2 8 kinetic and isotherm models kinetic experiments were conducted using the batch equilibrium technique obtained by mixing a known amount of rcw and mcw with 50 ml of pb2 and cd2 solutions in a rotary shaker at 300 rpm and 25 2 c which was sufﬁcient to reach the equilibrium in a 100 ml conical ﬂask in order to evaluate the kinetic data separate ﬂasks were prepared for 0 180 min time intervals for each adsorption isotherm experiment known amounts of rcw and mcw were separately added to 50 ml of pb2 and cd2 solutions in a concentration range from 1 to 150 ppm the mixture was shaken in a rotary shaker at 300 rpm for 1 h at 25 2 c two kinetic models namely pseudo ﬁrst order and pseudo second order were used to investigate the ion exchange kinetic modeling of the experimental data langmuir freundlich and temkin models widely used for the liquid solid systems were employed for the sorption isotherm modeling of the equilibrium data 2 9 statistical analysis the data in this study were analyzed using the spss software package version 21 the one way anova was used to analyze the signiﬁcant effects of various parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of different medicinal herb wastes the removal efficiency r adsorption capacity q mg g 1 and distribution coefficient kd ml g 1 of 14 different medicinal herb wastes were investigated according to the results presented in table s1 and s2 of supplementary file the removal efficiency and the afﬁnity of pb2 to the binding groups kd had the highest value for coriandrum sativum cichorium intybus coriandrum sativum and achillea millefolium cichorium intybus also showed the most removal efficiency and adsorption capacity for cd2 ions higher kd in cichorium intybus waste than in other medicinal herb wastes indicated that more amount of pb2 was adsorbed on its surface in comparison to the concentration of pb2 in the aqueous phase since cichorium intybus is the most abundantly used medicinal herb in iran and since it showed a higher pb2 and cd2 removal in comparison to the other plants all further experiments were conducted using its waste 3 2 characteristics of raw chicory waste rcw the physicochemical parameters of rcw are shown in table 1 the values of proximate analyses of the waste are in accordance with the literature 37 38 the ph of rcw was neutral about 6 which indicates that using chicory for removal of pb2 and cd2 do not change the ph of the solution to acidic or basic ph so it does not have any adverse effects on exchanging of pb2 and cd2 with the surface ions of chicory cation exchange capacity cec of chicory was about 98 cmol kg 1 equal to 98 meq 100g 1 which is high enough for the ion exchange the elemental analysis of chicory showed that there were not any pb2 and cd2 ions in the structure of the biomass and that the ca2 amount was the highest 0 974 meq g 1 among the exchanging ions 3 3 electrical conductivity initial ec of chicory was 1599 μs cm 1 therefore usage of unwashed chicory as ion exchanger may cause some interferences the released alkali and alkaline earth ions particularly ca2 having a high content in the chicory structure may compete with pb2 and cd2 to be exchanged and consequently reduce the exchange rate of the metal ions therefore it is necessary to reduce the negative impact of the ions in the extracted biomass as much as possible for this purpose the raw and modified biomass were rinsed with distilled several times the most significant changes in ec happened during the first and the second rinsing stages and there were fewer changes were in the next rinsing rounds therefore two stages of washing could be sufficient for reducing the interference effect of the ions in the biomass 3 4 effect of physical and chemical modification it has been reported in various studies that the modification processes may increase or decrease the efficiency of the sorbents in order to evaluate the effect of different modifications on pb2 and cd2 removal efficiency of chicory waste various physical and chemical modification methods were investigated four different physical pretreatment methods including using different particle sizes boiling in water heating by oven and autoclaving were investigated according to the results presented in table s3 increasing the size of particles 500 μm decreased the sorption efficiency and capacity of cw chicory waste with particle sizes less than 500 μm showed the highest adsorption capacity of pb2 and cd2 which can be attributed to the higher surface area of the small particles providing the more total area for interacting with hm ions washing the biomass enhanced the pb2 and cd2 removal efficiency due to the removal of dust and other materials which could interfere with the metals however boiling the biomass in hot water at 70 c and 100 c signiﬁcantly decreased the hm sorption table s3 boiling can dissolve the mineral matter decompose the organic matter 39 rupture the biomass cells and cause unavailability of binding sites for hm ions 40 dry heating did not show any signiﬁcant effect on the removal capacity of chicory waste a finding which was in accordance with the previous reports in the literature 39 chicory waste autoclaved at different temperatures and pressure of 15 bar did not have a signiﬁcant effect on hm sorption in comparison to the untreated waste while contradictory results are reported by other researches daneshvar et al 39 indicated that autoclaving of macroalgae biomass reduced the methylene blue biosorption due to the physical and morphological changes in the biomass structure including the destructive effect of dry heating on functional groups of algae cell walls on the other hand abdollah and taha 41 represented that autoclaving of the fungal biomass might increase the porosity and surface area which can increase the ion removal efficiency of the biomass this statement confirms that depending on the biomass type and its reactions under high pressure and heat dry heating can have different effects on its sorption capacity the chemical modification of cw was carried out using various chemical reagents the results of the pb2 and cd2 removal experiment showed that modification with na and h solutions reduced the ion exchange capacity of cw however the cacl2 modification could significantly increase the removal efficiency of pb2 and cd2 the distribution coefficient of ca2 treated cw was at the highest for pb2 and cd2 in comparison to the other treated ones indicating that the most amount of pb2 and cd2 ions in aqueous phase could be adsorbed on the ca2 treated biomass surface p value 0 01 table s3 calcium ion with a higher positive charge than na and h ions could be more efficient for removing the intended ions and exchange with them in some articles ca2 was introduced as the main cation for the removal of hm ions through ion exchange process 42 43 calcium can bind to functional groups and improve cec in this study biomass pretreatment with na solutions decreased the removal efﬁciency of chicory waste a finding which was similar to the results reported by daneshvar et al 39 who mentioned that the adverse effect of naoh in pretreatment might be attributed to biomass agglomeration and reduction of the effective number of binding sites for hm cations in some other studies the efficiency of hm removal by nacl treated algae was slightly better than cacl2 treated one 30 decreasing the removal efficiency and capacity of h modified chicory treated using acids e g hydrochloric acid and nitric acid could be due to the reduction of chicory surface electronegativity 39 by changing the surface charge of the biomass from negative to positive electrostatic attraction between chicory biomass and hm cation might be decreased 41 these results might also be due to the destruction of binding sites responsible for ion exchange after the biomass was exposed to acids 29 the surface chemical groups of chicory are protonated by pretreatment with strong acids and hence the residual h in the cell wall may compete with the pb2 and cd2 for the surface active sites of the ion exchangers 39 as previously mentioned light metals lms can bond to biomass through electrostatic interactions and play a significant role in the ion exchange of pb2 and cd2 metal complex formation coordination interaction and other processes 42 therefore ca2 mg2 na and k present in the biomass structure are washed away from the biomass as a result of the acid treatment which reduces the exchange rate of pb2 and cd2 moreover the washed lms ca2 mg2 na and k are replaced by h and the biomass surface is protonated consequently the hm ions are then replaced by these protons which decreases the ph of the solution and leads toa reduction of the hms removal due to competition between h and the pb2 and cd2 20 44 maximum pb2 and cd2 adsorption capacity mg g 1 was observed for ca2 treated ion exchanger so further experiments were conducted on optimization of cw with the particle size less than 500 μm by cacl2 modification 1m 3 4 1 effect of cacl2 concentration fig 1 a demonstrated the effect of different concentrations of cacl2 on the removal efficiency of the cw modification process as it is clear by increasing the cacl2 concentration from 0 01 to 1 m the removal efficiency for pb2 and cd2 increase from 29 to 92 and from 26 to 74 respectively increasing the concentration of cacl2 from 1 to 2 m did not affect the pb2 adsorption capacity significantly however it slightly increased the capacity of cd2 sorption therefore the 1m solution of cacl2 was selected for modification of cw for both metals and the modified chicory waste mcw 3 4 2 effect of temperature results revealed that by increasing the temperature from 25 c to 100 c the removal efficiency of pb2 and cd2 by the cw was reduced from 90 to 40 and from 78 to 36 respectively fig 1b hence it is better to modify the cw at the lower temperature the reason could be attributed to the fact that some part of the structure of the ion exchanger might be decomposed at higher temperatures which could lead to the loss of a portion of porosity on the surface of the sorbent 45 besides increasing the temperature could lead to the conversion of some the functional groups to others with less exchange potency 3 5 surface analysis of row and modified chicory waste the sem micrograph of the rcw and mcw are shown in fig 2 overall the samples show a similar morphology which consists of a smooth and ﬁbrillary structure without a deﬁned geometry it was observed that the structure was not damaged or destroyed after the cacl2 modification the ftir spectroscopic analysis of rcw and mcw revealed the functional groups of the exchanger s surface and the possible interactions of these functional groups with the pb2 and cd2 in the solution the broad and strong band between 3600 and 3200 cm 1 seen in the spectra fig 3 are associated with hydroxyl choh stretching and amino groups nh 20 these groups are associated with cellulose and proteins of chicory cell wall a small shift in the mcw band compared to rcw indicates changes in the amino group as a result of the cacl2 modification the shift also suggests that ca2 competes with the hydrogen bonding between the oh groups 46 the peak observed between 3000 and 2800 cm 1 can be attributed to ch groups 43 47 and those at 1650 cm 1 and 1480 cm 1 could be assigned to the carboxylic functional group co 20 moreover the bond between 1050 and 1100 cm 1 might be attributed to c o stretching of alcohol and carboxylic acid 48 3 6 the concentration of ions in solid and solution phases the acid digestion results of rcw showed that the concentration of ca2 0 97 meq g 1 was higher than that of mg2 0 12 meq g 1 na 0 03 meq g 1 and k 0 02 meq g 1 when rcw was modified with cacl2 solution the concentration of mg2 na and k in biomass decreased to 0 07 0 005 and 0 002 meq g 1 respectively while ca2 concentration increased significantly to 1 18 meq g 1 p value 0 01 this was because the ca2 concentration was very high in cacl2 solution hence when these ions were in contact with rcw exchanger na k and mg2 could be replaced and exchanged by the ca2 the results indicated that these wastes could react with ca2 and the functional groups on the surface might be saturated with ca2 hence they showed a higher ability for removing pb2 and cd2 ions via the ion exchange process figs 4b and 5 b the concentration of sum of lms na k ca2 and mg2 increased from 1 150 in rcw figs 4a and 5 a to 1 258 meq g 1 in mcw figs 4b and 5 b comparison of the elemental constitution of rcw and mcw by using elemental microprobe analysis of edax fig s1 approved these results the signals of ca2 na k and mg2 can be observed in fig s1a which are known as the principal elements of cw considering the exchange of ca2 with other lms during cacl2 modification no signals of other lms na k and mg2 were found in the edax results for mcw fig s1b where it is shown that ca2 is the principal element of the mcw due to the increase of ca2 concentration on the surface of modified exchangers from 0 974 meq g 1 in rcw to 1 182 meq g 1 in mcw the cec values significantly increased p value 0 01 from 98 meq 100g 1 in rcw to 118 meq 100g 1 in mcw which caused an increase in hm ion exchange efficiency of mcw after the exchange an experiment in a solution with 50 mg l 1 of the pb2 the loaded pb2 concentration on the rcw and mcw surfaces were 0 30 and 0 42 meq g 1 respectively fig 4 also in a solution with 50 mg l 1 of the cd2 0 59 meq g 1 of cd2 was removed by the rcw while the mcw could remove 0 7 meq g 1 of cd2 fig 5 moreover the amount of ca2 on rcw and mcw decreased through the hm ion exchange process so 0 24 and 0 47 meq g 1 of ca2 in rcw and mcw exchanged with pb2 fig 4 while 0 38 and 0 61 meq g 1 of ca2 in rcw and mcw exchanged with cd2 respectively fig 5 this decrease was well aligned with the amount of ca2 released to both the pb2 and the cd2 solutions after the ion exchange process by rcw and mcw which were respectively 0 26 and 0 45 meq l 1 into pb2 solution and 0 410 and 0 58 meq l 1 into cd2 solution the comparison of pb2 and cd2 concentrations in the solution phase before and after the ion exchange process confirmed these results figs 4 and 5 after the removal experiment by rcw the concentrations of unexchanged pb2 and cd2 in the solutions were 0 12 and 0 31 meq l 1 and after the using mcw the figures were 0 03 and 0 21 meq l 1 respectively the sum of lm concentrations na k ca2 and mg2 in rcw 1 15 meq g 1 decreased to 0 84 and 0 69 meq g 1 after the pb2 and cd2 exchange process respectively figs 4a and 5 a therefore the removal efficiency was about 78 3 for pb2 and 64 7 for cd2 also the sum of lm concentrations in mcw was 1 258 meq g 1 before the ion exchange which decreased to 0 779 and 0 621 meq g 1 respectively after the exchange of pb2 and cd2 these results indicated that 0 479 meq g 1 of these lms were exchanged with pb2 and 0 637 meq g 1 of lms exchanged with cd2 figs 4b and 5 b 1 g l 1 of cw is applied in pb2 and cd2 solution hence meq g 1 is equivalent to meq l 1 therefore the removal efficiency of pb2 and cd2 were 95 3 and 73 3 respectively furthermore edax spectra of rcw fig s1d after pb2 the removal process illustrated the reduction of lms weight and the increase of pb weight compared to their spectra before removal process the spectra of rcw and mcw after cd2 removal which is shown in fig s1 e and f revealed a similar trend of cd and lm signals confirming the occurrence of the ion exchange in another study 29 on the efficiency of algae as an ion exchanger it was also stated that the concentration of ni2 bonded to biomass is proportional to the sum of lm concentrations na k ca2 and mg2 released from its surface based on the ions concentrations in acid digested rcw and mcw solutions before and after pb2 and cd2 exchange experiment reduction of ca2 concentration and increasing of pb2 and cd2 concentration in the solid phase confirmed the exchange of the pb2 and cd2 with ca2 on the surface of rcw and mcw samples besides increasing the ca2 concentration and reduction of the pb2 and cd2 concentrations in the solution phases clearly proved these results among the ions pb2 and cd2 showed a higher potential to be exchanged on the surface of rcw and mcw the high concentration of pb2 and cd2 in the solution phase greater electrical charge for pb2 cd2 is twice that of na and k and greater electronegativity of pb2 and cd2 than mg2 ca2 na and k could be the main reasons for superiority of pb2 and cd2 for exchanging with listed lms 49 50 the exchange experiment of rcw and mcw showed that the removal efficiency of pb2 was 78 3 and 95 3 and of cd2 were 64 7 and 73 3 respectively these results indicated an increase in rcw removal efficiency after the modification process it could be due to the increase in cec after modification of rcw these findings are consistent with various studies indicating that the modification of natural ion exchanger with alkali and alkaline earth chloride salts increased the adsorption capacity of hms 29 it might be due to the trapping of pb2 and cd2 on a nacl treated algae and releasing of na which was attributed to the ion exchange process 20 29 furthermore bhatnagar et al in their study of ni2 biosorption stated that the adsorption of the metal ions on the treated biomass was accompanied by the release of na from the exchanger 29 the results also indicated that the ion exchange selectivity by rcw and mcw was higher for pb2than cd2 in other words the relative exchanging strength of pb2 was greater than that of cd2 this preference could be attributed to hydrated radius pb2 0 401 and cd2 0 426 nm electronegativity pb2 2 10 and cd2 1 69 eh hydration energy 1481 and 1807 kj mol 1 for pb2 and cd2 respectively and pkh negative log of hydrolysis constant 7 78 and 11 70 for pb2 and cd2 respectively higher electronegativity and lower hydrated radius eh and pkh led to a growing tendency of the pb2 than cd2 for both rcw and mcw 50 52 coles et al studied the removal of pb2 and cd2 by kaolinite in the ion exchange process they indicated that the affinity of pb2 to kaolinite was greater than that of cd2 49 similar results were reported in other researches 53 55 according to the above results it can be stated that the main process for the removal of hms in this study was ion exchange in similar articles it was pointed out that the functional groups on the exchanger s surface were able to exchange protons and or alkali ions na and k and alkaline earth ions ca2 and mg2 with hm cations 56 57 it was reported in other researches that cacl2 treated natural exchanger could properly exchange ions in the removal processes removing various types of hms from aqueous solutions by exchanging them with ca2 29 30 3 7 ion exchange modeling 3 7 1 kinetic models the values of kinetic constants for pb2 and cd2 sorption onto rcw and mcw are presented in table 2 the correlation coefﬁcient obtained for the pseudo second order kinetic model was higher than 0 99 was fig s2 which showed that the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order rate expression for removal of pb2 and cd2 the results also indicated higher pb2 and cd2 sorption capacity qe of mcw than of rcw 3 7 2 isotherm models isotherm parameters for pb2 and cd2 sorption by rcw and mcw are given in table 3 it is assumed that in the langmuir model there is no significant competition between the adsorbate and the solvent to occupy the adsorption sites the equilibrium data were also subjected to the temkin isotherm model in which the interactions between hm ion exchanger is based on the assumption that the free energy of sorption is a function of the surface coverage the r2 value of the langmuir model was higher than that of freundlich and tempkin isotherms fig s3 based on langmuir theory the pb2 and cd2 sorption could take place at speciﬁc homogenous sites on the surface of rcw and mcw value of qm which is assumed as the maximum capacity of sorbent has been calculated from the langmuir plots the maximum adsorption capacities of pb2 and cd2 have been increased from 103 11 and 53 76 mg g 1 by rcw to 123 45 and 64 51 mg g 1 by mcw respectively in the langmuir isotherm the dimensionless separation factor rl can be used as an indicator of the favorability of adsorption based on the langmuir isotherm the adsorption is either irreversible r l 0 favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 58 the second situation was true for all the conditions of the current experiment therefore the exchange of pb2 and cd2 with surface alkali and alkaline earth ions of rcw and mcw were favorable 3 8 regeneration of the ion exchanger ion exchanger recovery plays an important role in reducing wastewater treatment costs it not only makes the reuse of the exchanger in several cycles possible but also provides the recovery of hms 20 the results of the rcw and mcw cation exchanger recovery process are shown in fig 6 according to the results distilled water could not recover hms from the solid phase while cacl2 nacl and hno3 could recover metals with different efficiencies another study 59 reported the same result with distilled water and nacl among the rinsing solutions cacl2 had the highest ability to recover hms also increasing the concentration of the cacl2 solution from 0 05 to 1 m significantly increased the pb2 and cd2 recovery due to the higher amount of ca2 ions in the eluent solution sig 0 05 the eluent with the concentration of more than 1 m did not show any significant effect on the recovery of hms fig 7 it should be noted that the regeneration efficiency is an important parameter to scale up the process in this study the possibility of the pb and cd desorption from saturated bio ion exchanger by cacl2 solution was examined without considering the stoichiometric calculations in general the regeneration experiments were conducted in the same method 30 the pb2 recovery rate for rcw and mcw using cacl2 solution was 98 and 95 9 and was 92 and 89 8 for cd2 respectively which was approximately twice than that of hno3 and nacl fig 6 these results can be related to the charge of the existing ions in the rinsing solution since ca2 has two positive charges in comparison to na and h with only one positive charge its tendency and ability to be exchanged by pb2 and cd2 is higher than na and h moreover the results demonstrated that ca2 have more affinity to be exchanged with pb2 than cd2 therefore the amount of the released pb2 to the cacl2 solution was higher than that of cd2 3 9 ion exchange column studies the breakthrough curve showing the relative concentrations versus time for the exchange of pb2 and cd2 on mcw bed are depicted in fig 8 for the initial minutes the efﬂuent from the bottom of the bed was almost free of pb and cd ions due to the high availability of active sites on mcw indicating that the column was performing at a maximum efficiency during that period as the solution continued to ﬂow the available active sites were gradually occupied and accordingly the outlet concentration of pb and cd ions began to increase however more than 50 of pb2 and cd2 could be removed after 90 and 120 min respectively the biomass exhaustion occurred at approximately 330 and 360 min after pb and cd removal respectively 3 10 interference study to assess the suitability of the proposed method in pb2 and cd2 removal the interference of several ions was determined the results showed that mo2 ag k and po4 3 did not affect the efficiency of the ion exchanger for pb2 besides ag k and po4 3 did not interfere with cd2 removal however 50 mg l 1 concentration of cu2 zn2 as2 and mg2 were found to reduce the removal efficiencies of both pb2 and cd2 3 11 removal of hms from industrial wastewater the proposed method was applied to determine the heavy metal ion removal using mcw in real industrial wastewater sample the results table 4 indicated the considerable efficiency of the synthesized ion exchanger for removal of pb2 and cd2 which was in the range of 72 85 and 43 68 respectively in various initial concentrations 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the potential application of various medicinal wastes to exchange pb2 and cd2 ions from aqueous solutions among the used wastes chicory waste showed an excellent ability to exchange the metal ions with its surface elements modification of cw using cacl2 solution in ambient temperature could increase cec from 98 to 118 cmol kg 1 equal to 98 to 118 meq 100 g 1 and enhance its efficiency in the ion exchange process the maximum pb2 and cd2 adsorption capacity by mcw reached to about 123 5 and 64 5 mg g 1 respectively while the corresponding amounts for raw materials were 103 1 and 53 8 mg g 1 respectively indicating an increase in hm adsorption capacity after the modification process because of releasing of alkali and alkaline earth ions particularly ca2 from rcw and mcw into the solution and removing of pb2 and cd2 from the solutions it was found that the main mechanism for the removal of the metals by rcw and mcw was the ion exchange recovery of the metals by cacl2 nacl and hno3 and the lack of recovery by distilled water reinforced the ion exchange mechanism further researches are needed to evaluate the robustness and degradation of the chicory waste during the application as well as to develop the scale up of the process considering the economic aspects acknowledgments the authors would like to appreciate professor mohammad j taherzadeh for his guidance and revision of

14435,the ion exchange method has great potential for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions in this study after the pre selection experiments among 14 medicinal herb wastes the ion exchange capacity of the raw chicory waste and its modified forms were evaluated for the removal of pb2 and cd2 from aqueous solutions furthermore kinetics equilibrium isotherms and column studies were conducted modification of the raw chicory waste by cacl2 increased the cation exchange capacity as well as the pb2 and cd2 removal efficiency the maximum adsorption capacities were increased from 103 1 and 53 8 mg g 1 by raw chicory waste to 123 5 and 64 5 mg g 1 by modified chicory waste for pb2 and cd2 respectively exchange of pb2 and cd2 ions with alkali metals na and k and alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 onto the waste surface during the removal experiments indicated that the ion exchange could be the dominant mechanism for the removal of pb2 and cd2 in addition the regeneration of raw and modified chicory waste loaded by pb2 and cd2 with distilled water was not possible while eluting the waste using cacl2 nacl and hno3 could effectively recover both metals it was concluded that the prepared bio ion exchanger from chicory waste could be a promising and low cost alternative to synthetic resins for the removal of heavy metals from the water and wastewater keywords ion exchange chemical modification biowaste heavy metals water treatment 1 introduction heavy metals hms are amongst the most crucial water pollutants in the environment and thus limit natural water usage unlike organic compounds hms are not decomposable through chemical and biological processes in the environment they are highly toxic and also can be accumulated in plants animals and humans 1 2 among hms lead pb and cadmium cd listed as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 3 are of such high concern that they are considered to be toxic and dangerous even in low concentrations therefore they are of critical importance and must be removed from the aquatic environment 4 the major sources of pb and cd pollution are industrial wastewaters including wastewaters of mining paint pigments electroplating metal smelting wood preservation manufacturing of batteries and agricultural activities through the application of fertilizers and pesticides and urban wastewaters 5 6 the ion exchange process is a very efficient method due to its high capacity efficiency speed selectivity and low amount of sludge production 7 in this process the cations and anions are separated from the solution and enter the exchanger surface at the same time different ions with the same charge are released from the exchanger to the solution 8 9 there are several types of materials that can exchange ions and hence be used for the purification of polluted aqueous solutions and the softening of hard waters these ion exchangers can be natural based e g zeolite vermiculite polysaccharide protein and carbonaceous materials or synthetic e g zeolites titanates and silicotitans polystyrene divinylbenzene phenol and acrylic 10 11 resins are among the most practical cation and anion exchangers most of the resins are synthetic materials and despite their excellent performance in the removal of hms they are costly on the other hand the synthetic ion exchangers may have harmful effects on the environment due to the high use of chemicals in their production process for instance bisphenol a is used as a basic raw chemical for the production of epoxy resins 12 13 but can mimic the hormones of humans and animals and cause a detrimental effect on human health reproduction of wildlife embryonic development and the induction of genetic aberrations 14 furthermore exposure to epichlorohydrin another known compound used for production of ion exchangers has shown skin tumors 15 genetic damage on male reproductive function and animal infertility 16 as well as possible carcinogenic effects 17 mutagenic effects on fungi bacteria and plant 18 and respiratory and dermal toxicity in animals and humans 19 the use of natural materials can not only decrease the production costs by as much as one tenth of the synthetic ones but also reduce the hazards of chemicals significantly 20 natural wastes and by products have the great potential to remove the hms from aquatic environments they are renewable low cost biodegradable environmentally friendly and highly efficient 21 medicinal herb wastes are by products of distillation factories which can be used in this regard cichorium intybus l commonly known as chicory as a medicinal herb belongs to the asteraceae family it is a native plant of europe west asia and north africa 22 23 however it has a broad geographic distribution all over the world with many commercial uses e g medicinal herb coffee substitute vegetable crop and occasionally for animal forage and for ethanol production by direct fermentation 24 the food and agriculture organization fao reported that the world production of lettuce and chicory was about 26 8 million tons in 2016 an estimated 530 000 tons of which were produced in iran 25 because of its particular chemical compositions and physiological bioactivities extracts of chicory are used as salubrious beverages functional foods additives and as natural medicine drugs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus coronary heart disease chronic liverish disease allergic or infective disease inflammation and even types of cancer 24 generally a large amount of chicory waste is produced in essence extraction factories of which its management is very important particularly in iran as one of the leading producers of medicinal plants in the world at the moment most of these waste materials are disposed of at considerable expense consequently their valorization is of great importance for sustainable waste management in this regards synthesis of an ion exchanger with high added value from chicory wastes as cheap and available materials for the removal of heavy metals from water is justifiable both from the environmental and the economic perspectives although most of the natural materials used to remove hms have been considered as an adsorbent in the biosorption process 26 less attention has been paid to their application as an ion exchanger additionally the few published studies concerning the production of bio ion exchangers have often focused on the use of marine macroalgae such as laminaria hyperborea fucus spiralis pelvetia caniculata and ascophyllum nodosum 20 therefore this work aimed to investigate the possibility of using raw and modified chicory waste cw generated in essence extraction factories as a new cationic bioexchanger for the removal of pb2 and cd2 from aqueous solutions according to our knowledge these medicinal plant wastes have not been used as ion exchangers before we hypothesize that the material characteristics such as surface functional groups could act as active sites for pb and cd cation removal through the ion exchange mechanism it seems that the surface modification of the cw via different chemical treatments may improve their ion exchange efficiency in this regard the raw and modified chicories were characterized using different methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 hm solutions the stock solutions of pb2 and cd 2 1000 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving 160 mg and 180 mg of pb no3 2 4h2o and cdcl2 h2o respectively in 1 l of distilled water different concentrations of pb2 and cd2 were obtained by diluting the stock solution the ph of the solutions was adjusted at 5 using 0 1 m solutions of hcl and naoh all the chemicals used were of the analytical grade obtained from merck company germany 2 2

oven at a temperature of 60 c for 24 h 29 30 the dried materials were further crushed by a moulinex mill and sieved with mesh 40 the chicory waste which showed a higher effect on the hm removal efficiency in comparison to the other medicinal herbs was chosen for the next set of experiments and is called rcw raw chicory waste in this text proximate analysis was done by weighing 1 g of rcw

groups to study the morphology of bio ion exchanger scanning electron microscopy sem in a philips xi30 microscope at 30 kv voltage equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx seron ais 2300 were used to obtain the cation exchange capacity cec 0 5 g of cw were mixed with 16 ml of 1 n sodium acetate solution for five minutes and then separated by centrifugation hettich rotina 380 for 5 min at 3000 rpm this step was repeated three times the same process was then performed using 96 ethyl alcohol instead of sodium acetate consequently ammonium acetate 1 n was used as an extractant and the solution was then centrifuged this step was repeated three times and the supernatant solutions were collected in each time in 50 ml volumetric flask and then mixed with ammonium acetate solution to reach 50 ml the concentration of sodium in this solution was measured by a flame photometer cole parmer pfp7 and then cec was calculated the concentrations of hms pb2 and cd2 alkali metals na and k and alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 in dry samples of rcw were measured using dry ash method 35 one gram of exchanger was converted to ash in a furnace at 550 c for 4 h next the ash was digested by 5 ml of hno3 25 v v and the volume reached to 25 ml the amount of pb2 cd2 ca2 and mg2 in acid digested solutions were measured using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas perkinelmer aanalyst700 a flame photometer was used to measure the concentration of na and k in these solutions the ph of the rcw was measured using ph meter jenway 3330 1 g of biomass was placed in an erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 100 ml of distilled water and boiled for 5 min the solution was diluted to 200 ml by adding distilled water and cooled at room temperature then it was stirred and the ph was determined 31 2 4 bio ion exchanger modification to find out the most efficient form of cw for removal of pb2 and cd2 from aqueous solutions different types of particle size number of washing and using hot water and chemical basic acidic salts surfactant and organic agents pretreatment of cw were performed 2 4 1 particle sizes the dried rcw was grinded by a moulinex and sieved to different particle sizes 500 μm 500 μm 1000 μm and 1000 μm using standard sieves 2 4 2 washing 0 5 g of rcw was added to a beaker containing 250 ml distilled water and placed on a shaker with 150 rpm for 2 h the old solution was then replaced by 250 ml of new distilled water and the replacement process was repeated for three times next the biomass was filtered and dried at 60 c for 24 h 2 4 3 hot water 0 5 g of rcw was added into 250 ml flasks poured with distilled water with different temperatures 50 c 70 c and 100 c and kept for 30 min in these conditions then the solutions were filtered by whatman filter paper no 42 and biomasses were dried in an oven at 60 c for 24 h 2 4 4 dry heating oven 0 5 g of rcw was placed onto 3 glass plates separately the glass plates were kept in an oven at 50 c 70 c and 10 c for 4 h and then cooled at room temperature 2 4 5 wet heating autoclaving 0 5 g of rcw was added into 250 ml beakers separately the beakers were put in an autoclave under pressure of 15 bars at 50 c 70 c and 100 c for 2 h after the autoclaving process and cooling the samples were removed and used for the experiments 2 4 6 chemical modification to improve the cation exchange capacity of rcw modification of biomass were performed in calcium sodium and hydrogen forms 250 ml 1 m of various solutions including ca2 solution cacl2 na solutions nacl na2so4 ch3coona nac12h25so4 and naoh and h solutions hno3 hcl h2so4 h3po4 c6h8o6 and ch3cooh were separately poured in 500 ml flasks in each container 2 g of biomass was added and the containers were then placed at 25 2 c for two 12 hour cycles at an incubator shaker at 150 rpm after each cycle the old solution was replaced with a new one 30 the solutions were passed through whatman filter paper no 42 and washed several times with distilled water to decrease the ec and the ph of the outlet solution to the neutral value 2 4 7 rcw sodium alginate bead immobilized beads was prepared by mixing sodium alginate and rcw in different ratios of 1 1 1 3 and 1 6 biomass g sodium alginate g different amounts of sodium alginate were completely dissolved in 50 ml distilled water by stirring then 1 5 g of biomass was added to the solution and they were mixed to provide a homogenized suspension it was shaken for about 1 h to eliminate the resulting bubbles and slowly poured into 1 m solution of cacl2 by syringe the prepared beads were kept in the cacl2 solution for 24 h for hardening and then they were filtered washed with distilled water several times and dried at ambient temperature for 24 h 2 5 batch experiments 2 5 1 medicinal herb waste selection 0 05 g of each medicinal herb waste was placed in 100 ml flasks separately in contact with 50 ml of 50 mg l 1 pb2 and cd2 solution separately equivalent to 0 48 meq l 1 pb2 and 0 89 meq l 1 cd2 at ph 5 for 60 min on a rotary shaker at 300 rpm metal solutions were ﬁltered by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 5 min and the residual pb2 and cd2 concentrations were measured using faas all the experiments were performed in duplicate and the mean value of the results was reported 2 5 2 modification selection and optimization batch experiments were also performed to determine the effect of cacl2 modifications on pb2 and cd2 removal efficiency from aqueous solutions for this purpose the removal experiments as described in the previous section were performed with 0 05 g 1 g l 1 of each pretreated cw the pretreated sample with highest efficiency of pb2 and cd2 removal was selected for further experiments to optimize the effect of temperature 25 50 and 100 c and the modifier solution concentration 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 m the biomass modified in the optimum conditions was called mcw modified chicory waste mcw was characterized using ft ir and sem edax analyses 2 5 3 ion exchange process before doing the experiment the ion exchangers were washed several times to decrease the ec to an acceptable level to prevent the interferences of the ions in washing the extracts of the biomass structure with pb2 and cd2 exchange the ion exchange experiments by rcw and mcw were done using the same removal method as described in the section of 2 5 1 next the concentration of hms pb2 and cd2 alkali metals na and k and alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 were measured in the solution phase simultaneously the concentration of these metals in the solid phase bio ion exchanger were calculated for mass balance study using dry ash method 35 accordingly the mechanism of heavy metals removal through ion exchange was investigated by comparing the amount of hms alkali and alkaline earth metals in solid and solution phases as the matrix effect is an important problem in the removal of metal ions in real samples the effect of interference was studied in the synthetic solutions and industrial wastewater sample for selected mcw standard solutions of ni mo ag mn as al cu k cd pb mg po4 zn and cr were added separately to 50 mg l 1 of pb2 or cd2 solutions in binary model and the proposed batch procedure was applied to determine the effects of the competition between the ions on the metal removal to evaluate the efficiency of the bio ion exchanger in wastewater treatment an industrial wastewater obtained from a local galvanizing company the process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron was used the wastewater ph and ec was 6 0 and 3 8 ms cm 1 respectively the pb and cd concentration was less than the instrumental detection limit 15 and 0 8 μg l 1 whereas the concentrations of ni cu and cr were 0 069 0 065 and 0 072 mg l 1 respectively the ph of the wastewater sample was adjusted to 5 0 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions before the experiments furthermore the initial concentrations of pb2 and cd2 in the wastewater were increased to 10 30 and 50 mg l 1 by adding the metal solutions and the removal experiments were carried out under the same conditions for the synthetic solutions 2 6 regeneration experiments 0 05 g of saturated bio ion exchangers rcw and mcw containing pb2 and cd2 were separately shaken in contact with 50 ml eluent solutions of 1 m nacl cacl2 hno3 and distilled water in the end the concentrations of the recovered pb2 and cd2 in the solutions were measured the recovery efficiency of pb2 and cd2 was calculated using the following equation 36 10 d q e r e c o v e r y q e s o r p t i o n 100 where d is the hm recovery efficiency qe recovery and qe sorption are the hm recovery and sorption capacity mg g 1 respectively the hm recovery capacity was calculated as follows 11 q e r e c o v e r y v c f m where qe recovery is the amount of hm recovered from one gram of saturated ion exchanger mg g 1 cf is the hm concentration in the recovery solution mg l 1 v is the recovery solution volume l and m is the hm saturated ion exchanger weight g 50 ml of different concentrations 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 m of the eluent solution were placed in contact with the saturated bio ion exchangers containing pb2 and cd2 to examine the optimum concentration of the eluent for the regeneration process 2 7 column experiments a continuous flow ion exchange experiment was conducted using a teflon column 150 height 30 diameter mm to avoid biomass loss a small amount of glass wool was plugged at the bottom of the column then the column was packed with 0 1 g of mcw before loading the pb2 and cd2 solutions the column was washed with distilled water the continuous experiments were carried out by separately pumping 500 ml of pb2 and cd2 solution 50 mg l 1 into the column using a peristaltic pump sina lab equipment sp15 iran with 1 5 ml min 1 flow rate each experiment ran for approximately 430 min to ensure the formation of a complete breakthrough curve and 21 samples were taken at different time intervals during this period 2 8 kinetic and isotherm models kinetic experiments were conducted using the batch equilibrium technique obtained by mixing a known amount of rcw and mcw with 50 ml of pb2 and cd2 solutions in a rotary shaker at 300 rpm and 25 2 c which was sufﬁcient to reach the equilibrium in a 100 ml conical ﬂask in order to evaluate the kinetic data separate ﬂasks were prepared for 0 180 min time intervals for each adsorption isotherm experiment known amounts of rcw and mcw were separately added to 50 ml of pb2 and cd2 solutions in a concentration range from 1 to 150 ppm the mixture was shaken in a rotary shaker at 300 rpm for 1 h at 25 2 c two kinetic models namely pseudo ﬁrst order and pseudo second order were used to investigate the ion exchange kinetic modeling of the experimental data langmuir freundlich and temkin models widely used for the liquid solid systems were employed for the sorption isotherm modeling of the equilibrium data 2 9 statistical analysis the data in this study were analyzed using the spss software package version 21 the one way anova was used to analyze the signiﬁcant effects of various parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of different medicinal herb wastes the removal efficiency r adsorption capacity q mg g 1 and distribution coefficient kd ml g 1 of 14 different medicinal herb wastes were investigated according to the results presented in table s1 and s2 of supplementary file the removal efficiency and the afﬁnity of pb2 to the binding groups kd had the highest value for coriandrum sativum cichorium intybus coriandrum sativum and achillea millefolium cichorium intybus also showed the most removal efficiency and adsorption capacity for cd2 ions higher kd in cichorium intybus waste than in other medicinal herb wastes indicated that more amount of pb2 was adsorbed on its surface in comparison to the concentration of pb2 in the aqueous phase since cichorium intybus is the most abundantly used medicinal herb in iran and since it showed a higher pb2 and cd2 removal in comparison to the other plants all further experiments were conducted using its waste 3 2 characteristics of raw chicory waste rcw the physicochemical parameters of rcw are shown in table 1 the values of proximate analyses of the waste are in accordance with the literature 37 38 the ph of rcw was neutral about 6 which indicates that using chicory for removal of pb2 and cd2 do not change the ph of the solution to acidic or basic ph so it does not have any adverse effects on exchanging of pb2 and cd2 with the surface ions of chicory cation exchange capacity cec of chicory was about 98 cmol kg 1 equal to 98 meq 100g 1 which is high enough for the ion exchange the elemental analysis of chicory showed that there were not any pb2 and cd2 ions in the structure of the biomass and that the ca2 amount was the highest 0 974 meq g 1 among the exchanging ions 3 3 electrical conductivity initial ec of chicory was 1599 μs cm 1 therefore usage of unwashed chicory as ion exchanger may cause some interferences the released alkali and alkaline earth ions particularly ca2 having a high content in the chicory structure may compete with pb2 and cd2 to be exchanged and consequently reduce the exchange rate of the metal ions therefore it is necessary to reduce the negative impact of the ions in the extracted biomass as much as possible for this purpose the raw and modified biomass were rinsed with distilled several times the most significant changes in ec happened during the first and the second rinsing stages and there were fewer changes were in the next rinsing rounds therefore two stages of washing could be sufficient for reducing the interference effect of the ions in the biomass 3 4 effect of physical and chemical modification it has been reported in various studies that the modification processes may increase or decrease the efficiency of the sorbents in order to evaluate the effect of different modifications on pb2 and cd2 removal efficiency of chicory waste various physical and chemical modification methods were investigated four different physical pretreatment methods including using different particle sizes boiling in water heating by oven and autoclaving were investigated according to the results presented in table s3 increasing the size of particles 500 μm decreased the sorption efficiency and capacity of cw chicory waste with particle sizes less than 500 μm showed the highest adsorption capacity of pb2 and cd2 which can be attributed to the higher surface area of the small particles providing the more total area for interacting with hm ions washing the biomass enhanced the pb2 and cd2 removal efficiency due to the removal of dust and other materials which could interfere with the metals however boiling the biomass in hot water at 70 c and 100 c signiﬁcantly decreased the hm sorption table s3 boiling can dissolve the mineral matter decompose the organic matter 39 rupture the biomass cells and cause unavailability of binding sites for hm ions 40 dry heating did not show any signiﬁcant effect on the removal capacity of chicory waste a finding which was in accordance with the previous reports in the literature 39 chicory waste autoclaved at different temperatures and pressure of 15 bar did not have a signiﬁcant effect on hm sorption in comparison to the untreated waste while contradictory results are reported by other researches daneshvar et al 39 indicated that autoclaving of macroalgae biomass reduced the methylene blue biosorption due to the physical and morphological changes in the biomass structure including the destructive effect of dry heating on functional groups of algae cell walls on the other hand abdollah and taha 41 represented that autoclaving of the fungal biomass might increase the porosity and surface area which can increase the ion removal efficiency of the biomass this statement confirms that depending on the biomass type and its reactions under high pressure and heat dry heating can have different effects on its sorption capacity the chemical modification of cw was carried out using various chemical reagents the results of the pb2 and cd2 removal experiment showed that modification with na and h solutions reduced the ion exchange capacity of cw however the cacl2 modification could significantly increase the removal efficiency of pb2 and cd2 the distribution coefficient of ca2 treated cw was at the highest for pb2 and cd2 in comparison to the other treated ones indicating that the most amount of pb2 and cd2 ions in aqueous phase could be adsorbed on the ca2 treated biomass surface p value 0 01 table s3 calcium ion with a higher positive charge than na and h ions could be more efficient for removing the intended ions and exchange with them in some articles ca2 was introduced as the main cation for the removal of hm ions through ion exchange process 42 43 calcium can bind to functional groups and improve cec in this study biomass pretreatment with na solutions decreased the removal efﬁciency of chicory waste a finding which was similar to the results reported by daneshvar et al 39 who mentioned that the adverse effect of naoh in pretreatment might be attributed to biomass agglomeration and reduction of the effective number of binding sites for hm cations in some other studies the efficiency of hm removal by nacl treated algae was slightly better than cacl2 treated one 30 decreasing the removal efficiency and capacity of h modified chicory treated using acids e g hydrochloric acid and nitric acid could be due to the reduction of chicory surface electronegativity 39 by changing the surface charge of the biomass from negative to positive electrostatic attraction between chicory biomass and hm cation might be decreased 41 these results might also be due to the destruction of binding sites responsible for ion exchange after the biomass was exposed to acids 29 the surface chemical groups of chicory are protonated by pretreatment with strong acids and hence the residual h in the cell wall may compete with the pb2 and cd2 for the surface active sites of the ion exchangers 39 as previously mentioned light metals lms can bond to biomass through electrostatic interactions and play a significant role in the ion exchange of pb2 and cd2 metal complex formation coordination interaction and other processes 42 therefore ca2 mg2 na and k present in the biomass structure are washed away from the biomass as a result of the acid treatment which reduces the exchange rate of pb2 and cd2 moreover the washed lms ca2 mg2 na and k are replaced by h and the biomass surface is protonated consequently the hm ions are then replaced by these protons which decreases the ph of the solution and leads toa reduction of the hms removal due to competition between h and the pb2 and cd2 20 44 maximum pb2 and cd2 adsorption capacity mg g 1 was observed for ca2 treated ion exchanger so further experiments were conducted on optimization of cw with the particle size less than 500 μm by cacl2 modification 1m 3 4 1 effect of cacl2 concentration fig 1 a demonstrated the effect of different concentrations of cacl2 on the removal efficiency of the cw modification process as it is clear by increasing the cacl2 concentration from 0 01 to 1 m the removal efficiency for pb2 and cd2 increase from 29 to 92 and from 26 to 74 respectively increasing the concentration of cacl2 from 1 to 2 m did not affect the pb2 adsorption capacity significantly however it slightly increased the capacity of cd2 sorption therefore the 1m solution of cacl2 was selected for modification of cw for both metals and the modified chicory waste mcw 3 4 2 effect of temperature results revealed that by increasing the temperature from 25 c to 100 c the removal efficiency of pb2 and cd2 by the cw was reduced from 90 to 40 and from 78 to 36 respectively fig 1b hence it is better to modify the cw at the lower temperature the reason could be attributed to the fact that some part of the structure of the ion exchanger might be decomposed at higher temperatures which could lead to the loss of a portion of porosity on the surface of the sorbent 45 besides increasing the temperature could lead to the conversion of some the functional groups to others with less exchange potency 3 5 surface analysis of row and modified chicory waste the sem micrograph of the rcw and mcw are shown in fig 2 overall the samples show a similar morphology which consists of a smooth and ﬁbrillary structure without a deﬁned geometry it was observed that the structure was not damaged or destroyed after the cacl2 modification the ftir spectroscopic analysis of rcw and mcw revealed the functional groups of the exchanger s surface and the possible interactions of these functional groups with the pb2 and cd2 in the solution the broad and strong band between 3600 and 3200 cm 1 seen in the spectra fig 3 are associated with hydroxyl choh stretching and amino groups nh 20 these groups are associated with cellulose and proteins of chicory cell wall a small shift in the mcw band compared to rcw indicates changes in the amino group as a result of the cacl2 modification the shift also suggests that ca2 competes with the hydrogen bonding between the oh groups 46 the peak observed between 3000 and 2800 cm 1 can be attributed to ch groups 43 47 and those at 1650 cm 1 and 1480 cm 1 could be assigned to the carboxylic functional group co 20 moreover the bond between 1050 and 1100 cm 1 might be attributed to c o stretching of alcohol and carboxylic acid 48 3 6 the concentration of ions in solid and solution phases the acid digestion results of rcw showed that the concentration of ca2 0 97 meq g 1 was higher than that of mg2 0 12 meq g 1 na 0 03 meq g 1 and k 0 02 meq g 1 when rcw was modified with cacl2 solution the concentration of mg2 na and k in biomass decreased to 0 07 0 005 and 0 002 meq g 1 respectively while ca2 concentration increased significantly to 1 18 meq g 1 p value 0 01 this was because the ca2 concentration was very high in cacl2 solution hence when these ions were in contact with rcw exchanger na k and mg2 could be replaced and exchanged by the ca2 the results indicated that these wastes could react with ca2 and the functional groups on the surface might be saturated with ca2 hence they showed a higher ability for removing pb2 and cd2 ions via the ion exchange process figs 4b and 5 b the concentration of sum of lms na k ca2 and mg2 increased from 1 150 in rcw figs 4a and 5 a to 1 258 meq g 1 in mcw figs 4b and 5 b comparison of the elemental constitution of rcw and mcw by using elemental microprobe analysis of edax fig s1 approved these results the signals of ca2 na k and mg2 can be observed in fig s1a which are known as the principal elements of cw considering the exchange of ca2 with other lms during cacl2 modification no signals of other lms na k and mg2 were found in the edax results for mcw fig s1b where it is shown that ca2 is the principal element of the mcw due to the increase of ca2 concentration on the surface of modified exchangers from 0 974 meq g 1 in rcw to 1 182 meq g 1 in mcw the cec values significantly increased p value 0 01 from 98 meq 100g 1 in rcw to 118 meq 100g 1 in mcw which caused an increase in hm ion exchange efficiency of mcw after the exchange an experiment in a solution with 50 mg l 1 of the pb2 the loaded pb2 concentration on the rcw and mcw surfaces were 0 30 and 0 42 meq g 1 respectively fig 4 also in a solution with 50 mg l 1 of the cd2 0 59 meq g 1 of cd2 was removed by the rcw while the mcw could remove 0 7 meq g 1 of cd2 fig 5 moreover the amount of ca2 on rcw and mcw decreased through the hm ion exchange process so 0 24 and 0 47 meq g 1 of ca2 in rcw and mcw exchanged with pb2 fig 4 while 0 38 and 0 61 meq g 1 of ca2 in rcw and mcw exchanged with cd2 respectively fig 5 this decrease was well aligned with the amount of ca2 released to both the pb2 and the cd2 solutions after the ion exchange process by rcw and mcw which were respectively 0 26 and 0 45 meq l 1 into pb2 solution and 0 410 and 0 58 meq l 1 into cd2 solution the comparison of pb2 and cd2 concentrations in the solution phase before and after the ion exchange process confirmed these results figs 4 and 5 after the removal experiment by rcw the concentrations of unexchanged pb2 and cd2 in the solutions were 0 12 and 0 31 meq l 1 and after the using mcw the figures were 0 03 and 0 21 meq l 1 respectively the sum of lm concentrations na k ca2 and mg2 in rcw 1 15 meq g 1 decreased to 0 84 and 0 69 meq g 1 after the pb2 and cd2 exchange process respectively figs 4a and 5 a therefore the removal efficiency was about 78 3 for pb2 and 64 7 for cd2 also the sum of lm concentrations in mcw was 1 258 meq g 1 before the ion exchange which decreased to 0 779 and 0 621 meq g 1 respectively after the exchange of pb2 and cd2 these results indicated that 0 479 meq g 1 of these lms were exchanged with pb2 and 0 637 meq g 1 of lms exchanged with cd2 figs 4b and 5 b 1 g l 1 of cw is applied in pb2 and cd2 solution hence meq g 1 is equivalent to meq l 1 therefore the removal efficiency of pb2 and cd2 were 95 3 and 73 3 respectively furthermore edax spectra of rcw fig s1d after pb2 the removal process illustrated the reduction of lms weight and the increase of pb weight compared to their spectra before removal process the spectra of rcw and mcw after cd2 removal which is shown in fig s1 e and f revealed a similar trend of cd and lm signals confirming the occurrence of the ion exchange in another study 29 on the efficiency of algae as an ion exchanger it was also stated that the concentration of ni2 bonded to biomass is proportional to the sum of lm concentrations na k ca2 and mg2 released from its surface based on the ions concentrations in acid digested rcw and mcw solutions before and after pb2 and cd2 exchange experiment reduction of ca2 concentration and increasing of pb2 and cd2 concentration in the solid phase confirmed the exchange of the pb2 and cd2 with ca2 on the surface of rcw and mcw samples besides increasing the ca2 concentration and reduction of the pb2 and cd2 concentrations in the solution phases clearly proved these results among the ions pb2 and cd2 showed a higher potential to be exchanged on the surface of rcw and mcw the high concentration of pb2 and cd2 in the solution phase greater electrical charge for pb2 cd2 is twice that of na and k and greater electronegativity of pb2 and cd2 than mg2 ca2 na and k could be the main reasons for superiority of pb2 and cd2 for exchanging with listed lms 49 50 the exchange experiment of rcw and mcw showed that the removal efficiency of pb2 was 78 3 and 95 3 and of cd2 were 64 7 and 73 3 respectively these results indicated an increase in rcw removal efficiency after the modification process it could be due to the increase in cec after modification of rcw these findings are consistent with various studies indicating that the modification of natural ion exchanger with alkali and alkaline earth chloride salts increased the adsorption capacity of hms 29 it might be due to the trapping of pb2 and cd2 on a nacl treated algae and releasing of na which was attributed to the ion exchange process 20 29 furthermore bhatnagar et al in their study of ni2 biosorption stated that the adsorption of the metal ions on the treated biomass was accompanied by the release of na from the exchanger 29 the results also indicated that the ion exchange selectivity by rcw and mcw was higher for pb2than cd2 in other words the relative exchanging strength of pb2 was greater than that of cd2 this preference could be attributed to hydrated radius pb2 0 401 and cd2 0 426 nm electronegativity pb2 2 10 and cd2 1 69 eh hydration energy 1481 and 1807 kj mol 1 for pb2 and cd2 respectively and pkh negative log of hydrolysis constant 7 78 and 11 70 for pb2 and cd2 respectively higher electronegativity and lower hydrated radius eh and pkh led to a growing tendency of the pb2 than cd2 for both rcw and mcw 50 52 coles et al studied the removal of pb2 and cd2 by kaolinite in the ion exchange process they indicated that the affinity of pb2 to kaolinite was greater than that of cd2 49 similar results were reported in other researches 53 55 according to the above results it can be stated that the main process for the removal of hms in this study was ion exchange in similar articles it was pointed out that the functional groups on the exchanger s surface were able to exchange protons and or alkali ions na and k and alkaline earth ions ca2 and mg2 with hm cations 56 57 it was reported in other researches that cacl2 treated natural exchanger could properly exchange ions in the removal processes removing various types of hms from aqueous solutions by exchanging them with ca2 29 30 3 7 ion exchange modeling 3 7 1 kinetic models the values of kinetic constants for pb2 and cd2 sorption onto rcw and mcw are presented in table 2 the correlation coefﬁcient obtained for the pseudo second order kinetic model was higher than 0 99 was fig s2 which showed that the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order rate expression for removal of pb2 and cd2 the results also indicated higher pb2 and cd2 sorption capacity qe of mcw than of rcw 3 7 2 isotherm models isotherm parameters for pb2 and cd2 sorption by rcw and mcw are given in table 3 it is assumed that in the langmuir model there is no significant competition between the adsorbate and the solvent to occupy the adsorption sites the equilibrium data were also subjected to the temkin isotherm model in which the interactions between hm ion exchanger is based on the assumption that the free energy of sorption is a function of the surface coverage the r2 value of the langmuir model was higher than that of freundlich and tempkin isotherms fig s3 based on langmuir theory the pb2 and cd2 sorption could take place at speciﬁc homogenous sites on the surface of rcw and mcw value of qm which is assumed as the maximum capacity of sorbent has been calculated from the langmuir plots the maximum adsorption capacities of pb2 and cd2 have been increased from 103 11 and 53 76 mg g 1 by rcw to 123 45 and 64 51 mg g 1 by mcw respectively in the langmuir isotherm the dimensionless separation factor rl can be used as an indicator of the favorability of adsorption based on the langmuir isotherm the adsorption is either irreversible r l 0 favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 58 the second situation was true for all the conditions of the current experiment therefore the exchange of pb2 and cd2 with surface alkali and alkaline earth ions of rcw and mcw were favorable 3 8 regeneration of the ion exchanger ion exchanger recovery plays an important role in reducing wastewater treatment costs it not only makes the reuse of the exchanger in several cycles possible but also provides the recovery of hms 20 the results of the rcw and mcw cation exchanger recovery process are shown in fig 6 according to the results distilled water could not recover hms from the solid phase while cacl2 nacl and hno3 could recover metals with different efficiencies another study 59 reported the same result with distilled water and nacl among the rinsing solutions cacl2 had the highest ability to recover hms also increasing the concentration of the cacl2 solution from 0 05 to 1 m significantly increased the pb2 and cd2 recovery due to the higher amount of ca2 ions in the eluent solution sig 0 05 the eluent with the concentration of more than 1 m did not show any significant effect on the recovery of hms fig 7 it should be noted that the regeneration efficiency is an important parameter to scale up the process in this study the possibility of the pb and cd desorption from saturated bio ion exchanger by cacl2 solution was examined without considering the stoichiometric calculations in general the regeneration experiments were conducted in the same method 30 the pb2 recovery rate for rcw and mcw using cacl2 solution was 98 and 95 9 and was 92 and 89 8 for cd2 respectively which was approximately twice than that of hno3 and nacl fig 6 these results can be related to the charge of the existing ions in the rinsing solution since ca2 has two positive charges in comparison to na and h with only one positive charge its tendency and ability to be exchanged by pb2 and cd2 is higher than na and h moreover the results demonstrated that ca2 have more affinity to be exchanged with pb2 than cd2 therefore the amount of the released pb2 to the cacl2 solution was higher than that of cd2 3 9 ion exchange column studies the breakthrough curve showing the relative concentrations versus time for the exchange of pb2 and cd2 on mcw bed are depicted in fig 8 for the initial minutes the efﬂuent from the bottom of the bed was almost free of pb and cd ions due to the high availability of active sites on mcw indicating that the column was performing at a maximum efficiency during that period as the solution continued to ﬂow the available active sites were gradually occupied and accordingly the outlet concentration of pb and cd ions began to increase however more than 50 of pb2 and cd2 could be removed after 90 and 120 min respectively the biomass exhaustion occurred at approximately 330 and 360 min after pb and cd removal respectively 3 10 interference study to assess the suitability of the proposed method in pb2 and cd2 removal the interference of several ions was determined the results showed that mo2 ag k and po4 3 did not affect the efficiency of the ion exchanger for pb2 besides ag k and po4 3 did not interfere with cd2 removal however 50 mg l 1 concentration of cu2 zn2 as2 and mg2 were found to reduce the removal efficiencies of both pb2 and cd2 3 11 removal of hms from industrial wastewater the proposed method was applied to determine the heavy metal ion removal using mcw in real industrial wastewater sample the results table 4 indicated the considerable efficiency of the synthesized ion exchanger for removal of pb2 and cd2 which was in the range of 72 85 and 43 68 respectively in various initial concentrations 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the potential application of various medicinal wastes to exchange pb2 and cd2 ions from aqueous solutions among the used wastes chicory waste showed an excellent ability to exchange the metal ions with its surface elements modification of cw using cacl2 solution in ambient temperature could increase cec from 98 to 118 cmol kg 1 equal to 98 to 118 meq 100 g 1 and enhance its efficiency in the ion exchange process the maximum pb2 and cd2 adsorption capacity by mcw reached to about 123 5 and 64 5 mg g 1 respectively while the corresponding amounts for raw materials were 103 1 and 53 8 mg g 1 respectively indicating an increase in hm adsorption capacity after the modification process because of releasing of alkali and alkaline earth ions particularly ca2 from rcw and mcw into the solution and removing of pb2 and cd2 from the solutions it was found that the main mechanism for the removal of the metals by rcw and mcw was the ion exchange recovery of the metals by cacl2 nacl and hno3 and the lack of recovery by distilled water reinforced the ion exchange mechanism further researches are needed to evaluate the robustness and degradation of the chicory waste during the application as well as to develop the scale up of the process considering the economic aspects acknowledgments the authors would like to appreciate professor mohammad j taherzadeh for his guidance and revision of

14436,influence of anaerobic cod consumption on the properties and nutrient removal performance of aerobic granules was studied three identical sequencing batch reactors sbr were operated under two operation strategies over four months results indicated that the applied anaerobic contact provided better mass transfer during the anaerobic phase and improved the nutrient removal efficiency of the granules anaerobic contact increased anaerobic cod utilization from 17 24 to 45 53 and improved phosphorus removal from 63 to 93 the anaerobic contact also decreased effluent solids from 87 to 46 mg l vss with preventing the growth of biomass in suspension associated with rapidly growing organisms with the application of anaerobic contact slowly growing organisms dominated the system and solid retention time srt increased from 15 to 32 days alerting anaerobic continuous feeding with anaerobic contact worsened settling properties of the granular biomass however good settling granules were obtained after acclimation of the biomass to the new condition the application of anaerobic contact also affected granules size and extracellular polymeric substance eps content more compact granules with less net eps content and lower protein to carbohydrate ratio were obtained under increased anaerobic contact condition compared with operating with anaerobic continuous feeding results suggested that appropriate anaerobic contact could enhance the nutrient removal efficiency and effluent quality of mature aerobic granules treating low strength wastewater therefore design considerations should be taken into account to provide sufficient anaerobic contact in granular sequencing batch reactors sbrs when applied for the treatment of low strength wastewater keywords aerobic granular sludge wastewater treatment sequencing batch reactor anaerobic cod uptake anaerobic contact nutrient removal 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge is a type of biofilm formed by self immobilization of activated sludge in spherical shape when hydrodynamic shear force resulted from air flow and hydraulic selective pressure short settling time are applied the unique structure of aerobic granules offers different layers with aerobic anaerobic and anoxic conditions which provides simultaneous removal of organics phosphorous and nitrogen from wastewater 1 successful application of aerobic granules for organics removal from municipal wastewater in aerobic sbrs has been reported 2 3 however nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal were not achieved due to the high organic loading rate olr applied coma et al 4 reported that granulation with low strength wastewater for biological nutrient removal bnr is unsuitable and requires long start up periods the low olr required to obtain bnr results of our previous study 5 suggested that granulation at high olr and application of lower olr can obtain stable granules with bnr stable granules capable of simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus were obtained with low strength wastewater in few studies 6 7 however biological removal of nutrients especially phosphorus from low strength wastewater with granular sludge has been a challenge 4 8 9 competition between polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao for carbon uptake during the anaerobic phase was suggested as a possible reason for unsuccessful phosphorus removal in granular systems 9 different strategies were applied to enhance granules phosphorus removal selective biomass removal was found to improve the activity of paos and their studied found competibacter gaos to be more dominant at the top of the settled sludge while accumulibacter paos was more dominant at the bottom 10 however henriet et al 8 reported that candidatus accumulibacter pao was more dominant in intermediate density fraction of granules therefore high selective pressure with short settling time has improved phosphorus removal anaerobic cod removal during the feeding period was also beneficial for the development of aerobic granules with the reduction in yield of rapidly growing aerobic microorganisms 6 rocktäschel et al 11 found mixing advantageous to anaerobic cod utilization and hence enhanced phosphorus release and denitrification due to high mass transfer however at large scale anaerobic feeding can be strong enough to provide hydrodynamic turbulence which benefit mixing it should be noted that shear force in the anaerobic period can affect the granules structure also excess shear can be harmful to granules and cause disintegration of the granules therefore a feeding system that provides an equal substrate distribution can provide anaerobic cod uptake and enhance bnr treatment 11 while being cost effective as compared to anaerobic mixing in large scale sbrs the purpose of this work was to study the effect of anaerobic cod utilization on nutrient removal performance of the aerobic granules moreover the effluent quality as well as properties of granular sludge including solid residence time settling properties granules size and eps content were monitored under the two operating conditions i continuous anaerobic feeding and ii feeding followed by anaerobic contact 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation strategies three identical reactors named r1 r2 and r3 with 3 l working volume and 10 cm diameter were used the reactors were fed with 2 l wastewater resulting in an exchange ratio of 2 3 delivered through a four way splitter located on the reactors floor fine air bubbles were introduced from the bottom of the reactors through two spherical stone diffusers having 3 cm diameter with applying air flow rate of 2 l min during the aerobic period a superficial air velocity of 0 43 cm s was obtained the superficial flow velocity was calculated by dividing volume flow rate of the air liquid phase in m3 s by the cross sectional area of the cylindrical reactor in m2 the constant air flow during the aerobic phase resulted in dissolved oxygen do reached saturation condition do 8 9 mg o2 l in all stages of operation the reactors were kept at room temperature 23 c the sequencing batch reactors with the schematic diagram shown in fig 1 were operated in 8 hour cycles 3 cycle per day including 90 min of anoxic anaerobic phase 370 min of aerobic phase 4 min of settling and 15 min of discharge during the first stage continuous feeding over 90 min anaerobic phase was applied while in the next stage 15 min of feeding followed by 75 min of anaerobic contact was provided with circulating the liquid through settled biomass the aerobic phase settling and discharge time was the same during the two stages anaerobic contact was provided by circulation of wastewater with pumping from the top of the reactor to the bottom with 0 1 l min flow rate while the biomass was being settled solid retention time was not controlled during the whole operation period therefore the only way of wasting biomass was through the effluent solids the three identical reactors were operated under the same condition in order to ensure reproducibility to the study under the same operating conditions and with a method reported previously 5 aerobic granulation of conventional activated sludge taken from a full scale wastewater treatment plant south end water pollution control center winnipeg mb canada mature granules were initially obtained using high strength synthetic wastewater without changing the operation conditions the aerobic granules were fed with low strength wastewater for over two months until stable granules were achieved 2 2 wastewater characteristics synthetic wastewater simulating the characteristics of typical municipal wastewater with cod tn and tp concentrations of 400 45 and 8 mg l respectively was used in this study yeast extract 357 mg l was used as source of cod 400 mg l nitrogen 37 mg n l and phosphorus 5 3 mg p l in order to obtain characteristics of municipal wastewater nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were adjusted using 30 m l nh4cl 8 mg n l and 20 mg l k2hpo4 3h2o 2 7 mg p l other ingredients were 5 8 mg l mgso4 12 mg l cacl2 and 3 mg l edta additionally 0 3 ml l of mineral solution containing 0 15 g l h3bo3 0 03 g l cuso4 5h2o 0 03 g l ki 0 12 g l mncl2 4h2o 0 06 g l na2moo4 2h2o 0 12 g l znso4 7h2o 0 15 g l cocl2 2h2o and 1 5 g l fecl3 6h2o was used for the wastewater preparation in order to achieve complete nitrification sufficient alkalinity was provided by adding sodium bicarbonate 12 g nahco3 g nh4 n to the feed during the whole operation period 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of suspended solids in the mixed liquor mlss and effluent etss influent and effluent cod and sludge volume index svi after 5 and 30 min settling were measured according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater concentrations of phosphorous in form of orthophosphate po4 3 p and nitrogen in forms of ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n were measured via a flow injection analyser quick chem 8500 lachat instruments with the detection limit of 0 2 mg l all the measurement for nitrogen and phosphorus are performed using filtered samples via 0 45 μm filters which represented the concentration of soluble nitrogen and phosphorus in the case of cod the measurement for filtered samples was presented as scod granules size distribution was measured using malvern laser light scattering instrument mastersizer 2000 series malvern instruments with the capacity to measure particle sizes ranging from 0 02 to 2000 μm surface morphology of the granules was observed using a stereomicroscope axio vert a1 zeiss the eps content of the biomass was extracted and measured according to the method carried out by le clech et al 12 briefly 50 ml of mixed liquor was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was removed and the solids were re suspended with deionized water up to 50 ml the suspension was placed in a water bath at 80 c for 10 min after cooling down to room temperature the sample was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was filtered and protein and carbohydrate concentrations were measured using phenol sulphuric acid method and lowry protein assay respectively in this study the summation of protein and carbohydrate concentrations was reported as eps mixed liquor samples for mlss eps granules size and svi analyses were grabbed from the middle point of the reactors except the samples for eps which were always taken two hours after the start of cycle 30 min after the start of aerobic phase other mixed liquor samples were collected at the end of aerobic phase in this paper results for sludge properties such as svi5 granules size and eps are reported in the form of average of replicates of the three identical reactors and error bars in the graphs represent standard error of the mean however the results of mlss etss scod nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are reported for each reactor individually 2 4 data analyses statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics version 22 0 in order to understand whether characteristics granules size eps content and eps matrix and treatment performance cod tn and tp removal efficiency and effluent solids concentration of the granules differed by the ph control one way anova analysis was used for all statistical analyses significance level p value of 0 05 was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass quantities and effluent quality results of monitoring biomass concentration in the reactors in the form of tss and vss during both stages of operation are presented in fig 2 at the beginning of the first stage r1 r2 and r3 contained 2 0 1 7 and 2 0 g l mlvss respectively during this stage biomass acclimation was observed and the mlvss increased to 2 6 2 1 and 2 8 g l in r1 r2 and r3 respectively the acclimation was expected in the system because the biomass was only removed by effluent suspended solids the ratio of vss tss for the biomass was stable in the three reactors during this stage and an average of 0 80 0 01 was calculated for the three reactors the concentrations of vss and tss in the reactors effluent over time are shown in fig 2 during the first stage effluent vss was found in the range of 30 140 mg l with an average concentration of 87 5 mg l for the three reactors with the change in operation from anaerobic feeding to anaerobic contact an immediate increase was observed in the effluent vss to 166 214 and 108 mg l in r1 r2 and r3 respectively consequently biomass concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was reduced to 2 5 1 9 and 2 6 g l vss moreover after acclimation the effluent vss decreased down to 10 mg l on day 67 however the effluent vss was not stable after this day and fluctuated between 10 to 82 mg l an average vss concentration of 46 3 mg l was calculated for the reactors during this stage which was significantly p 0 05 lower than that of the first stage as a result of the decrease in effluent vss biomass acclimation was obtained and mlvss reached 3 0 3 1 and 3 8 g l in r1 r2 and r3 respectively at the end of the second stage the average ratio of vss tss for the biomass was 0 76 0 01 in all reactors this biomass acclimation under the condition that the organic load is fixed caused a decrease in f m ratio the f m ratio decreased from 0 42 to 0 33 gcod gvss d during the first stage and then to 0 25 gcod gvss d during the second stage of operation as can be seen in fig 2 a decrease in the effluent solid resulted in an increased in the mlss in the reactors and vice versa therefore biomass acclimation was controlled with the effluent quality which was dependent on the settling performance of the biomass the biomass residence time which was calculated based on quantities of biomass in the reactors and the effluent was determined by the effluent quality the average srt in the three reactors was 15 1 d during the first stage while in the second stage average srt of 32 3 d was obtained with the decrease in effluent vss results of srt and effluent quality for the three reactors during the first and second stage of operation are listed in table 1 results of statistical analysis showed that in the three reactors srt and effluent solids was significantly influenced p 0 05 by the change in the operation compared to anaerobic feeding strategies anaerobic contact obtained better effluent quality and resulted in higher biomass retention time in the system this suggested that in the second stage the slow growth organisms could proliferate in the system also less biomass in the effluent suggested that ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos had less chance to grow in the suspension when potentially no readily biodegradable cod rbcod was present in the aerobic phase devlin et al 6 also reported that anaerobic uptake of cod 55 77 of total cod removal reduced the yield of rapidly growing aerobic microorganisms 3 2 organics and nutrient removal performance of the granules the effluent concentrations of cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal during the 125 days of operation with low strength wastewater are presented in fig 3 based on these results cod tn and tp removal efficiency of the reactors during the two stages was calculated and presented in table 1 during the two stages effluent scod ranged from 15 to 25 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 95 in the three reactors however anaerobic cod removal was different in the two stages cod removal during anaerobic feeding was between 17 24 while contact enhanced cod removal from 45 to 53 in the anaerobic phase rocktäschel et al 11 also reported that compared to anaerobic feeding anaerobic mixing achieved higher cod uptakes however devlin et al 6 reported 55 77 cod uptake from low strength wastewater during one hour of anaerobic feeding in four liter reactors without mixing during the two stages nitrate concentration between 20 30 mg n l was obtained while ammonium and nitrite were not detected in the reactors effluent results presented in table 1 showed that the second stage obtained higher nitrogen removals in the three reactors this could be due to complete denitrification obtained during anaerobic contact which is explained later the reactors effluent phosphorus fluctuated between values approximately 1 mg p l to higher than 4 mg p l during the first stage average phosphorus removal of less than 65 was achieved in the first stage however when anaerobic contact was applied stable phosphorus removal with effluent phosphorus less than 1 mg l was obtained in one week the average phosphorus removal in this stage was higher than 90 statistical analysis confirmed that the phosphorus removal was significantly influenced by anaerobic contact the results of a cycle test performed in the first and the second stage are presented in fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4b phosphorus release was not achieved during the anaerobic feeding suggesting that paos were not responsible for phosphorus removal additionally incomplete denitrification was observed as 3 8 and 3 4 mg n l nitrate was measured in r1 and r3 respectively at the end of the anaerobic phase the initial nitrate measured was 29 1 and 29 8 mg n in r1 and r3 respectively assuming the ratio of 7 gcod gno3 n 7 203 6 and 208 5 gcod was required for the complete denitrification in r1 and r3 respectively however the anaerobic cod reduction for r1 and r3 was 164 6 and 154 4 mgcod respectively as shown in fig 4b applying anaerobic contact resulted in complete denitrification and anaerobic phosphorus release of 6 4 and 6 2 mg p gvss was observed in r2 and r3 respectively in the aerobic phase complete phosphorus removal was obtained with the specific uptake rate of 2 1 2 5 mg p vss h the results indicated that although sufficient carbon source was present in the feed denitrification and phosphorus release were not achieved with anaerobic feeding comparing the two operation strategies substrate gradient during the anaerobic phase was higher in the second stage also the applied anaerobic contact provided better mass transfer and improved the nutrient removal efficiency of the granules rocktäschel et al 11 also reported that mechanical mixing during the anaerobic feeding benefits the nutrient removal with equal distribution of substrate 3 3 characteristics of the granules characteristics of the granules were monitored during both stages of operation by measuring svi5 granules size eps content and eps composition the results are presented in fig 5 as can be seen svi5 was stable during the first stage while operating with anaerobic contact that resulted in the change in granules settleability after the change in operation svi5 increased from 49 1 to 90 7 ml g on day 68 high svi5 80 ml g was observed for 20 days after day 88 the settling improved and stable svi5 50 ml g was obtained after day 103 the settling velocity of granules is affected by the granular density shape particle size etc in this study the variation in the vss ss ratio and particle size could be responsible for the decrease of settling performance as shown in fig 5 eps content which was stable 150 mg gvss during the first stage decreased to 113 2 mg gvss day 86 after applying anaerobic contact after acclimation to the new condition with the improvement of biomass stability the eps content increased and reached 131 1 mg gvss at the end of this stage the eps content from the first stage could not be achieved in the second stage the results showed that the protein content of the granules decreased in the second stage while carbohydrate remained the same this resulted in lower p c ratio in the second stage the change in eps content and eps matrix p c of the granules could be due to the decrease in the amount of cod in the aerobic phase caused by the anaerobic cod uptake less availability of carbon in the aerobic period altered the feast famine balance it was reported that eps production is affected by feast famine balance 14 therefore in the second stage applying same aeration time with the availability of less carbon could either cause less eps production during the feast period or more eps consumption during the starvation period according to zhu et al 15 under the feast condition bacteria produced eps as an energy source to utilize as carbon for endogenous respiration under famine starvation condition when the presence of substrate is limited it was reported that higher f m ratios favor production of eps and consequently enhance granulation 16 at the end of the second stage granules stabilized to f m ratio of 0 33 gcod gvss d while the biomass increased from 3 to 4 g l vss and the f m ratio decreased to 0 25 gcod vss d devlin et al 6 also observed a decrease in net eps content when biomass acclimation was obtained in granular sbrs treating low strength wastewater increase in biomass concentration decreased f m ratio and caused aerobic consumption of eps it should also be mentioned that anaerobic contact could cause hydrodynamic shear and affect granules properties zhang et al 17 reported that applying shear during anaerobic and anoxic phase by contact can enhance eps production and aerobic granulation however in this work shear caused by the applied liquid circulation was very small compared to that of air flow the shear during the anaerobic phase in the first and second stage was calculated as 0 005 and 0 02 cm s respectively which were considered insignificant and therefore should not induce any superfluous changes as shown in fig 5 granules size was also affected by the change in operation during the first stage a gradual increase in the mean diameter from 0 6 to 0 7 mm was observed however in the second stage the granules size decreased to less than 0 6 mm which was later stabilized as can be seen the granules size decreased when the biomass settling was deteriorating suggesting disintegration of the granules and it stabilized when the biomass settling was improved suggesting re granulation according to previous studies 13 18 19 granule size is controlled by organic loading rate and shear force although the organic loading rate olr and shear were the same in the two stages the granules could not achieve their initial size when anaerobic contact was applied it could be due to the decrease in olr of the aerobic phase with the increase in removal of organics caused by anaerobic contact 3 4 implications for design the results suggest that anaerobic carbon uptake could be obtained without applying a high shear force with mechanical mixing although when it comes to full scale applications anaerobic feeding at high flow rates would be effective to produce hydrodynamic turbulence and provide adequate contact also fast anaerobic feeding followed by mixing for large sequential batch reactors may not be feasible due to the cost ineffectiveness high shear forces produced during the fast feeding could be destructive to the granules therefore design considerations are required for feeding system in sbrs introduce the feed while distributing the substrate and avoid the need for further mixing the distribution of feed can also reduce the hydraulic turbulence and accordingly prevent the high shear force which could cause granules disintegration 4 conclusion two operation strategies were applied to aerobic anaerobic sbrs anaerobic feeding and anaerobic contact results indicated that the system with anaerobic contact performed better in terms of effluent quality and nutrient removal anaerobic contact enhanced mass transfer and increased anaerobic cod removal from 17 24 to 45 53 consequently phosphorus removal was improved from 63 to 93 raising mass transfer during anaerobic phase improved the effluent quality from 87 to 46 mg l vss by reducing the growth of rapidly growing organisms floccular biomass and consequently improved biomass retention time from 15 to 32 d the presented results suggest that design considerations should be taken into account to provide sufficient anaerobic contact and hence anaerobic cod utilization in granular sbrs treating low strength wastewater acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the natural sciences and

14436,influence of anaerobic cod consumption on the properties and nutrient removal performance of aerobic granules was studied three identical sequencing batch reactors sbr were operated under two operation strategies over four months results indicated that the applied anaerobic contact provided better mass transfer during the anaerobic phase and improved the nutrient removal efficiency of the granules anaerobic contact increased anaerobic cod utilization from 17 24 to 45 53 and improved phosphorus removal from 63 to 93 the anaerobic contact also decreased effluent solids from 87 to 46 mg l vss with preventing the growth of biomass in suspension associated with rapidly growing organisms with the application of anaerobic contact slowly growing organisms dominated the system and solid retention time srt increased from 15 to 32 days alerting anaerobic continuous feeding with anaerobic contact worsened settling properties of the granular biomass however good settling granules were obtained after acclimation of the biomass to the new condition the application of anaerobic contact also affected granules size and extracellular polymeric substance eps content more compact granules with less net eps content and lower protein to carbohydrate ratio were obtained under increased anaerobic contact condition compared with operating with anaerobic continuous feeding results suggested that appropriate anaerobic contact could enhance the nutrient removal efficiency and effluent quality of mature aerobic granules treating low strength wastewater therefore design considerations should be taken into account to provide sufficient anaerobic contact in granular sequencing batch reactors sbrs when applied for the treatment of low strength wastewater keywords aerobic granular sludge wastewater treatment sequencing batch reactor anaerobic cod uptake anaerobic contact nutrient removal 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge is a type of biofilm formed by self immobilization of activated sludge in spherical shape when hydrodynamic shear force resulted from air flow and hydraulic selective pressure short settling time are applied the unique structure of aerobic granules offers different layers with aerobic anaerobic and anoxic conditions which provides simultaneous removal of organics phosphorous and nitrogen from wastewater 1 successful application of aerobic granules for organics removal from municipal wastewater in aerobic sbrs has been reported 2 3 however nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal were not achieved due to the high organic loading rate olr applied coma et al 4 reported that granulation with low strength wastewater for biological nutrient removal bnr is unsuitable and requires long start up periods the low olr required to obtain bnr results of our previous study 5 suggested that granulation at high olr and application of lower olr can obtain stable granules with bnr stable granules capable of simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus were obtained with low strength wastewater in few studies 6 7 however biological removal of nutrients especially phosphorus from low strength wastewater with granular sludge has been a challenge 4 8 9 competition between polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao for carbon uptake during the anaerobic phase was suggested as a possible reason for unsuccessful phosphorus removal in granular systems 9 different strategies were applied to enhance granules phosphorus removal selective biomass removal was found to improve the activity of paos and their studied found competibacter gaos to be more dominant at the top of the settled sludge while accumulibacter paos was more dominant at the bottom 10 however henriet et al 8 reported that candidatus accumulibacter pao was more dominant in intermediate density fraction of granules therefore high selective pressure with short settling time has improved phosphorus removal anaerobic cod removal during the feeding period was also beneficial for the development of aerobic granules with the reduction in yield of rapidly growing aerobic microorganisms 6 rocktäschel et al 11 found mixing advantageous to anaerobic cod utilization and hence enhanced phosphorus release and denitrification due to high mass transfer however at large scale anaerobic feeding can be strong enough to provide hydrodynamic turbulence which benefit mixing it should be noted that shear force in the anaerobic period can affect the granules structure also excess shear can be harmful to granules and cause disintegration of the granules therefore a feeding system that provides an equal substrate distribution can provide anaerobic cod uptake and enhance bnr treatment 11 while being cost effective as compared to anaerobic mixing in large scale sbrs the purpose of this work was to study the effect of anaerobic cod utilization on nutrient removal performance of the aerobic granules moreover the effluent quality as well as properties of granular sludge including solid residence time settling properties granules size and eps content were monitored under the two operating conditions i continuous anaerobic feeding and ii feeding followed by anaerobic contact 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation strategies three identical reactors named r1 r2 and r3 with 3 l working volume and 10 cm diameter were used the reactors were fed with 2 l wastewater resulting in an exchange ratio of 2 3 delivered through a four way splitter located on the reactors floor fine air bubbles were introduced from the bottom of the reactors through two spherical stone diffusers having 3 cm diameter with applying air flow rate of 2 l min during the aerobic period a superficial air velocity of 0 43 cm s was obtained the superficial flow velocity was calculated by dividing volume flow rate of the air liquid phase in m3 s by the cross sectional area of the cylindrical reactor in m2 the constant air flow during the aerobic phase resulted in dissolved oxygen do reached saturation condition do 8 9 mg o2 l in all stages of operation the reactors were kept at room temperature 23 c the sequencing batch reactors with the schematic diagram shown in fig 1 were operated in 8 hour cycles 3 cycle per day including 90 min of anoxic anaerobic phase 370 min of aerobic phase 4 min of settling and 15 min of discharge during the first stage continuous feeding over 90 min anaerobic phase was applied while in the next stage 15 min of feeding followed by 75 min of anaerobic contact was provided with circulating the liquid through settled biomass the aerobic phase settling and discharge time was the same during the two stages anaerobic contact was provided by circulation of wastewater with pumping from the top of the reactor to the bottom with 0 1 l min flow rate while the biomass was being settled solid retention time was not controlled during the whole operation period therefore the only way of wasting biomass was through the effluent solids the three identical reactors were operated under the same condition in order to ensure reproducibility to the study under the same operating conditions and with a method reported previously 5 aerobic granulation of conventional activated sludge taken from a full scale wastewater treatment plant south end water pollution control center winnipeg mb canada mature granules were initially obtained using high strength synthetic wastewater without changing the operation conditions the aerobic granules were fed with low strength wastewater for over two months until stable granules were achieved 2 2 wastewater characteristics synthetic wastewater simulating the characteristics of typical municipal wastewater with cod tn and tp concentrations of 400 45 and 8 mg l respectively was used in this study yeast extract 357 mg l was used as source of cod 400 mg l nitrogen 37 mg n l and phosphorus 5 3 mg p l in order to obtain characteristics of municipal wastewater nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were adjusted using 30 m l nh4cl 8 mg n l and 20 mg l k2hpo4 3h2o 2 7 mg p l other ingredients were 5 8 mg l mgso4 12 mg l cacl2 and 3 mg l edta additionally 0 3 ml l of mineral solution containing 0 15 g l h3bo3 0 03 g l cuso4 5h2o 0 03 g l ki 0 12 g l mncl2 4h2o 0 06 g l na2moo4 2h2o 0 12 g l znso4 7h2o 0 15 g l cocl2 2h2o and 1 5 g l fecl3 6h2o was used for the wastewater preparation in order to achieve complete nitrification sufficient alkalinity was provided by adding sodium bicarbonate 12 g nahco3 g nh4 n to the feed during the whole operation period 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of suspended solids in the mixed liquor mlss and effluent etss influent and effluent cod and sludge volume index svi after 5 and 30 min settling were measured according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater concentrations of phosphorous in form of orthophosphate po4 3 p and nitrogen in forms of ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n were measured via a flow injection analyser quick chem 8500 lachat instruments with the detection limit of 0 2 mg l all the measurement for nitrogen and phosphorus are performed using filtered samples via 0 45 μm filters which represented the concentration of soluble nitrogen and phosphorus in the case of cod the measurement for filtered samples was presented as scod granules size distribution was measured using malvern laser light scattering instrument mastersizer 2000 series malvern instruments with the capacity to measure particle sizes ranging from 0 02 to 2000 μm surface morphology of the granules was observed using a stereomicroscope axio vert a1 zeiss the eps content of the biomass was extracted and measured according to the method carried out by le clech et al 12 briefly 50 ml of mixed liquor was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was removed and the solids were re suspended with deionized water up to 50 ml the suspension was placed in a water bath at 80 c for 10 min after cooling down to room temperature the sample was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was filtered and protein and carbohydrate concentrations were measured using phenol sulphuric acid method and lowry protein assay respectively in this study the summation of protein and carbohydrate concentrations was reported as eps mixed liquor samples for mlss eps granules size and svi analyses were grabbed from the middle point of the reactors except the samples for eps which were always taken two hours after the start of cycle 30 min after the start of aerobic phase other mixed liquor samples were collected at the end of aerobic phase in this paper results for sludge properties such as svi5 granules size and eps are reported in the form of average of replicates of the three identical reactors and error bars in the graphs represent standard error of the mean however the results of mlss etss scod nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are reported for each reactor individually 2 4 data analyses statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics version 22 0 in order to understand whether characteristics granules size eps content and eps matrix and treatment performance cod tn and tp removal efficiency and effluent solids concentration of the granules differed by the ph control one way anova analysis was used for all statistical analyses significance level p value of 0 05 was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass quantities and effluent quality results of monitoring biomass concentration in the reactors in the form of tss and vss during both stages of operation are presented in fig 2 at the beginning of the first stage r1 r2 and r3 contained 2 0 1 7 and 2 0 g l mlvss respectively during this stage biomass acclimation was observed and the mlvss increased to 2 6 2 1 and 2 8 g l in r1 r2 and r3 respectively the acclimation was expected in the system because the biomass was only removed by effluent suspended solids the ratio of vss tss for the biomass was stable in the three reactors during this stage and an average of 0 80 0 01 was calculated for the three reactors the concentrations of vss and tss in the reactors effluent over time are shown in fig 2 during the first stage effluent vss was found in the range of 30 140 mg l with an average concentration of 87 5 mg l for the three reactors with the change in operation from anaerobic feeding to anaerobic contact an immediate increase was observed in the effluent vss to 166 214 and 108 mg l in r1 r2 and r3 respectively consequently biomass concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was reduced to 2 5 1 9 and 2 6 g l vss moreover after acclimation the effluent vss decreased down to 10 mg l on day 67 however the effluent vss was not stable after this day and fluctuated between 10 to 82 mg l an average vss concentration of 46 3 mg l was calculated for the reactors during this stage which was significantly p 0 05 lower than that of the first stage as a result of the decrease in effluent vss biomass acclimation was obtained and mlvss reached 3 0 3 1 and 3 8 g l in r1 r2 and r3 respectively at the end of the second stage the average ratio of vss tss for the biomass was 0 76 0 01 in all reactors this biomass acclimation under the condition that the organic load is fixed caused a decrease in f m ratio the f m ratio decreased from 0 42 to 0 33 gcod gvss d during the first stage and then to 0 25 gcod gvss d during the second stage of operation as can be seen in fig 2 a decrease in the effluent solid resulted in an increased in the mlss in the reactors and vice versa therefore biomass acclimation was controlled with the effluent quality which was dependent on the settling performance of the biomass the biomass residence time which was calculated based on quantities of biomass in the reactors and the effluent was determined by the effluent quality the average srt in the three reactors was 15 1 d during the first stage while in the second stage average srt of 32 3 d was obtained with the decrease in effluent vss results of srt and effluent quality for the three reactors during the first and second stage of operation are listed in table 1 results of statistical analysis showed that in the three reactors srt and effluent solids was significantly influenced p 0 05 by the change in the operation compared to anaerobic feeding strategies anaerobic contact obtained better effluent quality and resulted in higher biomass retention time in the system this suggested that in the second stage the slow growth organisms could proliferate in the system also less biomass in the effluent suggested that ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos had less chance to grow in the suspension when potentially no readily biodegradable cod rbcod was present in the aerobic phase devlin et al 6 also reported that anaerobic uptake of cod 55 77 of total cod removal reduced the yield of rapidly growing aerobic microorganisms 3 2 organics and nutrient removal performance of the granules the effluent concentrations of cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal during the 125 days of operation with low strength wastewater are presented in fig 3 based on these results cod tn and tp removal efficiency of the reactors during the two stages was calculated and presented in table 1 during the two stages effluent scod ranged from 15 to 25 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 95 in the three reactors however anaerobic cod removal was different in the two stages cod removal during anaerobic feeding was between 17 24 while contact enhanced cod removal from 45 to 53 in the anaerobic phase rocktäschel et al 11 also reported that compared to anaerobic feeding anaerobic mixing achieved higher cod uptakes however devlin et al 6 reported 55 77 cod uptake from low strength wastewater during one hour of anaerobic feeding in four liter reactors without mixing during the two stages nitrate concentration between 20 30 mg n l was obtained while ammonium and nitrite were not detected in the reactors effluent results presented in table 1 showed that the second stage obtained higher nitrogen removals in the three reactors this could be due to complete denitrification obtained during anaerobic contact which is explained later the reactors effluent phosphorus fluctuated between values approximately 1 mg p l to higher than 4 mg p l during the first stage average phosphorus removal of less than 65 was achieved in the first stage however when anaerobic contact was applied stable phosphorus removal with effluent phosphorus less than 1 mg l was obtained in one week the average phosphorus removal in this stage was higher than 90 statistical analysis confirmed that the phosphorus removal was significantly influenced by anaerobic contact the results of a cycle test performed in the first and the second stage are presented in fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4b phosphorus release was not achieved during the anaerobic feeding suggesting that paos were not responsible for phosphorus removal additionally incomplete denitrification was observed as 3 8 and 3 4 mg n l nitrate was measured in r1 and r3 respectively at the end of the anaerobic phase the initial nitrate measured was 29 1 and 29 8 mg n in r1 and r3 respectively assuming the ratio of 7 gcod gno3 n 7 203 6 and 208 5 gcod was required for the complete denitrification in r1 and r3 respectively however the anaerobic cod reduction for r1 and r3 was 164 6 and 154 4 mgcod respectively as shown in fig 4b applying anaerobic contact resulted in complete denitrification and anaerobic phosphorus release of 6 4 and 6 2 mg p gvss was observed in r2 and r3 respectively in the aerobic phase complete phosphorus removal was obtained with the specific uptake rate of 2 1 2 5 mg p vss h the results indicated that although sufficient carbon source was present in the feed denitrification and phosphorus release were not achieved with anaerobic feeding comparing the two operation strategies substrate gradient during the anaerobic phase was higher in the second stage also the applied anaerobic contact provided better mass transfer and improved the nutrient removal efficiency of the granules rocktäschel et al 11 also reported that mechanical mixing during the anaerobic feeding benefits the nutrient removal with equal distribution of substrate 3 3 characteristics of the granules characteristics of the granules were monitored during both stages of operation by measuring svi5 granules size eps content and eps composition the results are presented in fig 5 as can be seen svi5 was stable during the first stage while operating with anaerobic contact that resulted in the change in granules settleability after the change in operation svi5 increased from 49 1 to 90 7 ml g on day 68 high svi5 80 ml g was observed for 20 days after day 88 the settling improved and stable svi5 50 ml g was obtained after day 103 the settling velocity of granules is affected by the granular density shape particle size etc in this study the variation in the vss ss ratio and particle size could be responsible for the decrease of settling performance as shown in fig 5 eps content which was stable 150 mg gvss during the first stage decreased to 113 2 mg gvss day 86 after applying anaerobic contact after acclimation to the new condition with the improvement of biomass stability the eps content increased and reached 131 1 mg gvss at the end of this stage the eps content from the first stage could not be achieved in the second stage the results showed that the protein content of the granules decreased in the second stage while carbohydrate remained the same this resulted in lower p c ratio in the second stage the change in eps content and eps matrix p c of the granules could be due to the decrease in the amount of cod in the aerobic phase caused by the anaerobic cod uptake less availability of carbon in the aerobic period altered the feast famine balance it was reported that eps production is affected by feast famine balance 14 therefore in the second stage applying same aeration time with the availability of less carbon could either cause less eps production during the feast period or more eps consumption during the starvation period according to zhu et al 15 under the feast condition bacteria produced eps as an energy source to utilize as carbon for endogenous respiration under famine starvation condition when the presence of substrate is limited it was reported that higher f m ratios favor production of eps and consequently enhance granulation 16 at the end of the second stage granules stabilized to f m ratio of 0 33 gcod gvss d while the biomass increased from 3 to 4 g l vss and the f m ratio decreased to 0 25 gcod vss d devlin et al 6 also observed a decrease in net eps content when biomass acclimation was obtained in granular sbrs treating low strength wastewater increase in biomass concentration decreased f m ratio and caused aerobic consumption of eps it should also be mentioned that anaerobic contact could cause hydrodynamic shear and affect granules properties zhang et al 17 reported that applying shear during anaerobic and anoxic phase by contact can enhance eps production and aerobic granulation however in this work shear caused by the applied liquid circulation was very small compared to that of air flow the shear during the anaerobic phase in the first and second stage was calculated as 0 005 and 0 02 cm s respectively which were considered insignificant and therefore should not induce any superfluous changes as shown in fig 5 granules size was also affected by the change in operation during the first stage a gradual increase in the mean diameter from 0 6 to 0 7 mm was observed however in the second stage the granules size decreased to less than 0 6 mm which was later stabilized as can be seen the granules size decreased when the biomass settling was deteriorating suggesting disintegration of the granules and it stabilized when the biomass settling was improved suggesting re granulation according to previous studies 13 18 19 granule size is controlled by organic loading rate and shear force although the organic loading rate olr and shear were the same in the two stages the granules could not achieve their initial size when anaerobic contact was applied it could be due to the decrease in olr of the aerobic phase with the increase in removal of organics caused by anaerobic contact 3 4 implications for design the results suggest that anaerobic carbon uptake could be obtained without applying a high shear force with mechanical mixing although when it comes to full scale applications anaerobic feeding at high flow rates would be effective to produce hydrodynamic turbulence and provide adequate contact also fast anaerobic feeding followed by mixing for large sequential batch reactors may not be feasible due to the cost ineffectiveness high shear forces produced during the fast feeding could be destructive to the granules therefore design considerations are required for feeding system in sbrs introduce the feed while distributing the substrate and avoid the need for further mixing the distribution of feed can also reduce the hydraulic turbulence and accordingly prevent the high shear force which could cause granules disintegration 4 conclusion two operation strategies were applied to aerobic anaerobic sbrs anaerobic feeding and anaerobic contact results indicated that the system with anaerobic contact performed better in terms of effluent quality and nutrient removal anaerobic contact enhanced mass transfer and increased anaerobic cod removal from 17 24 to 45 53 consequently phosphorus removal was improved from 63 to 93 raising mass transfer during anaerobic phase improved the effluent quality from 87 to 46 mg l vss by reducing the growth of rapidly growing organisms floccular biomass and consequently improved biomass retention time from 15 to 32 d the presented results suggest that design considerations should be taken into account to provide sufficient anaerobic contact and hence anaerobic cod utilization in granular sbrs treating low strength wastewater acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the natural sciences and

efficiencies cost 1 introduction many countries in the world are still water stressed and lack access to abundant natural freshwater resources these countries are facing water scarcity not only for drinking purposes but also for other applications like agriculture and industrial process heating cooling that require high water quality the water stress might become worse in the near future as a result of surging population industrialization and climate change through an ensemble of models on climate and socioeconomic conditions the water resources institute recently carried out the water stress ranking of 167 countries 1 a water stress score which is a single score water stress indicator that showed the extent to which freshwater withdrawal exceeds renewable freshwater supply was calculated for each country it was discovered that 33 countries would face extremely high water stress by 2040 14 of these countries are in the middle east including 9 countries considered to be extremely water stressed bahrain kuwait palestine qatar united arab emirates israel saudi arabia oman and lebanon this region depends heavily on saline groundwater and desalinated seawater for freshwater supply in addition chile namibia estonia and botswana might experience considerable increase in water stress by 2040 although highly populated countries such as india and china may not experience the water stress level predicted for the middle east water stress indices show that high water stress might also be experienced in these countries by 2040 however in many of these countries wastewater is dumped into surface ponds and seas lately the united nations un has proposed wide scale wastewater reuse as a sustainable approach for tackling freshwater stress meanwhile the effluents from conventional wastewater treatment sand filtration activated sludge treatment membrane bioreactors etc may still contain a wide variety of residual contaminants in considerable amounts 2 3 these residual contaminants are harmful to humans and can potentially contaminate freshwater aquifers and delicate aquatic ecosystems therefore efficient wastewater treatment is essential to fill the gap between freshwater demand and renewable supply the conventional wastewater treatment processes for general and wholesome reuse include activated sludge membrane bioreactor treatment with post treatment processes such as reverse osmosis ro ion exchange or chemical coagulation 4 however as a result of several drawbacks such as high overall treatment costs and environmental footprints process inefficiencies and production of toxic byproducts the need to develop a simple and cost effective post treatment approach is crucial 5 in fact the industry approach for freshwater production from wastewater is the conventional activated sludge cas treatment followed by microfiltration ultrafiltration plus ro and an advanced oxidation process aop 6 this industry standard is costly because of the multiples stages the drawbacks of huge footprints and high overall energy requirements associated with the industry standard have also necessitated research on alternative systems 6 to ensure a cost competitive and more environmentally friendly approach the number of stages and energy consumption need to be significantly reduced however the alternative should also be able to guarantee acceptable water quality the primary treatment method employed in the industry is cas other attempts have been directed towards the consideration of mbr as a primary treatment method 7 8 most of the recent studies on the use of mbr for wastewater treatment to potable levels have focused on the osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr 5 ombr is a type of mbr that makes use of the osmotic power of a high salinity draw solution to recover fresh water from the mixed liquor in the mbr this technology is capable of reducing energy consumption and cost at the draw dilution stage however draw regeneration in a large scale is still a huge challenge as a result of this drawback conventional aerobic mbr that is not osmotically driven is still widely considered as the practical mbr technology for water recovery from wastewater 5 conventional aerobic mbr also faces the problem of membrane fouling but this problem can be addressed by the incorporation of electrodes electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor embr is an aerobic mbr that consists of electrodes inserted in the mbr to induce electrokinetics for membrane fouling abatement 9 the electrodes can be inserted in cylindrical or rectangular configurations as a primary treatment method embr has also been shown to provide effluents of high quality at lower cost than the traditional approaches such as cas and conventional aerobic mbr 3 10 comparatively embr provides higher removal efficiencies for organics water hardness and bacteria from raw wastewater however the residual contaminants in embr effluent are still beyond levels suitable for wholesome applications 5 the advantages of embr are relative improvement of treated effluent quality compared to cas and mbr and requirement of lower environmental footprints but embr effluent needs to be post treated in order to meet the un s goal of increasing global wastewater reuse for wholesome applications the combination of embr and inorganic membrane filtration could offer improved energy savings 9 11 but the use of inorganic membranes in the water industry is not common due to the difficulty of producing and handling these membranes at a large scale current applications of inorganic membranes are mostly in the areas where polymeric materials cannot be suitably used such as in applications that require high temperatures or harsh chemicals 12 meanwhile the fabrication of free standing aerogel membranes is evolving as an important aspect of membrane technology due to the possibility of producing the aerogels by using a simple technology at low cost 11 13 recently free standing inorganic nanowire nw aerogels have been produced from low cost hydrothermal method and used to remove heavy metal ions from synthetic aqueous solutions 11 the inorganic nws were self assembled into a 3d interconnected nw hydrogel network by interlinking of the grown nws during hydrothermal synthesis freestanding inorganic nw aerogel membranes are highly porous with ultra high surface areas and low bulk densities 14 15 the surface chemical functionalities of these aerogels also act as a critical factor on their pollutant removal efficiencies due to their interactions with pollutants in water therefore a two stage approach consisting of embr and anatase tio2 nw aerogel membrane filtration was employed for the treatment of raw wastewater in this work this two stage approach is studied for the first time chemical oxygen demand cod bacteria fe2 zn2 cr6 and cd2 are some of the crucial pollutants that need to be measured for the assessment of reclaimed water quality these pollutants contribute significant risks to human health ecosystem quality and biodiversity 16 17 so these pollutants were considered as the representative pollutants in this study the fabrication characterization and evaluation of the performance of the tio2 nw aerogel membrane were carried out from the characterization of the aerogel membrane the influence of the morphology crystallinity hydrophilicity surface charges and chemical functionalities of the membrane on its pollutant removal efficiencies was studied these characteristics also influence the applicability and regenerative potential of the aerogel membrane the performance of the aerogel membrane was evaluated in terms of water permeability across the membrane and its efficiency for removing cod bacteria fe2 zn2 cr6 and cd2 from embr effluent the overall performance of the two stage wastewater treatment process was also assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the materials used in this study were monopolar embr tio2 nw aerogel membrane 3 wt citric acid 1 wt sodium hypochlorite whatman fritted glass filtration set up 50 w led uva lamp hach lck pollutant detection cuvettes m coliblue24 coliforms broth and silwicktm wetting liquid the embr and aerogel membrane fabrication procedures were as reported in giwa et al 18 and sung mi et al 11 respectively and summarized hereinafter 2 2 electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor raw wastewater from a municipal storage tank at masdar city abu dhabi united arab emirates was fed into an aerobic embr the raw wastewater contained 3 9 million cfu 100 ml tbc 2 25 mg l zn2 1 4 mg l cr6 63 μg l cd2 and 880 mg l cod initial aerobic sludge was obtained from masdar city mbr plant and mixed with the raw wastewater at a hydraulic retention time of 13 ½ h and sludge retention time of 240 days this embr is a 31 5 l rectangular polycarbonate reactor two pairs of monopolar electrodes were inserted into the reactor using the series configuration the cathode and anode was made up of stainless steel mesh and perforated aluminum plate respectively each with an effective area of 535 cm2 the porosity of the anode was 40 a current density of 1 5 ma cm2 was applied to the configuration at an intermittent cycle of 5 min on and 15 min off for 120 days the embr was configured as reactor wall anode cathode membrane cathode anode reactor wall w a c m c a w the reactor was composed of the aerobic and anoxic regions the aerobic region was a c m c a used to promote aerobic conditions while the anoxic regions were w a and a w used to promote anoxic conditions for nitrogen removal the aerobic region was achieved by connecting air bubble diffusers to this region in order to keep the dissolved oxygen level at 5 8 mg l in addition the raw wastewater was fed directly to the aerobic region only for direct contact with dissolved oxygen no air bubble diffusers were fixed in the anoxic regions anoxic conditions were maintained by allowing the mixed liquor to move through the anode pores from the aerobic to the anoxic regions passage of mixed liquor across the anode pores resulted in a decrease in dissolved oxygen level to 1 2 mg l in the anoxic regions the mean pore size of the membrane inside the embr was 0 4 μm the effective membrane area width and height were 1100 cm2 22 6 cm and 31 6 cm respectively this membrane was made up of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate and chlorinated polyethylene the dimensions of the embr were 28 cm 25 cm 45 cm the volume percentage of the electrical zone was 26 the aluminum anodes had dimensions 22 8 cm 0 3 cm 43 7 cm the effective height of each electrode was 33 5 cm the inter electrode distance on each side of the membrane was 5 cm the effluent from the embr was fed to the aerogel membrane 2 3 fabrication of tio2 nw aerogel membrane to fabricate tio2 aerogel membrane na2ti8o17 nw hydrogel was first synthesized in situ from a precursor mixture consisting of 7 5 mg ml of commercial p25 anatase tio2 nanoparticles in 10 m naoh this reaction was also carried out at 523 k for 96 h and then the resulting hydrogel was ion exchanged with 0 2 m hno3 to obtain h2ti8o17 nw hydrogel the na2ti8o17 nw hydrogel was formed in situ during hydrothermal synthesis by interlinking of grown nws the hydrogel was transformed to aerogel by freeze drying which retained the 3d pore structure of the hydrogel at large scale and low cost the h2ti8o17 nws aerogel was then calcined to anatase tio2 nw aerogel at 550 c for 2 h the aerogel contained both the structural scaffold for the bulk monolith and active functional sites and there was no need for additional structural support the aerogel was cut as flat sheet circular disk membrane samples each having diameter of 47 mm for performance assessment and characterization 2 4 performance of aerogel membrane and combined process the aerogel membrane was combined with embr for the treatment of raw wastewater as shown in fig 1 first raw wastewater was fed to the embr the embr effluent was then filtered through the tio2 aerogel membrane this filtration was carried out in the batch mode at 70 kpa using whatman fritted glass filtration set up connected to welch 2546c 02a vacuum pump the filtrate obtained was recirculated to the membrane such that filtration was carried out twice filtration was performed under low energy uv using 50 w led uva lamp with a wavelength spectrum of 315 400 nm and low intensity of 8 mw cm2 the distance between the lamp and the aerogel membrane was 13 cm the aerogel membrane was initially irradiated for 30 min before filtration to ensure photocatalytic activation after which the embr effluent was passed through the membrane under uv illumination water permeability which is the water flux across the aerogel membrane per unit applied pressure was also estimated the concentrations of organics cod and heavy metal ions fe2 zn2 cr6 and cd2 in the effluents from the embr and combined process were measured using hach lck pollutant detection cuvettes and dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer with radio frequency identification rfid technology the total bacterial counts tbc of these effluents were also measured using hach m coliblue24 coliforms broth the autoclaving of the broth or medium was carried out at 121 c for 20 min the autoclaved medium was then poured into agar plates at room temperature and used for tbc measurements the pollutant removal efficiencies of the aerogel membrane were calculated from eq 1 1 r e m o v a l 100 c f c p c f cf and cp are concentrations of a pollutant in the feed and permeate respectively after filtration the aerogel membrane was washed several times with deionized water having resistivity of 15 mω cm at 25 c to investigate the suitability of physical cleaning for membrane regeneration the washed membrane was dried in memmert uf55 oven at 50 c characterized and compared with the pristine aerogel membrane the dried membrane after physical cleaning was tagged as spent membrane 2 5 characterization of the aerogel membrane before and after the filtration the morphology crystallinity hydrophilicity surface charges and chemical functionalities of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes were observed to assess the applicability and reusability of the membrane the mean pore size was measured using capillary flow porometer cfp porous materials inc usa porosity was calculated from gravimetric analysis i e from the membrane pores displaced by a wetting liquid silwicktm with a density of 0 7031 g cm3 when the membrane was submerged completely without saturation in the liquid the air in the membrane pores was displaced by the wetting liquid the volume occupied by silwicktm was considered as the pore volume of the aerogel membrane the porosity of the membrane was then estimated from the ratio of pore volume to total membrane volume as shown in eq 2 2 m e m b r a n e p o r o s i t y v p v t w f w i ρ l a m δ m v p is membrane pore volume v t is total membrane volume w f is final membrane weight after immersion in the wetting liquid w i is initial membrane weight before immersion in the wetting liquid ρ l is density of the wetting liquid a m is membrane area δ m is membrane thickness the morphology and structural features of the pristine and spent aerogel membrane were also observed using fei nova nanosem 650 with monopole magnetic immersion final lens and 60 objective lens geometry field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem was carried out at an electron beam energy of 5 kv 4 0 spot size emission current of 100 μa chamber vacuum 10 mpa and magnification of 500 nm membrane hydrophilicity was measured through dynamic water contact angle analysis the sessile drop technique in krüss drop shape analyzer dsa hamburg germany was employed to measure the dynamic water contact angle of the aerogel membrane the water contact angle was measured at the intersection points between a drop contour of 3 μl of deionized water and the projection of the membrane surface on dsa the structural integrity of the aerogel membrane was assessed in terms of the possibility of filtration to cause changes to the crystallinity of the membrane membrane crystallinity was observed using x ray diffraction xrd the xrd patterns of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes were observed using panalytical empyrean diffractometer with cu kα monochromatic radiation at a wavelength of 1 54 å the diffractometer was operated at a maximum voltage of 45 kv and current of 40 ma and in the bragg s 2θ angle range of 0 90 continuous scan step size of 5 s and scan rate of 5 min were employed the influence of surface charges on the pollutant removal efficiencies and reusability of the aerogel membrane was assessed by dispersing the spent membrane in deionized water such that a suspension containing 0 04 mg ml of spent tio2 was obtained the surface charges on this suspension were then determined from zeta potential measurements using the phase analysis light scattering principle in nanobrook zetapals potential analyzer with a scattering angle of 15 changes to the chemical functionalities and elemental composition of the aerogel membrane due to filtration were assessed using fourier transform infrared ft ir raman and energy dispersive x ray edax spectroscopy ft ir spectroscopy was performed to study the possibility of formation of new functionalities on the aerogel membrane due to filtration bruker s vertex 80v ft ir spectrometer was used to observe the ft ir spectra at vacuum pressure 5 hpa ir attenuated total reflectance spectra analysis was carried out in the wave number range of 4 000 to 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 raman spectra of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes were also observed using alpha 300r confocal micro raman imaging spectrometer with led visible laser excitation source observed as a blue light at 532 nm under a backscattering geometry and diffraction limited lateral resolution of 200 300 nm samples of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes were placed on a horizontal glass slide and raman scattering spectroscopy was used to investigate the local molecular structure of the membranes possible changes to the elemental composition of the membrane surface due to filtration were investigated through edax spectroscopy edax spectroscopy was carried out using apollo x silicon drift detector in fei nova nanosem 650 at a working distance of 5 mm the regenerative ability of the aerogel membrane was also evaluated through chemical cleaning by rinsing samples of the spent membrane in an aqueous solution containing 3 wt citric acid and 1 wt sodium hypochlorite for 2 h the samples were then washed several times with deionized water and air dried all measurements were carried out at room temperature 21 1 c 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance of aerogel membrane and combined process embr reduced the concentration levels of pollutants in the raw wastewater to 18 300 cfu 100 ml tbc 476 μg l zn2 14 μg l cr6 13 μg l cd2 and 36 9 mg l cod these values are too high for wholesome or general reuse 19 an important attribute of the tio2 aerogel membrane was its ability to remove residual contaminants from the embr effluent the aerogel membrane reduced the residual contaminant levels in the embr effluent to 0 cfu 100 ml tbc 69 μg l zn2 10 μg l cr6 10 μg l cd2 and 19 mg l cod an improvement in the pollutant removal efficiencies of the combined process was observed compared to the single process of embr this improvement is shown in table 1 100 bacteria 97 8 cod 96 9 zn2 99 3 cr6 and 84 1 cd2 were removed by the combined process compared to 99 5 bacteria 95 8 cod and 78 8 zn2 99 0 cr6 and 79 4 cd2 removal by embr only the embr effluent quality is only applicable for restricted reuse involving landscaping and forestry irrigation 19 however the post treatment of the embr effluent with tio2 aerogel membrane provides the opportunity to reuse the final effluent for advanced applications such as agricultural irrigation and industrial process heating cooling the removal of residual contaminants in the embr effluent by the aerogel membrane was ensured by its electrostatic and photoactive capabilities and porous network the aerogel membrane acted as a platform for the alkaline hydrolysis heavy metal ions the aerogel surface is acidic and through its oxidizing top layer the heavy metal ions in the embr effluent were chemically oxidized to their insoluble hydroxide forms these insoluble hydroxides were then collected as precipitate on the membrane 20 21 this mechanism is illustrated in fig 2 so in addition to the rejection via size exclusion offered by the nanosized pores of the membranes the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged active sites of the membranes and positively charged metal ions also contributed to the removal of these ions the removal efficiencies of the membrane for heavy metal ions followed the order zn2 cr6 cd2 compared to other heavy metal ions more zn2 ions were removed by the aerogel membrane because there were more zn2 ions in the embr effluent to saturate the binding sites of the membrane 22 zn2 ion exhibited affinity for adsorption to the multiple coordinated sites at the water tio2 interface 23 in general cd2 was precipitated as cd oh 3 while zn2 was precipitated as zn oh 3 24 for bacteria removal the aerogel membrane was able to increase the removal efficiency of residual tbc to 100 due to the excitation of valence electrons that generated electron hole pairs on the aerogel surface for photo activity 25 the nanowire morphology promoted the motion of these pairs 26 in such a way that the kinetics of photodegradation were enhanced 27 the aerogel membrane also increased the removal efficiency from 95 8 for embr to 97 8 for the combined process due to the same reasons the improved retention and degradation of residual organic matter by the aerogel membrane was confirmed from zeta potential measurements it was observed that the surface of the spent aerogel was negatively charged with a conductance of 270 μs due to its photo active sites consequently the zeta potential of the spent aerogel membrane surface was 29 76 mv the zeta potential of tio2 should extend up to 40 mv the measured zeta potential was lower than the expected optimum value due to the surface conductance of tio2 in the surrounding medium water the conductivity of tio2 altered the shape of the potential distribution of the applied field in the liquid modified the motion of water within the electrical double layer and therefore changed the stresses exerted on the particle by water consequently this conductivity led to the mutual distortion of the applied field and the field of the double layer and hence slowed the electrophoretic motion these findings have also been reported in a previous study 28 it was also observed that aside from its electrostatic and photocatalytic capabilities the removal of residual ions by the aerogel membrane was due to its porous structure and hydrophilicity the aerogel membrane showed highly porous network that consisted of interlinked nws having average diameter of 50 nm the diameter 50 nm was measured from fesem the porous structure existed as nanoporous channels as shown in the sem images in fig 3 a and aided the retention of organic pollutants by size exclusion the retention of organics on the aerogel membrane surface further improved their exposure to photo activity the mean pore size of the aerogel membrane was measured from cfp as 90 nm while membrane porosity was estimated as 90 the repulsion of contaminants by the aerogel membrane was also related to its super hydrophilicity as shown in the drop shapes in fig 3 b the aerogel membrane exhibited complete wetting with receding contact angle of 0 the receding contact angle of the membrane became 0 at just 1 s after contact with water this super hydrophilicity contributed to its exceedingly high permeability the aerogel membrane showed water permeability of 850 lmh bar this value is higher than those of commercial polymeric membranes as shown in fig 3 c the range of water permeability of commercial polymeric membranes from dow water process solutions is 1 14 lmh bar 29 this 14 fold difference in water permeability is covered by two polyamide types with small changes in composition the aromatic ft30 membrane and the aliphatic aromatic nanofiltration membrane the latter type is sometimes referred to as polypiperazine membrane the ft30 membrane is an aromatic membrane made from 1 3 phenylene diamine and the tri acid chloride of benzene 29 meanwhile ultrafiltration membranes with pore size range similar to that of the tio2 aerogel membrane have higher fluxes than the nanofiltration membranes in most practical applications these fluxes vary between 50 and 200 gfd 85 340 lmh at an operating pressure of about 50 psig 3 4 bar 30 the polymers used for the fabrication of these ultrafiltration membranes include polyethersulfone polyvinylidene fluoride and polyacrylonitrile the flux values reported for these commercial polymeric ultrafiltration membranes are however still lower than that of the tio2 aerogel membrane 3 2 applicability and reusability of aerogel membrane the spent membrane was observed to exhibit a slightly lower mean pore size fig 4 a and 4 b this observation might be due to the surface interactions of the membrane with residual contaminants during filtration the mean pore size of the pristine aerogel membrane decreased by 95 after filtration this decrease was insignificant and not enough to provide considerable alterations to the functional characteristics of the membrane as observed from xrd ft ir and raman spectroscopy fig 4 c 4 e the xrd patterns of the pristine and spent samples were analyzed in order to determine whether there are possible changes to the crystallinity of the aerogel membrane due to filtration fig 4 c the xrd pattern of the pristine aerogel membrane showed diffraction peaks at d spacings of 0 355 and 0 189 nm with 2θ angles of 25 and 48 respectively indicating that the crystalline structure was anatase tio2 the pristine membrane can be indexed to the tetragonal phase with lattice parameters a 3 804 å b 3 804 å and c 9 614 å for tio2 these values were close to the theoretical value reported in the literature confirming that there were no defects or collapse in the initial structure 31 from these xrd patterns it was also observed that the pristine aerogel membrane exhibited a single phase because no peaks showing impurities could be seen in the patterns the diffraction pattern of the spent aerogel membrane showed more intense peaks indicative of higher degree of crystallinity after filtration this means that the structural integrity of the nanowires was preserved during filtration ft ir analysis was carried out to study the possible change in the functionalities on the aerogel membrane surface due to filtration the ft ir spectra of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes are shown in fig 4 d the peaks in the ir spectrum of the pristine aerogel membrane observed at 455 810 and 976 cm 1 were due to the stretching vibration of ti o and the bending vibration of ti o ti 32 however the disappearance of the bending vibration of ti o ti corresponding to the peaks at 810 and 976 cm 1 was noticed in ir spectrum of the spent aerogel membrane new ir absorption peaks at 1074 and 3536 cm 1 were observed instead these new peaks can be ascribed to the bending vibration of carbonyl group co or hydrated organic functionality bonded to the spent membrane this carbonyl functionality might have resulted from the partially degraded organics adsorbed on the surface of the aerogel membrane 33 raman spectra showed the molecular fingerprints of the aerogel membrane raman spectroscopy is used to identify a specific molecule through the raman effect raman effect occurs when the energy of scattered light from a molecule is different from that of the incident monochromatic visible light thereby resulting in a distortion of the electron cloud or change in polarizability of the molecule similar peaks were observed for both pristine and spent aerogel membranes fig 4 e for the pristine membrane four sharp peaks were observed at bands 148 200 399 and 640 cm 1 whereas the raman spectra of the spent membrane showed main peaks at 148 200 396 and 648 cm 1 indicating only slight shifts this peak suggests that there are interstitial pores between the nws 34 as also observed in the sem scans the line shape of the raman spectra confirmed its nonstoichiometry i e its formation of electron hole pairs that were excited to the conduction band it is clear from ft ir analysis that chemisorption of organic pollutants onto the surface of the aerogel membrane i e organic membrane fouling occurred during filtration the physisorbed pollutants which were attracted to the aerogel membrane surface through electrostatic or van der waal interactions were washed away during physical cleaning however the presence of chemisorbed organics on the spent aerogel membrane surface was revealed by ft ir analysis edax analysis was also used to confirm whether some inorganic pollutants were chemically adsorbed to the membrane surface i e inorganic fouling from edax analysis table 2 it was observed that the surface of the spent membrane contained zn2 in addition to elemental composition of the pristine aerogel membrane therefore chemical cleaning of the aerogel membrane was carried out to remove these foulants the chemically cleaned membrane was retested for vacuum filtration and a flux recovery ratio of 0 9 was obtained 3 3 cost effectiveness of combined process in the conventional treatment of raw wastewater ro membrane is used to post treat the effluent from traditional cas mf uf or mbr followed by uv aop disinfection however ro gulps a comparatively high hydraulic pressure even for wastewater treatment wastewater ro gulps about 12 bar of pressure or more depending on the feed concentration therefore wastewater reuse is strongly dependent on the membrane technology employed the technology determines the environmental impact energy consumption and cost of water production for cas mf uf the cost of wastewater ro ranges from almost us 0 65 to us 1 25 m3 the cost of wastewater uf ranges from us 0 45 to us 0 75 m3 while that of mf ranges from us 0 3 0 7 m3 35 using inflation adjusted values these cost values will be higher the overall energy consumption of the conventional process is comparable to seawater ro energy requirement of about 3 5 kw h m3 36 therefore the overall cost of the treatment system is huge due to these multiple stages and the inflation adjusted cost could be higher for example singapore produces potable water from raw wastewater using the conventional cas mf uf ro uv aop and calls it newater newater is costly to produce because it requires multiple treatment stages including the mf uf and ro stages that increase the overall energy consumption as shown in table 3 newater tariff in singapore is sg 2 14 to 2 33 m3 us 1 54 to 1 68 m3 compared to sg 1 44 to 1 58 m3 for industrial process water produced from traditional activated sludge treatment 37 as a result an increase in newater production in the future means an increase in energy consumption for potable water production the cas mf uf ro uv aop process is referred to as conventional because it has also been used in other places aside singapore the process has been employed to treat wastewater at orange county and san diego in california usa 38 39 the process has been employed in australia whereby the final effluent is used for indirect potable reuse such as water supply to power plants in toowoomba queensland and perth western australia 39 in belgium the process has been used to produce recycled water in the torreele reuse plant wulpen in england mf and uv have been employed to produce recycled water that is discharged into the chelmer river for freshwater augmentation 39 the energy consumption of the combined process assessed in the study was estimated and compared with the conventional cas mf uf ro uv aop the specific energy consumption and cost of water production using embr were 0 87 kw h m3 and us 0 86 m3 respectively 9 the cost of fabricating the tio2 aerogel membrane was us 100 kg while the energy requirement for photo oxidation was 0 8 kw h ton the cost components of the combined embr tio2 aerogel membrane filtration process are shown in table 4 these cost values are applicable for the treatment of the raw wastewater considered in this study the concentrations of the pollutants in the raw wastewater treated by the combined process are stated again in table 4 from the pressure required for aerogel membrane filtration and the volume of water treated the specific energy consumption and cost of water production by aerogel membrane filtration were 0 2 kw h m3 and us 0 17 m3 respectively overall the cost of water production by the combined process was us 1 03 m3 this value is less than the cost of water production using the conventional process in addition energy requirement by the combined embr aerogel membrane filtration process is less indicating that this process is more environmentally friendly 4 conclusions embr was combined with anatase aerogel membrane for low cost efficient wastewater treatment the aerogel membrane was produced by one step hydrothermal synthesis at low cost and large scale the membrane was highly porous with 90 porosity superhydrophilic highly permeable with water permeability of 850 lmh bar and contained interconnected networks of nanowires with average pore size of 90 nm contaminant rejection analysis showed that the combined process was able to remove 100 bacteria 97 8 cod 96 9 zn2 99 3 cr6 and 84 1 cd2 from raw wastewater the aerogel membrane contributed to the overall removal efficiencies by removing residual heavy metal ions by surface charge interactions and residual organics and bacteria by size exclusion and photodegradation there were no considerable changes to the chemical properties of the aerogel membrane during filtration as confirmed from membrane characterization but fouling was observed chemical cleaning was effective for the regeneration of the aerogel membrane and 90 flux recovery was shown after chemical cleaning the cost of water production using the combined process was us 1 03 m3 which was less than the cost of water production using the conventional treatment the final effluent is suitable for advanced applications such as agricultural irrigation and industrial process heating cooling meanwhile long term experiments need to be carried out in further studies to assess the stability and mechanical strength of the aerogel membrane during long term filtration acknowledgement this work was funded by the cooperative agreement 02 mi mit cp 11 07633 gen g 00

experience the water stress level predicted for the middle east water stress indices show that high water stress might also be experienced in these countries by 2040 however in many of these countries wastewater is dumped into surface ponds and seas lately the united nations un has proposed wide scale wastewater reuse as a sustainable approach for tackling freshwater stress meanwhile the effluents from conventional wastewater treatment sand filtration activated sludge treatment membrane bioreactors etc may still contain a wide variety of residual contaminants in considerable amounts 2 3 these residual contaminants are harmful to humans and can potentially contaminate freshwater aquifers and delicate aquatic ecosystems therefore efficient wastewater treatment is essential to fill the gap between freshwater demand and renewable supply the conventional wastewater treatment processes for general and wholesome reuse include activated sludge membrane bioreactor treatment with post treatment processes such as reverse osmosis ro ion exchange or chemical coagulation 4 however as a result of several drawbacks such as high overall treatment costs and environmental footprints process inefficiencies and production of toxic byproducts the need to develop a simple and cost effective post treatment approach is crucial 5 in fact the industry approach for freshwater production from wastewater is the conventional activated sludge cas treatment followed by microfiltration ultrafiltration plus ro and an advanced oxidation process aop 6 this industry standard is costly because of the multiples stages the drawbacks of huge footprints and high overall energy requirements associated with the industry standard have also necessitated research on alternative systems 6 to ensure a cost competitive and more environmentally friendly approach the number of stages and energy consumption need to be significantly reduced however the alternative should also be able to guarantee acceptable water quality the primary treatment method employed in the industry is cas other attempts have been directed towards the consideration of mbr as a primary treatment method 7 8 most of the recent studies on the use of mbr for wastewater treatment to potable levels have focused on the osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr 5 ombr is a type of mbr that makes use of the osmotic power of a high salinity draw solution to recover fresh water from the mixed liquor in the mbr this technology is capable of reducing energy consumption and cost at the draw dilution stage however draw regeneration in a large scale is still a huge challenge as a result of this drawback conventional aerobic mbr that is not osmotically driven is still widely considered as the practical mbr technology for water recovery from wastewater 5 conventional aerobic mbr also faces the problem of membrane fouling but this problem can be addressed by the incorporation of electrodes electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor embr is an aerobic mbr that consists of electrodes inserted in the mbr to induce electrokinetics for membrane fouling abatement 9 the electrodes can be inserted in cylindrical or rectangular configurations as a primary treatment method embr has also been shown to provide effluents of high quality at lower cost than the traditional approaches such as cas and conventional aerobic mbr 3 10 comparatively embr provides higher removal efficiencies for organics water hardness and bacteria from raw wastewater however the residual contaminants in embr effluent are still beyond levels suitable for wholesome applications 5 the advantages of embr are relative improvement of treated effluent quality compared to cas and mbr and requirement of lower environmental footprints but embr effluent needs to be post treated in order to meet the un s goal of increasing global wastewater reuse for wholesome applications the combination of embr and inorganic membrane filtration could offer improved energy savings 9 11 but the use of inorganic membranes in the water industry is not common due to the difficulty of producing and handling these membranes at a large scale current applications of inorganic membranes are mostly in the areas where polymeric materials cannot be suitably used such as in applications that require high temperatures or harsh chemicals 12 meanwhile the fabrication of free standing aerogel membranes is evolving as an important aspect of membrane technology due to the possibility of producing the aerogels by using a simple technology at low cost 11 13 recently free standing inorganic nanowire nw aerogels have been produced from low cost hydrothermal method and used to remove heavy metal ions from synthetic aqueous solutions 11 the inorganic nws were self assembled into a 3d interconnected nw hydrogel network by interlinking of the grown nws during hydrothermal synthesis freestanding inorganic nw aerogel membranes are highly porous with ultra high surface areas and low bulk densities 14 15 the surface chemical functionalities of these aerogels also act as a critical factor on their pollutant removal efficiencies due to their interactions with pollutants in water therefore a two stage approach consisting of embr and anatase tio2 nw aerogel membrane filtration was employed for the treatment of raw wastewater in this work this two stage approach is studied for the first time chemical oxygen demand cod bacteria fe2 zn2 cr6 and cd2 are some of the crucial pollutants that need to be measured for the assessment of reclaimed water quality these pollutants contribute significant risks to human health ecosystem quality and biodiversity 16 17 so these pollutants were considered as the representative pollutants in this study the fabrication characterization and evaluation of the performance of the tio2 nw aerogel membrane were carried out from the characterization of the aerogel membrane the influence of the morphology crystallinity hydrophilicity surface charges and chemical functionalities of the membrane on its pollutant removal efficiencies was studied these characteristics also influence the applicability and regenerative potential of the aerogel membrane the performance of the aerogel membrane was evaluated in terms of water permeability across the membrane and its efficiency for removing cod bacteria fe2 zn2 cr6 and cd2 from embr effluent the overall performance of the two stage wastewater treatment process was also assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the materials

cuvettes m coliblue24 coliforms broth and silwicktm wetting liquid the embr and aerogel membrane fabrication procedures were as reported in giwa et al 18 and sung mi et al 11 respectively and summarized hereinafter 2 2 electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor raw wastewater from a municipal storage tank at masdar city abu dhabi united arab emirates was fed into an aerobic embr the raw wastewater contained 3 9 million cfu 100 ml tbc 2 25 mg l zn2 1 4 mg l cr6 63 μg l cd2 and 880 mg l cod initial aerobic sludge was obtained from masdar city mbr plant and mixed with the raw wastewater at a hydraulic retention time of 13 ½ h and sludge retention time of 240 days this embr is a 31 5 l rectangular polycarbonate reactor two pairs of monopolar electrodes were inserted into the reactor using the series configuration the cathode and anode was made up of stainless steel mesh and perforated aluminum plate respectively each with an effective area of 535 cm2 the porosity of the anode was 40 a current density of 1 5 ma cm2 was applied to the configuration at an intermittent cycle of 5 min on and 15 min off for 120 days the embr was configured as reactor wall anode cathode membrane cathode anode reactor wall w a c m c a w the reactor was composed of the aerobic and anoxic regions the aerobic region was a c m c a used to promote aerobic conditions while the anoxic regions were w a and a w used to promote anoxic conditions for nitrogen removal the aerobic region was achieved by connecting air bubble diffusers to this region in order to keep the dissolved oxygen level at 5 8 mg l in addition the raw wastewater was fed directly to the aerobic region only for direct contact with dissolved oxygen no air bubble diffusers were fixed in the anoxic regions anoxic conditions were maintained by allowing the mixed liquor to move through the anode pores from the aerobic to the anoxic regions passage of mixed liquor across the anode pores resulted in a decrease in dissolved oxygen level to 1 2 mg l in the anoxic regions the mean pore size of the membrane inside the embr was 0 4 μm the effective membrane area width and height were 1100 cm2 22 6 cm and 31 6 cm respectively this membrane was made up of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate and chlorinated polyethylene the dimensions of the embr were 28 cm 25 cm 45 cm the volume percentage of the electrical zone was 26 the aluminum anodes had dimensions 22 8 cm 0 3 cm 43 7 cm the effective height of each electrode was 33 5 cm the inter electrode distance on each side of the membrane was 5 cm the effluent from the embr was fed to the aerogel membrane 2 3 fabrication of tio2 nw aerogel membrane to fabricate tio2 aerogel membrane na2ti8o17 nw hydrogel was first synthesized in situ from a precursor mixture consisting of 7 5 mg ml of commercial p25 anatase tio2 nanoparticles in 10 m naoh this reaction was also carried out at 523 k for 96 h and then the resulting hydrogel was ion exchanged with 0 2 m hno3 to obtain h2ti8o17 nw hydrogel the na2ti8o17 nw hydrogel was formed in situ during hydrothermal synthesis by interlinking of grown nws the hydrogel was transformed to aerogel by freeze drying which retained the 3d pore structure of the hydrogel at large scale and low cost the h2ti8o17 nws aerogel was then calcined to anatase tio2 nw aerogel at 550 c for 2 h the aerogel contained both the structural scaffold for the bulk monolith and active functional sites and there was no need for additional structural support the aerogel was cut as flat sheet circular disk membrane samples each having diameter of 47 mm for performance assessment and characterization 2 4 performance of aerogel membrane and combined process the aerogel membrane was combined with embr for the treatment of raw wastewater as shown in fig 1 first raw wastewater was fed to the embr the embr effluent was then filtered through the tio2 aerogel membrane this filtration was carried out in the batch mode at 70 kpa using whatman fritted glass filtration set up connected to welch 2546c 02a vacuum pump the filtrate obtained was recirculated to the membrane such that filtration was carried out twice filtration was performed under low energy uv using 50 w led uva lamp with a wavelength spectrum of 315 400 nm and low intensity of 8 mw cm2 the distance between the lamp and the aerogel membrane was 13 cm the aerogel membrane was initially irradiated for 30 min before filtration to ensure photocatalytic activation after which the embr effluent was passed through the membrane under uv illumination water permeability which is the water flux across the aerogel membrane per unit applied pressure was also estimated the concentrations of organics cod and heavy metal ions fe2 zn2 cr6 and cd2 in the effluents from the embr and combined process were measured using hach lck pollutant detection cuvettes and dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer with radio frequency identification rfid technology the total bacterial counts tbc of these effluents were also measured using hach m coliblue24 coliforms broth the autoclaving of the broth or medium was carried out at 121 c for 20 min the autoclaved medium was then poured into agar plates at room temperature and used for tbc measurements the pollutant removal efficiencies of the aerogel membrane were calculated from eq 1 1 r e m o v a l 100 c f c p c f cf and cp are concentrations of a pollutant in the feed and permeate respectively after filtration the aerogel membrane was washed several times with deionized water having resistivity of 15 mω cm at 25 c to investigate the suitability of physical cleaning for membrane regeneration the washed membrane was dried in memmert uf55 oven at 50 c characterized and compared with the pristine aerogel membrane the dried membrane after physical cleaning was tagged as spent membrane 2 5 characterization of the aerogel membrane before and after the filtration the morphology crystallinity hydrophilicity surface charges and chemical functionalities of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes were observed to assess the applicability and reusability of the membrane the mean pore size was measured using capillary flow porometer cfp porous materials inc usa porosity was calculated from gravimetric analysis i e from the membrane pores displaced by a wetting liquid silwicktm with a density of 0 7031 g cm3 when the membrane was submerged completely without saturation in the liquid the air in the membrane pores was displaced by the wetting liquid the volume occupied by silwicktm was considered as the pore volume of the aerogel membrane the porosity of the membrane was then estimated from the ratio of pore volume to total membrane volume as shown in eq 2 2 m e m b r a n e p o r o s i t y v p v t w f w i ρ l a m δ m v p is membrane pore volume v t is total membrane volume w f is final membrane weight after immersion in the wetting liquid w i is initial membrane weight before immersion in the wetting liquid ρ l is density of the wetting liquid a m is membrane area δ m is membrane thickness the morphology and structural features of the pristine and spent aerogel membrane were also observed using fei nova nanosem 650 with monopole magnetic immersion final lens and 60 objective lens geometry field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem was carried out at an electron beam energy of 5 kv 4 0 spot size emission current of 100 μa chamber vacuum 10 mpa and magnification of 500 nm membrane hydrophilicity was measured through dynamic water contact angle analysis the sessile drop technique in krüss drop shape analyzer dsa hamburg germany was employed to measure the dynamic water contact angle of the aerogel membrane the water contact angle was measured at the intersection points between a drop contour of 3 μl of deionized water and the projection of the membrane surface on dsa the structural integrity of the aerogel membrane was assessed in terms of the possibility of filtration to cause changes to the crystallinity of the membrane membrane crystallinity was observed using x ray diffraction xrd the xrd patterns of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes were observed using panalytical empyrean diffractometer with cu kα monochromatic radiation at a wavelength of 1 54 å the diffractometer was operated at a maximum voltage of 45 kv and current of 40 ma and in the bragg s 2θ angle range of 0 90 continuous scan step size of 5 s and scan rate of 5 min were employed the influence of surface charges on the pollutant removal efficiencies and reusability of the aerogel membrane was assessed by dispersing the spent membrane in deionized water such that a suspension containing 0 04 mg ml of spent tio2 was obtained the surface charges on this suspension were then determined from zeta potential measurements using the phase analysis light scattering principle in nanobrook zetapals potential analyzer with a scattering angle of 15 changes to the chemical functionalities and elemental composition of the aerogel membrane due to filtration were assessed using fourier transform infrared ft ir raman and energy dispersive x ray edax spectroscopy ft ir spectroscopy was performed to study the possibility of formation of new functionalities on the aerogel membrane due to filtration bruker s vertex 80v ft ir spectrometer was used to observe the ft ir spectra at vacuum pressure 5 hpa ir attenuated total reflectance spectra analysis was carried out in the wave number range of 4 000 to 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 raman spectra of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes were also observed using alpha 300r confocal micro raman imaging spectrometer with led visible laser excitation source observed as a blue light at 532 nm under a backscattering geometry and diffraction limited lateral resolution of 200 300 nm samples of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes were placed on a horizontal glass slide and raman scattering spectroscopy was used to investigate the local molecular structure of the membranes possible changes to the elemental composition of the membrane surface due to filtration were investigated through edax spectroscopy edax spectroscopy was carried out using apollo x silicon drift detector in fei nova nanosem 650 at a working distance of 5 mm the regenerative ability of the aerogel membrane was also evaluated through chemical cleaning by rinsing samples of the spent membrane in an aqueous solution containing 3 wt citric acid and 1 wt sodium hypochlorite for 2 h the samples were then washed several times with deionized water and air dried all measurements were carried out at room temperature 21 1 c 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance of aerogel membrane and combined process embr reduced the concentration levels of pollutants in the raw wastewater to 18 300 cfu 100 ml tbc 476 μg l zn2 14 μg l cr6 13 μg l cd2 and 36 9 mg l cod these values are too high for wholesome or general reuse 19 an important attribute of the tio2 aerogel membrane was its ability to remove residual contaminants from the embr effluent the aerogel membrane reduced the residual contaminant levels in the embr effluent to 0 cfu 100 ml tbc 69 μg l zn2 10 μg l cr6 10 μg l cd2 and 19 mg l cod an improvement in the pollutant removal efficiencies of the combined process was observed compared to the single process of embr this improvement is shown in table 1 100 bacteria 97 8 cod 96 9 zn2 99 3 cr6 and 84 1 cd2 were removed by the combined process compared to 99 5 bacteria 95 8 cod and 78 8 zn2 99 0 cr6 and 79 4 cd2 removal by embr only the embr effluent quality is only applicable for restricted reuse involving landscaping and forestry irrigation 19 however the post treatment of the embr effluent with tio2 aerogel membrane provides the opportunity to reuse the final effluent for advanced applications such as agricultural irrigation and industrial process heating cooling the removal of residual contaminants in the embr effluent by the aerogel membrane was ensured by its electrostatic and photoactive capabilities and porous network the aerogel membrane acted as a platform for the alkaline hydrolysis heavy metal ions the aerogel surface is acidic and through its oxidizing top layer the heavy metal ions in the embr effluent were chemically oxidized to their insoluble hydroxide forms these insoluble hydroxides were then collected as precipitate on the membrane 20 21 this mechanism is illustrated in fig 2 so in addition to the rejection via size exclusion offered by the nanosized pores of the membranes the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged active sites of the membranes and positively charged metal ions also contributed to the removal of these ions the removal efficiencies of the membrane for heavy metal ions followed the order zn2 cr6 cd2 compared to other heavy metal ions more zn2 ions were removed by the aerogel membrane because there were more zn2 ions in the embr effluent to saturate the binding sites of the membrane 22 zn2 ion exhibited affinity for adsorption to the multiple coordinated sites at the water tio2 interface 23 in general cd2 was precipitated as cd oh 3 while zn2 was precipitated as zn oh 3 24 for bacteria removal the aerogel membrane was able to increase the removal efficiency of residual tbc to 100 due to the excitation of valence electrons that generated electron hole pairs on the aerogel surface for photo activity 25 the nanowire morphology promoted the motion of these pairs 26 in such a way that the kinetics of photodegradation were enhanced 27 the aerogel membrane also increased the removal efficiency from 95 8 for embr to 97 8 for the combined process due to the same reasons the improved retention and degradation of residual organic matter by the aerogel membrane was confirmed from zeta potential measurements it was observed that the surface of the spent aerogel was negatively charged with a conductance of 270 μs due to its photo active sites consequently the zeta potential of the spent aerogel membrane surface was 29 76 mv the zeta potential of tio2 should extend up to 40 mv the measured zeta potential was lower than the expected optimum value due to the surface conductance of tio2 in the surrounding medium water the conductivity of tio2 altered the shape of the potential distribution of the applied field in the liquid modified the motion of water within the electrical double layer and therefore changed the stresses exerted on the particle by water consequently this conductivity led to the mutual distortion of the applied field and the field of the double layer and hence slowed the electrophoretic motion these findings have also been reported in a previous study 28 it was also observed that aside from its electrostatic and photocatalytic capabilities the removal of residual ions by the aerogel membrane was due to its porous structure and hydrophilicity the aerogel membrane showed highly porous network that consisted of interlinked nws having average diameter of 50 nm the diameter 50 nm was measured from fesem the porous structure existed as nanoporous channels as shown in the sem images in fig 3 a and aided the retention of organic pollutants by size exclusion the retention of organics on the aerogel membrane surface further improved their exposure to photo activity the mean pore size of the aerogel membrane was measured from cfp as 90 nm while membrane porosity was estimated as 90 the repulsion of contaminants by the aerogel membrane was also related to its super hydrophilicity as shown in the drop shapes in fig 3 b the aerogel membrane exhibited complete wetting with receding contact angle of 0 the receding contact angle of the membrane became 0 at just 1 s after contact with water this super hydrophilicity contributed to its exceedingly high permeability the aerogel membrane showed water permeability of 850 lmh bar this value is higher than those of commercial polymeric membranes as shown in fig 3 c the range of water permeability of commercial polymeric membranes from dow water process solutions is 1 14 lmh bar 29 this 14 fold difference in water permeability is covered by two polyamide types with small changes in composition the aromatic ft30 membrane and the aliphatic aromatic nanofiltration membrane the latter type is sometimes referred to as polypiperazine membrane the ft30 membrane is an aromatic membrane made from 1 3 phenylene diamine and the tri acid chloride of benzene 29 meanwhile ultrafiltration membranes with pore size range similar to that of the tio2 aerogel membrane have higher fluxes than the nanofiltration membranes in most practical applications these fluxes vary between 50 and 200 gfd 85 340 lmh at an operating pressure of about 50 psig 3 4 bar 30 the polymers used for the fabrication of these ultrafiltration membranes include polyethersulfone polyvinylidene fluoride and polyacrylonitrile the flux values reported for these commercial polymeric ultrafiltration membranes are however still lower than that of the tio2 aerogel membrane 3 2 applicability and reusability of aerogel membrane the spent membrane was observed to exhibit a slightly lower mean pore size fig 4 a and 4 b this observation might be due to the surface interactions of the membrane with residual contaminants during filtration the mean pore size of the pristine aerogel membrane decreased by 95 after filtration this decrease was insignificant and not enough to provide considerable alterations to the functional characteristics of the membrane as observed from xrd ft ir and raman spectroscopy fig 4 c 4 e the xrd patterns of the pristine and spent samples were analyzed in order to determine whether there are possible changes to the crystallinity of the aerogel membrane due to filtration fig 4 c the xrd pattern of the pristine aerogel membrane showed diffraction peaks at d spacings of 0 355 and 0 189 nm with 2θ angles of 25 and 48 respectively indicating that the crystalline structure was anatase tio2 the pristine membrane can be indexed to the tetragonal phase with lattice parameters a 3 804 å b 3 804 å and c 9 614 å for tio2 these values were close to the theoretical value reported in the literature confirming that there were no defects or collapse in the initial structure 31 from these xrd patterns it was also observed that the pristine aerogel membrane exhibited a single phase because no peaks showing impurities could be seen in the patterns the diffraction pattern of the spent aerogel membrane showed more intense peaks indicative of higher degree of crystallinity after filtration this means that the structural integrity of the nanowires was preserved during filtration ft ir analysis was carried out to study the possible change in the functionalities on the aerogel membrane surface due to filtration the ft ir spectra of the pristine and spent aerogel membranes are shown in fig 4 d the peaks in the ir spectrum of the pristine aerogel membrane observed at 455 810 and 976 cm 1 were due to the stretching vibration of ti o and the bending vibration of ti o ti 32 however the disappearance of the bending vibration of ti o ti corresponding to the peaks at 810 and 976 cm 1 was noticed in ir spectrum of the spent aerogel membrane new ir absorption peaks at 1074 and 3536 cm 1 were observed instead these new peaks can be ascribed to the bending vibration of carbonyl group co or hydrated organic functionality bonded to the spent membrane this carbonyl functionality might have resulted from the partially degraded organics adsorbed on the surface of the aerogel membrane 33 raman spectra showed the molecular fingerprints of the aerogel membrane raman spectroscopy is used to identify a specific molecule through the raman effect raman effect occurs when the energy of scattered light from a molecule is different from that of the incident monochromatic visible light thereby resulting in a distortion of the electron cloud or change in polarizability of the molecule similar peaks were observed for both pristine and spent aerogel membranes fig 4 e for the pristine membrane four sharp peaks were observed at bands 148 200 399 and 640 cm 1 whereas the raman spectra of the spent membrane showed main peaks at 148 200 396 and 648 cm 1 indicating only slight shifts this peak suggests that there are interstitial pores between the nws 34 as also observed in the sem scans the line shape of the raman spectra confirmed its nonstoichiometry i e its formation of electron hole pairs that were excited to the conduction band it is clear from ft ir analysis that chemisorption of organic pollutants onto the surface of the aerogel membrane i e organic membrane fouling occurred during filtration the physisorbed pollutants which were attracted to the aerogel membrane surface through electrostatic or van der waal interactions were washed away during physical cleaning however the presence of chemisorbed organics on the spent aerogel membrane surface was revealed by ft ir analysis edax analysis was also used to confirm whether some inorganic pollutants were chemically adsorbed to the membrane surface i e inorganic fouling from edax analysis table 2 it was observed that the surface of the spent membrane contained zn2 in addition to elemental composition of the pristine aerogel membrane therefore chemical cleaning of the aerogel membrane was carried out to remove these foulants the chemically cleaned membrane was retested for vacuum filtration and a flux recovery ratio of 0 9 was obtained 3 3 cost effectiveness of combined process in the conventional treatment of raw wastewater ro membrane is used to post treat the effluent from traditional cas mf uf or mbr followed by uv aop disinfection however ro gulps a comparatively high hydraulic pressure even for wastewater treatment wastewater ro gulps about 12 bar of pressure or more depending on the feed concentration therefore wastewater reuse is strongly dependent on the membrane technology employed the technology determines the environmental impact energy consumption and cost of water production for cas mf uf the cost of wastewater ro ranges from almost us 0 65 to us 1 25 m3 the cost of wastewater uf ranges from us 0 45 to us 0 75 m3 while that of mf ranges from us 0 3 0 7 m3 35 using inflation adjusted values these cost values will be higher the overall energy consumption of the conventional process is comparable to seawater ro energy requirement of about 3 5 kw h m3 36 therefore the overall cost of the treatment system is huge due to these multiple stages and the inflation adjusted cost could be higher for example singapore produces potable water from raw wastewater using the conventional cas mf uf ro uv aop and calls it newater newater is costly to produce because it requires multiple treatment stages including the mf uf and ro stages that increase the overall energy consumption as shown in table 3 newater tariff in singapore is sg 2 14 to 2 33 m3 us 1 54 to 1 68 m3 compared to sg 1 44 to 1 58 m3 for industrial process water produced from traditional activated sludge treatment 37 as a result an increase in newater production in the future means an increase in energy consumption for potable water production the cas mf uf ro uv aop process is referred to as conventional because it has also been used in other places aside singapore the process has been employed to treat wastewater at orange county and san diego in california usa 38 39 the process has been employed in australia whereby the final effluent is used for indirect potable reuse such as water supply to power plants in toowoomba queensland and perth western australia 39 in belgium the process has been used to produce recycled water in the torreele reuse plant wulpen in england mf and uv have been employed to produce recycled water that is discharged into the chelmer river for freshwater augmentation 39 the energy consumption of the combined process assessed in the study was estimated and compared with the conventional cas mf uf ro uv aop the specific energy consumption and cost of water production using embr were 0 87 kw h m3 and us 0 86 m3 respectively 9 the cost of fabricating the tio2 aerogel membrane was us 100 kg while the energy requirement for photo oxidation was 0 8 kw h ton the cost components of the combined embr tio2 aerogel membrane filtration process are shown in table 4 these cost values are applicable for the treatment of the raw wastewater considered in this study the concentrations of the pollutants in the raw wastewater treated by the combined process are stated again in table 4 from the pressure required for aerogel membrane filtration and the volume of water treated the specific energy consumption and cost of water production by aerogel membrane filtration were 0 2 kw h m3 and us 0 17 m3 respectively overall the cost of water production by the combined process was us 1 03 m3 this value is less than the cost of water production using the conventional process in addition energy requirement by the combined embr aerogel membrane filtration process is less indicating that this process is more environmentally friendly 4 conclusions embr was combined with anatase aerogel membrane for low cost efficient wastewater treatment the aerogel membrane was produced by one step hydrothermal synthesis at low cost and large scale the membrane was highly porous with 90 porosity superhydrophilic highly permeable with water permeability of 850 lmh bar and contained interconnected networks of nanowires with average pore size of 90 nm contaminant rejection analysis showed that the combined process was able to remove 100 bacteria 97 8 cod 96 9 zn2 99 3 cr6 and 84 1 cd2 from raw wastewater the aerogel membrane contributed to the overall removal efficiencies by removing residual heavy metal ions by surface charge interactions and residual organics and bacteria by size exclusion and photodegradation there were no considerable changes to the chemical properties of the aerogel membrane during filtration as confirmed from membrane characterization but fouling was observed chemical cleaning was effective for the regeneration of the aerogel membrane and 90 flux recovery was shown after chemical cleaning the cost of water production using the combined process was us 1 03 m3 which was less than the cost of water production using the conventional treatment the final effluent is suitable for advanced applications such as agricultural irrigation and industrial process heating cooling meanwhile long term experiments need to be carried out in further studies to assess the stability and mechanical strength of the aerogel membrane during long term filtration acknowledgement this work was funded by the cooperative agreement 02 mi mit cp 11 07633 gen g 00

14438,the performance of a membrane bioreactor treating oily wastewater generated by a petroleum refinery was investigated at mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations of 6 5 and 8 5 g l with hydraulic retention times ranging from 12 to 24 h an evolutionary polynomial regression technique and multi kinetic models consisting of the first order grau second order and modified stover kincannon were applied for predicting the performance of the bioreactor the results showed that a maximum chemical oxygen demand reduction of 97 is achievable at the mixed liquor suspended solids of 8 5 g l and hydraulic retention time of 24 h the results also revealed positive influence of higher mixed liquor suspended solids and hydraulic retention time values on the bioreactor performance in addition the high accuracy of the evolutionary polynomial regression evidenced its capability in investigating the membrane bioreactor based on the analysis performed by the resulted model from the evolutionary polynomial regression the optimum operating conditions hydraulic retention time of 21 h mixed liquor suspended solids of 8 2 g l were recommended according to the kinetic evaluation the grau second order and modified stover kincannon kinetics seemed to be the best approach in describing the chemical oxygen demand reduction in the membrane bioreactor keywords evolutionary polynomial regression optimization hydraulic retention time mixed liquor suspended solids 1 introduction petroleum refineries generate a large amount of wastewater that commonly consists of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons inorganic compounds and heavy metals as well as dissolved and suspended solids 1 2 in general the average rate of water consumption and wastewater generation in a petroleum refinery are 65 90 gallons per barrel of crude and around 0 4 1 6 times the volume of processed crude oil respectively 3 4 the high rate of wastewater generation stringent environmental regulations and the scarcities in freshwater supplies emphasize the importance of water reuse and recycling in petroleum refineries and have led to the demand for efficient wastewater treatment technologies 3 as a whole the majority of petroleum refinery wastewater prw treatment plants are designed for primary and secondary treatment purposes the prw is treated primarily with a combination of physical and physicochemical separation processes in which the oil is separated and recovered in general the activated sludge process is commonly used as a secondary treatment for the removal of remained emulsified or dissolved oils and organic compounds 5 6 recently membrane bioreactors mbr have been considered as an advanced method for treating prw 7 8 even though the first mbr was developed by the dorr oliver company in the late 1960s to treat shipboard sewage these bioreactors have experienced booming development during the past few decades 9 the mbr system is a promising technology that provides benefits over conventional activated sludge derivatives and has been applied to treat a wide range of wastewaters 4 7 several studies have evaluated the performance of mbrs in the case of treating urban and industrial wastewaters 4 10 11 the first application of mbr was in prw treatment by rahman and al malack 7 they assessed the performance of a cross flow mbr equipped with tubular ceramic membranes torres et al 12 also conducted a comparative study to evaluate submerged mbrs operating with a polymeric flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes moreover shariati et al 6 used membrane sequencing batch reactors operated at hydraulic retention times hrt of 8 h 24 h to treat synthetic prw most recent study evaluated the integration of direct photolysis uv and photolysis assisted by hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 into a membrane bioreactor treating prw 4 the performance of mbr processes is affected by a variety of environmental and operating factors 7 the organic loading rate olr and its associated element hrt are important parameters for the design and operation of biological reactors 13 the hrt is an important parameter that has a significant impact on system design cost and process efficiency the operation of a treatment system at low hrts high olrs requires lower reactor volumes to achieve a specified removal efficiency yet higher hrts usually result in better removal performance 14 15 membrane fouling is a major obstacle facing the mbr technology 16 moreover the presence of recalcitrant organics in industrial wastewaters generates some challenges to the mbrs and

mbr performance under various operating conditions was studied to assess its stability and capability of removing cod during the experiments actual prw with significant fluctuations in cod concentrations was fed into the reactor the effects of hrt and mlss concentrations on the cod reduction are shown in fig 2 the experiments were conducted in 6 stages at four hrts and two mlss values the lowest cod removal rates at each stage are presented in fig 2 taking into account that treating industrial wastewaters normally requires hrt values of 10 5 389 h 38 determining the shortest hrt in the mbr is a key issue however local or international effluent discharge standards should be considered as criteria in selecting hrt according to the iranian water pollution prevention regulations the permissible levels of cod in treated effluent are 60 and 200 mg l for discharge into surface water and use for irrigation purposes respectively 39 during the first four stages of the experiments the mlss concentration was kept at 8 5 g l the influent cod at the first stage hrt of 24 h ranged from 270 to 590 mg l the effluent cod was between 10 and 36 mg l and cod removal efficiency was 94 to 97 in the second stage hrt of 16 h even though the influent cod was between 195 and 390 mg l the removal efficiency decreased to 91 to 92 however the effluent cod ranged between 18 and 32 mg l when hrt was 14 h stage 3 the cod removal efficiency decreased and the effluent cod reached 35 to 70 mg l this result indicated that in wastewater with a cod of higher than 455 mg l the bioreactor failed in treating wastewater efficiently and reducing the effluent cod levels to below the discharge standard of 60 mg l the lowest cod removal efficiency of 74 occurred at stage 4 hrt of 12 h in which the effluent cod ranged between 90 and 122 mg l and was always higher than the standard for discharge into surface water the mlss concentration was kept at 6 5 g l in stages 5 and 6 the fifth stage was conducted with an hrt of 24 h and the inlet cod ranged from 198 to 336 mg l the effluent cod was between 30 to 50 mg l indicating a cod removal efficiency of 84 to 85 when the hrt was reduced to 16 h a slight decline occurred in the cod removal efficiency 77 to 78 and the effluent cod ranged between 90 to 115 mg l which exceeded the standard discharge limit overall as seen in fig 2 a significant reduction in cod removal efficiency occurred when hrt and mlss concentrations decreased razavi and miri 8 studied the influence of hrt on hollow fiber membrane bioreactor efficiency they reported that the cod removal rate decreased from 81 to 78 by reducing the hrt from 36 h to 25 h a similar decline in cod removal efficiency from 82 to 77 when the hrt was reduced from 36 h to 25 h was also reported for an aerated submerged membrane bioreactor treating high strength acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs wastewater 40 in the study by ren et al 38 the effects of hrt 3 2 5 and 8 h were evaluated in treating high strength organic wastewater with an mbr in their experiments the influence of hrt was clearly observed for an hrt of 3 2 h the effluent cod decreased and exceeded the local standard discharge value of 100 mg l the positive influence of higher mlss concentrations on cod removal efficiency and their negative influence on membrane fouling have been reported in previous studies 41 43 according to the study conducted by rosenberger et al 44 membrane fouling was negligible for mlss concentrations up to 6 5 g l however an abrupt increase was observed when the mlss concentration was higher than 15 g l they suggested the range of 8 to 12 g l for the operation of the mbr for treating municipal wastewater as can be observed in fig 2 the cod removal efficiency decreased from 94 to 84 and 91 to 77 for hrts of 24 and 16 h respectively when the mlss concentration was reduced from 8 5 to 6 5 g l overall with the aim of attaining the effluent discharge standard of 60 mg l in a cost and time effective manner it can be suggested that the studied bioreactor be operated at an mlss concentration of 8 5 g l and an hrt of 14 h 3 2 prediction of mbr performance by epr the parameter settings for the epr are reported in table 4 in addition eq 11 shows the model obtained from the epr tool in order to predict the effluent cod concentration the output of the epr usually shows different complexities of the expressions and accuracy i e in terms of cod and mean square error mse although it is expected that the prediction accuracy of such models will increase as a result of the mathematical complexity increment those models with a complex structure can cause over fitting rather than capturing the main phenomenon 30 thus the feature of the epr that provides the possibility of attaining more than one model for a complex phenomenon allows the user to check the accuracy of the models by comparing their trends 45 the cod and mse criteria in this study were 0 91 and 109 respectively cod values between 0 85 and 0 90 were reported in the study conducted by kordkandi and berardi 30 for predicting the cod removal efficiency of a submerged biofilm reactor creaco et al 32 also delineated a cod of 0 88 in modeling storm water quality in addition abtahi et al 45 stated that application of epr in various engineering disciplines have led to cod values up to 0 98 11 c o d o u t 0 60811 c o d i n 0 012624 c o d i n m l s s h r t 0 5 19 5405 fig 3 shows a comparison between the values predicted by the regression model eq 11 and the experimental data as shown in this figure the high correlation coefficient r2 0 95 of first model implies that the epr technique has promising potential to predict the performance of such systems in this study the traditional and widely used one factor at a time approach was employed to investigate the effects of influent cod hrt and mlss on the removal efficiency and effluent cod concentrations for determining the optimum conditions in treating prw with a high cod concentration in this approach one factor is changed gradually from a low to a high value at one time while the other factors are kept fixed for this purpose when the influent cod was increased from 195 to 590 mg l in six steps the hrt and mlss were kept at their lowest values of 12 h and 6 5 g l respectively accordingly this technique was used to investigate the sensitivity of the effluent cod to hrt and mlss the hrt and mlss ranged between 12 to 24 h and 6 5 to 8 5 g l respectively the results indicated that increasing the influent cod had the greatest influence on the effluent cod due to the increment of influent cod from 195 to 590 mg l the effluent cod was increased from 44 to 172 mg l when the mlss concentration was changed in the range of 6 5 to 8 5 g l the effluent cod decreased from 44 to 27 mg l the investigation of increasing hrt from 12 to 24 h also showed that the effluent cod decreased from 44 to 21 mg l to determine the optimum conditions for treating prw with a cod of 590 mg l the highest influent cod in the current study and satisfy the discharge standards different scenarios were analyzed fig 4 shows the effects of changing hrt and mlss on the effluent cod concentration although based on the figure the lowest effluent cod can be obtained at an hrt of 24 h and mlss of 8 5 g l and this configuration is neither time nor cost effective to reduce the effluent cod to a value lower than the discharge standard of 60 mg l the best option when the influent cod is up to 590 mg l would be to operate the bioreactor at an hrt of 21 h and mlss of 8 2 g l 3 3 substrate removal kinetics 3 3 1 first order substrate removal model fig 5 shows the correlation between the substrate concentration se and s0 se hrt based on eq 5 the value of k1 was determined from the slope of the graph as 1 26 per day as compared with the other studies listed in table 5 the k1 in this study was within the range of constant values reported in previous studies however the low value of the correlation coefficient 0 63 obviously indicates that the first order substrate removal model cannot be applied with a good degree of precision the unsuitability of this model for an mbr treating polluted surface water 46 and an upflow aerobic immobilized biomass reactor treating sugar manufacturing wastewater 47 has been reported however the k1 value obtained in this study was higher than the ratio of 0 7 per day 46 for simulated polluted water and smaller than 92 6 per day for municipal wastewater 22 and 14 6 per day for sugar manufacturing wastewater 47 the smaller k1 value in this study was indicator of lower biodegradability of prw in comparison with mentioned wastewaters 3 3 2 grau second order model the grau second order model was also used in this study to evaluate the rate of the biodegradation process occurring in the mbr in order to determine the kinetic coefficients eq 8 was plotted in fig 6 the obtained equation with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 corroborated that this model fitted the experimental data adequately the values of b and a were calculated from the slope and intercept of the straight line on the graph therefore the effluent cod concentration can be predicted by eq 12 12 s e s 0 1 h r t 0 152 0 945 h r t the grau second order model coefficients reported in previous studies are in a wide range table 5 which is attributed to different factors like wastewater characteristics applied organic loading rates and type of reactor 48 49 for instance influent substrate concentration and mlss concentration are the main factors affecting the coefficient a 23 the substrate removal rate constant k2 depends on the biomass concentration and influent substrate concentration such that higher substrate removal efficiencies lead to higher k2 values 50 the k2 value calculated from the equation a s0 k2x ranged from 0 163 to 0 498 per day the obtained values in this study were within the range of k2 values reported in previous studies 22 48 3 3 3 modified stover kincannon model based on the stover kincannon model the substrate utilization rate is a function of the organic loading rate which is delineated in fig 7 the high correlation coefficient of 0 98 indicated the applicability of the model in describing cod removal the kinetic constants were calculated from the graph plotted between v qs0 and v q s0 se the kinetic constants of u max and kb were calculated as 6 41 and 6 88 g l d respectively so effluent cod concentrations can be predicted by eq 13 13 s e s 0 6 41 s 0 6 88 q s 0 v according to table 5 the values obtained for kb and u max were between the values found by ahmadi et al 51 and kordkandi and berardi 30 were about 4 times smaller than those reported by abyar et al 23 the high values of kb and u max could be mainly due to the presence of biodegradable components in the substrate 23 the close values of obtained u max and kb in this study demonstrate that by increasing organic loading rates the substrate removal efficiency will decrease 52 also according to işik and sponza 53 grau second order model transfers to stover kincannon model when u max is equal to kb in general higher u max and kb indicates biodegradability of the wastewaters while lower values have been obtained in the treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant and complex components 48 for example relatively higher u max 56 5 g l d and kb 58 2 g l d values obtained in treating municipal wastewater 22 indicated that municipal wastewater is more biodegradable than the prw investigated in this study 4 conclusions in this study the performance of a lab scale mbr in treating actual petroleum refinery wastewater was evaluated by changing the hrt and mlss concentrations three kinetic models and the epr technique were applied to predict the effluent cod throughout the study the influent cod ranged from 195 to 590 mg l and the effluent cod was between 10 and 122 mg l the maximum obtained cod removal efficiency was 97 at an hrt of 24 h and mlss concentration of 8 5 g l when the influent cod was 310 mg l the minimum removal efficiency was observed at an hrt of 12 h and mlss concentration of 8 5 g l the accuracy of the model obtained from the epr in terms of coefficient of determination revealed the applicability of this technique to mbr systems and the optimization of operating conditions investigating the performance of the bioreactor based on the model resulted from the epr revealed that in the studied interval of parameters the hrt had the greatest influence on the cod removal efficiency moreover the operation of the bioreactor at an hrt of 21 h and mlss concentration of 8 2 g l is suggested for the treatment of prw with a high concentration of cod from the applied kinetic models the grau second order and modified stover kincannon were found to be more suitable than the first order model for predicting the performance of the bioreactor therefore grau second order and modified stover kincannon models could be utlized in the design of membrane bioreactors in addition the modeling results can be used for scaling up and optimization of mbrs and provide a useful background for future studies and prepare a certain framework for better controlling and monitoring the system conflicts of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this manuscript acknowledgments the authors would like to express their gratitude to the water and wastewater company of east azerbaijan province for their support and providing the laboratory space to set up the reactor 
14438,the performance of a membrane bioreactor treating oily wastewater generated by a petroleum refinery was investigated at mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations of 6 5 and 8 5 g l with hydraulic retention times ranging from 12 to 24 h an evolutionary polynomial regression technique and multi kinetic models consisting of the first order grau second order and modified stover kincannon were applied for predicting the performance of the bioreactor the results showed that a maximum chemical oxygen demand reduction of 97 is achievable at the mixed liquor suspended solids of 8 5 g l and hydraulic retention time of 24 h the results also revealed positive influence of higher mixed liquor suspended solids and hydraulic retention time values on the bioreactor performance in addition the high accuracy of the evolutionary polynomial regression evidenced its capability in investigating the membrane bioreactor based on the analysis performed by the resulted model from the evolutionary polynomial regression the optimum operating conditions hydraulic retention time of 21 h mixed liquor suspended solids of 8 2 g l were recommended according to the kinetic evaluation the grau second order and modified stover kincannon kinetics seemed to be the best approach in describing the chemical oxygen demand reduction in the membrane bioreactor keywords evolutionary polynomial regression optimization hydraulic retention time mixed liquor suspended solids 1 introduction petroleum refineries generate a large amount of wastewater that commonly consists of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons inorganic compounds and heavy metals as well as dissolved and suspended solids 1 2 in general the average rate of water consumption and wastewater generation in a petroleum refinery are 65 90 gallons per barrel of crude and around 0 4 1 6 times the volume of processed crude oil respectively 3 4 the high rate of wastewater generation stringent environmental regulations and the scarcities in freshwater supplies emphasize the importance of water reuse and recycling in petroleum refineries and have led to the demand for efficient wastewater treatment technologies 3 as a whole the majority of petroleum refinery wastewater prw treatment plants are designed for primary and secondary treatment purposes the prw is treated primarily with a combination of physical and physicochemical separation processes in which the oil is separated and recovered in general the activated sludge process is commonly used as a secondary treatment for the removal of remained emulsified or dissolved oils and organic compounds 5 6 recently membrane bioreactors mbr have been considered as an advanced method for treating prw 7 8 even though the first mbr was developed by the dorr oliver company in the late 1960s to treat shipboard sewage these bioreactors have experienced booming development during the past few decades 9 the mbr system is a promising technology that provides benefits over conventional activated sludge derivatives and has been applied to treat a wide range of wastewaters 4 7 several studies have evaluated the performance of mbrs in the case of treating urban and industrial wastewaters 4 10 11 the first application of mbr was in prw treatment by rahman and al malack 7 they assessed the performance of a cross flow mbr equipped with tubular ceramic membranes torres et al 12 also conducted a comparative study to evaluate submerged mbrs operating with a polymeric flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes moreover shariati et al 6 used membrane sequencing batch reactors operated at hydraulic retention times hrt of 8 h 24 h to treat synthetic prw most recent study evaluated the integration of direct photolysis uv and photolysis assisted by hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 into a membrane bioreactor treating prw 4 the performance of mbr processes is affected by a variety of environmental and operating factors 7 the organic loading rate olr and its associated element hrt are important parameters for the design and operation of biological reactors 13 the hrt is an important parameter that has a significant impact on system design cost and process efficiency the operation of a treatment system at low hrts high olrs requires lower reactor volumes to achieve a specified removal efficiency yet higher hrts usually result in better removal performance 14 15 membrane fouling is a major obstacle facing the mbr technology 16 moreover the presence of recalcitrant organics in industrial wastewaters generates some challenges to the mbrs and highlights the relevance of hrt on bioreactor performance and the extent of membrane fouling 6 17 the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss is another key operational parameter for this technology which significantly influences membrane fouling and filtration resistance 18 although high mlss concentrations in the bioreactor contribute to the increment of fouling rate they also cause longer sludge retention time srt and lower f m thus it is essential to find an optimum point for the process at which operational costs are minimized membrane materials are another essential parameter

mlss concentration was kept at 8 5 g l the influent cod at the first stage hrt of 24 h ranged from 270 to 590 mg l the effluent cod was between 10 and 36 mg l and cod removal efficiency was 94 to 97 in the second stage hrt of 16 h even though the influent cod was between 195 and 390 mg l the removal efficiency decreased to 91 to 92 however the effluent cod ranged between 18 and 32 mg l when hrt was 14 h stage 3 the cod removal efficiency decreased and the effluent cod reached 35 to 70 mg l this result indicated that in wastewater with a cod of higher than 455 mg l the bioreactor failed in treating wastewater efficiently and reducing the effluent cod levels to below the discharge standard of 60 mg l the lowest cod removal efficiency of 74 occurred at stage 4 hrt of 12 h in which the effluent cod ranged between 90 and 122 mg l and was always higher than the standard for discharge into surface water the mlss concentration was kept at 6 5 g l in stages 5 and 6 the fifth stage was conducted with an hrt of 24 h and the inlet cod ranged from 198 to 336 mg l the effluent cod was between 30 to 50 mg l indicating a cod removal efficiency of 84 to 85 when the hrt was reduced to 16 h a slight decline occurred in the cod removal efficiency 77 to 78 and the effluent cod ranged between 90 to 115 mg l which exceeded the standard discharge limit overall as seen in fig 2 a significant reduction in cod removal efficiency occurred when hrt and mlss concentrations decreased razavi and miri 8 studied the influence of hrt on hollow fiber membrane bioreactor efficiency they reported that the cod removal rate decreased from 81 to 78 by reducing the hrt from 36 h to 25 h a similar decline in cod removal efficiency from 82 to 77 when the hrt was reduced from 36 h to 25 h was also reported for an aerated submerged membrane bioreactor treating high strength acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs wastewater 40 in the study by ren et al 38 the effects of hrt 3 2 5 and 8 h were evaluated in treating high strength organic wastewater with an mbr in their experiments the influence of hrt was clearly observed for an hrt of 3 2 h the effluent cod decreased and exceeded the local standard discharge value of 100 mg l the positive influence of higher mlss concentrations on cod removal efficiency and their negative influence on membrane fouling have been reported in previous studies 41 43 according to the study conducted by rosenberger et al 44 membrane fouling was negligible for mlss concentrations up to 6 5 g l however an abrupt increase was observed when the mlss concentration was higher than 15 g l they suggested the range of 8 to 12 g l for the operation of the mbr for treating municipal wastewater as can be observed in fig 2 the cod removal efficiency decreased from 94 to 84 and 91 to 77 for hrts of 24 and 16 h respectively when the mlss concentration was reduced from 8 5 to 6 5 g l overall with the aim of attaining the effluent discharge standard of 60 mg l in a cost and time effective manner it can be suggested that the studied bioreactor be operated at an mlss concentration of 8 5 g l and an hrt of 14 h 3 2 prediction of mbr performance by epr the parameter settings for the epr are reported in table 4 in addition eq 11 shows the model obtained from the epr tool in order to predict the effluent cod concentration the output of the epr usually shows different complexities of the expressions and accuracy i e in terms of cod and mean square error mse although it is expected that the prediction accuracy of such models will increase as a result of the mathematical complexity increment those models with a complex structure can cause over fitting rather than capturing the main phenomenon 30 thus the feature of the epr that provides the possibility of attaining more than one model for a complex phenomenon allows the user to check the accuracy of the models by comparing their trends 45 the cod and mse criteria in this study were 0 91 and 109 respectively cod values between 0 85 and 0 90 were reported in the study conducted by kordkandi and berardi 30 for predicting the cod removal efficiency of a submerged biofilm reactor creaco et al 32 also delineated a cod of 0 88 in modeling storm water quality in addition abtahi et al 45 stated that application of epr in various engineering disciplines have led to cod values up to 0 98 11 c o d o u t 0 60811 c o d i n 0 012624 c o d i n m l s s h r t 0 5 19 5405 fig 3 shows a comparison between the values predicted by the regression model eq 11 and the experimental data as shown in this figure the high correlation coefficient r2 0 95 of first model implies that the epr technique has promising potential to predict the performance of such systems in this study the traditional and widely used one factor at a time approach was employed to investigate the effects of influent cod hrt and mlss on the removal efficiency and effluent cod concentrations for determining the optimum conditions in treating prw with a high cod concentration in this approach one factor is changed gradually from a low to a high value at one time while the other factors are kept fixed for this purpose when the influent cod was increased from 195 to 590 mg l in six steps the hrt and mlss were kept at their lowest values of 12 h and 6 5 g l respectively accordingly this technique was used to investigate the sensitivity of the effluent cod to hrt and mlss the hrt and mlss ranged between 12 to 24 h and 6 5 to 8 5 g l respectively the results indicated that increasing the influent cod had the greatest influence on the effluent cod due to the increment of influent cod from 195 to 590 mg l the effluent cod was increased from 44 to 172 mg l when the mlss concentration was changed in the range of 6 5 to 8 5 g l the effluent cod decreased from 44 to 27 mg l the investigation of increasing hrt from 12 to 24 h also showed that the effluent cod decreased from 44 to 21 mg l to determine the optimum conditions for treating prw with a cod of 590 mg l the highest influent cod in the current study and satisfy the discharge standards different scenarios were analyzed fig 4 shows the effects of changing hrt and mlss on the effluent cod concentration although based on the figure the lowest effluent cod can be obtained at an hrt of 24 h and mlss of 8 5 g l and this configuration is neither time nor cost effective to reduce the effluent cod to a value lower than the discharge standard of 60 mg l the best option when the influent cod is up to 590 mg l would be to operate the bioreactor at an hrt of 21 h and mlss of 8 2 g l 3 3 substrate removal kinetics 3 3 1 first order substrate removal model fig 5 shows the correlation between the substrate concentration se and s0 se hrt based on eq 5 the value of k1 was determined from the slope of the graph as 1 26 per day as compared with the other studies listed in table 5 the k1 in this study was within the range of constant values reported in previous studies however the low value of the correlation coefficient 0 63 obviously indicates that the first order substrate removal model cannot be applied with a good degree of precision the unsuitability of this model for an mbr treating polluted surface water 46 and an upflow aerobic immobilized biomass reactor treating sugar manufacturing wastewater 47 has been reported however the k1 value obtained in this study was higher than the ratio of 0 7 per day 46 for simulated polluted water and smaller than 92 6 per day for municipal wastewater 22 and 14 6 per day for sugar manufacturing wastewater 47 the smaller k1 value in this study was indicator of lower biodegradability of prw in comparison with mentioned wastewaters 3 3 2 grau second order model the grau second order model was also used in this study to evaluate the rate of the biodegradation process occurring in the mbr in order to determine the kinetic coefficients eq 8 was plotted in fig 6 the obtained equation with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 corroborated that this model fitted the experimental data adequately the values of b and a were calculated from the slope and intercept of the straight line on the graph therefore the effluent cod concentration can be predicted by eq 12 12 s e s 0 1 h r t 0 152 0 945 h r t the grau second order model coefficients reported in previous studies are in a wide range table 5 which is attributed to different factors like wastewater characteristics applied organic loading rates and type of reactor 48 49 for instance influent substrate concentration and mlss concentration are the main factors affecting the coefficient a 23 the substrate removal rate constant k2 depends on the biomass concentration and influent substrate concentration such that higher substrate removal efficiencies lead to higher k2 values 50 the k2 value calculated from the equation a s0 k2x ranged from 0 163 to 0 498 per day the obtained values in this study were within the range of k2 values reported in previous studies 22 48 3 3 3 modified stover kincannon model based on the stover kincannon model the substrate utilization rate is a function of the organic loading rate which is delineated in fig 7 the high correlation coefficient of 0 98 indicated the applicability of the model in describing cod removal the kinetic constants were calculated from the graph plotted between v qs0 and v q s0 se the kinetic constants of u max and kb were calculated as 6 41 and 6 88 g l d respectively so effluent cod concentrations can be predicted by eq 13 13 s e s 0 6 41 s 0 6 88 q s 0 v according to table 5 the values obtained for kb and u max were between the values found by ahmadi et al 51 and kordkandi and berardi 30 were about 4 times smaller than those reported by abyar et al 23 the high values of kb and u max could be mainly due to the presence of biodegradable components in the substrate 23 the close values of obtained u max and kb in this study demonstrate that by increasing organic loading rates the substrate removal efficiency will decrease 52 also according to işik and sponza 53 grau second order model transfers to stover kincannon model when u max is equal to kb in general higher u max and kb indicates biodegradability of the wastewaters while lower values have been obtained in the treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant and complex components 48 for example relatively higher u max 56 5 g l d and kb 58 2 g l d values obtained in treating municipal wastewater 22 indicated that municipal wastewater is more biodegradable than the prw investigated in this study 4 conclusions in this study the performance of a lab scale mbr in treating actual petroleum refinery wastewater was evaluated by changing the hrt and mlss concentrations three kinetic models and the epr technique were applied to predict the effluent cod throughout the study the influent cod ranged from 195 to 590 mg l and the effluent cod was between 10 and 122 mg l the maximum obtained cod removal efficiency was 97 at an hrt of 24 h and mlss concentration of 8 5 g l when the influent cod was 310 mg l the minimum removal efficiency was observed at an hrt of 12 h and mlss concentration of 8 5 g l the accuracy of the model obtained from the epr in terms of coefficient of determination revealed the applicability of this technique to mbr systems and the optimization of operating conditions investigating the performance of the bioreactor based on the model resulted from the epr revealed that in the studied interval of parameters the hrt had the greatest influence on the cod removal efficiency moreover the operation of the bioreactor at an hrt of 21 h and mlss concentration of 8 2 g l is suggested for the treatment of prw with a high concentration of cod from the applied kinetic models the grau second order and modified stover kincannon were found to be more suitable than the first order model for predicting the performance of the bioreactor therefore grau second order and modified stover kincannon models could be utlized in the design of membrane bioreactors in addition the modeling results can be used for scaling up and optimization of mbrs and provide a useful background for future studies and prepare a certain framework for better controlling and monitoring the system conflicts of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this manuscript acknowledgments the authors would like to express their gratitude to the water and wastewater company of east azerbaijan province for their support and providing the laboratory space to set up the reactor 
14439,synthetic polymers mostly polyacrylamides pams are frequently used in the water industry to improve the performance of clarification however synthetic polymers may increase headloss in granular media filters biodegrade slowly and are potentially toxic alternatively bio sourced starch based polymers may eliminate the drawbacks of synthetic flocculants similarly to poly acrylamide co acrylic acid carboxymethylated starch is expected to adsorb on metal hydroxides via hydrogen bonding on carboxyl groups however it is already known that starch like many other polysaccharide flocculants is required in higher dosages for its performance to be comparable to pam this study identified the conditions favorable to the use of an activated starch polymer as an alternative to pam during

conventional clarification 1 2 ballasted flocculation 3 4 upflow sludge blanket clarifiers 5 and sludge dewatering 6 however synthetic polymers may increase headloss in granular media filters 7 8 these phenomena result from the presence of unsettled microflocs that contain high molecular weight polymer chains for over twenty five years many polysaccharide based polymers were suggested as being economical efficient and eco friendly flocculants including corn or potato starch guar gum cellulose sodium alginate and tannin 9 10 11 moreover bio sourced polymers may eliminate some of the drawbacks associated with synthetic polymers frequently used in the water industry 1 the risk related to the presence of residual toxic monomers of acrylamide from pam 12 14 2 the formation of oxidation by products from the interactions between monomers and polymers and impurities in the manufactured products and various oxidants 15 3 the low biodegradability of synthetic petroleum based polymers 16 and 4 the ecotoxicity of many cationic polyelectrolytes 17 as a consequence many countries particularly in europe have forbidden or restricted the use of synthetic polyelectrolytes such as pam for drinking water applications 18 19 in the case of pam maximal dosages are governed by american and european standards that allow a maximal acrylamide monomer concentration of 0 5 μg l nsf ansi 60 and 0 1 μg l en 1407 in treated water respectively therefore maximal dosages are product specific as they depend on the purity of the commercial pam due to the aforementioned constraints there is a growing interest in eliminating or drastically reducing the use of synthetic polyelectrolytes although polysaccharides based flocculants have been recognized to offer fairly good flocculation performance 9 the dosages required for starch 20 or chitosan 16 were higher than for pam in ballasted flocculation applications the required starch dosages were also shown to be higher in comparison to synthetic pam polymers 3 5 times higher 3 21 2 10 times higher 22 10 times higher for a relatively high turbidity of 21 ntu at ph 7 0 and more than 60 times for a 81 ntu wastewater at ph 8 4 23 starch based polymers chains are shorter and have a more branched structure compared to the linear pam configuration which reduces their ability to aggregate particles via interparticle bridging additionally flocs produced with activated starch polymers are more fragile and more sensitive to shearing compared to flocs produced with pam 3 consequently starch polymers are more efficient when smaller ballast media bm are used due to the lower mixing intensity required to keep them in suspension 3 25 nevertheless there is an interest in identifying alternative polymers to pam that are able to improve solid settling and retention in the filter media while simultaneously limiting headloss in the granular media filters considering the studies mentioned above polysaccharides based flocculants might not be an appropriate alternative to pam however it is expected that carboxymethylated starch with a finely selected charge density and with optimal mixing conditions could offer a sufficient turbidity removal to replace conventional pam e g starch dosage lower than 1 mg l to reach a settled water turbidity lower than 1 ntu no study ever attempted to physicochemically and hydraulically improve the performance of starch during flocculation the general objective of this study was to identify all of the conditions favorable to the use of an activated starch polymer as an alternative to pam during ballasted flocculation it is known that activated starch flocculation benefits from a lower shear mixing to reduce floc breakage as mixing conditions during ballasted flocculation are intimately linked with the bm characteristics size and density we investigated the interdependence of these two factors with regard to ballasted flocculation and settling performance more specifically assays were conducted under variable mixing conditions using various bm sizes and chemical compositions i e the different oxide groups at the bm surface the influence of coagulation ph flocculation time and polymer charge density was also investigated assays with pam were always performed as a reference condition hence this study hypothesized that starch dosages under such optimal mixing conditions could be notably lowered without impacting turbidity to compare flocculation performance with both polymers jar tests and microscopic flocs analysis were used to monitor floc size and the rate of aggregation turbidity measurements were also assessed to confirm the settling performance before and after the flocculation optimization 2 material and methods 2 1 waters

with six square b kers jars of 2 l with each possessing a sampling port located 10 cm from the top the bm was entirely injected at the onset of flocculation i e after the 2 min flash mix flocculation times varying from 10 s to 8 min were tested 4 28 the flocculant dosage was equally divided into 50 at the onset of flocculation and 50 at mid flocculation this injection sequence is typically used to improve floc size at the end of flocculation since it allows for floc regrowth at mid flocculation turbidity measurements were assessed on settled waters after 180 s of settling the range of g tested

polymers 106 in terms of molecular structure starch based polymers are known to adopt a ramified structure 29 in contrast acrylamide monomers are typically polymerized as linear structures the charge densities were obtained by colloid titration values from the manufacturer both polymers were subjected to comparative jar tests to determine their capacity to form ballasted floc and remove turbidity among the critical factors for the coagulation flocculation process the following were separately tested ph coagulant types aluminum or ferric based coagulant polymer charge density flocculation time mixing intensity mineral composition of the bm the bm adsorption surface expressed as m2 of bm l and the bm size the bm adsorption surface was determined by the bm total external surface injected during the flocculation 28 optimal polymer dosages were established through interpolation between the points x1 y1 and x2 y2 of the turbidity vs polymer dosage curves to reach 1 ntu after settling a

3 2 4 floc monitoring a non intrusive camera floccam time exposure 1 500 s was directly installed on a jar test beaker to measure the floc size growth and breakage during flocculation 23 floc size and rate of aggregation were also confirmed through optical microscopy olympus dp70 camera connected to an olympus bx51 optical microscope 100x with a counting cell depth of 2 mm as described in lapointe and barbeau 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of ph on floc size and turbidity removal the current knowledge about organic polyelectrolytes suggests that the aggregation kinetic is primarily controlled by the polymer molecular weight and its charge density 2 12 32 however the influence of ph on metal hydroxides species has been documented 33 34 and because hydrogen bonding is involved it is anticipated that coagulated particles and the polymer chain interactions and adsorption affinities will also be controlled by the nature of these metal hydroxides me oh 2 me oh 2 me oh 3 s and me oh 4 and by polynuclear species 35 when a ferric coagulant was used both polymers reached the lowest turbidity for a ph between 6 0 6 5 fig 1 b for both polymers more alkaline conditions ph 7 5 were considered to be detrimental as they drastically reduced both the floc diameter and turbidity removal for a dosage of 1 5 mg starch l the settled water turbidity was 0 9 ntu and 2 9 ntu for a ph of 6 4 and 6 9 respectively a similar ph impact was noted for pam for which lower turbidity were observed although to a lesser extent since settled water turbidity increased from 0 2 ntu to 1 5 ntu for a ph increase from 6 4 to 6 9 similar conclusions were made when considerably different coagulation conditions were tested using only 2 7 mg al l data not shown in such case the optimal ph range was narrower 5 7 5 9 and the settled water turbidity 2 5 ntu was higher when starch was used in suboptimal coagulation conditions under such ph range it is expected that starch and pam both having anionic carboxyl groups adsorptions on colloids occur through three pathways 1 hydrogen bonding between the metal hydroxides silica oxides and the carbon oxygen double bond of the carboxyl groups 2 electrostatic interactions between positively charged hydroxides and anionic carboxyl groups and 3 divalent ion binding e g ca2 between anionic carboxyl groups and negatively charged colloids ballast media the largest floc sizes were achieved with the ferric coagulant in the ph range of 6 0 6 5 fig 1a 430 490 μm however the ferric flocs formed with starch were significantly smaller in comparison with pam despite dosages that were tenfold higher 246 μm with 2 mg starch l vs 477 μm with 0 2 mg pam l ph 6 5 respectively the results concerning the floc size are partly attributable to the polymer molecular weight which is discussed in the following section 3 2 impact of the polymer charge density and molecular weight the difference in turbidity removal between activated starch and pam is likely attributable primarily to the polymer molecular weight previous studies have reported the importance of this factor on the aggregation kinetic floc size floc stability and resistance to shearing 12 36 37 the polymer molecular configuration has also been reported to have an impact on the effective length of polymer chains that are able to connect particles through interparticle bridging 23 starch is known to be less effective for such reasons however no study has evaluated the impact of the starch charge density during ballasted flocculation the impact of the polymer charge density on turbidity removal for both types of polymers is presented in this section as shown in fig 2 a slightly anionic charge density between 2 4 and 0 4 meq g corresponding to approximately 18 to 3 of the negatively charged monomers in the case of pam and around 1 9 meq g in the case of starch were established as optimal in comparison when a low cationic polymer was used rather than a low anionic polymer the settled water turbidity was negatively affected as it increased by 30 for starch from 1 04 ntu to 1 35 ntu and 105 for pam from 0 19 ntu to 0 39 ntu in the case of pam it could be argued that any of the tested polymers could be selected by the water utility as they all met the target of 1 ntu in settled waters such observations and behavior where an inadequate charge density caused an unfavorable polymer chain reconfiguration leading to the reduction of polymer chain bridging capacity were also reported by gregory and barany 2 and bolto and gregory 12 nevertheless the studies confirmed that there is an optimal charge density for each polymer type that is influenced by the coagulant type the ph and the water characteristics among other factors 12 38 3 3 impact of flocculation time on turbidity removal and floc size the aggregation kinetic between the polymer chain and a given particle can be expressed as a second order reaction i e higher particle and polymer concentrations will lead to a higher aggregation rate 2 gregory 39 states that the required time to adsorb a particle onto a polymer chain is inversely proportional to the effective size of the polymer the starch polymer required approximately 5 min to reach 1 ntu while the pam needed less than 2 min fig 3 b nonetheless both polymers benefited from a longer flocculation time 8 min as the settled water turbidity was 0 80 and 0 21 ntu for starch and pam respectively the mean floc diameter was simultaneously measured during these experiments fig 3a it is clearly evident that the maximal floc size for both polymers was reached after only 4 min of flocculation 364 μm for starch and 580 μm for pam moreover a longer flocculation time of 8 min caused a floc size reduction for both polymers 342 μm for starch and 552 μm for pam this could be associated with the extended shearing of the floc structure or unfavorable chain reconfiguration as both phenomena lead to floc restructuration or disaggregation 12 this observation indicates that floc size may not be the best parameter when used alone to predict clarification performance as better turbidity removal was observed at 8 min even though smaller flocs were formed under these conditions it is hypothesized that the better turbidity removal at 8 min can be explained by the aggregation of smaller particles or microflocs either onto or into the existing ballasted floc these microflocs would not impact the average diameter but would be observable during a turbidity analysis to confirm this hypothesis particle counting 1 100 μm and floc size measurements could be simultaneously performed as function of flocculation time 3 4 floc resistance to shearing in this section the impact of velocity gradient on turbidity removal was evaluated to confirm the optimal mixing conditions fig 4 in the case of starch the optimal value was 165 s 1 0 65 ntu in lapointe and barbeau 4 the higher settled water turbidity values under non optimal g were attributable to ballasted floc disaggregation in the current study pam was less sensitive to shearing for the g range tested 135 195 s 1 a conclusion similar to that observed in our previous study 3 where pam was only impacted at a mixing intensity higher than 300 s 1 generally for ballasted flocculation the optimal mixing conditions are determined by two factors the need to maintain the bm in suspension and limit the floc disaggregation that occurs due to shearing forces 25 3 5 impact of sand mineral composition on turbidity removal and floc size besides the previously mentioned factors the bm mineral composition may have an impact on the floc bm interactions and adsorption affinities to evaluate this effect the performance of ballasted flocculation was assessed for two types of sand with different origins but identical size distribution d50 143 μm uc of 1 9 by using sand no 1 wt 93 6 of sio2 see section 2 3 the dosages required for the polymer to reach 1 ntu determined by interpolation and extracted from fig 5 were found to be 1 86 mg for activated starch l vs 0 068 mg pam l ratio starch pam 27 with sand no 2 the latter being almost exclusively composed of sio2 wt 98 7 the required dosages for both polymers were considerably reduced but more notably for starch 0 66 mg of starch l vs 0 047 mg pam l ratio starch pam 14 by using sand no 2 as an alternative to sand no 1 the starch and pam dosages required to reach 1 ntu after settling were reduced by 64 and 31 respectively moreover the mean floc diameter after 8 min of flocculation using 2 0 mg l starch was increased by 16 342 10 μm with sand no 1 vs 396 12 μm with sand no 2 t test p 0 002 in neutral ph it was reported that polysaccharide based polymers and pam have a higher affinity expressed in mg of polymer m2 of oxide with aluminum or ferric oxides compared to silica oxides l t lee and somasundaran 40 liu et al 35 the higher polymer adsorption on aluminum oxides covering sand no 1 could influence the chain configuration onto the oxides surface thus reducing the length of the effective polymer chain responsible for the interparticle bridging 3 6 impact of ballast media size on turbidity removal the influence of the bm size on turbidity removal using starch is examined in this section the initial raw media material was sieved to collect three different sizes with mean diameters of 72 90 and 143 μm for both types of sand a smaller bm achieved lower settled turbidity the latter being inversely proportional to the grain size when sand no 2 was used as bm shown in fig 5 lower turbidity values t test p 0 04 were observed 0 49 0 52 and 0 77 ntu fig 6 compared to those measured with sand no 1 0 69 0 78 and 1 31 ntu fig 6 for the respective bm diameters mentioned above a higher solid removal with a smaller bm is explained by two phenomena a smaller bm 1 is easily embeddable into the floc structure 4 and 2 offers a higher bm adsorption surface for an equivalent bm mass concentration 28 the beneficial effect of smaller bm was also observed on a different surface water st lawrence river quebec canada turbidity 3 4 ntu doc 3 3 5 mg c l data not shown 4 conclusion this study addressed the impact of coagulation flocculation conditions on the optimization of starch based polymers by combining the appropriate coagulation ph flocculation time and mixing intensity ballast size and mineral composition and polymer charge density starch is proposed as a potential alternative to the use of pam in ballasted flocculation processes this alternative could potentially eliminate many of the drawbacks related to the use of pam including toxicity and carcinogenicity the clogging effect on the media filter non biodegradability and its production from non renewable oil based materials etc in this study the following observations about starch polymers were considered to be of importance to water treatment specialists aiming to improve process performance a coagulation ph above 6 5 was detrimental for both polymers but more drastically for starch polymers therefore optimizing coagulation is the first step needed prior to optimizing flocculation a slightly anionic charge density between 2 4 and 0 4 meq g was established as optimal for coagulation at a ph of 6 5 the optimal charge density which is anticipated to be water specific was not found to be the most important variable for optimization with a similar anionic charge density starch required longer flocculation time to complete aggregation and to reach 1 ntu after settling this is probably attributable to the effective length of the polymer chain nevertheless the flocculation time was short and compatible with a ballasted flocculation process the optimal velocity gradient for starch polymers was fixed at 165 s 1 starch was more sensitive to shearing compared to pam the latter being able to tolerate values higher than 195 s1 without it impacting turbidity removal the bm characteristics were shown to have an important impact on floc size and turbidity removal in the case of starch smaller bm containing almost exclusively sio2 were established as ideal more work is needed to elucidate the interactions between metal hydroxide complexes polymers and inorganic oxide based bm finally a full scale comparison between starch and pam

14439,synthetic polymers mostly polyacrylamides pams are frequently used in the water industry to improve the performance of clarification however synthetic polymers may increase headloss in granular media filters biodegrade slowly and are potentially toxic alternatively bio sourced starch based polymers may eliminate the drawbacks of synthetic flocculants similarly to poly acrylamide co acrylic acid carboxymethylated starch is expected to adsorb on metal hydroxides via hydrogen bonding on carboxyl groups however it is already known that starch like many other polysaccharide flocculants is required in higher dosages for its performance to be comparable to pam this study identified the conditions favorable to the use of an activated starch polymer as an alternative to pam during

conventional clarification 1 2 ballasted flocculation 3 4 upflow sludge blanket clarifiers 5 and sludge dewatering 6 however synthetic polymers may increase headloss in granular media filters 7 8 these phenomena result from the presence of unsettled microflocs that contain high molecular weight polymer chains for over twenty five years many polysaccharide based polymers were suggested as being economical efficient and eco friendly flocculants including corn or potato starch guar gum cellulose sodium alginate and tannin 9 10 11 moreover bio sourced polymers may eliminate some of the drawbacks associated with synthetic polymers frequently used in the water industry 1 the risk related to the presence of residual toxic monomers of acrylamide from pam 12 14 2 the formation of oxidation by products from the interactions between monomers and polymers and impurities in the manufactured products and various oxidants 15 3 the low biodegradability of synthetic petroleum based polymers 16 and 4 the ecotoxicity of many cationic polyelectrolytes 17 as a consequence many countries particularly in europe have forbidden or restricted the use of synthetic polyelectrolytes such as pam for drinking water applications 18 19 in the case of pam maximal dosages are governed by american and european standards that allow a maximal acrylamide monomer concentration of 0 5 μg l nsf ansi 60 and 0 1 μg l en 1407 in treated water respectively therefore maximal dosages are product specific as they depend on the purity of the commercial pam due to the aforementioned constraints there is a growing interest in eliminating or drastically reducing the use of synthetic polyelectrolytes although polysaccharides based flocculants have been recognized to offer fairly good flocculation performance 9 the dosages required for starch 20 or chitosan 16 were higher than for pam in ballasted flocculation applications the required starch dosages were also shown to be higher in comparison to synthetic pam polymers 3 5 times higher 3 21 2 10 times higher 22 10 times higher for a relatively high turbidity of 21 ntu at ph 7 0 and more than 60 times for a 81 ntu wastewater at ph 8 4 23 starch based polymers chains are shorter and have a more branched structure compared to the linear pam configuration which reduces their ability to aggregate particles via interparticle bridging additionally flocs produced with activated starch polymers are more fragile and more sensitive to shearing compared to flocs produced with pam 3 consequently starch polymers are more efficient when smaller ballast media bm are used due to the lower mixing intensity required to keep them in suspension 3 25 nevertheless there is an interest in identifying alternative polymers to pam that are able to improve solid settling and retention in the filter media while simultaneously limiting headloss in the granular media filters considering the studies mentioned above polysaccharides based flocculants might not be an appropriate alternative to pam however it is expected that carboxymethylated starch with a finely selected charge density and with optimal mixing conditions could offer a sufficient turbidity removal to replace conventional pam e g starch dosage lower than 1 mg l to reach a settled water turbidity lower than 1 ntu no study ever attempted to physicochemically and hydraulically improve the performance of starch during flocculation the general objective of this study was to identify all of the conditions favorable to the use of an activated starch polymer as an alternative to pam during ballasted flocculation it is known that activated starch flocculation benefits from a lower shear mixing to reduce floc breakage as mixing conditions during ballasted flocculation are intimately linked with the bm characteristics size and density we investigated the interdependence of these two factors with regard to ballasted flocculation and settling performance more specifically assays were conducted under variable mixing conditions using various bm sizes and chemical compositions i e the different oxide groups at the bm surface the influence of coagulation ph flocculation time and polymer charge density was also investigated assays with pam were always performed as a reference condition hence this study hypothesized that starch dosages under such optimal mixing conditions could be notably lowered without impacting turbidity to compare flocculation performance with both polymers jar tests and microscopic flocs analysis were used to monitor floc size and the rate of aggregation turbidity measurements were also assessed to confirm the settling performance before and after the flocculation optimization 2 material and methods 2 1 waters

with six square b kers jars of 2 l with each possessing a sampling port located 10 cm from the top the bm was entirely injected at the onset of flocculation i e after the 2 min flash mix flocculation times varying from 10 s to 8 min were tested 4 28 the flocculant dosage was equally divided into 50 at the onset of flocculation and 50 at mid flocculation this injection sequence is typically used to improve floc size at the end of flocculation since it allows for floc regrowth at mid flocculation turbidity measurements were assessed on settled waters after 180 s of settling the range of g tested

polymers 106 in terms of molecular structure starch based polymers are known to adopt a ramified structure 29 in contrast acrylamide monomers are typically polymerized as linear structures the charge densities were obtained by colloid titration values from the manufacturer both polymers were subjected to comparative jar tests to determine their capacity to form ballasted floc and remove turbidity among the critical factors for the coagulation flocculation process the following were separately tested ph coagulant types aluminum or ferric based coagulant polymer charge density flocculation time mixing intensity mineral composition of the bm the bm adsorption surface expressed as m2 of bm l and the bm size the bm adsorption surface was determined by the bm total external surface injected during the flocculation 28 optimal polymer dosages were established through interpolation between the points x1 y1 and x2 y2 of the turbidity vs polymer dosage curves to reach 1 ntu after settling a

3 2 4 floc monitoring a non intrusive camera floccam time exposure 1 500 s was directly installed on a jar test beaker to measure the floc size growth and breakage during flocculation 23 floc size and rate of aggregation were also confirmed through optical microscopy olympus dp70 camera connected to an olympus bx51 optical microscope 100x with a counting cell depth of 2 mm as described in lapointe and barbeau 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of ph on floc size and turbidity removal the current knowledge about organic polyelectrolytes suggests that the aggregation kinetic is primarily controlled by the polymer molecular weight and its charge density 2 12 32 however the influence of ph on metal hydroxides species has been documented 33 34 and because hydrogen bonding is involved it is anticipated that coagulated particles and the polymer chain interactions and adsorption affinities will also be controlled by the nature of these metal hydroxides me oh 2 me oh 2 me oh 3 s and me oh 4 and by polynuclear species 35 when a ferric coagulant was used both polymers reached the lowest turbidity for a ph between 6 0 6 5 fig 1 b for both polymers more alkaline conditions ph 7 5 were considered to be detrimental as they drastically reduced both the floc diameter and turbidity removal for a dosage of 1 5 mg starch l the settled water turbidity was 0 9 ntu and 2 9 ntu for a ph of 6 4 and 6 9 respectively a similar ph impact was noted for pam for which lower turbidity were observed although to a lesser extent since settled water turbidity increased from 0 2 ntu to 1 5 ntu for a ph increase from 6 4 to 6 9 similar conclusions were made when considerably different coagulation conditions were tested using only 2 7 mg al l data not shown in such case the optimal ph range was narrower 5 7 5 9 and the settled water turbidity 2 5 ntu was higher when starch was used in suboptimal coagulation conditions under such ph range it is expected that starch and pam both having anionic carboxyl groups adsorptions on colloids occur through three pathways 1 hydrogen bonding between the metal hydroxides silica oxides and the carbon oxygen double bond of the carboxyl groups 2 electrostatic interactions between positively charged hydroxides and anionic carboxyl groups and 3 divalent ion binding e g ca2 between anionic carboxyl groups and negatively charged colloids ballast media the largest floc sizes were achieved with the ferric coagulant in the ph range of 6 0 6 5 fig 1a 430 490 μm however the ferric flocs formed with starch were significantly smaller in comparison with pam despite dosages that were tenfold higher 246 μm with 2 mg starch l vs 477 μm with 0 2 mg pam l ph 6 5 respectively the results concerning the floc size are partly attributable to the polymer molecular weight which is discussed in the following section 3 2 impact of the polymer charge density and molecular weight the difference in turbidity removal between activated starch and pam is likely attributable primarily to the polymer molecular weight previous studies have reported the importance of this factor on the aggregation kinetic floc size floc stability and resistance to shearing 12 36 37 the polymer molecular configuration has also been reported to have an impact on the effective length of polymer chains that are able to connect particles through interparticle bridging 23 starch is known to be less effective for such reasons however no study has evaluated the impact of the starch charge density during ballasted flocculation the impact of the polymer charge density on turbidity removal for both types of polymers is presented in this section as shown in fig 2 a slightly anionic charge density between 2 4 and 0 4 meq g corresponding to approximately 18 to 3 of the negatively charged monomers in the case of pam and around 1 9 meq g in the case of starch were established as optimal in comparison when a low cationic polymer was used rather than a low anionic polymer the settled water turbidity was negatively affected as it increased by 30 for starch from 1 04 ntu to 1 35 ntu and 105 for pam from 0 19 ntu to 0 39 ntu in the case of pam it could be argued that any of the tested polymers could be selected by the water utility as they all met the target of 1 ntu in settled waters such observations and behavior where an inadequate charge density caused an unfavorable polymer chain reconfiguration leading to the reduction of polymer chain bridging capacity were also reported by gregory and barany 2 and bolto and gregory 12 nevertheless the studies confirmed that there is an optimal charge density for each polymer type that is influenced by the coagulant type the ph and the water characteristics among other factors 12 38 3 3 impact of flocculation time on turbidity removal and floc size the aggregation kinetic between the polymer chain and a given particle can be expressed as a second order reaction i e higher particle and polymer concentrations will lead to a higher aggregation rate 2 gregory 39 states that the required time to adsorb a particle onto a polymer chain is inversely proportional to the effective size of the polymer the starch polymer required approximately 5 min to reach 1 ntu while the pam needed less than 2 min fig 3 b nonetheless both polymers benefited from a longer flocculation time 8 min as the settled water turbidity was 0 80 and 0 21 ntu for starch and pam respectively the mean floc diameter was simultaneously measured during these experiments fig 3a it is clearly evident that the maximal floc size for both polymers was reached after only 4 min of flocculation 364 μm for starch and 580 μm for pam moreover a longer flocculation time of 8 min caused a floc size reduction for both polymers 342 μm for starch and 552 μm for pam this could be associated with the extended shearing of the floc structure or unfavorable chain reconfiguration as both phenomena lead to floc restructuration or disaggregation 12 this observation indicates that floc size may not be the best parameter when used alone to predict clarification performance as better turbidity removal was observed at 8 min even though smaller flocs were formed under these conditions it is hypothesized that the better turbidity removal at 8 min can be explained by the aggregation of smaller particles or microflocs either onto or into the existing ballasted floc these microflocs would not impact the average diameter but would be observable during a turbidity analysis to confirm this hypothesis particle counting 1 100 μm and floc size measurements could be simultaneously performed as function of flocculation time 3 4 floc resistance to shearing in this section the impact of velocity gradient on turbidity removal was evaluated to confirm the optimal mixing conditions fig 4 in the case of starch the optimal value was 165 s 1 0 65 ntu in lapointe and barbeau 4 the higher settled water turbidity values under non optimal g were attributable to ballasted floc disaggregation in the current study pam was less sensitive to shearing for the g range tested 135 195 s 1 a conclusion similar to that observed in our previous study 3 where pam was only impacted at a mixing intensity higher than 300 s 1 generally for ballasted flocculation the optimal mixing conditions are determined by two factors the need to maintain the bm in suspension and limit the floc disaggregation that occurs due to shearing forces 25 3 5 impact of sand mineral composition on turbidity removal and floc size besides the previously mentioned factors the bm mineral composition may have an impact on the floc bm interactions and adsorption affinities to evaluate this effect the performance of ballasted flocculation was assessed for two types of sand with different origins but identical size distribution d50 143 μm uc of 1 9 by using sand no 1 wt 93 6 of sio2 see section 2 3 the dosages required for the polymer to reach 1 ntu determined by interpolation and extracted from fig 5 were found to be 1 86 mg for activated starch l vs 0 068 mg pam l ratio starch pam 27 with sand no 2 the latter being almost exclusively composed of sio2 wt 98 7 the required dosages for both polymers were considerably reduced but more notably for starch 0 66 mg of starch l vs 0 047 mg pam l ratio starch pam 14 by using sand no 2 as an alternative to sand no 1 the starch and pam dosages required to reach 1 ntu after settling were reduced by 64 and 31 respectively moreover the mean floc diameter after 8 min of flocculation using 2 0 mg l starch was increased by 16 342 10 μm with sand no 1 vs 396 12 μm with sand no 2 t test p 0 002 in neutral ph it was reported that polysaccharide based polymers and pam have a higher affinity expressed in mg of polymer m2 of oxide with aluminum or ferric oxides compared to silica oxides l t lee and somasundaran 40 liu et al 35 the higher polymer adsorption on aluminum oxides covering sand no 1 could influence the chain configuration onto the oxides surface thus reducing the length of the effective polymer chain responsible for the interparticle bridging 3 6 impact of ballast media size on turbidity removal the influence of the bm size on turbidity removal using starch is examined in this section the initial raw media material was sieved to collect three different sizes with mean diameters of 72 90 and 143 μm for both types of sand a smaller bm achieved lower settled turbidity the latter being inversely proportional to the grain size when sand no 2 was used as bm shown in fig 5 lower turbidity values t test p 0 04 were observed 0 49 0 52 and 0 77 ntu fig 6 compared to those measured with sand no 1 0 69 0 78 and 1 31 ntu fig 6 for the respective bm diameters mentioned above a higher solid removal with a smaller bm is explained by two phenomena a smaller bm 1 is easily embeddable into the floc structure 4 and 2 offers a higher bm adsorption surface for an equivalent bm mass concentration 28 the beneficial effect of smaller bm was also observed on a different surface water st lawrence river quebec canada turbidity 3 4 ntu doc 3 3 5 mg c l data not shown 4 conclusion this study addressed the impact of coagulation flocculation conditions on the optimization of starch based polymers by combining the appropriate coagulation ph flocculation time and mixing intensity ballast size and mineral composition and polymer charge density starch is proposed as a potential alternative to the use of pam in ballasted flocculation processes this alternative could potentially eliminate many of the drawbacks related to the use of pam including toxicity and carcinogenicity the clogging effect on the media filter non biodegradability and its production from non renewable oil based materials etc in this study the following observations about starch polymers were considered to be of importance to water treatment specialists aiming to improve process performance a coagulation ph above 6 5 was detrimental for both polymers but more drastically for starch polymers therefore optimizing coagulation is the first step needed prior to optimizing flocculation a slightly anionic charge density between 2 4 and 0 4 meq g was established as optimal for coagulation at a ph of 6 5 the optimal charge density which is anticipated to be water specific was not found to be the most important variable for optimization with a similar anionic charge density starch required longer flocculation time to complete aggregation and to reach 1 ntu after settling this is probably attributable to the effective length of the polymer chain nevertheless the flocculation time was short and compatible with a ballasted flocculation process the optimal velocity gradient for starch polymers was fixed at 165 s 1 starch was more sensitive to shearing compared to pam the latter being able to tolerate values higher than 195 s1 without it impacting turbidity removal the bm characteristics were shown to have an important impact on floc size and turbidity removal in the case of starch smaller bm containing almost exclusively sio2 were established as ideal more work is needed to elucidate the interactions between metal hydroxide complexes polymers and inorganic oxide based bm finally a full scale comparison between starch and pam should also consider the benefits of using starch for other downstream processes such as membrane granular media filters acknowledgments these experiments were conducted as part of the industrial
