distribution main to taps moh 2007 swsss are commonly constructed in multi floor and high rise buildings i e 5 floors in metropolitan cities in order to provide adequate hydraulic pressure for higher floors and equalize water demands it was estimated that more than 140 000 water tanks had been constructed in public and residential buildings in shanghai the largest city in china by 2012 smhb 2013

e g outdoor tanks these features can trigger disinfectant decay and subsequent microbial multiplication resulting in tap water quality deterioration evison and sunna 2001 nordblom and bergdahl 2004 schafer and mihelcic 2012 opportunistic pathogens including legionella pneumophila nontuberculous mycobacteria ntm acanthamoeba spp have attracted worldwide attention due to elevated disease incidences boost et al 2008 craun et al 2010 wu et al 2014 yu et al 2008 and evidences linking infections to drinking water systems brownelliott et al 2011 beer et al 2015 falkinham et al 2008 kilvington et al 2004 these microorganisms are natural inhabitants of engineered water systems and capable of resisting heat and disinfectants posing a unique challenge to their control in drinking water pruden et al 2013 moreover amoeba can also serve as hosts for legionella and mycobacterial species facilitating their replication and transmission delafont et al 2014 thomas et al 2006 the occurrences of opportunistic pathogens have been previously explored in drinking water e g marciano cabral et al 2010 ovrutsky et al 2013 thomas and ashbolt 2011 wang et al 2012 however the majority of studies focused on building plumbing directly served by the mains in western countries the occurrence pattern of opportunistic pathogens and environmental factors governing their occurrence and regrowth in swsss remain elusive it is also not clear how and to what extent the design i e layouts and characteristics of swsss would affect opportunistic pathogens and the drinking water microbiota during water transportation from the main to taps opportunistic pathogen transmission and exposure to humans in swsss is a vital but neglected public health problem in metropolitan cities where a large number of swsss are used rivera et al 2014 sun et al 2009 this study provides a comprehensive molecular survey of the occurrence of l pneumophila and mycobacterium avium two amoeba hosts acanthamoeba spp and vermamoeba vermiformis and genus level legionella and mycobacteria in swsss from 10 public and 14 residential buildings in shanghai the aims of this study were 1 to reveal the occurrence pattern and identify hotspots of opportunistic pathogens in swsss 2 to explore the influence of swss design and characteristics on opportunistic pathogen gene markers and broader microbial communities quantitative polymerase chain reaction q pcr was used to quantify target microorganisms due to its advantages of low detection limit high specificity and high throughput wang et al 2012 illumina sequencing of 16s rrna genes was performed to profile bacterial community shifts from the main water to taps in different types of swsss 2 methods and materials 2 1 site locations and sampling procedures drinking water in swsss was sampled from public and residential buildings in shanghai during april 2016 to march 2017 where chloramine was used as the secondary disinfectant ten public buildings around tongji university campus were randomly selected with number of stories varying from 5 to 24 table s1 among them eight buildings employed on site underground tanks coupled with rooftop tanks to supply water pressure while the other two 6 stories only used rooftop tanks one liter of tap water amended with membrane sterilized sodium thiosulfate to quench disinfectant residual was collected for microbiological analysis before flushing the taps i e first draw and after 28 min flushing i e postflushing at the first and top floors of each building with 100 ml water taken every 4 min for total chlorine analysis taps in the first floor were directly supplied by the mains in 8 out of 10 buildings whereas all top floor taps were served by swsss fig s1 appendix i therefore top floor tap water the nearest taps to tanks after extensive flushing could be used to represent rooftop tank water as access to rooftop tanks in public buildings was restricted survey of residential buildings was designed to include three types of swsss that were commonly encountered in shanghai underground tanks 4 buildings rooftop tanks 6 buildings and underground rooftop tanks i e water is pressurized from an underground tank and transported to rooftop tanks prior to distribution 4 buildings table s1 fig s1 sampling sites were selected along the water flow in swsss including first floor postflushing taps i e samples were taken after 4 min flushing to represent the main water underground tanks rooftop tanks and taps receiving tank water without flushing appendix i water sample

resemblance an exploratory tool biota and or environment matching best analysis in primer e was used to identify the most important environmental variables driving microbial community shifts 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using r 3 4 1 http www rproject org at a significance level of 0 05 since q pcr data were not normally distributed the non parametric kruskal wallis one way anova was used to compare the numbers of target organisms in different groups followed by a multiple comparison test to identify differences between individual pairs of groups with p

associations between genera of legionella and mycobacterium and other bacterial genera i e phylotypes with overall relative abundance 0 03 3 results 3 1 water quality characteristics in public buildings the average temperature of the top floor tap water was approximately 2 5 c higher than that of the first floor water table 1 p 0 05 total chlorine concentrations were higher in the first floor water than the top floor water for both first draw and postflushing samples with different buildings exhibiting unique chlorine variation profiles fig s2 p 0 05 the discrepancy of disinfectant concentrations between the top and first floor water is associated with water supply difference as 8 out of 10 buildings were directly served by the mains in the first floor while all top floor taps were supplied by rooftop tanks no other significant differences in water quality constituents were found between the first and top floor water p 0 05 water samples from residential buildings were grouped by different sampling locations along swsss table 1 for each individual site total chlorine concentrations in the main water and or underground tanks were consistently higher than taps p 0 05 no difference was observed for other water quality parameters among sampling location groups p 0 05 3 2 occurrence of legionella mycobacteria and two amoeba hosts in public buildings legionella spp and mycobacterium spp were detected in all water samples ranging from 16 to 4 8 103 and 86 to 4 4 104 gene copies ml respectively fig 1 l pneumophila was detected in 56 4 of water samples and 100 of buildings sampled whereas m avium was not found in any sample in this study the frequency of detection fod of acanthamoeba spp 20 5 of samples was higher than that of v vermiformis 5 1 with comparable gene copy numbers 53 410 gene copies ml similarly all water samples from residential buildings yielded positive detections for legionella spp 77 8 4 103 gene copies ml and mycobacterium spp 61 2 1 104 gene copies ml fig 2 the fods for l pneumophila acanthamoeba and v vermiformis in residential water samples were 15 9 7 out of 44 15 9 7 out of 44 and 11 4 5 out of 44 respectively with positive detections mainly noted in water tanks and taps 84 3 3 microbial growth potential in swsss in public buildings hybridly served by the main and swss n 8 the top floor postflushing samples are representative of rooftop tank water while the first floor postflushing samples are indicative of the water main fig s1 numbers of 16s rrna genes legionella and mycobacterial gene markers were higher in the top floor postflushing samples compared to the first floor postflushing samples in these buildings fig 1 p 0 05 suggesting significant microbial regrowth in rooftop tanks higher numbers were also observed for 16s rrna genes in the top floor first draw samples compared to the first floor first draw samples p 0 05 flushing only reduced numbers of 16s rrna genes legionella and mycobacteria in first floor samples p 0 05 no significant difference was observed for other target organisms between first and top floor water with regards to their gene copy numbers and or detection rates likely due to low fods in residential buildings 16s rrna genes were higher in rooftop tanks compared to the distribution main i e postflushing first floor water n 8 table s3 p 0 05 fig 2 indicating microbial regrowth in swsss higher 16s rrna genes were also noted in taps relative to underground tanks in buildings using underground tanks as part of swsss p 0 05 however no difference was observed for other target organisms along swsss 3 4 effect of different types of swsss the numbers of 16s rrna genes varied greater in rooftop systems relative to underground and underground rooftop systems fig 2 p 0 001 this is likely associated with wider temperature range in rooftop systems samples due to seasonal changes while underground and underground rooftop systems were mainly sampled in fall however no significant difference was observed for 16s rrna gene levels in three types of systems p 0 05 legionella numbers were higher in underground systems average number 1 95 103 2 49 103 gene copies ml than rooftop systems 7 8 102 1 40 103 gene copies ml p 0 05 on the contrary higher mycobacterial densities were observed in rooftop systems compared to underground and underground rooftop systems p 0 05 3 5 correlations between target organisms and abiotic and biotic factors in public buildings negative correlations were noted between legionella numbers and total chlorine rs 0 55 0 45 p 0 05 and between 16s rrna gene copy numbers and total chlorine rs 0 71 0 59 p 0 05 in both first draw and postflushing samples table s4 no correlation was found between target organisms and other abiotic factors correlation between target microorganisms was noted between legionella and 16s rrna genes in both first draw and postflushing samples rs 0 88 0 90 p 0 05 as well as between mycobacteria and 16s rrna genes and between mycobacteria and legionella in postflushing samples table s5 correlation analysis was performed between target organisms and abiotic factors in groups of the main water tank water and tap water in residential buildings table s6 mycobacterial numbers displayed strong positive association with temperature in three groups rs 0 80 0 91 p 0 05 positive correlation was also noted between 16s rrna gene numbers and the temperature of tank water rs 0 54 p 0 05 negative correlation was observed between 16s rrna genes and total chlorine rs 0 72 p 0 05 in tank water and between v vermiformis and total chlorine in tap water rs 0 60 p 0 05 numbers of legionella mycobacteria and v vermiformis displayed moderate positive correlations with 16s rrna gene numbers for all samples combined or in some groups of samples rs 0 38 0 73 p 0 05 table s7 however negative association was noted between numbers of acanthamoeba and legionella in tank water samples and all samples combined p 0 05 due to non simultaneous detections of these two organisms 3 6 illumina sequencing of microbial communities in swsss thirty four bacterial phyla were retrieved from 1 764 579 illumina sequences obtained from 67 drinking water samples 1 sample was excluded from further analysis due to small read library after removing singletons appendix ii proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in the majority of samples relative abundance 59 5 25 2 followed by firmicutes 9 9 15 2 bacteroidetes 14 0 14 7 nitrospirae 3 5 4 1 actinobacteria 2 5 3 3 and acidobacteira 2 4 2 4 according to their overall abundance in pooled samples at the genus level sphingomonas prevotella nitrospira novosphingobium methylobacterium nitrosomonas mycobacterium bdellovibrio bradyrhizobium methylophilus were the 10 most abundant genera in all samples combined appendix ii the relative abundances of legionella spp rs 0 4668 p 0 05 and mycobacteria rs 0 4717 p 0 05 were positively associated with corresponding q pcr numbers in all sequenced samples n 67 mine analysis identified 52 significant associations between legionella and other genera p 0 05 appendix iii the highest maximal information coefficient mic was with vampirovibrio mic 0 62 followed by flavobacterium and aggregicoccus a total of 37 associations were noted between mycobacteria and other genera p 0 05 appendix iii including nitrosomonas flavobacterium and methylobacterium clear separation was observed by sampling area for residential and public building samples in the multidimensional scaling mds plots fig s3 despite the fact that the sampling was performed on different dates in one area e g 1 2 months apart proximate distributions between ra3 and ra4 groups and between pa and r2 groups were likely due to the same water source received in these areas table s1 although anosim analysis demonstrated significant microbial difference between groups p 0 05 mds plots revealed tight clustering of samples by building e g building p2 and p3 fig 3 i which was also confirmed by anosim analysis indicating building specific microbial communities table s8 p 0 05 however other buildings demonstrated dramatic community shifts between top and first floor waters and between first draw and postflushing samples e g p4 p5 p6 with the lowest between sample similarity level at 17 the similarity levels between rooftop tanks i e top floor postflushing water and the distribution water i e first floor postflushing water n 5 varied from 38 5 63 6 implying considerable microbial community shifts during water transportation in swsss in residential buildings using rooftop systems the similarity levels between rooftop tanks and the main water varied from 33 95 to 55 11 comparable to those between rooftop tank and tap water 24 64 61 38 p 0 05 indicating similar degree of microbial community shifts during water transportation from the main to rooftop tanks and from tanks to taps fig 3 ii however in buildings using underground or underground rooftop systems high degree of microbial similarity was observed between the main water and underground tank water 66 01 71 21 and between underground tank and rooftop tank water 68 40 70 21 revealing less community shifts from the mains to underground tanks and then rooftop tanks p 0 05 if any in residential buildings using underground rooftop systems higher variance was noted for the similarity levels between roof top tank and tap water relative to levels between underground and rooftop tank water p 0 05 illustrating varied degree of community shifts as water flows from rooftop tanks to taps relate analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between similarity matrices derived from bacterial communities and water physiochemical parameters ρ 0 391 p 0 001 implying the drinking water microbiome is significantly influenced by water chemistry best analysis indicated that temperature was the most important individual factor driving bacterial community compositions ρ 0 388 p 0 001 no difference was observed for the shannon diversity index of samples from different floors in public buildings or from different sampling locations along swsss in residential buildings p 0 05 however the shannon diversity index was positively correlated with total chlorine for postflushing samples in public buildings rs 0 76 p 0 05 and tank water samples in residential buildings rs 0 50 p 0 05 positive correlation was also noted between the shannon diversity index and toc in all residential samples rs 0 51 p 0 05 4 discussions 4 1 occurrence of opportunistic pathogens in swsss opportunistic pathogens ubiquitously exist in drinking water distribution systems and building plumbing delafont et al 2013 2014 donohue et al 2014 the latter of which represents an important reservoir and exposure route for these pathogens pruden et al 2013 however previous studies mainly focused on household plumbing served directly by the mains holinger et al 2014 marciano cabral et al 2010 wang et al 2012 or in large buildings e g hotels hospitals without disclosing related plumbing information e g brown elliott et al 2011 thomas et al 2006 to our knowledge this is the first study that explored the precise effect of swss design i e three types of swsss and characteristics on multiple drinking water opportunistic pathogens during water transportation from the main to taps using culture independent methods results of this study would provide practical guidance to pathogen control in buildings with swsss the occurrence pattern of multiple opportunistic pathogen gene markers in this work was similar to that in one household plumbing survey in two chloraminated u s distribution systems using the same q pcr assays wang et al 2012 both studies reported high fods of legionella spp and mycobacteria and relatively lower fods of l pneumophila v vermiformis and acanthamoeba in spite of different density numbers l pneumophila the notorious species responsible for 90 of legionnaires diseases fields et al 2002 was more frequently found in public buildings relative to residential buildings this might be associated with relatively lower water usage in public buildings or the unique water chemistry in this area as suggested in a recent outbreak investigation in flint mi some water may contain constituents e g iron conducive to legionella growth or have high tendency to corrode pipes to release nutrients and deplete disinfectants rhoads et al 2017 the ubiquitous presence of mycobacteria and absence of m avium were consistent with the results of one previous study investigating ntm in unchlorinated distributed water from eight treatment plants in netherlands van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 however m avium was the most important clinical species in the united states and frequently detected in its drinking water systems falkinham et al 2001 2008 feazel et al 2009 pfaller et al 2007 this difference might be associated with geographic separation and the unique local epidemiological profile it was suggested that m kansasii 45 m intracellulare 20 8 and m chelonae abscessu 14 9 are the most prevalent clinical species in shanghai whereas m avium only accounts for 3 6 of clinical isolates wu et al 2014 therefore further scrutiny of other mycobacterial species especially pathogenic species such as m kansasii m intracellulare m abscessus and m chelonae falkinham 2008 is needed in order to elucidate exposure risks of relevant mycobacterial species in local drinking water systems both acanthamoeba and v vermiformis are potential amoebal hosts for opportunistic pathogens such as l pneumophila and m avium delafont et al 2014 thomas et al 2006 the present study showed higher occurrence rates 2 fold and gene copy numbers 10 fold of acanthamoeba and lower numbers of v vermiformis 100 fold less compared to the above mentioned u s report wang et al 2012 v vermiformis has been described as the most represented genus of fla in drinking water networks delafont et al 2013 hoffmann and michel 2001 and is likely more ecological relevant to legionella proliferation in engineered water systems compared to acanthamoeba valster et al 2010 however absence of v vermiformis was also noted in some studies likely associated with certain water characteristics that limit their proliferation e g atp concentration 1 ng l ntu 0 5 marciano cabral et al 2010 valster et al 2011 in addition low fods of amoeba speices might be partially due to the small sampling volumes used in this study and others boost et al 2008 jeong and yu 2005 valster et al 2011 since large volumes 100 l may increase the recovery efficiency of amoeba cope et al 2015 4 2 regrowth of opportunistic pathogens in swsss swss represents an ideal place for microbial regrowth given its unique characteristics of long storage time warm temperature presence of sediments and noncontinuous flow evison and sunna 2001 high numbers of heterotrophic bacteria hpc and total coliform and detection of potential pathogens such as aeromonas and pseudomonas have been found in drinking water storage tanks across the world evison and sunna 2001 miyagi et al 2017 schafer and mihelcic 2012 there were also reports of higher acanthamoeba fod in taps fed by tanks compared to those fed by the mains in the u k hong kong and korea boost et al 2008 jeong and yu 2005 seal et al 1992 which is in agreement with the primary detection of l pneumophila acanthamoeba and v vermiformis in tank and tap water in this study since swsss can promote colonization of potential pathogens consumers use taps served by swsss may undertake higher pathogen exposure risks water retention time is a critical driving factor for microbial regrowth in swsss even overnight stagnation can increase hpc by 4 580 fold in building plumbing water lautenschlager et al 2010 increased numbers of legionella mycobacteria and v vermiformis were also observed in first draw building plumbing water after overnight stagnation compared to postflushing samples wang et al 2012 in water tanks the stored water usually takes up a large portion of the total volume of the building plumbing systems significantly contributing to elevated water retention time nordblom and bergdahl 2004 the uneven water use and water stratification can further increase the retention time to a couple of days or even weeks in some worst case scenarios evison and sunna 2001 such a long retention time will contribute to disinfectant degradation and allow microbes to reach the growth plateau for instance a water tank simulation experiment demonstrated approximate 3 5 log increase of hpc after 4 day storage comparable to numbers on the 7th day evison and sunna 2001 besides water storage tanks microbial growth can also occur in pipes connecting drinking water installations due to the presence of biofilm and loss of disinfectant residuals flemming et al 2002 lautenschlager et al 2010 in the present study 28 min flushing posed little effect on the numbers of target organisms in top floor samples implying greater microbial regrowth in water storage tanks compared to pipes connecting tanks and taps this phenomenon is consistent with the result of a full scale drinking water distribution study which reported that water reservoirs exerted a dominant influence toward hpc density compared to pipes due to elevated retention time in reservoirs kerneïs et al 1995 4 3 association with biotic and abiotic factors negative correlations between total chlorine and gene markers of total bacteria legionella and v vermiformis illustrated the critical role of disinfectant residuals in inhibiting microbial growth in swsss however maintaining a disinfectant residual remains a challenge at the distal ends of distribution systems and building plumbing kerneïs et al 1995 nrc 2006 nguyen et al 2012 in the present study we observed total chlorine concentrations 0 5 mg l in 40 of rooftop tanks and disinfectant absence in some first draw samples in residential buildings unable to satisfy the chlorine dosage recommended for legionella control i e 0 5 mg l free residual oxidant as chlorine by the american society of heating refrigeration and air conditioning engineering ashrae 2013 it was also demonstrated that 1 mg l chloramine can barely inhibit the establishment of legionella mycobacteria and acanthameoba biofilm under simulated building plumbing conditions wang et al 2013 in addition no correlation was observed between total chlorine and mycobacteria which is likely associated with unique characteristics of mycobacteria such as disinfectant resistance and lower susceptibility to chloramine relative to chlorine falkinham 2008 moore et al 2006 it is likely that chloramine dosages in the present study exerted an inhibitory effect toward mycobacteria but lower than the threshold concentration at which the dose response relationship becomes apparent strong positive correlations between temperature and numbers of 16s rrna genes and mycobacteria as well as its important role in driving broader microbial communities best analysis implied that temperature is an important factor for controlling the microbiomes in swsss miyagi et al 2017 the result is consistent with the previous report of lower mycobacterial numbers in winter than summer in unchlorinated drinking water in netherlands van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 no correlation between temperature and legionella was found which was plausibly due to the fact that water temperatures in this survey were lower than or at the lower end of the favorable temperature range for legionella multiplication i e 25 42 c fields et al 2002 therefore approaches to prevent temperature increase are of importance in swsss in order to limit pathogen growth for example rooftop tanks should be placed in shade to minimize sunlight exposure ecological interactions among microbes may play a particularly critical role in governing occurrence and regrowth of opportunistic pathogens in drinking water delafont et al 2014 thomas and ashbolt 2011 the positive correlation between v vermiformis and total bacterial numbers was also observed in one previous study wang et al 2012 reflecting the predator prey relationship between amoeba and bacteria weekers et al 1993 this result is consistent with the rare detection of v vermiformis in waters with atp concentrations 1 ng l valster et al 2011 or biofilm 100 pg atp cm 2 van der kooij et al 2017 suggesting the importance of food availability toward v vermiformis multiplication in drinking water however we did not observe any positive correlation between legionella and two amoebas which is in contrast to the previous reports revealing potential pathogen host interactions thomas et al 2006 2014 valster et al 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 the high prevalence of legionella in this study implied that there might be other protozoa species supporting legionella multiplication or legionella may undergo necrotrophic growth temmerman et al 2006 associations between legionella mycobacteria and other genera mine analysis further illustrates potential antagonistic or synergistic relationship among microbes in drinking water for example methylobacterium and mycobacteria were found not to coexist in drinking water biofilm falkinham et al 2016 4 4 effect of swss characteristics on microbial community structure the overarching influence of sampling area on microbial communities could likely be ascribed to the water source difference table s1 and varied physical properties of the distribution systems from one area to another in shanghai the drinking water distribution networks are large and complex with 38 water plants jointly serving 19 districts the accumulative length of transmission pipe is 35 000 km using a variety of pipe materials including dust gray cast iron polyethylene cement etc interactions between water chemistry pipe materials and other factors in the distribution systems likely select for the distinct microbiota in one designated area tsintzou et al 2000 wang et al 2015 the strong influence of sampling area might mask the effects of swss types and tank materials on the microbiome as evidenced by the anosim analysis p 0 05 data not shown in contrast one lab scale study able to isolate the effect of tank materials revealed a higher similarity level of microbial taxa between water samples from two cast iron tanks compared to the fiber glass and polyethylene tanks evison and sunna 2001 the varied levels of microbial community shifts e g top floor water vs first floor water tank water vs the main water in building water illustrated that swss design and characteristics play an important role in governing the drinking water microbiome in general underground tanks contribute less to microbial community shifts relative to rooftop tanks which might be explained by the short traveling distance between the mains and tanks low temperature and inert tank materials i e stainless steel in this study in underground rooftop systems high similarity of microbial communities between underground and rooftop tank water was probably due to similar retention time although not confirmed in the present study building plumbing age status and integrity may also be important factors governing bacterial colonization and community structures mathys et al 2008 in shanghai roof top systems were commonly constructed in medium size buildings constructed before 1990s with tank surface mainly made of ceramic or concrete underground systems were typically designed for a cluster of buildings e g residential blocks using one or several gigantic underground tanks e g 20 m3 serving for the whole community in recent years underground rooftop systems with stainless steel as the preferred tank material miyagi et al 2017 have gained more popularity in high buildings interplay between factors such as tank surface materials disinfectant residuals retention time and flow rates in swsss will likely generate a variety of micro environments selecting for distinct microbial communities in swsss inkinene et al 2014 wang et al 2015 for instance high numbers of legionella in underground systems is likely a result of complex physiochemical and biological interactions producing favorable ecological niche for legionella multiplication 5 conclusions the results showed ubiquitous presence of legionella and mycobacterium genera and relatively lower detection frequency of l pneumophila acanthamoeba and v vermiformis in swsss illustrating swss is an important reservoir for opportunistic pathogens and related microorganisms higher copy numbers of

illumina sequencing of 16s rrna genes was performed to profile bacterial community shifts from the main water to taps in different types of swsss 2 methods and materials 2 1 site locations and sampling procedures drinking water in swsss was sampled from public and residential buildings in shanghai during april 2016 to march 2017 where chloramine was used as the secondary disinfectant ten public buildings around tongji university campus were randomly selected with number of stories varying from 5 to 24 table s1 among them eight buildings employed on site underground tanks coupled with rooftop tanks to supply water pressure while the other two 6 stories only used rooftop tanks one liter of tap water amended with membrane sterilized sodium thiosulfate to quench disinfectant residual was collected for microbiological analysis before flushing the taps i e first draw and after 28 min flushing i e postflushing at the first and top floors of each building with 100 ml water taken every 4 min for total chlorine analysis taps in the first floor were directly supplied by the mains in 8 out of 10 buildings whereas all top floor taps were served by swsss fig s1 appendix i therefore top floor tap water the nearest taps to tanks after extensive flushing could be used to represent rooftop tank water as access to rooftop tanks in public buildings was restricted survey of residential buildings was designed to include three types of swsss that were commonly encountered in shanghai underground tanks 4 buildings rooftop tanks 6 buildings and underground rooftop tanks i e water is pressurized from an underground tank and transported to rooftop tanks prior to distribution 4 buildings table s1 fig s1 sampling sites were selected along the water flow in swsss including first floor

buildings the average temperature of the top floor tap water was approximately 2 5 c higher than that of the first floor water table 1 p 0 05 total chlorine concentrations were higher in the first floor water than the top floor water for both first draw and postflushing samples with different buildings exhibiting unique chlorine variation profiles fig s2 p 0 05 the discrepancy of disinfectant concentrations between the top and first floor water is associated with water supply difference as 8 out of 10 buildings were directly served by the mains in the first floor while all top floor taps were supplied by rooftop tanks no other significant differences in water quality constituents were found between the first and top floor water p 0 05 water samples from residential buildings were grouped by different sampling locations along swsss table 1 for each individual site total chlorine concentrations in the main water and or underground tanks were consistently higher than taps p 0 05 no difference was observed for other water quality parameters among sampling location groups p 0 05 3 2 occurrence of legionella mycobacteria and two amoeba hosts in public buildings legionella spp and mycobacterium spp were detected in all water samples ranging from 16 to 4 8 103 and 86 to 4 4 104 gene copies ml respectively fig 1 l pneumophila was detected in 56 4 of water samples and 100 of buildings sampled whereas m avium was not found in any sample in this study the frequency of detection fod of acanthamoeba spp 20 5 of samples was higher than that of v vermiformis 5 1 with comparable

gene copies ml fig 2 the fods for l pneumophila acanthamoeba and v vermiformis in residential water samples were 15 9 7 out of 44 15 9 7 out of 44 and 11 4 5 out of 44 respectively with positive detections mainly noted in water tanks and taps 84 3 3 microbial growth potential in swsss in public buildings hybridly served by the main and swss n 8 the top floor postflushing samples are representative of rooftop tank water while the first floor postflushing samples are indicative of the water main fig s1 numbers of 16s rrna genes legionella and mycobacterial gene markers were higher in the top floor postflushing samples compared to the first floor postflushing samples in these buildings fig 1 p 0 05 suggesting significant microbial regrowth in rooftop tanks higher numbers were also observed for 16s rrna genes in the top floor first draw samples compared to the first floor first draw samples p 0 05 flushing only reduced numbers of 16s rrna genes legionella and mycobacteria in first floor samples p 0 05 no significant difference was observed for other target organisms between first and top floor water with regards to their gene copy numbers and or detection rates likely due to low fods in residential buildings 16s rrna genes were higher in rooftop tanks compared to the distribution main i e postflushing first floor water n 8 table s3 p 0 05 fig 2 indicating microbial regrowth in swsss higher 16s rrna genes were also noted in taps relative to underground tanks in buildings using underground tanks as part of swsss p 0 05 however no difference was observed for other target organisms along swsss 3 4 effect of different types of swsss the numbers of 16s rrna genes varied greater in rooftop systems relative to underground and underground rooftop systems fig 2 p 0 001 this is likely associated with wider temperature range in rooftop systems samples due to seasonal changes while underground and underground rooftop systems were mainly sampled in fall however no significant difference was observed for 16s rrna gene levels in three types of systems p 0 05 legionella numbers were higher in underground systems average number 1 95 103 2 49 103 gene copies ml than rooftop systems 7 8 102 1 40 103 gene copies ml p 0 05 on the contrary higher mycobacterial densities were observed in rooftop systems compared to underground and underground rooftop systems p 0 05 3 5 correlations between target organisms and abiotic and biotic factors in public buildings negative correlations were noted between legionella numbers and total chlorine rs 0 55 0 45 p 0 05 and between 16s rrna gene copy numbers and total chlorine rs 0 71 0 59 p 0 05 in both first draw and postflushing samples table s4 no correlation was found between target organisms and other abiotic factors correlation between target microorganisms was noted between legionella and 16s rrna genes in both first draw and postflushing samples rs 0 88 0 90 p 0 05 as well as between mycobacteria and 16s rrna genes and between mycobacteria and legionella in postflushing samples table s5 correlation analysis was performed between target organisms and abiotic factors in groups of the main water tank water and tap water in residential buildings table s6 mycobacterial numbers displayed strong positive association with temperature in three groups rs 0 80 0 91 p 0 05 positive correlation was also noted between 16s rrna gene numbers and the temperature of tank water rs 0 54 p 0 05 negative correlation was observed between 16s rrna genes and total chlorine rs 0 72 p 0 05 in tank water and between v vermiformis and total chlorine in tap water rs 0 60 p 0 05 numbers of legionella mycobacteria and v vermiformis displayed moderate positive correlations with 16s rrna gene numbers for all samples combined or in some groups of samples rs 0 38 0 73 p 0 05 table s7 however negative association was noted between numbers of acanthamoeba and legionella in tank water samples and all samples combined p 0 05 due to non simultaneous detections of these two organisms 3 6 illumina sequencing of microbial communities in swsss thirty four bacterial phyla were retrieved from 1 764 579 illumina sequences obtained from 67 drinking water samples 1 sample was excluded from further analysis due to small read library after removing singletons appendix ii proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in the majority of samples relative abundance 59 5 25 2 followed by firmicutes 9 9 15 2 bacteroidetes 14 0 14 7 nitrospirae 3 5 4 1 actinobacteria 2 5 3 3 and acidobacteira 2 4 2 4 according to their overall abundance in pooled samples at the genus level sphingomonas prevotella nitrospira novosphingobium methylobacterium nitrosomonas mycobacterium bdellovibrio bradyrhizobium methylophilus were the 10 most abundant genera in all samples combined appendix ii the relative abundances of legionella spp rs 0 4668 p 0 05 and mycobacteria rs 0 4717 p 0 05 were positively associated with corresponding q pcr numbers in all sequenced samples n 67 mine analysis identified 52 significant associations between legionella and other genera p 0 05 appendix iii the highest maximal information

nitrosomonas flavobacterium and methylobacterium clear separation was observed by sampling area for residential and public building samples in the multidimensional scaling mds plots fig s3 despite the fact that the sampling was performed on different dates in one area e g 1 2 months apart proximate distributions between ra3 and ra4 groups and between pa and r2 groups were likely due to the same water source received in these areas table s1 although anosim analysis demonstrated significant microbial difference between groups p 0 05 mds plots revealed tight clustering of samples by building e g building p2 and p3 fig 3 i which was also confirmed by anosim analysis indicating building specific microbial communities table s8 p 0 05 however other buildings demonstrated dramatic community shifts between top and first floor waters and between first draw and postflushing samples e g p4 p5 p6 with the lowest between sample similarity level at 17 the similarity levels between rooftop tanks i e top floor postflushing water and the distribution water i e first floor postflushing water n 5 varied from 38 5 63 6 implying considerable microbial community shifts during water transportation in swsss in residential buildings using rooftop systems the similarity levels between rooftop tanks and the main water varied from 33 95 to 55 11 comparable to those between rooftop tank and tap water 24 64 61 38 p 0 05 indicating similar degree of microbial community shifts during water transportation from the main to rooftop tanks and from tanks to taps fig 3 ii however in buildings using underground or underground rooftop systems high degree of microbial similarity was observed between the main water and underground tank water 66 01 71 21 and between underground tank and rooftop tank water 68 40 70 21 revealing less community shifts from the mains to underground tanks and then rooftop tanks p 0 05 if any in residential buildings using underground rooftop systems higher variance was noted for the similarity levels between roof top tank and tap water relative to levels between underground and rooftop tank water p 0 05 illustrating varied degree of community shifts as water flows from rooftop tanks to taps relate analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between similarity matrices derived from bacterial communities and water physiochemical parameters ρ 0 391 p 0 001 implying the drinking water microbiome is significantly influenced by water chemistry best analysis indicated that temperature was the most important individual factor driving bacterial community compositions ρ 0 388 p 0 001 no difference was observed for the shannon diversity index of samples from different floors in public buildings or from different sampling locations along swsss in residential buildings p 0 05 however the shannon diversity index was positively correlated with total chlorine for postflushing samples in public buildings rs 0 76 p 0 05 and tank water samples in residential buildings rs 0 50 p 0 05 positive correlation was also noted between the shannon diversity index and toc in all residential samples rs 0 51 p 0 05 4 discussions 4 1 occurrence of opportunistic pathogens in swsss opportunistic pathogens ubiquitously exist in drinking water distribution systems and building plumbing delafont et al 2013 2014 donohue et al 2014 the latter of which represents an important reservoir and exposure route for these pathogens pruden et al 2013 however previous studies mainly focused on household plumbing served directly by the mains holinger et al 2014 marciano cabral et al 2010 wang et al 2012 or in large buildings e g hotels hospitals without disclosing related plumbing information e g brown elliott et al 2011 thomas et al 2006 to our knowledge this is the first study that explored the precise effect of swss design i e three types of swsss and characteristics on multiple drinking water opportunistic pathogens during water transportation from the main to taps using culture independent methods results of this study would provide practical guidance to pathogen control in buildings with swsss the occurrence pattern of multiple opportunistic pathogen gene markers in this work was similar to that in one household plumbing survey in two chloraminated u s distribution systems using the same q pcr assays wang et al 2012 both studies reported high fods of legionella spp and mycobacteria and relatively lower fods of l pneumophila v vermiformis and acanthamoeba in spite of different density numbers l pneumophila the notorious species responsible for 90 of legionnaires diseases fields et al 2002 was more frequently found in public buildings relative to residential buildings this might be associated with relatively lower water usage in public buildings or the unique water chemistry in this area as suggested in a recent outbreak investigation in flint mi some water may contain constituents e g iron conducive to legionella growth or have high tendency to corrode pipes to release nutrients and deplete disinfectants rhoads et al 2017 the ubiquitous presence of mycobacteria and absence of m avium were consistent with the results of one previous study investigating ntm in unchlorinated distributed water from eight treatment plants in netherlands van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 however m avium was the most important clinical species in the united states and frequently detected in its drinking water systems falkinham et al 2001 2008 feazel et al 2009 pfaller et al 2007 this difference might be associated with geographic separation and the unique local epidemiological profile it was suggested that m kansasii 45 m intracellulare 20 8 and m chelonae abscessu 14 9 are the most prevalent clinical species in shanghai whereas m avium only accounts for 3 6 of clinical isolates wu et al 2014 therefore further scrutiny of other mycobacterial species especially pathogenic species such as m kansasii m intracellulare m abscessus and m chelonae falkinham 2008 is needed in order to elucidate exposure risks of relevant mycobacterial species in local drinking water systems both acanthamoeba and v vermiformis are potential amoebal hosts for opportunistic pathogens such as l pneumophila and m avium delafont et al 2014 thomas et al 2006 the present study showed higher occurrence rates 2 fold and gene copy numbers 10 fold of acanthamoeba and lower numbers of v vermiformis 100 fold less compared to the above mentioned u s report wang et al 2012 v vermiformis has been described as the most represented genus of fla in drinking water networks delafont et al 2013 hoffmann and michel 2001 and is likely more ecological relevant to legionella proliferation in engineered water systems compared to acanthamoeba valster et al 2010 however absence of v vermiformis was also noted in some studies likely associated with certain water characteristics that limit their proliferation e g atp concentration 1 ng l ntu 0 5 marciano cabral et al 2010 valster et al 2011 in addition low fods of amoeba speices might be partially due to the small sampling volumes used in this study and others boost et al 2008 jeong and yu 2005 valster et al 2011 since large volumes 100 l may increase the recovery efficiency of amoeba cope et al 2015 4 2 regrowth of opportunistic pathogens in swsss swss represents an ideal place for microbial regrowth given its unique characteristics of long storage time warm temperature presence of sediments and noncontinuous flow evison and sunna 2001 high numbers of heterotrophic bacteria hpc and total coliform and detection of potential pathogens such as aeromonas and pseudomonas have been found in drinking water storage tanks across the world evison and sunna 2001 miyagi et al 2017 schafer and mihelcic 2012 there were also reports of higher acanthamoeba fod in taps fed by tanks compared to those fed by the mains in the u k hong kong and korea boost et al 2008 jeong and yu 2005 seal et al 1992 which is in agreement with the primary detection of l pneumophila acanthamoeba and v vermiformis in tank and tap water in this study since swsss can promote colonization of potential pathogens consumers use taps served by swsss may undertake higher pathogen exposure risks water retention time is a critical driving factor for microbial regrowth in swsss even overnight stagnation can increase hpc by 4 580 fold in building plumbing water lautenschlager et al 2010 increased numbers of legionella mycobacteria and v vermiformis were also observed in first draw building plumbing water after overnight stagnation compared to postflushing samples wang et al 2012 in water tanks the stored water usually takes up a large portion of the total volume of the building plumbing systems significantly contributing to elevated water retention time nordblom and bergdahl 2004 the uneven water use and water stratification can further increase the retention time to a couple of days or even weeks in some worst case scenarios evison and sunna 2001 such a long retention time will contribute to disinfectant degradation and allow microbes to reach the growth plateau for instance a water tank simulation experiment demonstrated approximate 3 5 log increase of hpc after 4 day storage comparable to numbers on the 7th day evison and sunna 2001 besides water storage tanks microbial growth can also occur in pipes connecting drinking water installations due to the presence of biofilm and loss of disinfectant residuals flemming et al 2002 lautenschlager et al 2010 in the present study 28 min flushing posed little effect on the numbers of target organisms in top floor samples implying greater microbial regrowth in water storage tanks compared to pipes connecting tanks and taps this phenomenon is consistent with the result of a full scale drinking water distribution study which reported that water reservoirs exerted a dominant influence toward hpc density compared to pipes due to elevated retention time in reservoirs kerneïs et al 1995 4 3 association with biotic and abiotic factors negative correlations between total chlorine and gene markers of total bacteria legionella and v vermiformis illustrated the critical role of disinfectant residuals in inhibiting microbial growth in swsss however maintaining a disinfectant residual remains a challenge at the distal ends of distribution systems and building plumbing kerneïs et al 1995 nrc 2006 nguyen et al 2012 in the present study we observed total chlorine concentrations 0 5 mg l in 40 of rooftop tanks and disinfectant absence in some first draw samples in residential buildings unable to satisfy the chlorine dosage recommended for legionella control i e 0 5 mg l free residual oxidant as chlorine by the american society of heating refrigeration and air conditioning engineering ashrae 2013 it was also demonstrated that 1 mg l chloramine can barely inhibit the establishment of legionella mycobacteria and acanthameoba biofilm under simulated building plumbing conditions wang et al 2013 in addition no correlation was observed between total chlorine and mycobacteria which is likely associated with unique characteristics of mycobacteria such as disinfectant resistance and lower susceptibility to chloramine relative to chlorine falkinham 2008 moore et al 2006 it is likely that chloramine dosages in the present study exerted an inhibitory effect toward mycobacteria but lower than the threshold concentration at which the dose response relationship becomes apparent strong positive correlations between temperature and numbers of 16s rrna genes and mycobacteria as well as its important role in driving broader microbial communities best analysis implied that temperature is an important factor for controlling the microbiomes in swsss miyagi et al 2017 the result is consistent with the previous report of lower mycobacterial numbers in winter than summer in unchlorinated drinking water in netherlands van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 no correlation between temperature and legionella was found which was plausibly due to the fact that water temperatures in this survey were lower than or at the lower end of the favorable temperature range for legionella multiplication i e 25 42 c fields et al 2002 therefore approaches to prevent temperature increase are of importance in swsss in order to limit pathogen growth for example rooftop tanks should be placed in shade to minimize sunlight exposure ecological interactions among microbes may play a particularly critical role in governing occurrence and regrowth of opportunistic pathogens in drinking water delafont et al 2014 thomas and ashbolt 2011 the positive correlation between v vermiformis and total bacterial numbers was also observed in one previous study wang et al 2012 reflecting the predator prey relationship between amoeba and bacteria weekers et al 1993 this result is consistent with the rare detection of v vermiformis in waters with atp concentrations 1 ng l valster et al 2011 or biofilm 100 pg atp cm 2 van der kooij et al 2017 suggesting the importance of food availability toward v vermiformis multiplication in drinking water however we did not observe any positive correlation between legionella and two amoebas which is in contrast to the previous reports revealing potential pathogen host interactions thomas et al 2006 2014 valster et al 2011 van der kooij et al 2017 the high prevalence of legionella in this study implied that there might be other protozoa species supporting legionella multiplication or legionella may undergo necrotrophic growth temmerman et al 2006 associations between legionella mycobacteria and other genera mine analysis further illustrates potential antagonistic or synergistic relationship among microbes in drinking water for example methylobacterium and mycobacteria were found not to coexist in drinking water biofilm falkinham et al 2016 4 4 effect of swss characteristics on microbial community structure the overarching influence of sampling area on microbial communities could likely be ascribed to the water source difference table s1 and varied physical properties of the distribution systems from one area to another in shanghai the drinking water distribution networks are large and complex with 38 water plants jointly serving 19 districts the accumulative length of transmission pipe is 35 000 km using a variety of pipe materials including dust gray cast iron polyethylene cement etc interactions between water chemistry pipe materials and other factors in the distribution systems likely select for the distinct microbiota in one designated area tsintzou et al 2000 wang et al 2015 the strong influence of sampling area might mask the effects of swss types and tank materials on the microbiome as evidenced by the anosim analysis p 0 05 data not shown in contrast one lab scale study able to isolate the effect of tank materials revealed a higher similarity level of microbial taxa between water samples from two cast iron tanks compared to the fiber glass and polyethylene tanks evison and sunna 2001 the varied levels of microbial community shifts e g top floor water vs first floor water tank water vs the main water in building water illustrated that swss design and characteristics play an important role in governing the drinking water microbiome in general underground tanks contribute less to microbial community shifts relative to rooftop tanks which might be explained by the short traveling distance between the mains and tanks low temperature and inert tank materials i e stainless steel in this study in underground rooftop systems high similarity of microbial communities between underground and rooftop tank water was probably due to similar retention time although not confirmed in the present study building plumbing age status and integrity may also be important factors governing bacterial colonization and community structures mathys et al 2008 in shanghai roof top systems were commonly constructed in medium size buildings constructed before 1990s with tank surface mainly made of ceramic or concrete underground systems were typically designed for a cluster of buildings e g residential blocks using one or several gigantic underground tanks e g 20 m3 serving for the whole community in recent years underground rooftop systems with stainless steel as the preferred tank material miyagi et al 2017 have gained more popularity in high buildings interplay between factors such as tank surface materials disinfectant residuals retention time and flow rates in swsss will likely generate a variety of micro environments selecting for distinct microbial communities in swsss inkinene et al 2014 wang et al 2015 for instance high numbers of legionella in underground systems is likely a result of complex physiochemical and biological interactions producing favorable ecological niche for legionella multiplication 5 conclusions the results showed ubiquitous presence of legionella and mycobacterium genera and relatively lower detection frequency of l pneumophila acanthamoeba and v vermiformis in swsss illustrating swss is an important reservoir for opportunistic pathogens and related microorganisms higher copy numbers of 16s rrna genes legionella and mycobacteria in rooftop tanks compared to the distribution mains as well as primary detection of l pneumophila acanthameoba and v vermiformis gene markers in tank and tap water emphasized that swss can promote microbial regrowth and colonization of potential pathogens illumina sequencing demonstrated considerable but variable bacterial community shifts as water traveled from the distribution main to swsss less community shifts were noted in underground tanks relative to rooftop tanks highlighting the critical role of swss design and characteristics in driving drinking water bacterial communities long water retention time warm temperature and loss of disinfectant residuals are driving factors for potential opportunistic pathogen colonization and microbial community shifts in swsss dramatic variations of opportunistic pathogen gene numbers and microbial communities between the top and first floor water illustrated the necessity of sampling

19656,this study investigated the removal of 15 trace organic chemicals torcs occurring at ambient concentrations from municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent by advanced oxidation using uv h2o2 at pilot scale pseudo first order rate constants kobs for photolytic as well as combined oxidative and photolytic degradation observed at pilot scale were validated with results from a bench scale collimated beam device no significant difference was determined between pilot and lab scale performance during continuous pilot scale operation at constant uv fluence of 800 mj cm2 and h2o2 dosage of 10 mg l the removal of various torcs was investigated the average observed removal for photo susceptible kuv 10 3 cm2 mj like diclofenac iopromide and sulfamethoxazole moderately photo susceptible 10 4 kuv 10 3 cm2 mj like climbazole tramadol sotalol citalopram benzotriazole venlafaxine and metoprolol and most photo resistant kuv 10 4 cm2 mj like primidone carbamazepine and gabapentin compounds was 90 49 and 37 including outliers respectively the poorly reactive compound tcep was not significantly eliminated during pilot scale experiments additionally based on removal kinetics of photo resistant torcs continuous pilot scale operation revealed high variations of oh radical exposure determined from removal kinetics of photo resistant torcs primarily due to nitrite concentration fluctuations in the feed water furthermore a correlation between oh radical exposure and scavenging capacity could be determined and verified by mechanistic modeling using uv fluence h2o2 dosage and standard water quality parameters i e doc no3 no2 and hco3 as model input data this correlation revealed the possibility of oh radical exposure prediction by water matrix parameters and proved its

industrial chemicals have been detected and extensively investigated in the aquatic environment and in all parts of the water cycle lim 2008 blum et al 2017 hofman caris et al 2017 yang et al 2017 besides urban and agricultural run off wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents are considered to be the most significant torc emitters to the aqueous environment gros et al 2010 luo et al 2014 dong et al 2015 although concentrations hardly exceed μg l concentrations persistent substances remain in wwtp effluents being discharged in surface waters since conventional physical and biological wastewater treatment can only partially remove these substances lim 2008 zhang et al 2008 luo et al 2014 for the removal of these compounds from wwtp effluents advanced oxidation might be a promising treatment approach advanced oxidation processes aop are generally defined as processes that intentionally form highly reactive radicals in situ comninellis et al 2008 yang et al 2014 specifically oh radicals produced are known for their rapid and non selective oxidation of organic water contaminants with second order reaction rate constants in the range of 108 1010 m 1s 1 in current practice utilization of aops is mostly limited to highly treated wastewater effluents including reverse osmosis treatment and advanced drinking water treatment with high uv transmittance among uv based aops uv h2o2 where h2o2 is directly activated by uv light to form two oh radicals is a commonly applied aop in water reuse and advanced drinking water treatment for contaminant as well as taste and odor removal torc removal during low pressure uv h2o2 is achieved by two major reaction pathways direct photolysis by uv c irradiation at 254 nm and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals formed in situ since generated oh radicals react unselectively with all water constituents transformation of target compounds in wastewater is competing with oxidation of other organic and inorganic compounds the occurrence of so called radical scavengers which terminate radical chain reactions can significantly reduce oxidation efficiency in aops keen et al 2012 furthermore changes in uv transmittance directly affect the activation of h2o2 therefore uv h2o2 effectiveness is highly susceptible to water matrix changes the influence of scavenging on uv h2o2 has been investigated thoroughly liao et al 2001 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 and a good overview of scavengers and their reactivity with oh radicals is given by wols and hofman caris 2012 kinetic models can be adopted to estimate the influence of radical scavengers on the degradation performance and represent a useful tool to predict torc degradation by uv h2o2 in different water matrices as proposed by bolton and stefan 2002 and wols et al 2013 uv h2o2 is a thoroughly examined aop pereira et al 2007 for all kinds of water applications with most studies performed at laboratory scale yuan et al 2011 only a limited number of studies however have been carried out specifically on wastewater effluent at the laboratory rosario ortiz et al 2010 keen and linden 2013 yu et al 2015 or pilot scale audenaert et al 2011 köhler et al 2012 de la cruz et al 2013 lester et al 2014 merel et al 2015 cedat et al 2016 some pilot scale studies on uv h2o2 investigated its viability for torc removal sarathy et al 2011 wang et al 2015 cedat et al 2016 chu et al 2016 gerrity et al 2016 miralles cuevas et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge verifying pilot scale studies using data from standardized lab scale systems combined with mechanistic modeling efforts are lacking in the peer reviewed literature furthermore little is known about uv h2o2 applicability for municipal wastewater effluents with respect to oh radical scavenging across changing water qualities gerrity et al 2016 lee et al 2016 in this study we characterize the applicability of uv h2o2 for advanced municipal wastewater treatment using lab and pilot scale set ups piloting results are directly compared to results conducted using a lab scale collimated beam device cbd to verify the up scaling effort a total of 15 torcs occurring at ambient concentrations and representing a range of different photolytic and oh radical reactivities were measured to assess the viability of uv h2o2 for continuous treatment of tertiary effluents a comprehensive investigation of oh radical scavenging caused by different water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon doc nitrite nitrate and alkalinity was performed during continuous operation of a pilot scale uv h2o2 system finally the experimental results were compared to mechanistic modeling estimations 2 experimental approach 2 1 uv aop pilot scale experiments 2 1 1 description of the pilot scale setup the shipping container based uv aop pilot scale plant was designed by wedeco xylem germany and installed on site at the wwtp gut marienhof munich germany with a capacity of 11 35 m3 per hour in 2015 the wwtp with a capacity of one million population equivalents treated approximately 55 7 million m³ of wastewater the treatment plant consists of a mechanical treatment stage including screens aerated sand fat traps and preliminary sedimentation followed by a two stage activated sludge process for biological carbon and nutrient removal the activated sludge process is a two stage biological process with an intermediate clarification stage the first stage has a solids retention time of 2 3 days and the second stage of 6 8 days the water is then filtered using tertiary granular media filters with a resulting uv transmittance at 254 nm uvt of 65 75 relevant water quality parameters of the granular media filter effluent are reported in table 3 during summer months methanol is added to a third of all 24 granular media filter cells as an external carbon source for denitrification furthermore the filter effluent is disinfected by a low pressure lp uv system at a targeted fluence of 50 mj cm2 from may september to maintain microbial bathing water quality in the river isar the pilot scale system consisted of two lp uv reactors wedeco lbx 90e and lbx 10 xylem germany operated to deliver high 100 4000 mj cm2 and low 40 400 mj cm2 levels of fluence respectively see specifications in table 1 the pilot system was fed with tertiary effluent delivered by an external process water pump station the inflow was divided into two streams and controlled by diaphragm valves mv310 asv stübbe germany flow rates were measured by magnetic inductive flow sensors proline promag 50 e h messtechnik germany uv intensity was measured by two internal radiometers and corrected by manufacturer specific correction factors based on uv transmittance fig s3 supplemental information uvt was measured by an online flow through sensor wedeco tmo iv xylem germany both reactors were equipped with mechanical cleaning wipers to minimize the influence of deposits resulting in reduced intensity over time h2o2 was injected by a magnetic dosing pump gamma x prominent germany with a maximum flow rate of 6 8 l h homogeneous distribution of the oxidant was maintained by a static mixer series 400 statiflo germany h2o2 influent and effluent concentrations were measured with a potentiostatic online sensor using bypass pipes neon des kuntze instruments germany influent and effluent samples were taken right before and after each reactor after uv oxidation both reactor streams were combined before the water was discharged 2 1 2 determination of removal kinetics in pilot experiments short term experiments were conducted during dry weather conditions flow rates of the pilot system for respective exposure times were calculated and adjusted based on desired fluences current uv intensities and uvt a fluence range of 40 160 mj cm2 was maintained in the smaller reactor lbx 10 and a range of 200 2000 mj cm2 in reactor lbx 90e h2o2 dosing at 10 mg l was adjusted based on respective flow rates before sampling the system was constantly operated with a minimum of ten reactor volumes to establish steady state conditions in the pilot scale system while effluent samples were taken for each setting influent samples were taken hourly the samples were filled in amber glass bottles and stored at 4 c pending analyses during sampling uvt and h2o2 concentration was analyzed on site online measurement of h2o2 was validated for each sample by manual analysis directly after sampling as described in section 2 3 2 in addition nitrate and nitrite concentrations as well as alkalinity were directly analyzed on site doc and torcs analyses were conducted within 24 h after sampling 2 1 3 continuous operation of the pilot scale system to assess a continuous operation of uv h2o2 processes at the wwtp as a function of naturally fluctuating feed water conditions two independent experiments were conducted over a period of five days each the first experiment was scheduled during a dry weather period in the summer from 08 29 09 02 2016 dry weather the second experiment was conducted during a wet weather period from 09 26 09 30 2016 and was dominated by several heavy rain events rain event each day influent and effluent samples were taken at 6 and 9 a m and 12 3 6 and 8 p m for both campaigns a fluence of 800 mj cm2 and a h2o2 dose of 10 mg l were targeted sampling procedure and analyses were conducted analogously to the determination of removal kinetics experiment 2 2 determination of removal kinetics in laboratory scale experiments lab experiments were conducted using a collimated beam device containing three 15 w low pressure hg uv lamps uv technik meyer germany which were installed in an aluminum housing with mounted cooling ribs for active heat dispersion two air coolers were installed to keep the lamps at optimal irradiation temperature of 35 40 c a black 20 cm pvc tube with a diameter of 10 cm was attached to the aluminium housing serving as a quasi collimator to increase radiation through the collimator tube an anodized aluminum uv c reflector uv technik meyer was attached to the inside of the housing lid bent at both sides at an angle of 45 below the collimator a xy cross slide table with a magnetic stirrer placed on top included the mounting for the petri dishes resulting uv c irradiation intensity at the sample position was determined as 1 1 4 mw cm2 on average across the petri dish by a certified uv c surface radiometer sglux germany to verify measurement accuracy of uv intensity a radiometer factor actinometer radiometer of 0 997 was determined by uridine actinometry as described in scheurer et al 2014 experimental procedure followed the standardized method for fluence determination bolton and linden 2003 fluences of 40 2000 mj cm2 were applied to 30 ml of sample in a 100 mm glass petri dish h2o2 was added directly before uv exposure from a stock solution 1 g l h2o2 torcs were present at ambient levels and not spiked into the wastewater dark experiments were conducted in the same experimental set up in triplicates applying dosages of 5 10 15 and 20 mg l h2o2 to investigate direct torc attenuation by h2o2 after 30 min residual h2o2 was quenched in dark experiment samples with na2so3 2 1 m ratio all samples were stored in amber glass bottles at 4 c and analyzed for doc and torcs within 24 h for verification of the pilot scale results a composite sample of the wastewater effluent was taken at the inlet to the aop reactors hourly during pilot scale operation which was subsequently used for lab scale experiments the following day 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 trace organic chemical analysis for torc quantification all samples were filtered through 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filters berrytec germany samples were measured using high performance liquid chromatography knauer platinblue uhplc coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms sciex qtrap 6500 with direct injection isotope dilution was used to account for matrix suppression and instrument variability more detailed description of the analytical method can be found elsewhere müller et al 2017 torcs as well as isotope labelled analytical standards for torcs analysis were purchased of analytical grade all solvents used for liquid chromatography were hplc grade analyzed torcs are summarized in table 2 along with previously reported kinetic data for the reaction with uv light quantum yield and molar absorption and oh radicals and their measured concentrations in wastewater during lab and pilot scale experiments 2 3 2 bulk water parameters h2o2 concentration in wastewater samples was determined according to din 38 409 h15 using titanium iv oxysulfate colorimetry din 38 409 1987 hydrogen peroxide solution h2o2 50 technical grade was obtained from bernd kraft gmbh germany titanium iv oxysulfate solution 2 for h2o2 measurements in wastewater was purchased from sigma aldrich

were analyzed using a dr6000 uv vis spectrophotometer hach germany doc was analyzed after filtration through cellulose nitrate membrane filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm sartorius ag germany on a variotoc cube elementar germany 2 4 modeling prediction of lab and pilot scale experiments was performed by modeling assuming only direct photolysis and oh radical based torc removal pseudo first order kinetics with linear correlation of the logarithmic relative concentration ln c c0 to the fluence f can be assumed for low torc concentrations 1 l n c c 0 k f k u v k r a d i c a l f in this equation k represents the apparent degradation rate constant for a specific compound which equals the sum of the photolytic rate constant kuv and the pseudo first order oxidation rate constant with oh radicals kradical it can be derived according to wols et al 2013 and bolton and stefan 2002 as shown in equation 2 for the use of monochromatic lp lamps the photolytic reaction rate constant kuv can be calculated from the quantum yield ϕ mol einstein the molar absorption coefficient ε l mol cm and the energy of a mole of photons at 254 nm u254 j einstein the oxidative degradation rate constant

radicals and the overall scavenging capacity ki oh si s 1 which is described as the product of a scavenger concentration multiplied by its second order rate constant with oh keen et al 2014 in this study scavenging capacity was calculated by using rate constants summarized in table 3 the rate constant for doc was selected to optimize model results for oxidation of photo resistant compounds carbamazepine and primidone in lab and pilot scale comparison experiments this value was then used to calculate scavenging capacity during long term operation concentrations of scavengers were converted into molar concentration units 2 k k u v k r a d i c a l ln 10 φ ε u 254 2 ln 10 φ h ε h u 254 k o h h 2 o 2 σ k i s i k h h 2 o 2 for oh radical based reactions a steady state oh radical concentration is assumed compound specific values for ϕ ε kuv and koh are given in table 2 3 results discussion 3 1 lab scale determination of uv photolysis and oh radical enhanced removal lab scale cbd experiments with effluent from the wwtp were conducted to quantify oxidant specific removal of torcs and to evaluate uv h2o2 viability as an advanced treatment process for tertiary treated effluents h2o2 experiments without uv irradiation revealed degradation of 10 for the 15 torcs investigated in all experiments without significant influence of h2o2 concentration on compound removal the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constants of torcs kobs from lab scale uv photolysis and uv h2o2 experiments are compared in fig 1 kinetic data for tcep and phenytoin are not shown since their ambient concentrations in the tertiary effluent were below the limit of quantification in this experiment for each compound the natural logarithm of the relative residual concentration c c0 from 11 experiments at different uv fluences is plotted as a function of uv fluence regression curves were determined and the respective slopes representing kobs were obtained exact values of kobs and r2 are reported in table s1 supplemental information the torcs presented in fig 1 are sorted according to their observed photolytic reactivity and classified based on published kuv values into photo susceptible 1 10 3 cm2 mj moderately photo susceptible 1 10 4 1 10 3 cm2 mj and photo resistant 1 10 4 cm2 mj compounds observed photolytic degradation rate constants for photo susceptible compounds like diclofenac iopromide and sulfamethoxazole were high with values of 67 25 and 14 10 4 cm2 mj respectively achieving up to 99 removal at fluence of 600 mj cm2 climbazole tramadol sotalol citalopram benzotriazole venlafaxine and metoprolol exhibited observed photolytic degradation rate constants in the range of 1 4 8 10 4 cm2 mj resulting in moderate removal at 600 mj cm2 while primidone carbamazepine and gabapentin with rate constants of 1 10 4 cm2 mj were considered photo resistant in the following sections these photo resistant compounds are also used to determine oh radical exposures for the uv h2o2 process in comparison to kuv values reported in the literature table 2 all experimental kobs values were slightly lower for tramadol no reported kuv could be found however based on lab scale experiments the photolytic reactivity could be determined as 3 62 10 4 cm2 mj due to the unique scavenging of a given water matrix observed rate constants for aop are very site specific in our study the addition of 10 mg l h2o2 led to an increase of kobs values for all substances except sulfamethoxazole where no significant difference could be observed between photolytic and oh radical enhanced kobs values the addition of h2o2 resulted in little benefit for photo susceptible compounds only minor enhancement of 1 6 14 could be observed apparent rate constants for moderately photo susceptible compounds were enhanced by factors varying between 1 87 climbazole and 6 1 metoprolol even though the radical enhanced kobs value for sotalol is likely an outlier fig 1 its enhancement factor of 5 9 is within the range for moderately photo susceptible compounds for photo resistant compounds enhancement by h2o2 addition can only be quantified for primidone enhancement factor of 9 5 since photolysis of carbamazepine and gabapentin did not result in significant removal in uv h2o2 the kobs value of carbamazepine exceeds the kobs of gabapentin by a factor of 1 9 even though respective koh values are similar table 2 based on the dataset no reasonable explanation could be derived from this phenomenon kobs values determined in this study confirm values reported in other studies rosario ortiz et al 2010 wols et al 2013 gerrity et al 2016 lee et al 2016 3 2 verification of results at pilot scale the observed kinetic rate constants at pilot scale kobs pp were compared with those determined during lab scale experiments kobs cbd to evaluate consistency in the measured rate constants between the two scales of treatment to enable comparison of pilot and lab scale oxidation with minimum influence of water matrix fluctuations lab experiments were conducted with tertiary effluent collected as a composite sample on the day of pilot scale experiments average water quality parameters of lab and pilot scale experiments are reported in table 3 the ratios of observed reaction rate constants in pilot and lab scale experiments kobs pp kobs cbd are illustrated in fig 2 for uv photolysis and uv h2o2 the median kobs ratio for all data points in this evaluation is 1 06 statistical tests did not show any systematic difference of lab and pilot scale kobs values p 0 24 indicating that determination of fluence was accurate in both systems and reactor geometry did not show a general impact on treatment efficiency however the kobs ratio for photo resistant compounds showed significantly better agreement between the two scales than for moderately photo susceptible compounds a general reason for performance deviations between lab and pilot scale might be the fluctuating water matrix during continuous operation however water matrix parameters between lab and pilot scale tests were very similar indicating that the total amount of scavenging did not vary at the two different scales even though the wastewater samples used in the lab scale investigations were collected hourly during the pilot scale experiment instant back wash of granular media filter cells could cause a temporary increase of uvt or change in scavengers which would not be reflected in the composite sample and therefore is neglected in lab scale uv h2o2 average torc attenuation evaluation however this only applies to single samples and not to kobs values that comprise the combined 11 samples collected throughout the pilot scale experimental procedure furthermore matrix effects would induce systematic errors rather than deviation of single substances another possible explanation for the observed deviation of torcs with lower or no photo susceptibility might be the lower significance of kobs values for photolysis the plotted natural logarithm of c c0 did in some cases not exceed correlation coefficients of r2 0 9 see table s1 which therefore lowered the confidence of these specific kobs values in addition analytical inaccuracies might have occurred as compound removal was measured without spiking of torcs influent concentrations of some compounds e g sotalol and primidone were close to the limit of quantification introducing larger uncertainties regarding removal efficiency table 2 the compounds benzotriazole and sotalol showed largest differences in kinetic constants from pilot and lab scale operations benzotriazole was better removed at pilot scale by a factor of 1 8 uv h2o2 and 3 7 photolysis while sotalol was removed to a higher extent during pilot scale experiments due to photolysis 4 8 and to a lower extent due to uv h2o2 0 3 to the best of our knowledge such discrepancy has not been reported and discussed previously further research is needed to understand removal of these compounds 3 2 1 modeling of lab and pilot scale uv h2o2 sample specific data including water quality parameters as well as process parameters uv fluence and h2o2 dose from lab and pilot scale experiments were used as inputs for the model validation exercise in this study oh radical scavenging by hydrogen peroxide nitrite nitrate doc and bicarbonate was incorporated into the model following the approach described by wols et al 2013 specific second order rate constants used for the reaction of different scavengers with oh radicals as well as their average concentration in lab and pilot scale experiments are summarized in table 3 depending on the water matrix doc can contribute up to 95 of total scavenging capacity keen et al 2014 its reactivity with oh radicals is reported as 1 7 7 9 108 mc 1s 1 westerhoff et al 2007 rosario ortiz et al 2008 katsoyiannis et al 2011 mckay et al 2011 nagarnaik and boulanger 2011 lee et al 2013 in this study the rate constant was adjusted to a value of 3 0 108 mc 1s 1 which showed the best modeled fit for photo resistant torcs from lab and pilot scale rate constant determination experiments fig 3 nitrite is described as a scavenger with a second order reaction rate constant with oh radicals of 1 1010 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1987 since its reactivity with oh radicals is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than the reactivity of most torcs 108 109 m 1s 1 huber et al 2003 wols and hofman caris 2012 low nitrite concentrations of 1 mg l can significantly impact the performance of an aop in biological wastewater treatment nitrite can result from insufficient nitrification and denitrification and should therefore always be considered as a possible scavenger when oxidative treatment is applied downstream of biological nutrient removal processes nitrate was also included as a relevant scavenger due to highly variable concentration even though its reactivity with oh radicals is relatively low table 3 predicted pseudo first order removal rate constants are compared with results from lab and pilot scale experiments in fig 3 modeling depicts an overestimation for both uv photolysis and uv h2o2 in pilot and lab scale experiments with a median kobs ratio of 0 87 for all data points 0 78 for photolysis and 0 91 for aop observed overestimation in both processes can be attributed to photolytic degradation of torcs since the model for radical scavenger capacity was adjusted to experimental data a slight overestimation of photo resistant compounds applying a similar model was also observed by gerrity et al 2016 photolytic kobs values determined in this study are slightly lower compared to kuv values reported in the literature table 2 which might explain the general modeled overestimation over most torcs since a systematic error in photolytic rate constants from literature is unlikely inaccuracies in fluence determination are suspected to cause the observed overestimation this would also apply to h2o2 photolysis and consequently oh radical generation however it has to be noted that the estimation of kdoc oh to model experimental data also compensated for overestimation of h2o2 photolysis during radical generation modeling results for benzotriazole exhibit highest variances kobs ratio of 0 4 1 5 which is based on the different scale comparison fig 2 2 4 times higher attenuation was achieved at pilot scale compared to the cbd leading to a substantial over or underestimation of experimental kobs values other possible reasons for deviations between modeled and experimental data are simplified assumptions that were set within this study the model only considers direct photolysis and oh radical based oxidation in wastewater however a variety of complex radical side reactions occur indirect photolysis resulting in additional oh radicals dong and rosario ortiz 2012 and radical chain reactions involving carbonate liao et al 2001 wu and linden 2010 chlorine liao et al 2001 sulfate and phosphate radicals as well as reactive oxygen species e g perhydroxyl and superoxide radicals however this would result in an underestimation of torc removal consideration of only four scavengers neglects the influence of various other inorganic scavengers and consequently reduces the estimated scavenging capacity in general all reaction rate constants were taken from literature reported values might differ from real reactivities for each torc 3 3 continuous pilot scale operation of uv h2o2 the evaluation of water matrix influence on uv h2o2 oxidation performance was investigated in two continuous pilot scale experiments for a period of five days each application of 800 mj cm2 and 10 mg l h2o2 was targeted in both experiments however final uv fluence and h2o2 dose were slightly higher during dry weather compared to rain event experiments table 4 for evaluation chemical parameters of the water matrix and respective torc removal were investigated and assessed by descriptive statistics influent concentrations of relevant water quality parameters are summarized in table 4 boundary conditions for these experimental periods were chosen to reflect the highest variances during biological wastewater treatment the dry weather experiment was scheduled during the summer holiday season resulting in constantly low nutrient loads and efficient removal of scavenger concentrations during the activated sludge process as well as during granular media filtration based on annual average water quality data of wwtp gut marienhof during the rain event higher nitrogen loads were insufficiently removed during post denitrification and resulted in nitrite peaks of up to 2 mgn l uvt at 254 nm could be measured at 74 3 during dry weather experiment and slightly lower values during the rain event week 71 4 while no3 n bicarbonate and doc concentrations were similar in both experiments large fluctuations were observed for average no2 n concentrations of 0 13 mgn l during dry weather and 1 1 mgn l during the rain event experiment 3 3 1 water matrix influences on torc removal efficiency torc removal results are illustrated in fig 4 during continuous pilot scale operation at constant uv fluence and h2o2 dosage the removal of photo susceptible moderately photo susceptible and most photo resistant compounds including outliers varied in a range of 44 99 6 1 90 and 1 81 respectively the respective removal is in agreement with the illustrated reaction rate constant groupings depicted in fig 1 torc removal during the rain event indicated significantly lower oxidation performance compared to the dry weather experiment for all substances except diclofenac which was removed by more than 2 orders of magnitude in both sampling periods since it is highly reactive to direct photolysis differences in oxidation performance during the two continuous experiments can be explained based on slightly different process parameters and water quality parameters summarized in table 4 also higher variances in nitrite concentrations could have influenced the scattering of removal data resulting in a wider range of 25th and 75th percentiles during the rain event illustrated by a wider spread in the boxplots a detailed chronological sequence of oxidation performance illustrated by four representative substances iopromide sulfamethoxazole primidone and tcep is shown in figure s 1 supplemental information contribution of individual scavengers to overall scavenging capacity during continuous operation of the uv h2o2 pilot scale experiments is illustrated in fig 5 scavenging by nitrate is not considered in the figure since its scavenging capacity is three orders of magnitude lower than the illustrated ones calculated scavenger capacities agree well with the range of values reported in the literature lee et al 2013 results confirm that continuous operation during dry weather condition revealed a consistent scavenging potential while experiments during the rain event exhibited highly variable scavenging capacities however scavenging capacities by doc and bicarbonate remained mostly stable and at a comparable level in both weeks in september the overall scavenging capacity was dominated by nitrite peaks in the tertiary effluent these data confirm the importance to monitor and manage nitrite concentration if oxidative processes for advanced treatment are considered 3 3 2 influence of scavenging capacity on oh radical exposure to determine the impact of scavenging capacity on oh radical based oxidation performance the oh radical exposure was used as a figure of merit to assess oh radical abundance over time compound specific reaction rate constants of photo resistant radical indicators were used to calculate the oh radical exposure rosenfeldt et al 2006 3 o h d t m s ln c c 0 k o h i m 1 s 1 based on the data obtained from continuous experiments oh radical exposure was calculated from relative residual concentrations c c0 of primidone and carbamazepine gabapentin was not included in the calculations since photolytic rate constants were not available for this compound average exposures from both experiments are shown in fig 6 as a function of the radical scavenging capacity data from fig 5 the dashed line represents calculated exposures applying the model for constant fluence of 800 mj cm2 and h2o2 dosage of 10 mg l during the dry weather experiment oh radical exposure values ranged from 4 8 10 11 m s to 1 3 10 10 m s whereas higher variation of scavenging capacity during the rain event experiment resulted in a wider range of oh radical exposure from 2 9 10 12 to 1 4 10 10 m s relatively large extent of scattering during the rain event experiment might be explained by unstable nitrite concentrations in reactor influent samples it is assumed that sampling did not exactly represent the true water quality in effluent samples with increasing scavenging capacities the oh radical exposure decreased following a quasi hyperbolic correlation the findings could be corroborated using the calculated oh radical exposure based on modeling performing an ordinary least squares regression analysis between modeled and observed data points the median of all residuals is determined as 23 and 121 for dry weather and rain event experiments respectively three major conclusions can be drawn from these results at the municipal wwtp gut marienhof a high impact of oh radical scavenging on radical formation and oxidative compound removal was identified which triggers the need for monitoring and control of effluent water quality the modeled and experimental correlation between scavenging capacity and oh radical exposure indicates the possibility of oh radical exposure prediction by water matrix parameters and proves its applicability at pilot or full scale which confirms results by gerrity et al 2016 online sensors for water quality parameters i e no2 n doc and hco3 are commercially available and could be considered for future aop process control torc removal from tertiary effluents by uv h2o2 is highly dependent on nitrite concentrations therefore oxidation performance of uv h2o2 can be improved by nitrite control in wwtp effluents 4 conclusion this study demonstrates through pilot scale investigations that uv h2o2 is applicable to remove torcs from municipal wastewater effluents uv h2o2 pilot plant performance was verified by a bench scale collimated beam device for removal of 15 torcs occurring at ambient concentrations and representing a range of photolytic and oh radical reactivity in wastewater effluent the impact of water matrices on oh radical exposure was evaluated during continuous pilot scale operation using the removal kinetics of photo resistant ambient torcs furthermore successful application of a model was confirmed using uv fluence h2o2 dosage and standard water quality parameters i e doc no3 no2 and hco3 as input parameter key findings of this study are high variations of oh radical exposure during pilot scale uv h2o2 operation were observed primarily due to fluctuations of nitrite concentration which suggests the need for online water quality monitoring and control of tertiary effluent nutrient removal if uv h2o2 is implemented a correlation between oh radical exposure and scavenging capacity could be determined and verified by modeling this correlation reveals the possibility of oh radical exposure prediction by water matrix

19656,this study investigated the removal of 15 trace organic chemicals torcs occurring at ambient concentrations from municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent by advanced oxidation using uv h2o2 at pilot scale pseudo first order rate constants kobs for photolytic as well as combined oxidative and photolytic degradation observed at pilot scale were validated with results from a bench scale collimated beam device no significant difference was determined between pilot and lab scale performance during continuous pilot scale operation at constant uv fluence of 800 mj cm2 and h2o2 dosage of 10 mg l the removal of various torcs was investigated the average observed removal for photo susceptible kuv 10 3 cm2 mj like diclofenac iopromide and sulfamethoxazole moderately photo susceptible 10 4 kuv 10 3 cm2 mj like climbazole tramadol sotalol citalopram benzotriazole venlafaxine and metoprolol and most photo resistant kuv 10 4 cm2 mj like primidone carbamazepine and gabapentin compounds was 90 49 and 37 including outliers respectively the poorly reactive compound tcep was not significantly eliminated during pilot scale experiments additionally based on removal kinetics of photo resistant torcs continuous pilot scale operation revealed high variations of oh radical exposure determined from removal kinetics of photo resistant torcs primarily due to nitrite concentration fluctuations in the feed water furthermore a correlation between oh radical exposure and scavenging capacity could be determined and verified by mechanistic modeling using uv fluence h2o2 dosage and standard water quality parameters i e doc no3 no2 and hco3 as model input data this correlation revealed the possibility of oh radical exposure prediction by water matrix parameters and proved its

industrial chemicals have been detected and extensively investigated in the aquatic environment and in all parts of the water cycle lim 2008 blum et al 2017 hofman caris et al 2017 yang et al 2017 besides urban and agricultural run off wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents are considered to be the most significant torc emitters to the aqueous environment gros et al 2010 luo et al 2014 dong et al 2015 although concentrations hardly exceed μg l concentrations persistent substances remain in wwtp effluents being discharged in surface waters since conventional physical and biological wastewater treatment can only partially remove these substances lim 2008 zhang et al 2008 luo et al 2014 for the removal of these compounds from wwtp effluents advanced oxidation might be a promising treatment approach advanced oxidation processes aop are generally defined as processes that intentionally form highly reactive radicals in situ comninellis et al 2008 yang et al 2014 specifically oh radicals produced are known for their rapid and non selective oxidation of organic water contaminants with second order reaction rate constants in the range of 108 1010 m 1s 1 in current practice utilization of aops is mostly limited to highly treated wastewater effluents including reverse osmosis treatment and advanced drinking water treatment with high uv transmittance among uv based aops uv h2o2 where h2o2 is directly activated by uv light to form two oh radicals is a commonly applied aop in water reuse and advanced drinking water treatment for contaminant as well as taste and odor removal torc removal during low pressure uv h2o2 is achieved by two major reaction pathways direct photolysis by uv c irradiation at 254 nm and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals formed in situ since generated oh radicals react unselectively with all water constituents transformation of target compounds in wastewater is competing with oxidation of other organic and inorganic compounds the occurrence of so called radical scavengers which terminate radical chain reactions can significantly reduce oxidation efficiency in aops keen et al 2012 furthermore changes in uv transmittance directly affect the activation of h2o2 therefore uv h2o2 effectiveness is highly susceptible to water matrix changes the influence of scavenging on uv h2o2 has been investigated thoroughly liao et al 2001 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 and a good overview of scavengers and their reactivity with oh radicals is given by wols and hofman caris 2012 kinetic models can be adopted to estimate the influence of radical scavengers on the degradation performance and represent a useful tool to predict torc degradation by uv h2o2 in different water matrices as proposed by bolton and stefan 2002 and wols et al 2013 uv h2o2 is a thoroughly examined aop pereira et al 2007 for all kinds of water applications with most studies performed at laboratory scale yuan et al 2011 only a limited number of studies however have been carried out specifically on wastewater effluent at the laboratory rosario ortiz et al 2010 keen and linden 2013 yu et al 2015 or pilot scale audenaert et al 2011 köhler et al 2012 de la cruz et al 2013 lester et al 2014 merel et al 2015 cedat et al 2016 some pilot scale studies on uv h2o2 investigated its viability for torc removal sarathy et al 2011 wang et al 2015 cedat et al 2016 chu et al 2016 gerrity et al 2016 miralles cuevas et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge verifying pilot scale studies using data from standardized lab scale systems combined with mechanistic modeling efforts are lacking in the peer reviewed literature furthermore little is known about uv h2o2 applicability for municipal wastewater effluents with respect to oh radical scavenging across changing water qualities gerrity et al 2016 lee et al 2016 in this study we characterize the applicability of uv h2o2 for advanced municipal wastewater treatment using lab and pilot scale set ups piloting results are directly compared to results conducted using a lab scale collimated beam device cbd to verify the up scaling effort a total of 15 torcs occurring at ambient concentrations and representing a range of different photolytic and oh radical reactivities were measured to assess the viability of uv h2o2 for continuous treatment of tertiary effluents a comprehensive investigation of oh radical scavenging caused by different water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon doc nitrite nitrate and alkalinity was performed during continuous operation of a pilot scale uv h2o2 system finally the experimental results were compared to mechanistic modeling estimations 2 experimental approach 2 1 uv aop pilot scale experiments 2 1 1 description of the pilot scale setup the shipping container based uv aop pilot scale plant was designed by wedeco xylem germany and installed on site at the wwtp gut marienhof munich germany with a capacity of 11 35 m3 per hour in 2015 the wwtp with a capacity of one million population equivalents treated approximately 55 7 million m³ of wastewater the treatment plant consists of a mechanical treatment stage including screens aerated sand fat traps and preliminary sedimentation followed by a two stage activated sludge process for biological carbon and nutrient removal the activated sludge process is a two stage biological process with an intermediate clarification stage the first stage has a solids retention time of 2 3 days and the second stage of 6 8 days the water is then filtered using tertiary granular media filters with a resulting uv transmittance at 254 nm uvt of 65 75 relevant water quality parameters of the granular media filter effluent are reported in table 3 during summer months methanol is added to a third of all 24 granular media filter cells as an external carbon source for denitrification furthermore the filter effluent is disinfected by a low pressure lp uv system at a targeted fluence of 50 mj cm2 from may september to maintain microbial bathing water quality in the river isar the pilot scale system consisted of two lp uv reactors wedeco lbx 90e and lbx 10 xylem germany operated to deliver high 100 4000 mj cm2 and low 40 400 mj cm2 levels of fluence respectively see specifications in table 1 the pilot system was fed with tertiary effluent delivered by an external process water pump station the inflow was divided into two streams and controlled by diaphragm valves mv310 asv stübbe germany flow rates were measured by magnetic inductive flow sensors proline promag 50 e h messtechnik germany uv intensity was measured by two internal radiometers and corrected by manufacturer specific correction factors based on uv transmittance fig s3 supplemental information uvt was measured by an online flow through sensor wedeco tmo iv xylem germany both reactors were equipped with mechanical cleaning wipers to minimize the influence of deposits resulting in reduced intensity over time h2o2 was injected by a magnetic dosing pump gamma x prominent germany with a maximum flow rate of 6 8 l h homogeneous distribution of the oxidant was maintained by a static mixer series 400 statiflo germany h2o2 influent and effluent concentrations were measured with a potentiostatic online sensor using bypass pipes neon des kuntze instruments germany influent and effluent samples were taken right before and after each reactor after uv oxidation both reactor streams were combined before the water was discharged 2 1 2 determination of removal kinetics in pilot experiments short term experiments were conducted during dry weather conditions flow rates of the pilot system for respective exposure times were calculated and adjusted based on desired fluences current uv intensities and uvt a fluence range of 40 160 mj cm2 was maintained in the smaller reactor lbx 10 and a range of 200 2000 mj cm2 in reactor lbx 90e h2o2 dosing at 10 mg l was adjusted based on respective flow rates before sampling the system was constantly operated with a minimum of ten reactor volumes to establish steady state conditions in the pilot scale system while effluent samples were taken for each setting influent samples were taken hourly the samples were filled in amber glass bottles and stored at 4 c pending analyses during sampling uvt and h2o2 concentration was analyzed on site online measurement of h2o2 was validated for each sample by manual analysis directly after sampling as described in section 2 3 2 in addition nitrate and nitrite concentrations as well as alkalinity were directly analyzed on site doc and torcs analyses were conducted within 24 h after sampling 2 1 3 continuous operation of the pilot scale system to assess a continuous operation of uv h2o2 processes at the wwtp as a function of naturally fluctuating feed water conditions two independent experiments were conducted over a period of five days each the first experiment was scheduled during a dry weather period in the summer from 08 29 09 02 2016 dry weather the second experiment was conducted during a wet weather period from 09 26 09 30 2016 and was dominated by several heavy rain events rain event each day influent and effluent samples were taken at 6 and 9 a m and 12 3 6 and 8 p m for both campaigns a fluence of 800 mj cm2 and a h2o2 dose of 10 mg l were targeted sampling procedure and analyses were conducted analogously to the determination of removal kinetics experiment 2 2 determination of removal kinetics in laboratory scale experiments lab experiments were conducted using a collimated beam device containing three 15 w low pressure hg uv lamps uv technik meyer germany which were installed in an aluminum housing with mounted cooling ribs for active heat dispersion two air coolers were installed to keep the lamps at optimal irradiation temperature of 35 40 c a black 20 cm pvc tube with a diameter of 10 cm was attached to the aluminium housing serving as a quasi collimator to increase radiation through the collimator tube an anodized aluminum uv c reflector uv technik meyer was attached to the inside of the housing lid bent at both sides at an angle of 45 below the collimator a xy cross slide table with a magnetic stirrer placed on top included the mounting for the petri dishes resulting uv c irradiation intensity at the sample position was determined as 1 1 4 mw cm2 on average across the petri dish by a certified uv c surface radiometer sglux germany to verify measurement accuracy of uv intensity a radiometer factor actinometer radiometer of 0 997 was determined by uridine actinometry as described in scheurer et al 2014 experimental procedure followed the standardized method for fluence determination bolton and linden 2003 fluences of 40 2000 mj cm2 were applied to 30 ml of sample in a 100 mm glass petri dish h2o2 was added directly before uv exposure from a stock solution 1 g l h2o2 torcs were present at ambient levels and not spiked into the wastewater dark experiments were conducted in the same experimental set up in triplicates applying dosages of 5 10 15 and 20 mg l h2o2 to investigate direct torc attenuation by h2o2 after 30 min residual h2o2 was quenched in dark experiment samples with na2so3 2 1 m ratio all samples were stored in amber glass bottles at 4 c and analyzed for doc and torcs within 24 h for verification of the pilot scale results a composite sample of the wastewater effluent was taken at the inlet to the aop reactors hourly during pilot scale operation which was subsequently used for lab scale experiments the following day 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 trace organic chemical analysis for torc quantification all samples were filtered through

torcs as well as isotope labelled analytical standards for torcs analysis were purchased of analytical grade all solvents used for liquid chromatography were hplc grade analyzed torcs are summarized in table 2 along with previously reported kinetic data for the reaction with uv light quantum yield and molar absorption and oh radicals and their measured concentrations in wastewater during lab and pilot scale experiments 2 3 2 bulk water parameters h2o2 concentration in wastewater samples was determined according to din 38 409 h15 using titanium iv oxysulfate colorimetry din 38 409 1987

were analyzed using a dr6000 uv vis spectrophotometer hach germany doc was analyzed after filtration through cellulose nitrate membrane filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm sartorius ag germany on a variotoc cube elementar germany 2 4 modeling prediction of lab and pilot scale experiments was performed by modeling assuming only direct photolysis and oh radical based torc removal pseudo first

equation k represents the apparent degradation rate constant for a specific compound which equals the sum of the photolytic rate constant kuv and the pseudo first order oxidation rate constant with oh radicals kradical it can be derived according to wols et al 2013 and bolton and stefan 2002 as shown in equation 2 for the use of monochromatic lp lamps the photolytic reaction rate constant kuv can be calculated from the quantum yield ϕ mol einstein the molar absorption coefficient ε l mol cm and the energy of a mole of photons at 254 nm u254 j einstein the oxidative degradation rate constant

radicals and the overall scavenging capacity ki oh si s 1 which is described as the product of a scavenger concentration multiplied by its second order rate constant with oh keen et al 2014 in this study scavenging capacity was calculated by using rate constants summarized in table 3 the rate constant for doc was selected to optimize model results for oxidation of photo resistant compounds carbamazepine and primidone in lab and pilot scale comparison experiments this value was then used to calculate scavenging capacity during long term operation concentrations of scavengers were

concentration is assumed compound specific values for ϕ ε kuv and koh are given in table 2 3 results discussion 3 1 lab scale determination of uv photolysis and oh radical enhanced removal lab scale cbd experiments with effluent from the wwtp were conducted to quantify oxidant specific removal of torcs and to evaluate uv h2o2 viability as an advanced treatment process for tertiary treated effluents h2o2 experiments without uv irradiation revealed degradation of 10 for the 15 torcs investigated in all experiments without significant influence of h2o2 concentration on compound removal the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constants of torcs kobs from lab scale uv photolysis and uv h2o2 experiments are compared in fig 1 kinetic data for tcep and phenytoin are not shown since their ambient concentrations in the tertiary effluent were below the limit of quantification in this experiment for each compound the natural logarithm of the relative residual concentration c c0 from 11 experiments at different uv fluences is plotted as a function of uv fluence regression curves were determined and the respective slopes representing kobs were obtained exact values of kobs and r2 are reported in table s1 supplemental information the torcs presented in fig 1 are sorted according to their observed photolytic reactivity and classified based on published kuv values into photo susceptible 1 10 3 cm2 mj moderately photo susceptible 1 10 4 1 10 3 cm2 mj and photo resistant 1 10 4 cm2 mj compounds observed photolytic degradation rate constants for photo susceptible compounds like diclofenac iopromide and sulfamethoxazole were high with values of 67 25 and 14 10 4 cm2 mj respectively achieving up to 99 removal at fluence of 600 mj cm2 climbazole tramadol sotalol citalopram benzotriazole venlafaxine and metoprolol exhibited observed photolytic degradation rate constants in the range of 1 4 8 10 4 cm2 mj resulting in moderate removal at 600 mj cm2 while primidone carbamazepine and gabapentin with rate constants of 1 10 4 cm2 mj were considered photo resistant in the following sections these photo resistant compounds are also used to determine oh radical exposures for the uv h2o2 process in comparison to kuv values reported in the literature table 2 all experimental kobs values were slightly lower for tramadol no reported kuv could be found however based on lab scale experiments the photolytic reactivity could be determined as 3 62 10 4 cm2 mj due to the unique scavenging of a given water matrix observed rate constants for aop are very site specific in our study the addition of 10 mg l h2o2 led to an increase of kobs values for all substances except sulfamethoxazole where no significant difference could be observed between photolytic and oh radical enhanced kobs values the addition of h2o2 resulted in little benefit for photo susceptible compounds only minor enhancement of 1 6 14 could be observed apparent rate constants for moderately photo susceptible compounds were enhanced by factors varying between 1 87 climbazole and 6 1 metoprolol even though the radical enhanced kobs value for sotalol is likely an outlier fig 1 its enhancement factor of 5 9 is within the range for moderately photo susceptible compounds for photo resistant compounds enhancement by h2o2 addition can only be quantified for primidone enhancement factor of 9 5 since photolysis of carbamazepine and gabapentin did not result in significant removal in uv h2o2 the kobs value of carbamazepine exceeds the kobs of gabapentin by a factor of 1 9 even though respective koh values are similar table 2 based on the dataset no reasonable explanation could be derived from this phenomenon kobs values determined in this study confirm values reported in other studies rosario ortiz et al 2010 wols et al 2013 gerrity et al 2016 lee et al 2016 3 2 verification of results at pilot scale the observed kinetic rate constants at pilot scale kobs pp were compared with those determined during lab scale experiments kobs cbd to evaluate consistency in the measured rate constants between the two scales of treatment to enable comparison of pilot and lab scale oxidation with minimum influence of water matrix fluctuations lab experiments were conducted with tertiary effluent collected as a composite sample on the day of pilot scale experiments average water quality parameters of lab and pilot scale experiments are reported in table 3 the ratios of observed reaction rate constants in pilot and lab scale experiments kobs pp kobs cbd are illustrated in fig 2 for uv photolysis and uv h2o2 the median kobs ratio for all data points in this evaluation is 1 06 statistical tests did not show any systematic difference of lab and pilot scale kobs values p 0 24 indicating that determination of fluence was accurate in both systems and reactor geometry did not show a general impact on treatment efficiency however the kobs ratio for photo resistant compounds showed significantly better agreement between the two scales than for moderately photo susceptible compounds a general reason for performance deviations between lab and pilot scale might be the fluctuating water matrix during continuous operation however water matrix parameters between lab and pilot scale tests were very similar indicating that the total amount of scavenging did not vary at the two different scales even though the wastewater samples used in the lab scale investigations were collected hourly during the pilot scale experiment instant back wash of granular media filter cells could cause a temporary increase of uvt or change in scavengers which would not be reflected in the composite sample and therefore is neglected in lab scale uv h2o2 average torc attenuation evaluation however this only applies to single samples and not to kobs values that comprise the combined 11 samples collected throughout the pilot scale experimental procedure furthermore matrix effects would induce systematic errors rather than deviation of single substances another possible explanation for the observed deviation of torcs with lower or no photo susceptibility might be the lower significance of kobs values for photolysis the plotted natural logarithm of c c0 did in some cases not exceed correlation coefficients of r2 0 9 see table s1 which therefore lowered the confidence of these specific kobs values in addition analytical inaccuracies might have occurred as compound removal was measured without spiking of torcs influent concentrations of some compounds e g sotalol and primidone were close to the limit of quantification introducing larger uncertainties regarding removal efficiency table 2 the compounds benzotriazole and sotalol showed largest differences in kinetic constants from pilot and lab scale operations benzotriazole was better removed at pilot scale by a factor of 1 8 uv h2o2 and 3 7 photolysis while sotalol was removed to a higher extent during pilot scale experiments due to photolysis 4 8 and to a lower extent due to uv h2o2 0 3 to the best of our knowledge such discrepancy has not been reported and discussed previously further research is needed to understand removal of these compounds 3 2 1 modeling of lab and pilot scale uv h2o2 sample specific data including water quality parameters as well as process parameters uv fluence and h2o2 dose from lab and pilot scale experiments were used as inputs for the model validation exercise in this study oh radical scavenging by hydrogen peroxide nitrite nitrate doc and bicarbonate was incorporated into the model following the approach described by wols et al 2013 specific second order rate constants used for the reaction of different scavengers with oh radicals as well as their average concentration in lab and pilot scale experiments are summarized in table 3 depending on the water matrix doc can contribute up to 95 of total scavenging capacity keen et al 2014 its reactivity with oh radicals is reported as 1 7 7 9 108 mc 1s 1 westerhoff et al 2007 rosario ortiz et al 2008 katsoyiannis et al 2011 mckay et al 2011 nagarnaik and boulanger 2011 lee et al 2013 in this study the rate constant was adjusted to a value of 3 0 108 mc 1s 1 which showed the best modeled fit for photo resistant torcs from lab and pilot scale rate constant determination experiments fig 3 nitrite is described as a scavenger with a second order reaction rate constant with oh radicals of 1 1010 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1987 since its reactivity with oh radicals is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than the reactivity of most torcs 108 109 m 1s 1 huber et al 2003 wols and hofman caris 2012 low nitrite concentrations of 1 mg l can significantly impact the performance of an aop in biological wastewater treatment nitrite can result from insufficient nitrification and denitrification and should therefore always be considered as a possible scavenger when oxidative treatment is applied downstream of biological nutrient removal processes nitrate was also included as a relevant scavenger due to highly variable concentration even though its reactivity with oh radicals is relatively low table 3 predicted pseudo first order removal rate constants are compared with results from lab and pilot scale experiments in fig 3 modeling depicts an overestimation for both uv photolysis and uv h2o2 in pilot and lab scale experiments with a median kobs ratio of 0 87 for all data points 0 78 for photolysis and 0 91 for aop observed overestimation in both processes can be attributed to photolytic degradation of torcs since the model for radical scavenger capacity was adjusted to experimental data a slight overestimation of photo resistant compounds applying a similar model was also observed by gerrity et al 2016 photolytic kobs values determined in this study are slightly lower compared to kuv values reported in the literature table 2 which might explain the general modeled overestimation over most torcs since a systematic error in photolytic rate constants from literature is unlikely inaccuracies in fluence determination are suspected to cause the observed overestimation this would also apply to h2o2 photolysis and consequently oh radical generation however it has to be noted that the estimation of kdoc oh to model experimental data also compensated for overestimation of h2o2 photolysis during radical generation modeling results for benzotriazole exhibit highest variances kobs ratio of 0 4 1 5 which is based on the different scale comparison fig 2 2 4 times higher attenuation was achieved at pilot scale compared to the cbd leading to a substantial over or underestimation of experimental kobs values other possible reasons for deviations between modeled and experimental data are simplified assumptions that were set within this study the model only considers direct photolysis and oh radical based oxidation in wastewater however a variety of complex radical side reactions occur indirect photolysis resulting in additional oh radicals dong and rosario ortiz 2012 and radical chain reactions involving carbonate liao et al 2001 wu and linden 2010 chlorine liao et al 2001 sulfate and phosphate radicals as well as reactive oxygen species e g perhydroxyl and superoxide radicals however this would result in an underestimation of torc removal consideration of only four scavengers neglects the influence of various other inorganic scavengers and consequently reduces the estimated scavenging capacity in general all reaction rate constants were taken from literature reported values might differ from real reactivities for each torc 3 3 continuous pilot scale operation of uv h2o2 the evaluation of water matrix influence on uv h2o2 oxidation performance was investigated in two continuous pilot scale experiments for a period of five days each application of 800 mj cm2 and 10 mg l h2o2 was targeted in both experiments however final uv fluence and h2o2 dose were slightly higher during dry weather compared to rain event experiments table 4 for evaluation chemical parameters of the water matrix and respective torc removal were investigated and assessed by descriptive statistics influent concentrations of relevant water quality parameters are summarized in table 4 boundary conditions for these experimental periods were chosen to reflect the highest variances during biological wastewater treatment the dry weather experiment was scheduled during the summer holiday season resulting in constantly low nutrient loads and efficient removal of scavenger concentrations during the activated sludge process as well as during granular media filtration based on annual average water quality data of wwtp gut marienhof during the rain event higher nitrogen loads were insufficiently removed during post denitrification and resulted in nitrite peaks of up to 2 mgn l uvt at 254 nm could be measured at 74 3 during dry weather experiment and slightly lower values during the rain event week 71 4 while no3 n bicarbonate and doc concentrations were similar in both experiments large fluctuations were observed for average no2 n concentrations of 0 13 mgn l during dry weather and 1 1 mgn l during the rain event experiment 3 3 1 water matrix influences on torc removal efficiency torc removal results are illustrated in fig 4 during continuous pilot scale operation at constant uv fluence and h2o2 dosage the removal of photo susceptible moderately photo susceptible and most photo resistant compounds including outliers varied in a range of 44 99 6 1 90 and 1 81 respectively the respective removal is in agreement with the illustrated reaction rate constant groupings depicted in fig 1 torc removal during the rain event indicated significantly lower oxidation performance compared to the dry weather experiment for all substances except diclofenac which was removed by more than 2 orders of magnitude in both sampling periods since it is highly reactive to direct photolysis differences in oxidation performance during the two continuous experiments can be explained based on slightly different process parameters and water quality parameters summarized in table 4 also higher variances in nitrite concentrations could have influenced the scattering of removal data resulting in a wider range of 25th and 75th percentiles during the rain event illustrated by a wider spread in the boxplots a detailed chronological sequence of oxidation performance illustrated by four representative substances iopromide sulfamethoxazole primidone and tcep is shown in figure s 1 supplemental information contribution of individual scavengers to overall scavenging capacity during continuous operation of the uv h2o2 pilot scale experiments is illustrated in fig 5 scavenging by nitrate is not considered in the figure since its scavenging capacity is three orders of magnitude lower than the illustrated ones calculated scavenger capacities agree well with the range of values reported in the literature lee et al 2013 results confirm that continuous operation during dry weather condition revealed a consistent scavenging potential while experiments during the rain event exhibited highly variable scavenging capacities however scavenging capacities by doc and bicarbonate remained mostly stable and at a comparable level in both weeks in september the overall scavenging capacity was dominated by nitrite peaks in the tertiary effluent these data confirm the importance to monitor and manage nitrite concentration if oxidative processes for advanced treatment are considered 3 3 2 influence of scavenging capacity on oh radical exposure to determine the impact of scavenging capacity on oh radical based oxidation performance the oh radical exposure was used as a figure of merit to assess oh radical abundance over time compound specific reaction rate constants of photo resistant radical indicators were used to calculate the oh radical exposure rosenfeldt et al 2006 3 o h d t m s ln c c 0 k o h i m 1 s 1 based on the data obtained from continuous experiments oh radical exposure was calculated from relative residual concentrations c c0 of primidone and carbamazepine gabapentin was not included in the calculations since photolytic rate constants were not available for this compound average exposures from both experiments are shown in fig 6 as a function of the radical scavenging capacity data from fig 5 the dashed line represents calculated exposures applying the model for constant fluence of 800 mj cm2 and h2o2 dosage of 10 mg l during the dry weather experiment oh radical exposure values ranged from 4 8 10 11 m s to 1 3 10 10 m s whereas higher variation of scavenging capacity during the rain event experiment resulted in a wider range of oh radical exposure from 2 9 10 12 to 1 4 10 10 m s relatively large extent of scattering during the rain event experiment might be explained by unstable nitrite concentrations in reactor influent samples it is assumed that sampling did not exactly represent the true water quality in effluent samples with increasing scavenging capacities the oh radical exposure decreased following a quasi hyperbolic correlation the findings could be corroborated using the calculated oh radical exposure based on modeling performing an ordinary least squares regression analysis between modeled and observed data points the median of all residuals is determined as 23 and 121 for dry weather and rain event experiments respectively three major conclusions can be drawn from these results at the municipal wwtp gut marienhof a high impact of oh radical scavenging on radical formation and oxidative compound removal was identified which triggers the need for monitoring and control of effluent water quality the modeled and experimental correlation between scavenging capacity and oh radical exposure indicates the possibility of oh radical exposure prediction by water matrix parameters and proves its applicability at pilot or full scale which confirms results by gerrity et al 2016 online sensors for water quality parameters i e no2 n doc and hco3 are commercially available and could be considered for future aop process control torc removal from tertiary effluents by uv h2o2 is highly dependent on nitrite concentrations therefore oxidation performance of uv h2o2 can be improved by nitrite control in wwtp effluents 4 conclusion this study demonstrates through pilot scale investigations that uv h2o2 is applicable to remove torcs from municipal wastewater effluents uv h2o2 pilot plant performance was verified by a bench scale collimated beam device for removal of 15 torcs occurring at ambient concentrations and representing a range of photolytic and oh radical reactivity in wastewater effluent the impact of water matrices on oh radical exposure was evaluated during continuous pilot scale operation using the removal kinetics of photo resistant ambient torcs furthermore successful application of a model was confirmed using uv fluence h2o2 dosage and standard water quality parameters i e doc no3 no2 and hco3 as input parameter key findings of this study are high variations of oh radical exposure during pilot scale uv h2o2 operation were observed primarily due to fluctuations of nitrite concentration which suggests the need for online water quality monitoring and control of tertiary effluent nutrient removal if uv h2o2 is implemented a correlation between oh radical exposure and scavenging capacity could be determined and verified by modeling this correlation reveals the possibility of oh radical exposure prediction by water matrix

sample pores were sealed with butyl rubber cai et al 2016a shown in fig s7 there was no membrane between the anode and cathode gas bags were connected to the top to collect biogas from the reactors a carbon brush length and diameter 2 5 2 5 cm was used as anode and a carbon cloth coated with pt c was used as the cathode 3 cm diameter thick 410 μm the anode was pre treated by immersion in acetone for 24 h followed by burning in a muffle furnace for 30 min at 450 c wang et al 2009b cathodes were fabricated as previously described liu et al 2012 the substrate for methane generation was 1 5 g l acetate dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffered solution pbs which is commonly used in mecs cai et al 2016b the waste activated sludge used for inoculation was obtained from gaobeidian municipal wastewater treatment plant in beijing the coupling reactor was operated in fed batch mode to maintain methanogen activity and 10 of the working volume of substrate solution was changed every 3 days the initial acetate concentration was 1 5 g l in each cycle with almost no acetate detected in the effluent the volume of exchange liquid was maintained within 10 of the total effective volume in each 72 h batch for methanogenesis to prevent acetotrophic methanogens from being washed out the external voltage of the reactor was constant at 0 8 v with switch off power supply provided 2 2 chemical

instructions 2 4 pcr amplification sequencing and quantification community composition was determined based on 16s gene sequencing using the primer pair 515f and 806r which can detect nearly all bacterial and most archaeal 16s sequences cai et al 2016d liang et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 the amplification protocol has been previously described cai et al 2016c primers for amplifying the mcra gene were synthesised by biomed beijing china and had the following sequences mlf ggtggtgtmggattcacacartaygcwacagc and mlr ttcattgcrtagttwggrtagtt luton et al 2002 the thermal cycling program was as follows 5 min at 95 c followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 95 c 45 s at 55 c and 60 s at 72 c the length of the mcra product was approximately 470 bp the pcr products contained barcodes between the adapter and forward primer sequencing was performed with the miseq platform illumina san diego ca usa expression of the mcra gene was quantified by quantitative q pcr as previously described cai et al 2016c with the same primers as those used for sequencing 2 5 sequence analysis total raw reads obtained by 16s sequencing were processed with the galaxy pipeline http mem rcees ac cn 8080 root using the default parameters the fasta data were used to generate an operational taxonomic unit table with uparse based on 97 similarity the taxonomy of the 16s otu was assigned using the rdp classifier a

data were searched against the local database and sequences were verified in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi non redundant database taxonomic assignment was carried out by

sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive accession no srp097099 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance and electron flux in electromethanogenesis the reactor was operated over 1 month after inoculation and methane generation was determined over 2 months batch cycles when a stable performance was achieved figs 1 and s1 the theoretical methane is only the sum of methane generated from current therefore the value of it is lower than the measured methane which consisted of the part of methane generated from current and part of methane directly from acetate during the start up period average methane production rate increased figs s2a c from 1 92 to 4 06 mmol methane m3 reactor day within 33 days before stabilising at 7 10 mmol methane m3 reactor day over the period of 40 110 days r2 0 99 methane production was enhanced in the closed circuit electron balance analysis confirmed the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens guo et al 2017 these results suggest that hydrogen is the key factor regulating methanogen growth and electron flow from the electrode into methane hydrogen was detected in the initial days hydrogen in the gas bag was collected after determining gas composition by gas chromatography while hydrogen in the headspace was likely consumed by hydrogenotrophic archaea fig 2a the hydrogen level increased with current but then rapidly decreased with methane generation on day 6 fig s2 hydrogen in the headspace was clearly consumed by scavengers suggesting that hydrogenotrophic methanogens were acclimated the maximum current increased from 12 to 25 ma after day 40 figs 1 and s3 in theory one mole acetate can produce one mole methane hence the conversion efficiency of the electron flux from acetate into methane was 0 80 0 08 mol methane mole acetate in the hybrid reactor methane was directly produced from acetate via acetoclastic methanogenesis and from electrons or hydrogen via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at the cathode which is dependent on acetate oxidation by the bioanode cai et al 2016a 2016c in each batch cycle electron production from anodophilic conversion of organic substrate was calculated based on current measurement which reflected substrate degradation from fuel input to consumption fig 1 the calculated contribution of electron flux current to the final methane product was 29 57 7 36 exceeding the 50 methane that was produced via the acetoclastic pathway the lower percentage demonstrated the limited role of bioelectrochemistry in the coupling reactor which was mainly due to the small anode 6 25 cm3 and cathode 7 cm2 relative to the working volume of 700 ml electrode spacing and surface area are critical parameters for bioelectrochemical applications logan et al 2015 that can be optimized to improve power density this reflects greater electron flux into the current which could be converted to methane via the hydrogenotrophic pathway the key to this coupling system for enhanced methane generation depends on the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens which are more effective in producing methane than acetotrophic methanogens cai et al 2016c although the monod maximum uptake rate of acetotrophic methanogens k m ac was 8 chemical oxygen demand per day cod day 1 which is lower than the k m h2 35 cod day 1 for hydrogenotrophic methanogens according to the adm1 model batstone et al 2002 guo et al 2017 and using hydrogen and acetate as precursors for methane generation resulted in a 13 55 times higher yield was pan et al 2016 most studies have reported limited improvement clauwaert and verstraete 2009 guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 when introducing a bes into a conventional reactor this can be ascribed to rapid proton consumption which blocks the diffusion of protons and inhibits methane formation by methanogens protons transported out of the biofilm were shown to limit current production by bioanodes torres et al 2008 thus the cathodic microenvironment is expected to exhibit a similar phenomenon including altered proton concentration that could affect community evolution 3 2 zone of ph polarisation surrounding the cathode we first examined the zone of ph polarisation surrounding the cathode which was generated by proton consumption with an insufficient diffusion rate fig 2b the ph increased sharply from 6 9 to 9 1 at a distance of 1 mm from the electrode surface the maximum ph was 10 2 at the surface the standard gibbs energy δg0 varied with ph the δg0 at ph 6 9 was 33 89 kj mol but declined to 21 47 and 15 32 kj mol at ph 9 1 and 10 2 respectively the alkaline conditions increased the external voltage required to maintain the energy barrier at the value of the neutral environment by 0 192 v which was higher than the theoretical value of 0 114 v required for hydrogen evolution coupled with acetate oxidation 0 414 v vs 0 3 v call and logan 2008 a high concentration of pbs is commonly used to reduce solution resistance and prevent proton shortage and limits cathodic reactions ahn and logan 2013 cai et al 2016a however the polarisation zone surrounding the cathode biofilm cannot be discounted as it may substantially alter cathodic reactions in deep within the biofilm cathode surface and impact the growth of microorganisms that rely on these reactions the ph gradient may be the limiting factor in hydrogenotrophic methane generation which prefer a neutral environment many studies have shown that cathodic methanogens were the main source of methane in bes it is thus expected that the methanogen community composition at the cathode would differ from that of the rest of the solution additionally the found of ph polarization could provide insights into how to improve the performance in bioenergy recovery previous studies implied the proper stir and applied voltage which directly influence the ph polarization could increase hydrogen production rate at cathode ajayi et al 2010 linji et al 2013 therefore it was clear that the regulation of external voltage and diffusion could be the optimized methods for eliminating the ph polarization not only occurred at cathode but also anode dhar et al 2017 3 3 genus and species identification based on mcra gene sequencing the alpha diversity indices of 16s and mcra genes indicated low diversity of bacteria and methanogens in cathodic biofilm table 1 suggesting that there were other organisms that had colonised the cathodic biofilm the mcra sequencing results revealed the taxonomic distribution of methanogens in all samples based on cut off values for genus and species 80 and 85 respectively yang et al 2014 most otus related to mcra have been classified at the genus and species levels except for otus 35 and 75 which are relegated to uncultured taxonomy table s1 in the rarefaction curve of mcra sequencing reached a plateau earlier than in the 16s based process fig s4 indicating that there was sufficient information to capture the overall diversity of samples wilkins et al 2015 the phylogenetic tree constructed from the mcra gene sequences was phylogenetically diverse fig 3 and taxa were grouped into three clusters including methanosarcina methanosaeta and methanobacterium the relative abundances of methanosarcina accounted for 35 16 1 37 and 49 43 of the anode cathode and suspension organisms with 0 8 v as the external voltage methanosaeta were found to have a relative abundance of 21 31 in anodic biofilm while the relative abundance of methanobacterium reached 96 21 in the cathodic biofilm the result based on 16s sequencing was consistent with previous study siegert et al did the qpcr with mcra primers and 16s sequencing for different inocula mecs which revealed the dominant of methanobacterium in the cathodic community siegert et al 2014 at the species level methanosarcina mazei lyc predominated in the acetoclastic methanogen communities of all samples however methanobacterium alcaliphilum and other hydrogenotrophic methanogens were enriched at the cathode accounting for 71 03 of the all species 3 4 electro driven hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis the sequencing results of the suspension revealed methanosarcina as the dominant genus 49 43 and the major producer of methane methanosaeta are obligate acetoclastic methanogens that produce lower levels of methane at high acetate concentration as compared to conventional anaerobes demirel and scherer 2008 biofilms at cathodes differed from those at the anode communities and in suspension the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be ascribed to both hydrogen evolution and electrons derived from the cathode several methanogens of methanococcus spp and methanobacterium like archaea are known to accept electrons from electrodes beese vasbender et al 2015 lohner et al 2014 importantly hydrogen evolution readily occurs under neutral conditions with cathodic potential varying from 500 to 600 mv vs rhe the ph gradient inhibited but did not completely block this reaction resulting in an increase in the corrected potential to nearly 430 mv vs rhe which favoured hydrogen evolution overall hydrogen evolution and direct electron transfer induce hydrogenotrophic methanogen growth leading to enrichment of diverse hydrogenotrophic methanogens at the cathode lee and rittmann 2009 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2009a the ph surrounding the cathode ranged from 7 to nearly 10 only methanobacterium can tolerate this range although methanosarcina can compete with methanobacterium since it can derive hydrogen or electrons from the electrode rotaru et al 2014a the optimum ph values of m barkeri and m mazei are 5 7 and 5 5 8 respectively de vrieze et al 2012 making methanosarcina less dominant in the biofilm m alcaliphilum which thrives in an alkaline environment ph 8 3 9 9 worakit et al 1986 was enriched in the cathodic community fig 4 this corresponded to the increase in ph resulting from the proton consuming cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction cai et al 2016a call and logan 2008 rozendal et al 2007 although the single chamber was considered as a better way to eliminate ph variation than the dual chamber ph polarisation around the cathode may still act as a barrier for microbes in the biofilm due to the higher ph value liu et al 2007 few studies to date have described specific changes in methanogenic communities under different cathodic microenvironments especially at the species level importantly the enrichment of alkaliphilic methanogens suggested that the microbial community composition was affected by the consumption of protons at the cathode moreover the abundance of methanobacterium subterraneum and methanobacterium formicicum which thrive in the ph ranges of 7 8 8 8 and 6 5 8 6 respectively was 15 29 and 5 95 respectively other species that exist at neutral ph were also represented possibly as a result of being protected by syntrophs however how this methanogenic community cooperate within cathodic biofilm to share electrons and protons in the cathodic electron transfer pathway remains to be determined importantly the high through sequencing technology however only indicates the relative composition of microbial community which fails to reflect the absolute change of specific species since the absolute cell density of inter sample is absence the relative variation of abundance is one sided to investigate deeply the ecological succession the qpcr technology which determines the absolute copies numbers supplies the absolute biomass for making up the lack of taxonomic abundance smith and osborn 2009 moreover the qpcr test starts from the same extracted dna thereby produces similar related laboratory bias which is more sensitive to cooperate with sequencing result to show the absolute quantification of taxonomic dynamics props et al 2016 the final result lightened on the new finding to the cathodic methanogens the qpcr analysis showed that the number of methanogens was several orders of magnitude higher in cathodic biofilm samples than in those from other sites fig 3 taxonomic classification sequencing and qpcr analysis which are useful for describing changes in taxa zhang et al 2017 revealed the distinct advantage of cathodic biofilm samples over the other sample types in terms of absolute abundance of methanogens in biocathodic biofilm m alcaliphilum had the highest abundance in cathodic biofilm followed by m subterraneum m formicicum and methanobacterium movens fig 5 alkaliphilic methanogens predominate in cathodic biofilm implying that the main contribution of current to methane generation occurred under alkaline conditions this could act as a barrier since the kinetics of methane production require a neutral ph iqbal syaichurrozi and sumardiono 2014 besides hydrogenotrophic methanogens acetoclastic species were enriched near the cathode surface the growth of acetoclastic methanogens of methanosaeta and methanosarcina depends on direct interspecies electron transfer with co cultured geobacter rotaru et al 2014b 2014c thus methanogens can thrive when the cathode serves as an electron donor however most acetoclastic methanogens prefer neutral conditions and are likely to exist on the exterior of cathodic biofilm additional studies are required to determine the specific distribution of hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens in different biofilm layers 4 conclusion the hybrid reactor coupling mec with anaerobic digestion showed stable methane generation via the acetate and current conversion pathways an increase in ph within the cathode biofilm influenced methane production rate as well as the microbial community structure based on mcra sequencing the predominant microbes at the cathode were hydrogenotrophic methanogens mostly basophilic m alcaliphilum notably extreme alkaline conditions were detected within a micrometre distance

within the micrometre scale surrounding the cathode surface and by mcra gene sequencing the results provide insight into the effects of ph polarisation on biocathodic methanogenic community composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation reactors were made of glass shaped into cylinders with a total volume of 1 l and working volume of 700 ml whose tops and side sample pores were sealed with butyl rubber cai et al 2016a shown in fig s7 there was no membrane between the anode and cathode gas bags were connected to the top to collect biogas from the reactors a carbon brush length and diameter 2 5 2 5 cm was used as anode and a carbon cloth coated with pt c was used as the cathode 3 cm diameter thick 410 μm the anode was pre treated by immersion in acetone for 24 h followed by burning in a muffle furnace for 30 min at 450 c wang et al 2009b cathodes were fabricated as previously described liu et al 2012 the substrate for methane generation was 1 5 g l acetate dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffered solution pbs which is commonly used in mecs cai et al 2016b the waste activated sludge used for inoculation was obtained from gaobeidian municipal wastewater treatment plant in beijing the coupling reactor was operated in fed batch mode to maintain methanogen activity and 10 of the working volume of substrate solution was changed every 3 days the initial acetate concentration was 1 5 g l in each cycle with almost no acetate detected in the effluent the volume of exchange liquid was maintained within 10 of the total effective volume in each 72 h batch for methanogenesis to prevent acetotrophic methanogens from being washed out the external voltage of the reactor was constant at 0 8 v with switch off power supply provided 2 2 chemical measurements and calculations methane was detected on a gc4000a gas chromatograph east west analytical instruments beijing china as previously described cai et al 2016d the current was automatically monitored with a keithley model 2700 multimetre tektronix beaverton or usa the ph was measured with a ph microsensor model ph 50 5343 unisense aarhus denmark samples were collected close to the cathode by moving the microsensor down to contact the electrode surface until the electrode moved and moving the microsensor up in the opposite direction away from the electrode surface three measurements were made per 1 mm distance the methane generated by the current was calculated with the following equation v m e t h a n e it nf v m where v m e t h a n e is the theoretical volume of

according to the following equation zhang et al 2016 e 0 e v s a g a g c l 0 059 p h 0 197 v 2 3 dna sample collection samples were collected from the reactor after nearly 4 months of operation when stable methane production was achieved the electrodes were cut into pieces the biofilms were vortexed and washed and the suspensions were centrifuged 4000 rpm for 5 min samples were randomly selected from three different sites and mixed before dna extraction to avoid stochastic effects dna was extracted using the fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions 2 4 pcr amplification sequencing and quantification community composition was determined based on 16s gene sequencing using the primer pair 515f and 806r which can detect nearly all bacterial and most archaeal 16s sequences cai et al 2016d liang et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 the amplification protocol has been previously described cai et al 2016c primers for amplifying the mcra gene were synthesised by biomed beijing china and had the following sequences mlf ggtggtgtmggattcacacartaygcwacagc and mlr ttcattgcrtagttwggrtagtt luton et al 2002 the thermal cycling program was as follows 5 min at 95 c followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 95 c 45 s at 55 c and 60 s at 72 c the length of the mcra product was approximately 470 bp the pcr products contained barcodes between the adapter and forward primer sequencing was performed with the miseq platform illumina san diego ca usa expression of the mcra gene was quantified by quantitative q pcr as previously described cai et al 2016c with the same primers as those used for sequencing 2 5 sequence analysis total raw reads obtained by 16s sequencing were processed with the galaxy pipeline http mem rcees ac cn 8080 root using the default parameters the fasta data were used to generate an operational taxonomic unit table with uparse based on 97 similarity the taxonomy of the 16s otu was assigned using the rdp classifier a library was constructed for mcra by downloading all mcra sequences excluding environmental samples from the functional gene repository website http fungene cme msu edu wilkins et al 2015 the mcra otu data were searched against the local database and sequences were verified in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi non redundant database taxonomic assignment was carried out by setting the cut off value at 85 for species and 80 for genus webster et al 2016 yang et al 2014 which were calculated from the 16s rdna sequence identity of 97 and 95 according to the fitting line raw sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive accession no srp097099 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance and electron flux in electromethanogenesis the reactor was operated over 1 month after inoculation and methane generation was determined over 2 months batch cycles when a stable performance was achieved figs 1 and s1 the theoretical methane is only the sum of methane generated from current therefore the value of it is lower than the measured methane which consisted of the part of methane generated from current and part of methane directly from acetate during the start up period average methane production rate increased figs s2a c from 1 92 to 4 06 mmol methane m3 reactor day within 33 days before stabilising at 7 10 mmol methane m3 reactor day over the period of 40 110 days r2 0 99 methane production was enhanced in the closed circuit electron balance analysis confirmed the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens guo et al 2017 these results suggest that hydrogen is the key factor regulating methanogen growth and electron flow from the electrode into methane hydrogen was detected in the initial days hydrogen in the gas bag was collected after determining gas composition by gas chromatography while hydrogen in the headspace was likely consumed by hydrogenotrophic archaea fig 2a the hydrogen level increased with current but then rapidly decreased with methane generation on day 6 fig s2 hydrogen in the headspace was clearly consumed by scavengers suggesting that hydrogenotrophic methanogens were acclimated the maximum current increased from 12 to 25 ma after day 40 figs 1 and s3 in theory one mole acetate can produce one mole methane hence the conversion efficiency of the electron flux from acetate into methane was 0 80 0 08 mol methane mole acetate in the hybrid reactor methane was directly produced from acetate via acetoclastic methanogenesis and from electrons or hydrogen via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at the cathode which is dependent on acetate oxidation by the bioanode cai et al 2016a 2016c in each batch cycle electron production from anodophilic conversion of organic substrate was calculated based on current measurement which reflected substrate degradation from fuel input to consumption fig 1 the calculated contribution of electron flux current to the final methane product was 29 57 7 36 exceeding the 50 methane that was produced via the acetoclastic pathway the lower percentage demonstrated the limited role of bioelectrochemistry in the coupling reactor which was mainly due to the small anode 6 25 cm3 and cathode 7 cm2 relative to the working volume of 700 ml electrode spacing and surface area are critical parameters for bioelectrochemical applications logan et al 2015 that can be optimized to improve power density this reflects greater electron flux into the current which could be converted to methane via the hydrogenotrophic pathway the key to this coupling system for enhanced methane generation depends on the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens which are more effective in producing methane than acetotrophic methanogens cai et al 2016c although the monod maximum uptake rate of acetotrophic methanogens k m ac was 8 chemical oxygen demand per day cod day 1 which is lower than the k m h2 35 cod day 1 for hydrogenotrophic methanogens according to the adm1 model batstone et al 2002 guo et al 2017 and using hydrogen and acetate as precursors for methane generation resulted in a 13 55 times higher yield was pan et al 2016 most studies have reported limited improvement clauwaert and verstraete 2009 guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 when introducing a bes into a conventional reactor this can be ascribed to rapid proton consumption which blocks the diffusion of protons and inhibits methane formation by methanogens protons transported out of the biofilm were shown to limit current production by bioanodes torres et al 2008 thus the cathodic microenvironment is expected to exhibit a similar phenomenon including altered proton concentration that could affect community evolution 3 2 zone of ph polarisation surrounding the cathode we first examined the zone of ph polarisation surrounding the cathode which was generated by proton consumption with an insufficient diffusion rate fig 2b the ph increased sharply from 6 9 to 9 1 at a distance of 1 mm from the electrode surface the maximum ph was 10 2 at the surface the standard gibbs energy δg0 varied with ph the δg0 at ph 6 9 was 33 89 kj mol but declined to 21 47 and 15 32 kj mol at ph 9 1 and 10 2 respectively the alkaline conditions increased the external voltage required to maintain the energy barrier at the value of the neutral environment by 0 192 v which was higher than the theoretical value of 0 114 v required for hydrogen evolution coupled with acetate oxidation 0 414 v vs 0 3 v call and logan 2008 a high concentration of pbs is commonly used to reduce solution resistance and prevent proton shortage and limits cathodic reactions ahn and logan 2013 cai et al 2016a however the polarisation zone surrounding the cathode biofilm cannot be discounted as it may substantially alter cathodic reactions in deep within the biofilm cathode surface and impact the growth of microorganisms that rely on these reactions the ph gradient may be the limiting factor in hydrogenotrophic methane generation which prefer a neutral environment many studies have shown that cathodic methanogens were the main source of methane in bes it is thus expected that the methanogen community composition at the cathode would differ from that of the rest of the solution additionally the found of ph polarization could provide insights into how to improve the performance in bioenergy recovery previous studies implied the proper stir and applied voltage which directly influence the ph polarization could increase hydrogen production rate at cathode ajayi et al 2010 linji et al 2013 therefore it was clear that the regulation of external voltage and diffusion could be the optimized methods for eliminating the ph polarization not only occurred at cathode but also anode dhar et al 2017 3 3 genus and species identification based on mcra gene sequencing the alpha diversity indices of 16s and mcra genes indicated low diversity of bacteria and methanogens in cathodic biofilm table 1 suggesting that there were other organisms that had colonised the cathodic biofilm the mcra sequencing results revealed the taxonomic distribution of methanogens in all samples based on cut off values for genus and species 80 and 85 respectively yang et al 2014 most otus related to mcra have been classified at the genus and species levels except for otus 35 and 75 which are relegated to uncultured taxonomy table s1 in the rarefaction curve of mcra sequencing reached a plateau earlier than in the 16s based process fig s4 indicating that there was sufficient information to capture the overall diversity of samples wilkins et al 2015 the phylogenetic tree constructed from the mcra gene sequences was phylogenetically diverse fig 3 and taxa were grouped into three clusters including methanosarcina methanosaeta and methanobacterium the relative abundances of methanosarcina accounted for 35 16 1 37 and 49 43 of the anode cathode and suspension organisms with 0 8 v as the external voltage methanosaeta were found to have a relative abundance of 21 31 in anodic biofilm while the relative abundance of methanobacterium reached 96 21 in the cathodic biofilm the result based on 16s sequencing was consistent with previous study siegert et al did the qpcr with mcra primers and 16s sequencing for different inocula mecs which revealed the dominant of methanobacterium in the cathodic community siegert et al 2014 at the species level methanosarcina mazei lyc predominated in the acetoclastic methanogen communities of all samples however methanobacterium alcaliphilum and other hydrogenotrophic methanogens were enriched at the cathode accounting for 71 03 of the all species 3 4 electro driven hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis the sequencing results of the suspension revealed methanosarcina as the dominant genus 49 43 and the major producer of methane methanosaeta are obligate acetoclastic methanogens that produce lower levels of methane at high acetate concentration as compared to conventional anaerobes demirel and scherer 2008 biofilms at cathodes differed from those at the anode communities and in suspension the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be ascribed to both hydrogen evolution and electrons derived from the cathode several methanogens of methanococcus spp and methanobacterium like archaea are known to accept electrons from electrodes beese vasbender et al 2015 lohner et al 2014 importantly hydrogen evolution readily occurs under neutral conditions with cathodic potential varying from 500 to 600 mv vs rhe the ph gradient inhibited but did not completely block this reaction resulting in an increase in the corrected potential to nearly 430 mv vs rhe which favoured hydrogen evolution overall hydrogen evolution and direct electron transfer induce hydrogenotrophic methanogen growth leading to enrichment of diverse hydrogenotrophic methanogens at the cathode lee and rittmann 2009 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2009a the ph surrounding the cathode ranged from 7 to nearly 10 only methanobacterium can tolerate this range although methanosarcina can compete with methanobacterium since it can derive hydrogen or electrons from the electrode rotaru et al 2014a the optimum ph values of m barkeri and m mazei are 5 7 and 5 5 8 respectively de vrieze et al 2012 making methanosarcina less dominant in the biofilm m alcaliphilum which thrives in an alkaline environment ph 8 3 9 9 worakit et al 1986 was enriched in the cathodic community fig 4 this corresponded to the increase in ph resulting from the proton consuming cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction cai et al 2016a call and logan 2008 rozendal et al 2007 although the single chamber was considered as a better way to eliminate ph variation than the dual chamber ph polarisation around the cathode may still act as a barrier for microbes in the biofilm due to the higher ph value liu et al 2007 few studies to date have described specific changes in methanogenic communities under different cathodic microenvironments especially at the species level importantly the enrichment of alkaliphilic methanogens suggested that the microbial community composition was affected by the consumption of protons at the cathode moreover the abundance of methanobacterium subterraneum and methanobacterium formicicum which thrive in the ph ranges of 7 8 8 8 and 6 5 8 6 respectively was 15 29 and 5 95 respectively other species that exist at neutral ph were also represented possibly as a result of being protected by syntrophs however how this methanogenic community cooperate within cathodic biofilm to share electrons and protons in the cathodic electron transfer pathway remains to be determined importantly the high through sequencing technology however only indicates the relative composition of microbial community which fails to reflect the absolute change of specific species since the absolute cell density of inter sample is absence the relative variation of abundance is one sided to investigate deeply the ecological succession the qpcr technology which determines the absolute copies numbers supplies the absolute biomass for making up the lack of taxonomic abundance smith and osborn 2009 moreover the qpcr test starts from the same extracted dna thereby produces similar related laboratory bias which is more sensitive to cooperate with sequencing result to show the absolute quantification of taxonomic dynamics props et al 2016 the final result lightened on the new finding to the cathodic methanogens the qpcr analysis showed that the number of methanogens was several orders of magnitude higher in cathodic biofilm samples than in those from other sites fig 3 taxonomic classification sequencing and qpcr analysis which are useful for describing changes in taxa zhang et al 2017 revealed the distinct advantage of cathodic biofilm samples over the other sample types in terms of absolute abundance of methanogens in biocathodic biofilm m alcaliphilum had the highest abundance in cathodic biofilm followed by m subterraneum m formicicum and methanobacterium movens fig 5 alkaliphilic methanogens predominate in cathodic biofilm implying that the main contribution of current to methane generation occurred under alkaline conditions this could act as a barrier since the kinetics of methane production require a neutral ph iqbal syaichurrozi and sumardiono 2014 besides hydrogenotrophic methanogens acetoclastic species were enriched near the cathode surface the growth of acetoclastic methanogens of methanosaeta and methanosarcina depends on direct interspecies electron transfer with co cultured geobacter rotaru et al 2014b 2014c thus methanogens can thrive when the cathode serves as an electron donor however most acetoclastic methanogens prefer neutral conditions and are likely to exist on the exterior of cathodic biofilm additional studies are required to determine the specific distribution of hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens in different biofilm layers 4 conclusion the hybrid reactor coupling mec with anaerobic digestion showed stable methane generation via the acetate and current conversion pathways an increase in ph within the cathode biofilm influenced methane production rate as well as the microbial community structure based on mcra sequencing the predominant microbes at the cathode were hydrogenotrophic methanogens mostly basophilic m alcaliphilum notably extreme alkaline conditions were detected within a micrometre distance from the cathode where basophilic methanogens functioned effectively to produce methane competing financial interests the authors declare no competing financial interests acknowledgements this

19658,the chemistry of hydraulic fracturing fluids and wastewaters is complex and is known to vary by operator geologic formation and fluid age a time series of hydraulic fracturing fluids flowback fluids and produced waters was collected from two adjacent marcellus shale gas wells for organic chemical composition analyses using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry hierarchical clustering was used to compare and extract ions related to different fluid ages and many halogenated organic molecular ions were identified in flowback fluids and early produced waters based on exact mass iodinated organic compounds were the dominant halogen class in these clusters and were nearly undetectable in hydraulic fracturing fluid prior to injection the iodinated ions increased in flowback and remained elevated after ten months of well production we suggest that these trends are mainly driven by dissolved organic matter reacting with reactive halogen species formed abiotically through oxidizing chemical additives applied to the well and biotically via iodide oxidizing bacteria understanding the implications of these identified halogenated organic compounds will require future investigation in to their structures and environmental fate graphical abstract image 1 keywords high volume hydraulic fracturing marcellus shale flowback fluid produced water halogenated organic compounds 1 introduction halogenated organic compounds hocs have been recently identified in shale gas wastewaters using both targeted and non targeted analytical approaches hoelzer et al 2016 luek et al 2017 maguire boyle and barron 2014 furthermore hocs are of particular interest because they are not known additives used in the hydraulic fracturing process and although a handful of mechanisms have been proposed their origin remains unknown hoelzer et al 2016 luek et al 2017 maguire boyle and barron 2014 the environmental fate and toxicity of these compounds also remains unknown non targeted ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is widely used to investigate the chemical composition of diverse organic matter based on its high mass accuracy and resolution dvorski et al 2016 gonsior et al 2011 kellerman et al 2014 roullier gall et al 2015 walker et al 2014 this approach has been applied to complex natural and engineered systems to describe compositional changes not understood a prior and without the use of hundreds or thousands of costly analytical standards chen et al 2016 gonsior et al 2016 lavonen et al 2013 shakeri yekta et al 2012 sleighter et al 2014 ultrahigh resolution ft icr ms operated in negative mode is an appropriate approach for identifying unknown deprotonated hocs including diverse disinfection by products dbps gonsior et al 2015 lavonen et al 2013 luek et al 2017 xu et al 2013 paired with solid phase extraction dittmar et al 2008 ft icr ms is uniquely suited for describing the temporal dynamics of diverse hocs found in high salinity shale gas wastewater understanding the behavior of hocs within an individual hydraulic fracturing well is essential for narrowing down their possible origins and environmental fate hocs have been hypothesized to be transformation products hoelzer et al 2016 luek et al 2017 but time series data have not been used previously to investigate this possibility therefore the aim of this study was to track changes to the dissolved organic matter dom pool of marcellus shale gas well fluids over the first ten months of well operation specifically we combined solid phase extraction with ft icr ms and used hierarchical clustering analysis to identify key shifts in the distribution of hocs and suggest plausible formation mechanisms 2 methods hydraulic fracturing fluid flowback fluid and produced water samples were collected from two adjacent hydraulic fracturing wells at the marcellus shale energy and environment laboratory mseel field site in morgantown wv fig s1 between november 2015 and september 2016 carr 2017 dom was solid phase extracted from water samples and analyzed using ft icr ms hierarchical clustering analyses were performed on the resulting ions and assigned molecular formulas to track the temporal trends of hocs 2 1 sample collection mseel wells mip 3h and mip 5h herein referred to as 3h and 5h were sampled from a gas fluid separator in autoclaved high density polyethylene carboys from the separator outlet fluid was then transferred in to 1l base washed low density polyethylene containers using a peristaltic pump minimizing headspace samples were collected approximately daily during the initial week of flowback december 2015 fluid production rates as high as 1000 barrels d 1 bi weekly for the following 3 months early production water fluid production rates 10s of barrels d 1 monthly for 3 months and then bimonthly late production water fluid production rates very low 1 barrel d 1 mseel org on certain dates the 5h well was not producing fluid so no sample was collected samples were refrigerated at 4 c and shipped on ice within two weeks of collection one field blank was collected by taking milliq water in to the field and then processed in the same manner as samples 2 2 extraction of organic compounds upon receipt samples were filtered over a 0 7 μm glass fiber filter whatman gf f in to glass bottles previously baked at 500 c filtered samples 200 ml for solid phase extraction were immediately acidified to ph 2 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted over 1 g 6 ml bond elut ppl solid phase extraction cartridges preconditioned with 2 cartridge volumes of methanol followed by 2 volumes of 0 1 formic acid solution dittmar et al 2008 loaded cartridges were desalted using a 200 ml dilute hydrochloric acid rinse ph 2 followed by a 30 ml 0 1 formic acid solution rinse to avoid halide contamination of the methanolic extract large volume washing of cartridges reduces the likelihood of iodo adducts luek et al 2017 xu et al 2013 and prior investigations with high and ultrahigh resolution electrospray mass spectrometry have confirmed covalently bound iodine in complex mixtures luek et al 2017 moulin et al 2001 xu et al 2013 cartridges were dried under vacuum and eluted with 10 ml ultrapure methanol methanolic extracts were stored at 20 c prior to ft icr ms analysis 2 3 ft icr ms analysis methanolic extracts were diluted 1 5 in ultrapure methanol and injected at 120 μl hr 1 using a bruker solarix 12t electrospray ionization ft icr ms located at the helmholtz zentrum munich germany the instrument was operated in negative mode to target solid phase extracted compounds and hocs complementary positive ionization was not performed although this mode could have ionized additional organic compounds including nitrogen containing hocs 500 scans were averaged for each sample and a post calibration was performed using a list of known dom internal calibrants to obtain a mass accuracy of less than 0 1 ppm table s1 the obtained full scan mass resolution was better than 400 000 at m z 400 allowing for precise formula assignments hertkorn et al 2008 all m z ions identified in the field blank were removed prior to further processing following the methods of sleighter et al 2012 replicate sample mass spectra were compared to confirm that variability in the mass spectral analysis across samples was different from variability among extraction replicates as a function of the of overlapping m z ions and a regression of peak magnitudes from two replicates figs s2 and s3 because the ions of interest were not understood a priori no surrogate or internal standards were added to samples prior to extraction or analysis and hence why ft icr ms is used as a semi quantitative approach ion suppression issues caused by changes in the matrix were limited by diluting samples sufficiently as determined by the transient spectra however remaining extraction and ionization efficiency issues are not addressed using this non targeted approach for this reason changes that would only be consistent with the expected changes in the matrix itself i e consistently present in only unbroken fracturing fluids but absent in all flowback and produced waters the largest contrast in the fluid matrices were not discussed to limit false pattern identification 2 4 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using gene cluster 3 0 and treeview on log transformed ion abundances to limit clustering driven only by high intensity ions clustering analysis using average linkages was performed on uncentered m z ions identified in each well on ions present in 2 or more samples between m z 150 400 3h n 6613 5h n 5296 clusters were selected with ions unique to flowback and early produced waters first three months of well operation and assigned formulas 2 5 formula assignments molecular formulas were assigned to individual ions from the entire spectra including selected hierarchical clusters using in house software hertkorn et al 2008 a range of 150 700 m z was selected to encompass the majority of ions in the spectra and where the calibration is reliable to 0 1 ppm formulas were assigned with a maximum value per assignment of c100h o80n3s2cl3br3i3 and a maximum error of 0 2 ppm the mass error associated with ions identified below the lowest molecular weight calibrant was sufficient for formula assignment in this 0 2 ppm window nonsensical formula assignments were removed using a number of criteria in favor of alternative plausible formula assignments formulas not passing the nitrogen rule mclafferty and turecek 1993 were removed within this software and remaining assignments were further reduced to remove invalid formulas by removing those with an oxygen to carbon ratio o c greater than one or a negative double bond equivalent dbe raw values of formulas containing only carbon hydrogen and oxygen cho as well as nitrogen chon or sulfur chos between m z 150 700 are reported in fig s4 additional filtering of assigned formulas identified during the cluster analysis involved removing assignments with more than 3 heteroatoms e g choi3 kept choi3s1 removed and preferentially removing duplicate assignments with very low o c ratios and higher heteroatoms based on consistencies found when checking many assigned formulas against isotopic pattern matching and consistently confirming their alternatives for example of the observed m z ions assigned to an iodinated formula approximately 50 had a duplicate formula assignment containing s and cl but were determined false assignments because the distinctive 35cl to 37cl isotopic ratios were not observed in the mass spectra it is possible that this stringent filtering criteria may have removed a small number of correct formula assignments but was necessary for management of the large dataset halogenated formula assignments were compared to their theoretical isotopic patterns fig s5 and those ions not matching their theoretical isotopic distribution were removed 0 1 ppm error with error consistent across isotopes and maximum 10 error in magnitude hocs found using the cluster analysis with insufficient intensity to confirm isotopically were not removed 43 of hoc formulas however about half of these low intensity ions were members of a homologous series for which at least one member was confirmed isotopically degree of confidence for halogenated formula assignments is discussed in section 3 1 and reported in table s4 assigned formulas matching known compounds are putatively named as such based on their plausible presence in these fluids and likelihood to ionize under the methods used but have not been confirmed structurally 3 results and discussion 3 1 cluster analysis reveals halogenated ions unique to early produced waters due to the obvious differences in the injected fluid unbroken gel and the flowback and produced waters broken gels shale derived fluids hierarchical clusters that only described differences between identified ions in the injected fluid and flowback and produced waters were not compared to avoid improper comparisons based on possible extraction differences between these two fluid types instead ions unique to a certain period of flowback were selected absent both before and after the selected period and therefore both the broken and unbroken fluid types three clusters could be identified in the 3h well series that contained ions unique to different flowback and early produced waters representing three fluid age groups 3s 1 3s 2 and 3s 3 fig s6 the 5h well series contained fewer samples and only one cluster of ions unique to flowback and early produced waters could be identified 5s 2 fig s7 all m z ions identified in these clusters are given in supplemental table s2 regardless of whether or not they could be assigned an unambiguous molecular formula the molecular formulas identified in the four selected clusters are presented as van krevelen diagrams to visualize differences in the formula assignments as a function of heteroatom type fig 1 van krevelen 1950 and oxidation and saturation status the selected clusters contained a large number of heteroatom formula assignments rather than those containing only carbon hydrogen and oxygen typically dominant in natural organic matter table s3 the ions in clusters 3s 1 3s 2 and 5s 2 contain similar dom heteroatom classes and distributions with 74 ions shared between the 5h well cluster and either the 3s 1 or 3s 2 cluster in contrast only three of the 5h well cluster ions overlapped with those in cluster 3 s3 a large number of ions containing both nitrogen and sulfur were observed cluster 3s 3 representing ions present only in early produced waters 32 80 d was distinct from the other clusters containing 155 ions with halogenated formula assignments that could be validated to varying degrees table s4 the majority of ions were iodinated 52 while 20 were brominated 9 were chlorinated and 19 contained two different halogens sixty five of these halogenated formula assignments were supported with secondary peaks matching their theoretical stable isotopic spectra e g fig s5 five iodinated ions had been previously identified in a north dakota flowback fluid where their assignment was supported by the appearance of a 126 9045 m z peak iodine during fragmentation luek et al 2017 of the remaining ions assigned plausible halogenated formulas many were members of homologous series separated by ch2 groups determined using kmd z values shakeri yekta et al 2012 where at least one member of the series had been confirmed isotopically thirty eight of the remaining halogenated formula assignments had intensities too low to rely on isotopic pattern matching particularly iodinated assignments which rely solely on the 13c peak among the other three clusters only five plausible halogenated formula assignments were identified and three confirmed using isotopic pattern matching the overlap of many nitrogen and or sulfur containing compounds between the 3h well and the 5h well clusters suggests similar processes are occurring in both wells resulting in these ions unique to flowback and early produced waters this is expected due to their similar hydraulic fracturing fluids and underlying geology in contrast the absence of a 5h well cluster containing hocs suggests a difference between the two wells possibly related to the smaller quantity of ammonium persulfate breaker added to 5h well see section 3 3 3 2 iodinated organic ions high in flowback and produced water due to the large number of iodinated organic compounds identified during the

smaller sample volumes or the aging of the fluids prior to extraction 3 7 months storage unfiltered at 4 c because of the expected variability in the make up of the injected fluid and wastewaters over

this supports that the observed trends are indeed a function of actual changes in the fluid mixture rather than as a function of analytical differences due to ion suppression or extraction efficiency the majority of the iodinated ions confirmed with 13c isotopic pattern matching contained only carbon hydrogen oxygen and one iodine atom but seven ions contained nitrogen or sulfur table 1 and five

icr ms and revealed a steep increase in the number of ions assigned iodinated organic molecular formulas during the initial flowback period the number and abundance of iodinated organic ions remained elevated in produced waters 276 days later hierarchical clustering analysis also revealed a large number of iodinated brominated and chlorinated ions that were unique to fluids returning to the surface of the 3h well 1 3 months after the initial flowback we suggest that biotic and abiotic oxidation of halides subsequently reacting with diverse dom contributes to the observed organohalogen diversity and temporal dynamics tracking changes in the chemical composition of shale gas fluids is essential for understanding fundamental changes occurring in hydraulic fracturing fluids particularly those driven by known additives and microbial communities although many similarities were observed between the two wells their differences raise questions as to why these differences exist do they reflect differences in geology hydraulic fracturing fluid mixtures hydraulic fracturing techniques or some other undescribed variable more work on this topic is needed to better understand how these results can be generalized to different wells understanding why differences are observed across hydraulic fracturing wastewaters is essential for understanding the fundamental

19658,the chemistry of hydraulic fracturing fluids and wastewaters is complex and is known to vary by operator geologic formation and fluid age a time series of hydraulic fracturing fluids flowback fluids and produced waters was collected from two adjacent marcellus shale gas wells for organic chemical composition analyses using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry hierarchical clustering was used to compare and extract ions related to different fluid ages and many halogenated organic molecular ions were identified in flowback fluids and early produced waters based on exact mass iodinated organic compounds were the dominant halogen class in these clusters and were nearly undetectable in hydraulic fracturing fluid prior to injection the iodinated ions increased in flowback and remained elevated after ten months of well production we suggest that these trends are mainly driven by dissolved organic matter reacting with reactive halogen species formed abiotically through oxidizing chemical additives applied to the well and biotically via iodide oxidizing bacteria understanding the implications of these identified halogenated organic compounds will require future investigation in to their structures and environmental fate graphical abstract image 1 keywords high volume hydraulic fracturing marcellus shale flowback fluid produced water halogenated organic compounds 1 introduction halogenated organic compounds hocs have been recently identified in shale gas wastewaters using both targeted and non targeted analytical approaches hoelzer et al 2016 luek et al 2017 maguire boyle and barron 2014 furthermore hocs are of particular interest because they are not known additives used in the hydraulic fracturing process and although a handful of mechanisms have been proposed their origin remains unknown hoelzer et al 2016 luek et al 2017 maguire boyle and barron 2014 the environmental fate and toxicity of these compounds also remains unknown non targeted ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is widely used to investigate the chemical composition of diverse organic matter based on its high mass accuracy and resolution dvorski et al 2016 gonsior et al 2011 kellerman et al 2014 roullier gall et al 2015 walker et al 2014 this approach has been applied to complex natural and engineered systems to describe compositional changes not understood a prior and without the use of hundreds or thousands of costly analytical standards chen et al 2016 gonsior et al 2016 lavonen et al 2013 shakeri yekta et al 2012 sleighter et al 2014 ultrahigh resolution ft icr ms operated in negative mode is an appropriate approach for identifying unknown deprotonated hocs including diverse disinfection by products dbps gonsior et al 2015 lavonen et al 2013 luek et al 2017 xu et al 2013 paired with solid phase extraction dittmar et al 2008 ft icr ms is uniquely suited for describing the temporal dynamics of diverse hocs found in high salinity shale gas wastewater understanding the behavior of hocs within an individual hydraulic fracturing well is essential for narrowing down their possible origins and environmental fate hocs have been hypothesized to be transformation products hoelzer et al 2016 luek et al 2017 but time series data have not been used previously to investigate this possibility therefore the aim of this study was to track changes to the dissolved organic matter dom pool of marcellus shale gas well fluids over the first ten months of well operation specifically we combined solid phase extraction with ft icr ms and used hierarchical clustering analysis to identify key shifts in the distribution of hocs and suggest plausible formation mechanisms 2 methods hydraulic fracturing fluid flowback fluid and produced water samples were collected from two adjacent hydraulic fracturing wells at the marcellus shale energy and environment laboratory mseel field site in morgantown wv fig s1 between november 2015 and september 2016 carr 2017 dom was solid phase extracted from water samples and analyzed using ft icr ms hierarchical clustering analyses were performed on the resulting ions and assigned molecular formulas to track the temporal trends of hocs 2 1 sample collection mseel wells mip 3h and mip 5h herein referred to as 3h and 5h were sampled from a gas fluid separator in autoclaved high density polyethylene carboys from the separator outlet fluid was then transferred in to 1l base washed low density polyethylene containers using a peristaltic pump minimizing headspace samples were collected approximately daily during the initial week of flowback december 2015 fluid production rates as high as 1000 barrels d 1 bi weekly for the following 3 months early production water fluid production rates 10s of barrels d 1 monthly for 3 months and then bimonthly late production water fluid production rates very low 1 barrel d 1 mseel org on certain dates the 5h well was not producing fluid so no sample was collected samples were refrigerated at 4 c and shipped on ice within two weeks of collection one field blank was collected by taking milliq water in to the field and then processed in the same manner as samples 2 2 extraction of organic compounds upon receipt samples were filtered over a 0 7 μm glass fiber filter whatman gf f in to glass bottles previously baked at 500 c filtered samples 200 ml for solid phase extraction were immediately acidified to ph 2 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted over 1 g 6 ml bond elut ppl solid phase extraction cartridges preconditioned with 2 cartridge volumes of methanol followed by 2 volumes of 0 1 formic acid solution dittmar et al 2008 loaded cartridges were desalted using a 200 ml dilute hydrochloric acid rinse ph 2 followed by a 30 ml 0 1 formic acid solution rinse to avoid halide contamination of the methanolic extract large volume washing of cartridges reduces the likelihood of iodo adducts luek et al 2017 xu et al 2013 and prior investigations with high and ultrahigh resolution electrospray mass spectrometry have confirmed covalently bound iodine in complex mixtures luek et al 2017 moulin et al 2001 xu et al 2013 cartridges were dried under vacuum and eluted with 10 ml ultrapure methanol methanolic extracts were stored at 20 c prior to ft icr ms analysis 2 3 ft icr ms analysis methanolic extracts were diluted 1 5 in ultrapure methanol and injected at 120 μl hr 1 using a bruker solarix 12t electrospray ionization ft icr ms located at the helmholtz zentrum munich germany the instrument was operated in negative mode to target solid phase extracted compounds and hocs complementary positive ionization was not performed although this mode could have ionized additional organic compounds including nitrogen containing hocs 500 scans were averaged for each sample and a post calibration was performed using a list of known dom internal calibrants to obtain a mass accuracy of less than 0 1 ppm table s1 the obtained full scan mass resolution was better than 400 000 at m z 400 allowing for precise formula assignments hertkorn et al 2008 all m z ions identified in the field blank were removed prior to further processing following the methods of sleighter et al 2012 replicate sample mass spectra were compared to confirm that variability in the mass spectral analysis across samples was different from variability among extraction replicates as a function of the of overlapping m z ions and a regression of peak magnitudes from two replicates figs s2 and s3 because the ions of interest were not understood a priori no surrogate or internal standards were added to samples prior to extraction or analysis and hence why ft icr ms is used as a semi quantitative approach ion suppression issues caused by changes in the matrix were limited by diluting samples sufficiently as determined by the transient spectra however remaining extraction and ionization efficiency issues are not addressed using this non targeted approach for this reason changes that would only be consistent with the expected changes in the matrix itself i e consistently present in only unbroken fracturing fluids but absent in all flowback and produced waters the largest contrast in the fluid matrices were not discussed to limit false pattern identification 2 4 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using gene cluster 3 0 and treeview on log transformed ion abundances to limit clustering driven only by high intensity ions clustering analysis using average linkages was performed on uncentered m z ions identified in each well on ions present in 2 or more samples between m z 150 400 3h n 6613 5h n 5296 clusters were selected with ions unique to flowback and early produced waters first three months of well operation and assigned formulas 2 5 formula assignments molecular formulas were assigned to individual ions from the entire spectra including selected hierarchical clusters using in house software hertkorn et al 2008 a range of 150 700 m z was selected to encompass the majority of ions in the spectra and where the calibration is reliable to 0 1 ppm formulas were assigned with a maximum value per assignment of c100h o80n3s2cl3br3i3 and a maximum error of 0 2 ppm the mass error associated with ions identified below the lowest molecular weight calibrant was sufficient for formula assignment in this 0 2 ppm window nonsensical formula assignments were removed using a number of criteria in favor of alternative plausible formula assignments formulas not passing the nitrogen rule mclafferty and turecek 1993 were removed within this software and remaining assignments were further reduced to remove invalid formulas by removing those with an oxygen to carbon ratio o c greater than one or a negative double bond equivalent dbe raw values of formulas containing only carbon hydrogen and oxygen cho as well as nitrogen chon or sulfur chos between m z 150 700 are reported in fig s4 additional filtering of assigned formulas identified during the cluster analysis involved removing assignments with more than 3 heteroatoms e g choi3 kept choi3s1 removed and preferentially removing duplicate assignments with very low o c ratios and higher heteroatoms based on consistencies found when checking many assigned formulas against isotopic pattern matching and consistently confirming their alternatives for example of the observed m z ions assigned to an iodinated formula approximately 50 had a duplicate formula assignment containing s and cl but were determined false assignments because the distinctive 35cl to 37cl isotopic ratios were not observed in the mass spectra it is possible that this stringent filtering criteria may have removed a small number of correct formula assignments but was necessary for management of the large dataset halogenated formula assignments were compared to their theoretical isotopic patterns fig s5 and those ions not matching their theoretical isotopic distribution were removed 0 1 ppm error with error consistent across isotopes and maximum 10 error in magnitude hocs found using the cluster analysis with insufficient intensity to confirm isotopically were not removed 43 of hoc formulas however about half of these low intensity ions were members of a homologous series for which at least one member was confirmed isotopically degree of confidence for halogenated formula assignments is discussed in section 3 1 and reported in table s4 assigned formulas matching known compounds are putatively named as such based on their plausible presence in these fluids and likelihood to ionize under the methods used but have not been confirmed structurally 3 results and discussion 3 1 cluster analysis reveals halogenated ions unique to early produced waters due to the obvious differences in the injected fluid unbroken gel and the flowback and produced waters broken gels shale derived fluids hierarchical clusters that only described differences between identified ions in the injected fluid and flowback and produced waters were not compared to avoid improper comparisons based on possible extraction differences between these two fluid types instead ions unique to a certain period of flowback were selected absent both before and after the selected period and therefore both the broken and unbroken fluid types three clusters could be identified in the 3h well series that contained ions unique to different flowback and early produced waters representing three fluid age groups 3s 1 3s 2 and 3s 3 fig s6 the 5h well series contained fewer samples and only one cluster of ions unique to flowback and early produced waters could be identified 5s 2 fig s7 all m z ions identified in these clusters are given in supplemental table s2 regardless of whether or not they could be assigned an unambiguous molecular formula the molecular formulas identified in the four selected clusters are presented as van krevelen diagrams to visualize differences in the formula assignments as a function of heteroatom type fig 1 van krevelen 1950 and oxidation and saturation status the selected clusters contained a large number of heteroatom formula assignments rather than those containing only carbon hydrogen and oxygen typically dominant in natural organic matter table s3 the ions in clusters 3s 1 3s 2 and 5s 2 contain similar dom heteroatom classes and distributions with 74 ions shared between the 5h well cluster and either the 3s 1 or 3s 2 cluster in contrast only three of the 5h well cluster ions overlapped with those in cluster 3 s3 a large number of ions containing both nitrogen and sulfur were observed cluster 3s 3 representing ions present only in early produced waters 32 80 d was distinct from the other clusters containing 155 ions with halogenated formula assignments that could be validated to varying degrees table s4 the majority of ions were iodinated 52 while 20 were brominated 9 were chlorinated and 19 contained two different halogens sixty five of these halogenated formula assignments were supported with secondary peaks matching their theoretical stable isotopic spectra e g fig s5 five iodinated ions had been previously identified in a north dakota flowback fluid where their assignment was supported by the appearance of a 126 9045 m z peak iodine during fragmentation luek et al 2017 of the remaining ions assigned plausible halogenated formulas many were members of homologous series separated by ch2 groups determined using kmd z values shakeri yekta et al 2012 where at least one member of the series had been confirmed isotopically thirty eight of the remaining halogenated formula assignments had intensities too low to rely on isotopic pattern matching particularly iodinated assignments which rely solely on the 13c peak among the other three clusters only five plausible halogenated formula assignments were identified and three confirmed using isotopic pattern matching the overlap of many nitrogen and or sulfur containing compounds between the 3h well and the 5h well clusters suggests similar processes are occurring in both wells resulting in these ions unique to flowback and early produced waters this is expected due to their similar hydraulic fracturing fluids and underlying geology in contrast the absence of a 5h well cluster containing hocs suggests a difference between the two wells possibly related to the smaller quantity of ammonium persulfate breaker added to 5h well see section 3 3 3 2 iodinated organic ions high in flowback and produced water due to the large number of iodinated organic compounds identified during the

iodides and oxidants e g persulfate are present in this system these data suggest the potential exists for biotic production of iodinated organic compounds in conjunction with abiotic reactions in this system albeit by low abundance microbial community members 4 conclusions iodinated organic ions were tracked through the first ten months of operation of two marcellus shale gas wells using ft icr ms and revealed a steep increase in the number of ions assigned iodinated organic molecular formulas during the initial flowback period the number and abundance of iodinated organic ions remained elevated in produced waters 276 days later hierarchical clustering analysis also revealed a large number of iodinated brominated and chlorinated ions that were unique to fluids returning to the surface of the 3h well 1 3 months after the initial flowback we suggest that biotic and abiotic oxidation of halides subsequently reacting with diverse dom contributes to the observed organohalogen diversity and temporal dynamics tracking changes in the chemical composition of shale gas fluids is essential for understanding fundamental changes occurring in hydraulic fracturing fluids particularly those driven by known additives and microbial communities although many similarities were observed between the two wells their differences raise questions as to why these differences exist do they reflect differences in geology hydraulic fracturing fluid mixtures hydraulic fracturing techniques or some other undescribed variable more work on this topic is needed to better understand how these results can be generalized to different wells understanding why differences are observed across hydraulic fracturing wastewaters is essential for understanding the fundamental functions occurring within a well and for addressing more applied questions of which wastewaters are suitable for reuse or a given treatment technique acknowledgements we thank mary evert and andrea

19659,an analytical method based on high resolution mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography lc hrms for 25 quaternary phosphonium compounds qpcs and derived phosphine oxides pos was developed and validated to investigate the occurrence and fate of qpcs in the aquatic environment water suspended solids and sediments from the rivers rhine and elbe upper and middle elbe as well as tidal elbe were analyzed as well as samples from tributaries bearing significant loads of qpcs for the first time the quaternary phosphonium compound tetrabutylphosphonium bu4p was detected in the river elbe concentrations were determined of up to 4700 ng l surface water and 1000 μg kg sediment respectively analysis of a time series of suspended solids 2005 2015 showed that qpcs have been present in the elbe and rhine catchment for at least one decade with partly rising tendency a degradation experiment with rhine sediment revealed that triphenylphosphonium compounds r ph3p and bu4p are persistent in contact with sediment and suspended solids and tend to sorb onto sediment particles toxicological studies reactive oxygen species ros after substance exposure ames test micronucleus test determination of cytotoxicity with selected qpcs confirmed that all of them exhibit cytotoxicity and some even genotoxic potential at elevated concentrations which emphasizes the need for an emission regulation of these compounds keywords tetrabutylphosphonium sorption partition coefficient cytotoxicity genotoxicity lc qtof ms 1 introduction the contamination of water bodies with a multitude of emerging contaminants is a challenging problem for water monitoring and water treatment processes today schwarzenbach et al 2006 although many of the organic contaminants are present at low concentrations they may raise considerable eco toxicological concerns due to their occurrence in complex mixtures or simply because the total load transported in some rivers may be quite high several t a buxton et al 2015 luna acosta et al 2012 petersen et al 2014 various classes of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals richardson and ternes 2005 ternes 1998 estrogens hanselman et al 2003 biocides and pesticides pereira et al 1996 household chemicals slack et al 2005 and personal care product ingredients daughton and ternes 1999 have been detected worldwide in rivers and streams more recently a variety of starting materials for chemical syntheses or recycling processes as well as synthesis byproducts have also been detected in the aquatic environment dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer

schymanski et al 2015 a variety of ensuing questions arise of particular interest are eco toxicological data but also exposure source of contamination time trends and continuity total annual loads transported in the particular river stream etc bioaccumulation and persistence in the aquatic environment should be investigated together these data are the basis for environmental risk assessments era european commission 2006 hernando et al 2006 recently a new class of contaminants has been identified in the river rhine namely quaternary triphenylphosphonium compounds r ph3p schlüsener et al 2015 r ph3p compounds are well known for being used for the wittig reaction by the chemical industry pommer 1977 trippett 1963 although some other special applications such as their use as phase transfer catalysts or for recovery of technetium from radioactive waste streams have been reported evans et al 2008 weidlich and martinkova 2012 werner 2009 indeed representatives of this class with r methyl ethyl butyl methoxymethyl and phenyl have been found in water sediments and or suspended solid samples in remarkably high concentrations in the river rhine whenever the sampling site was located nearby larger chemical industry sites schlüsener et al 2015 although municipal wastewater should not be ignored its contribution to the overall load of certain compounds was negligibly small compared to the emissions of the chemical industry schlüsener et al 2015 additionally certain alkyl triphenylphosphonium homologues have been used as probes to estimate the membrane potential of cells vesicles or liposomes during biological assays ono et al 1994 yang et al 1999 2000 which is a first hint to a potential toxicological relevance due to their ability to penetrate lipid bilayer membranes the aim of this study was to elucidate the occurrence and fate of quaternary phosphonium compounds qpcs in rivers and streams as well as to assess their eco toxicological relevance with that in mind another important european stream with considerable industrial wastewater discharge namely the elbe upper and middle as well as tidal elbe was monitored with a newly developed analytical method containing 25 qpcs and derived phosphine oxides pos additionally degradation experiments with four representative qpcs were performed since no data were available concerning the behavior of these compounds in the aquatic environment furthermore suspended solid samples of the german environmental specimen bank of the rivers rhine and elbe were analyzed to elucidate the time trends of contaminations from 2005 to 2015 finally the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of these compounds was investigated by reactive oxygen species ros after substance exposure bacterial reverse mutation

significance of linear and non linear trend components by means of an analysis of variance anova following the approach of fryer and nicholson 1999 annual loads of the compounds were calculated by multiplying the determined concentrations of the sd extracts with the total ss loads at the corresponding location and year table s12 for the tidal elbe however calculation of annual loads kg a was impossible due to the tidal amplitude which makes ss particles move in both directions of the river course hence for blankenese only concentrations μg kg are reported 2 7 aerobic lab scale degradation

validation we developed a new analytical method for qpcs which was validated for 25 substances with this method a new quaternary phosphonium compound was identified in elbe samples namely tetrabutylphosphonium bu4p m z 259 2544 rt 9 31 measurement of an authentic reference standard tetrabutylphosphonium bromide sigma aldrich taufkirchen germany confirmed its discovery fig 1 and fig s5 similar to r ph3p this compound is also used as phase transfer catalyst in the synthesis of certain organic compounds or can be used as accelerator for the curing of e g phenolic based epoxy resins balakrishnan and damodarkumar 2000 ouyang et al 2014 smith 1979 all contained substances and validation parameters of the new method are shown in tables s2 s4 3 2 occurrence between july and august 2015 water and sediment samples from 34 sampling sites at the river elbe were taken and analyzed with the new analytical method upper middle and tidal elbe see table 1 for exact location data see tables s6 s9 in the si in contrast to results from the river rhine schlüsener et al 2015 quaternary triphenylphosphonium compounds r ph3p were barely present in the surface water of the elbe for 22 out of 25 substances concentrations were below the limit of quantification loq 10 ng l regardless if the samples were from the upper middle elbe or the tidal elbe area only me ph3p and bu ph3p could be found in appreciable concentrations at the mouthing of the tributary mulde 36 and 19 ng l respectively and me ph3p was present at the last 100 km of the middle elbe at dömitz and geesthacht with 10 and 14 ng l respectively table 1 however tetrabutylphosphonium bu4p was found in elbe sw sd and ss samples unlike r ph3p compounds bu4p was found in elevated concentrations in the surface water of the elbe especially near barby and the mouth of the saale river up to 4700 ng l as bu4p was not present at all in the elbe upstream of the saale mouth and a constant decrease of the bu4p concentrations from rki 290 7 to the north sea was detected a source in the saale river catchment was very likely responsible for the high concentrations of bu4p in the sw of the elbe nevertheless bu4p was still detected with a concentration of 68 ng l at the sampling site oste at the boarder to the german bight highlighting the potential of qpcs to also reach and contaminate coastal and even marine water in general the concentration patterns of r ph3p and bu4p in sediments were similar to those in the surface waters however some differences were observed first of all low concentrations of meome ph3p me ph3p et ph3p and ph ph3p were found in sd samples taken directly downstream of the czech border at prossen table 1 within the next 250 river kilometers concentrations remained constant or decreased slightly until dessau where a notable increase in r ph3p concentrations was observed increases were most distinct for et ph3p bu ph3p and me ph3p for which concentrations of up to 450 μg kg 83 μg kg and 62 μg kg were measured at dessau elevated concentrations of meome ph3p and pro ph3p were also detected while they were present in only very low concentrations or not at all among the rest of the river course thus major contaminations of the elbe with r ph3p seem to occur through the mulde river the occurrence r ph3p in elbe sd but not elbe sw might have two possible explanations i r ph3p found exclusively in sd samples are historic burdens and are no longer emitted by the chemical industry or more likely ii these compounds are emitted discontinuously and the sampling date fell in a low concentration phase investigations at the rhine have shown that concentrations of r ph3p are closely related to production cycles of the chemical industry with emission maxima and periods in which the concentrations were below the loqs schlüsener et al 2015 bu4p on the other hand was found at very high concentrations in both middle elbe and tidal elbe sd see fig 2 although bu4p was not detected in the river elbe upstream of barby concentrations were remarkably high after the mouth of river saale 770 μg kg which is consistent with the results of the corresponding sw samples sd concentrations of bu4p analogous to the sw concentrations generally decreased downstream of the mouth of river saale but were still high with 380 μg kg at the sluice in geesthacht rki 582 8 samples taken at the mouth of the tributaries havel havelberg stepenitz wittenberge and sude boize boizenburg exhibited notably lower concentrations of bu4p and r ph3p which means that they most likely do not contribute to contamination of the elbe river with qpcs to confirm that the major contamination of the elbe with bu4p happens through the saale additional sw and sd samples from the saale river between leuna and halle were taken in september 2016 table s7 concentrations in both sw and sd were found to be very high with up to 7400 ng l and 1400 μg kg respectively table 1 the elevated concentrations in sw highlight that bu4p was obviously still discharged in 2016 by larger industrial production sites located at the saale probably at leuna and schkopau in the tidal elbe highest concentration of bu4p was found at seemannshöft rki 638 9 with 1000 μg kg which was surprising since no major source for qpcs in the tidal elbe upstream of seemannshöft could be identified additional ss and sd samples from this area taken beyond the initial sampling campaign and over a lager period of time also exhibited very high concentrations of bu4p table s9 as source for high bu4p concentrations we assume a larger chemical company near bützfleth stade a few river kilometers downstream of the sampling site this assumption is underlined by the fact that the same company has additional production sites at leuna and schkopau where also elevated concentrations of bu4p were detected high concentrations at seemannshöft are probably caused by an upstream transport process of suspended solids and sediments called tidal pumping the tidal amplitude moves water in regular intervals up and downstream always entraining sd and ss within since in the elbe estuary the tidal period is asymmetrical the flood period is shorter and the flood current therefore stronger than the ebb period this process is even enhanced in summer months during low fresh water discharge and leads to net upstream transport of sediment and suspended particulate matter since the weaker ebb current is insufficient to bring all the sd ss back to the river mouth boehlich and strotmann 2008 tide project 2010 2013 this example shows that in tidal rivers sd ss and concurrently contaminants such as bu4p in the elbe catchment can be transported upstream and cause contaminations at originally unexpected upstream sites 3 3 time trends analysis of a time series of suspended solid samples of the years 2005 2015 showed that some qpcs have been present in the elbe and or rhine river for the last decade fig 3 and table s12 3 3 1 elbe in general the time trends for the individual qpcs were similar in barby middle elbe and blankenese tidal elbe which indicates either a common source of the qpcs primarily river mulde or in the case of bu4p a similar temporal pattern of the emissions at both assumed emission hot spots leuna schkopau and bützfleth for bu4p the highest concentrations of all investigated compounds were detected and concentrations sorbed on ss did not change significantly over time average concentrations 270 μg kg in barby and 430 μg kg in blankenese for the three detected triphenylphosphonium compounds me ph3p et ph3p and bu ph3p different time trends were observed the concentrations of bu ph3p at blankenese decreased from 15 μg kg in 2005 to loq in the years 2014 and 2015 while the concentrations at barby changed erratically from values 40 μg kg in years 2005 and 2012 to loq in five others years for me ph3p the concentrations in ss were only in the low μg kg range with maximum concentrations of 5 9 μg kg 2008 in blankenese and 6 8 μg kg 2015 in barby respectively this is in accordance to low concentrations of me ph3p in the respective sediment samples from the sampling campaign in 2015 on the contrary the ss concentrations of et ph3p decreased at both sampling sites at river elbe at barby the concentrations lessened from 38 μg kg to 7 0 μg kg in the time frame 2005 2015 while the concentrations dropped almost linearly from 69 μg kg to 8 9 μg kg at blankenese ph4p pro ph3p and meome ph3p which were found only sporadically in sediment samples were never detected loq in the ss samples from barby and blankenese hence these three qpcs were obviously not emitted at elevated concentrations in the elbe river in recent years furthermore no additional qpcs could be detected in ss samples from 2005 to 2015 compared to detections in sw and sd samples from the sampling campaign of 2015 3 3 2 rhine in contrast to river elbe bu4p was not detected in ss samples from the rhine at koblenz hence despite the large number of different chemical industries at the river rhine none of these discharged bu4p in considerable amounts between 2006 and 2015 in addition we searched the data files of the sediment and water samples from the rhine catchment reported in schlüsener et al 2015 for the mass of bu4p however bu4p was also not detected in any of these samples loq data not shown thus bu4p seems to be a rather elbe specific compound and its presence in sediments of coastal and marine parts of the german bay could be used as an indicator that at least parts from the sediments at this site originated from the elbe catchment however according with schlüsener et al 2015 triphenylphosphonium compounds were detected at elevated concentrations in ss samples from the rhine at koblenz in analogy to the elbe catchment concentrations of me ph3p did not change significantly over time average concentration 47 μg kg while the concentrations of et ph3p decreased from 56 μg kg in 2006 to 20 μg kg in 2015 the concentrations of ph4p which was not detected in ss samples from the elbe decreased by approx a factor of five from 2006 to 2015 82 μg kg vs 18 μg kg in contrast the concentrations of meome ph3p in ss samples from koblenz increased by more than a factor of ten from 2006 to 2015 since in 2006 only 19 μg kg were detected whereas 260 μg kg were found in 2015 despite that the concentrations of contaminants in ss give valuable information about the occurrence and potential effects of these compounds in rivers loads have to be calculated to estimate actual emissions table s12 and fig s14 highest loads of sorbed qpcs were calculated with 180 kg a for bu4p at the elbe in barby 2010 and 420 kg a for meome ph3p at the river rhine in koblenz 2013 since 80 of triphenylphosphonium compounds are transported in the dissolved phase schlüsener et al 2015 individual qpcs have been discharged in several tons per year into the rivers rhine and elbe for the last decade by the chemical industry as the sorption affinity of bu4p is much lower than for the common r ph3p see chapter below the actual total annual loads of bu4p at the river elbe could have been even substantially higher finally triphenylphosphine oxide tppo the major side product from the wittig reaction schlüsener et al 2015 trippett 1963 was also monitored in ss samples fig s13 interestingly it could not be detected in blankenese and was only found sporadically above the loq in barby while it was found at almost constant concentrations of approx 20 μg kg in ss from the rhine at koblenz overall the time trends reveal that r ph3p have been primarily used in the rhine catchment area while the occurrence of bu4p was is restricted to the elbe catchment in addition the time trends also indicate that et ph3p has become successively less important in industrial chemical processes while meome ph3p seems to take over as its loads have increased significantly more than 10 fold since 2005 in the rhine catchment upstream of koblenz 3 4 degradation experiment to investigate the behavior of qpcs in the aquatic environment the degradation of me ph3p et ph3p meome ph3p and bu4p was studied a well defined amount of substance was spiked to a vessel with sediment and water and aliquots of both phases were analyzed after workup see also materials and methods the amounts of substance quantified in water and sediment extract were summed up and divided by the amount of substance initially spiked into the experiment vessel to determine the recovery rate which should decrease over the course of the experiment if a degradation of the substance takes place however fig s18 shows that for all four compounds the recovery rates remained constant at about 70 80 which indicates that they were not degraded but were rather persistent under test conditions loss in the mass balance probably due to the formation of non extractable residues additionally concentrations found in the sediment extracts were significantly higher than in the water phase underlining their elevated adsorption affinities fig s19 kd values calculated based on these data average of the last four points of each degradation experiment see table s20 of approximately 1800 l kg for me ph3p 1400 l kg for et ph3p 1900 l kg for meome ph3p and 110 l kg for bu4p reflect this sorption behavior according to appendix xiii of the european regulation concerning the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach european parlament 2006 substances are classified as persistent p if their half life time is i a greater than 120 d in freshwater sediments and as very persistent vp when their half life period in freshwater sediments exceeds 180 d as tested qpc concentrations were constant until the end of the degradation experiments 100 d very likely these compounds have to be considered as persistent persistence of a substance is alarming especially in combination with bioaccumulation potential or toxicity but also for itself should be investigated carefully as persistent substances may potentially disturb ecological equilibriums and an uncontaminated environment may be reachieved only with great efforts considering the fact that qpcs have a single positive charge at the phosphorous atom and soil or sediment compartments are well known for bearing negatively polarized or charged functional groups e g deprotonated carboxyl groups of humic acids or silicate groups of phyllosilicate clay minerals it is not surprising that these compounds can easily sorb onto sediment particles it is striking however that the kd value for bu4p is one magnitude smaller than those of r ph3p compounds unfortunately modelling and predicting sorption behavior of molecules onto soil and sediments is a very complex subject when ionic species are involved while sorption of neutral organic compounds happens primarily to humic substances and is well investigated schwarzenbach et al 2003 sorption of ionic organic species may occur equally at clay mineral surfaces and is determined by a variety of parameters such as ionic strength concentration of competitive ions ph value and steric factors droge and goss 2013a b franco and trapp 2008 since in our case all experimental and sediment parameters were the same across degradation experiments we assume that differences in observed kd values result from different physico chemical properties of the respective compounds all qpcs have a formal charge of 1 at the phosphor and are not even close to be protonated or deprotonated at natural conditions ph values regarding the overall size of the respective molecules bu4p has the highest van der waals volume with four sterically demanding n butyl chains table 2 assuming that adsorption of qpcs onto sediment primarily occurs due to the positive charge at the phosphorous atom coulomb force the latter would be better shielded and harder to access the greater the residual groups are obviously the three phenyl groups are less sterically demanding than the n butyl chains thus shielding the positive charge less well which leads to enhanced sorption affinity of r ph3p compared to bu4p the composition of r seems to have a minor influence onto the sorption behavior at least as far as investigated r ph3p are concerned nevertheless one should keep in mind that various other interactions and parameters have not been considered and that for a profound discussion of physisorption processes further investigations and calculations have to be made 3 5 partition coefficients distribution ratios partition coefficients in octanol water log kow are an indicator for hydrophilicity of a chemical species and give information about the distribution of the latter between two different phases whereas distribution ratios log dow refer to total concentrations of a given chemical distributed between two different phases kow dow when only one species of a chemical is present schwarzenbach et al 2003 log kow dow values are very often used as approximation for the partition coefficient between water and phospholipid membranes log klipw of a substance thus being an important factor in drug design and toxicity considerations endo et al 2011 mouritsen et al 2001 however this approximation is only valid for uncharged compounds although some new approaches have been published trying to include ionic species into prediction models bittermann et al 2014 zhao and abraham 2005 for ionic species in particular partition between two phases is dependent on the concentration and type of counter ions as ion pair formation and distribution must be added to the equilibrium consideration escher and sigg 2004 westall et al 1990 since qpcs bear a single positive charge and very often only calculated log dow values are available we decided to experimentally determine partition coefficients for the compounds used in the degradation experiments as it can be seen in table 3 experimental log dow values differ significantly from calculated values i e by five to six orders of magnitude low dow values might partly be explained by low counter ion concentration since no counter ions other than those from dissociated phosphonium salt molecules were present according to escher and sigg 2004 ion pair partitioning is about 10000 times higher as compared to ion partitioning but even under the assumption that the determined log dow values were solely for the ion partitioning and thus values for the ion pair partitioning about the factor 104 higher there still would be a gap of approx two orders of magnitude or more depending on the calculation method between calculated and experimental values so obviously common calculation methods and prediction models are not able to estimate the dow values of these charged substances properly the type of counter ion however as well as the structure of r side chains did not have a significant impact on the partition since log dow values were comparable for all four investigated substances not showing any prominent difference between r ph3p and bu4p or br and cl interestingly there are several publications using alkyl triphenylphosphonium homologues as probes to estimate the membrane potential of cells vesicles or liposomes and measuring their membrane partition coefficients ono et al 1994 yang et al 1999 2000 yang et al 2000 reported log klipw values between 1 20 and 3 02 for different qpcs increasing with the length of the alkyl chain partition of those compounds in lipid membrane layers is a bit surprising at first sight as one would expect a more hydrophilic behavior of those compounds based on the experimental log dow values we obtained on closer inspection however yang et al also stated that in absence of an external electric field or a so called electrogenic pumps translocation of alkyl triphenylphosphonium compounds through membranes is minimal and that they predominantly interact with the outer leaflet of a bilayer membrane yang et al 2000 this means that under some conditions phosphonium compounds may translocate through bilayer membranes while under other conditions they only bind to or penetrate the outer leaflet of lipid membranes which can be important for assessment of toxicity see also chapter below under the conditions used for the simple distribution experiments no external electric field etc the obtained log dow and log klipw values indicate that qpcs have kind of an amphiphilic character but that hydrophilic properties dominate their behavior especially for the compounds with short alkyl groups 3 6 toxicity 3 6 1 ros and cytotoxicity to detect precursor events which can result in genotoxicity and cytotoxicity intracellular reactive oxygen species ros were measured all tested substances led to an increase in reactive oxygen species the lowest concentration leading to an increase in ros levels lowest observed effect concentration loec is shown in table 4 since reactive oxygen species can lead to endogenous dna damage e g single strand breaks ap sites oxidatively modified dna bases and cytotoxicity the genotoxic and the cytotoxic potential of the phosphonium compounds were also investigated it was found that all tested phosphonium compounds with exception of tetrabutylphosphonium bromide bu4p br induced cytotoxicity in human cells but that for 8 out of 13 compounds loecs for ros appeared to be higher than or equal to cytotoxicity loecs thus for these substances cytotoxicity cannot be a result of ros since cell necrosis occurred at lower concentrations than generation of ros concerning the loecs some kind of grading for cytotoxicity could be observed with the highest effect for the reference substance tributylhexadecylphosphonium bromide c16h33 bu3p br 0 0006 mmol l tetraphenylphosphonium chloride ph4p cl showed second highest cytotoxicity 0 0032 mmol l followed by the n alkyl r me et pro bu and benzyltriphenylphosphonium bn ph3p br compounds which all showed comparable results ca 0 01 0 03 mmol l phosphonium compounds with ether groups r meome meocarbme seem to be less cytotoxic ca 0 1 0 2 mmol l while the phosphine oxides meome ph2po tppo had the highest loecs 0 2 2 mmol l among investigated compounds table 4 the comparison of bu4p br no cytotoxicity up to highest tested concentration with bu4p cl 0 5 mmol l indicated that the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of the investigated compounds was also influenced by the halogen counter ion concerning the specificity of the cytotoxicity comparison of cytotoxicity with baseline toxicity can reveal if cytotoxicity is caused by a specific effect baseline toxicity also referred to as narcosis is defined as a nonspecific reversible disturbance of the functioning of the membrane caused by accumulation of the pollutants in hydrophobic phases within the organism wezel and opperhuizen 1995 although any chemical can potentially elicit narcosis it might be of higher relevance for qpcs in particular since they have the potential to penetrate double layer membranes see section 3 5 so based on the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar published by escher et al 2017 we calculated effect concentrations ec50 for cytotoxicity and toxic ratios tr for qpcs for which experimental klipw values were available yang et al 2000 and plotted the calculated values predicted by the qsar compared to our experimental data see fig 4 and table s21 note that loec equals ec50 since loec was defined as the last data point where the amount of vital cells was still 50 the experimental log 1 ec50 values of all compounds were near to the values predicted by the qsar with solely ph4p lying slightly above the predicted baseline toxicity however escher et al proposed that values lying in the range of 0 1 tr 10 can be considered as baseline toxicants and that only values outside this range indicate further specific or reactive modes of action such as uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation acetylcholine esterase inhibition membrane irritation or seizure of the central nervous system escher et al 2017 hence as shown in fig 4 investigated qpcs can all be considered as baseline toxicants according to the procedure of escher et al 2017 3 6 2 genotoxicity the phosphonium compounds c16h33 bu3p br and meome ph2po showed a mutagenic potential during the initial screen for genotoxic impact of the test substances with the bacterial reverse mutation test ames test with s9 and without metabolic activation s9 the results are presented in table s22 as the lowest concentration with mutagenic effects induction factor 1 2 moreover the diverse phosphonium compounds resulted in different loecs for induction of micronuclei table 4 as overt cytotoxicity could lead to artefactual positive results regarding induction of micronuclei tested concentration values for micronucleus induction must lay outside the cytotoxic range therefore the following compounds were identified as potentially genotoxic in the micronucleus assay meocarbme ph3p br bu4p br meome ph3p cl and tppo the detected induction of micronuclei as measure of genotoxicity of the other tested substances can be considered as secondary effects of cytotoxicity overall considering the detected environmental concentrations of the investigated phosphonium compounds the concentrations leading to toxic effects were significantly higher however it should be kept in mind that a repeated or chronic exposure can occur c16h33 bu3p br and meome ph2po showed a mutagenic potential in the bacterial reverse mutation test and therefore dna reactivity but led to no induction of micronuclei in human cells thus a third genotoxic test is indicated to assess the genotoxic relevance of these compounds in humans meocarbme ph3p br bu4p br meome ph3p cl and tppo for which an induction of micronuclei in human cells was observed can be assessed most likely as genotoxic finally in terms of human toxicology and the associated precautionary reasons the concentration of these compounds with genotoxic potential should not be higher than 100 ng l in drinking water as the health related guide values concept for drinking water suggests for genotoxic substances dieter 2014 4 conclusion qpcs were detected in high concentrations in the german rivers elbe and rhine probably due to point emissions from the chemical industry due to the high consumptions of qpc as intermediate products in the wittig synthesis of olefins e g vitamin a and their use as phase transfer catalysts it can be expected that they are worldwide present in rivers and streams used as receiving water for the effluents of industrial wastewater treatment plants wwtp from chemical industry it has to be noted that intermediate products of chemical synthesis are not covered by reach registration or by any other product regulation as they are not defined as products hence they should not be discharged into in the aquatic environment although the production volumes for individual compounds e g meome ph3p are far higher than 100000 t a only in germany this regulation gap needs to be shortly closed as i qpcs are very likely only one representative of several other intermediate products of chemicals synthesis that are discharged into the aquatic environment ii are shown to be persistent accumulating on ss iii have been discharged for at least one decade with sometimes increasing quantities and iv even cytotoxic and genotoxic effects cannot be ruled out thus qpcs are potential candidates for new pbt compounds the questions arises which other synthesis intermediate chemicals are discharged by the chemical industry and are harmful for the aquatic urban water cycle since they are neither registered nor regulated at all however as industrial wwtps are point sources the emission of those synthesis intermediates can be managed either by technical solutions at the production plants or at the industrial wwtps for qpcs biodegradation and ozonation cannot help to remove these persistent compounds with electron deficits however processes

19659,an analytical method based on high resolution mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography lc hrms for 25 quaternary phosphonium compounds qpcs and derived phosphine oxides pos was developed and validated to investigate the occurrence and fate of qpcs in the aquatic environment water suspended solids and sediments from the rivers rhine and elbe upper and middle elbe as well as tidal elbe were analyzed as well as samples from tributaries bearing significant loads of qpcs for the first time the quaternary phosphonium compound tetrabutylphosphonium bu4p was detected in the river elbe concentrations were determined of up to 4700 ng l surface water and 1000 μg kg sediment respectively analysis of a time series of suspended solids 2005 2015 showed that qpcs have been

emission regulation of these compounds keywords tetrabutylphosphonium sorption partition coefficient cytotoxicity genotoxicity lc qtof ms 1 introduction the contamination of water bodies with a multitude of emerging contaminants is a challenging problem for water monitoring and water treatment processes today schwarzenbach et al 2006 although many of the organic contaminants are present at low concentrations they may raise considerable eco toxicological concerns due to their occurrence in complex mixtures or simply because the total load transported in some rivers may be quite high several t a buxton et al 2015 luna acosta et al 2012 petersen et al 2014 various classes of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals richardson and ternes 2005 ternes 1998 estrogens hanselman et al 2003

era european commission 2006 hernando et al 2006 recently a new class of contaminants has been identified in the river rhine namely quaternary triphenylphosphonium compounds r ph3p schlüsener et al 2015 r ph3p compounds are well known for being used for the wittig reaction by the chemical industry pommer 1977 trippett 1963 although some other special applications such as their use as phase transfer catalysts or for recovery of technetium from radioactive waste streams have been reported evans et al 2008 weidlich and martinkova 2012 werner 2009 indeed representatives of this class with r methyl ethyl butyl methoxymethyl and phenyl have been found in water sediments and or suspended solid samples in remarkably high concentrations in the river rhine whenever the sampling site was located nearby larger chemical industry sites schlüsener et al 2015 although municipal wastewater should not be ignored its contribution to the overall load of certain compounds was negligibly small compared to the emissions of the chemical industry schlüsener et al 2015 additionally certain alkyl triphenylphosphonium homologues have been used as probes to estimate the membrane potential of cells vesicles or liposomes during biological assays ono et al 1994 yang et al 1999 2000 which is a first hint to a potential toxicological relevance due to their ability to penetrate lipid bilayer membranes the aim of this study was to elucidate the occurrence and fate of quaternary phosphonium compounds qpcs in rivers and streams as well as to assess their eco toxicological relevance with that in mind another important european stream with considerable industrial wastewater discharge namely the elbe upper and middle as well as tidal elbe was monitored with a newly developed analytical method containing 25 qpcs and derived phosphine oxides pos additionally degradation experiments with four representative qpcs were performed since no data were available concerning the behavior of these compounds in the aquatic environment furthermore suspended solid samples of the german environmental specimen bank of the rivers rhine and elbe were analyzed to elucidate the time trends of contaminations from 2005 to 2015 finally the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of these compounds was investigated by reactive oxygen species ros after substance exposure bacterial reverse mutation

validation we developed a new analytical method for qpcs which was validated for 25 substances with this method a new quaternary phosphonium compound was identified in elbe samples namely tetrabutylphosphonium bu4p m z 259 2544 rt 9 31 measurement of an authentic reference standard tetrabutylphosphonium bromide sigma aldrich taufkirchen germany confirmed its discovery fig 1 and fig s5 similar to r ph3p this compound is also used as phase transfer catalyst in the synthesis of certain organic compounds or can be used as accelerator for the curing of e g phenolic based epoxy resins balakrishnan and damodarkumar 2000 ouyang et al 2014 smith 1979 all contained substances and validation parameters of the new method are shown in tables s2 s4 3 2 occurrence between july and august 2015 water and sediment samples from 34 sampling sites at the river elbe were taken and analyzed with the new analytical method upper middle and tidal elbe see table 1 for exact location data see tables s6 s9 in the si in contrast to results from the river rhine schlüsener et al 2015 quaternary triphenylphosphonium compounds r ph3p were barely present in the surface water of the elbe for 22 out of 25 substances concentrations were below the limit of quantification loq 10 ng l regardless if the samples were from the upper middle elbe or the tidal elbe area only me ph3p and bu ph3p could be found in appreciable concentrations at the mouthing of the tributary mulde 36 and 19 ng l respectively and me ph3p was present at the last 100 km of the middle elbe at dömitz and geesthacht with 10 and 14 ng l respectively table 1 however tetrabutylphosphonium bu4p was found in elbe sw sd and ss samples unlike r ph3p compounds bu4p was found in elevated concentrations in the surface water of the elbe especially near barby and the mouth of the saale river up to 4700 ng l as bu4p was not present at all in the elbe upstream of the saale mouth and a constant decrease of the bu4p concentrations from rki 290 7 to the north sea was detected a source in the saale river catchment was very likely responsible for the high concentrations of bu4p in the sw of the elbe nevertheless bu4p was still detected with a concentration of 68 ng l at the sampling site oste at the boarder to the german bight highlighting the potential of qpcs to also reach and contaminate coastal and even marine water in general the concentration patterns of r ph3p and bu4p in sediments were similar to those in the surface waters however some differences were observed first of all low concentrations of meome ph3p me ph3p et ph3p and ph ph3p were found in sd samples taken directly downstream of the czech border at prossen table 1 within the next 250 river kilometers concentrations remained constant or decreased slightly until dessau where a notable increase in r ph3p concentrations was observed increases were most distinct for et ph3p bu ph3p and me ph3p for which concentrations of up to 450 μg kg 83 μg kg and 62 μg kg were measured at dessau elevated concentrations of meome ph3p and pro ph3p were also detected while they were present in only very low concentrations or not at all among the rest of the river course thus major contaminations of the elbe with r ph3p seem to occur through the mulde river the occurrence r ph3p in elbe sd but not elbe sw might have two possible explanations i r ph3p found exclusively in sd samples are historic burdens and are no longer emitted by the chemical industry or more likely ii these compounds are emitted discontinuously and the sampling date fell in a low concentration phase investigations at the rhine have shown that concentrations of r ph3p are closely related to production cycles of the chemical industry with emission maxima and periods in which the concentrations were below the loqs schlüsener et al 2015 bu4p on the other hand was found at very high concentrations in both middle elbe and tidal elbe sd see fig 2 although bu4p was not detected in the river elbe upstream of barby concentrations were remarkably high after the mouth of river saale 770 μg kg which is consistent with the results of the corresponding sw samples sd concentrations of bu4p analogous to the sw concentrations generally decreased downstream of the mouth of river saale but were still high with 380 μg kg at the sluice in geesthacht rki 582 8 samples taken at the mouth of the tributaries havel havelberg stepenitz wittenberge and sude boize boizenburg exhibited notably lower concentrations of bu4p and r ph3p which means that they most likely do not contribute to contamination of the elbe river with qpcs to confirm that the major contamination of the elbe with bu4p happens through the saale additional sw and sd samples from the saale river between leuna and halle were taken in september 2016 table s7 concentrations in both sw and sd were found to be very high with up to 7400 ng l and 1400 μg kg respectively table 1 the elevated concentrations in sw highlight that bu4p was obviously still discharged in 2016 by larger industrial production sites located at the saale probably at leuna and schkopau in the tidal elbe highest concentration of bu4p was found at seemannshöft rki 638 9 with 1000 μg kg which was surprising since no major source for qpcs in the tidal elbe upstream of seemannshöft could be identified additional ss and sd samples from this area taken beyond the initial sampling campaign and over a lager period of time also exhibited very high concentrations of bu4p table s9 as source for high bu4p concentrations we assume a larger chemical company near bützfleth stade a few river kilometers downstream of the sampling site this assumption is underlined by the fact that the same company has additional production sites at leuna and schkopau where also elevated concentrations of bu4p were detected high concentrations at seemannshöft are probably caused by an upstream transport process of suspended solids and sediments called tidal pumping the tidal amplitude moves water in regular intervals up and downstream always entraining sd and ss within since in the elbe estuary the tidal period is asymmetrical the flood period is shorter and the flood current therefore stronger than the ebb period this process is even enhanced in summer months during low fresh water discharge and leads to net upstream transport of sediment and suspended particulate matter since the weaker ebb current is insufficient to bring all the sd ss back to the river mouth boehlich and strotmann 2008 tide project 2010 2013 this example shows that in tidal rivers sd ss and concurrently contaminants such as bu4p in the elbe catchment can be transported upstream and cause contaminations at originally unexpected upstream sites 3 3 time trends analysis of a time series of suspended solid samples of the years 2005 2015 showed that some qpcs have been present in the elbe and or rhine river for the last decade fig 3 and table s12 3 3 1 elbe in general the time trends for the individual qpcs were similar in barby middle elbe and blankenese tidal elbe which indicates either a common source of the qpcs primarily river mulde or in the case of bu4p a similar temporal pattern of the emissions at both assumed emission hot spots leuna schkopau and bützfleth for bu4p the highest concentrations of all investigated compounds were detected and concentrations sorbed on ss did not change significantly over time average concentrations 270 μg kg in barby and 430 μg kg in blankenese for the three detected triphenylphosphonium compounds me ph3p et ph3p and bu ph3p different time trends were observed the concentrations of bu ph3p at blankenese decreased from 15 μg kg in 2005 to loq in the years 2014 and 2015 while the concentrations at barby changed erratically from values 40 μg kg in years 2005 and 2012 to loq in five others years for me ph3p the concentrations in ss were only in the low μg kg range with maximum concentrations of 5 9 μg kg 2008 in blankenese and 6 8 μg kg 2015 in barby respectively this is in accordance to low concentrations of me ph3p in the respective sediment samples from the sampling campaign in 2015 on the contrary the ss concentrations of et ph3p decreased at both sampling sites at river elbe at barby the concentrations lessened from 38 μg kg to 7 0 μg kg in the time frame 2005 2015 while the concentrations dropped almost linearly from 69 μg kg to 8 9 μg kg at blankenese ph4p pro ph3p and meome ph3p which were found only sporadically in sediment samples were never detected loq in the ss samples from barby and blankenese hence these three qpcs were obviously not emitted at elevated concentrations in the elbe river in recent years furthermore no additional qpcs could be detected in ss samples from 2005 to 2015 compared to detections in sw and sd samples from the sampling campaign of 2015 3 3 2 rhine in contrast to river elbe bu4p was not detected in ss samples from the rhine at koblenz hence despite the large number of different chemical industries at the river rhine none of these discharged bu4p in considerable amounts between 2006 and 2015 in addition we searched the data files of the sediment and water samples from the rhine catchment reported in schlüsener et al 2015 for the mass of bu4p however bu4p was also not detected in any of these samples loq data not shown thus bu4p seems to be a rather elbe specific compound and its presence in sediments of coastal and marine parts of the german bay could be used as an indicator that at least parts from the sediments at this site originated from the elbe catchment however according with schlüsener et al 2015 triphenylphosphonium compounds were detected at elevated concentrations in ss samples from the rhine at koblenz in analogy to the elbe catchment concentrations of me ph3p did not change significantly over time average concentration 47 μg kg while the concentrations of et ph3p decreased from 56 μg kg in 2006 to 20 μg kg in 2015 the concentrations of ph4p which was not detected in ss samples from the elbe decreased by approx a factor of five from 2006 to 2015 82 μg kg vs 18 μg kg in contrast the concentrations of meome ph3p in ss samples from koblenz increased by more than a factor of ten from 2006 to 2015 since in 2006 only 19 μg kg were detected whereas 260 μg kg were found in 2015 despite that the concentrations of contaminants in ss give valuable information about the occurrence and potential effects of these compounds in rivers loads have to be calculated to estimate actual emissions table s12 and fig s14 highest loads of sorbed qpcs were calculated with 180 kg a for bu4p at the elbe in barby 2010 and 420 kg a for meome ph3p at the river rhine in koblenz 2013 since 80 of triphenylphosphonium compounds are transported in the dissolved phase schlüsener et al 2015 individual qpcs have been discharged in several tons per year into the rivers rhine and elbe for the last decade by the chemical industry as the sorption affinity of bu4p is much lower than for the common r ph3p see chapter below the actual total annual loads of bu4p at the river elbe could have been even substantially higher finally triphenylphosphine oxide tppo the major side product from the wittig reaction schlüsener et al 2015 trippett 1963 was also monitored in ss samples fig s13 interestingly it could not be detected in blankenese and was only found sporadically above the loq in barby while it was found at almost constant concentrations of approx 20 μg kg in ss from the rhine at koblenz overall the time trends reveal that r ph3p have been primarily used in the rhine catchment area while the occurrence of bu4p was is restricted to the elbe catchment in addition the time trends also indicate that et ph3p has become successively less important in industrial chemical processes while meome ph3p seems to take over as its loads have increased significantly more than 10 fold since 2005 in the rhine catchment upstream of koblenz 3 4 degradation experiment to investigate the behavior of qpcs in the aquatic environment the degradation of me ph3p et ph3p meome ph3p and bu4p was studied a well defined amount of substance was spiked to a vessel with sediment and water and aliquots of both phases were analyzed after workup see also materials and methods the amounts of substance quantified in water and sediment extract were summed up and divided by the amount of substance initially spiked into the experiment vessel to determine the recovery rate which should decrease over the course of the experiment if a degradation of the substance takes place however fig s18 shows that for all four compounds the recovery rates remained constant at about 70 80 which indicates that they were not degraded but were rather persistent under test conditions loss in the mass balance probably due to the formation of non extractable residues additionally concentrations found in the sediment extracts were significantly higher than in the water phase underlining their elevated adsorption affinities fig s19 kd values calculated based on these data average of the last four points of each degradation experiment see table s20 of approximately 1800 l kg for me ph3p 1400 l kg for et ph3p 1900 l kg for meome ph3p and 110 l kg for bu4p reflect this sorption behavior according to appendix xiii of the european regulation concerning the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach european parlament 2006 substances are classified as persistent p if their half life time is i a greater than 120 d in freshwater sediments and as very persistent vp when their half life period in freshwater sediments exceeds 180 d as tested qpc concentrations were constant until the end of the degradation experiments 100 d very likely these compounds have to be considered as persistent persistence of a substance is alarming especially in combination with bioaccumulation potential or toxicity but also for itself should be investigated carefully as persistent substances may potentially disturb ecological equilibriums and an uncontaminated environment may be reachieved only with great efforts considering the fact that qpcs have a single positive charge at the phosphorous atom and soil or sediment compartments are well known for bearing negatively polarized or charged functional groups e g deprotonated carboxyl groups of humic acids or silicate groups of phyllosilicate clay minerals it is not surprising that these compounds can easily sorb onto sediment particles it is striking however that the kd value for bu4p is one magnitude smaller than those of r ph3p compounds unfortunately modelling and predicting sorption behavior of molecules onto soil and sediments is a very complex subject when ionic species are involved while sorption of neutral organic compounds happens primarily to humic substances and is well investigated schwarzenbach et al 2003 sorption of ionic organic species may occur equally at clay mineral surfaces and is determined by a variety of parameters such as ionic strength concentration of competitive ions ph value and steric factors droge and goss 2013a b franco and trapp 2008 since in our case all experimental and sediment parameters were the same across degradation experiments we assume that differences in observed kd values result from different physico chemical properties of the respective compounds all qpcs have a formal charge of 1 at the phosphor and are not even close to be protonated or deprotonated at natural conditions ph values regarding the overall size of the respective molecules bu4p has the highest van der waals volume with four sterically demanding n butyl chains table 2 assuming that adsorption of qpcs onto sediment primarily occurs due to the positive charge at the phosphorous atom coulomb force the latter would be better shielded and harder to access the greater the residual groups are obviously the three phenyl groups are less sterically demanding than the n butyl chains thus shielding the positive charge less well which leads to enhanced sorption affinity of r ph3p compared to bu4p the composition of r seems to have a minor influence onto the sorption behavior at least as far as investigated r ph3p are concerned nevertheless one should keep in mind that various other interactions and parameters have not been considered and that for a profound discussion of physisorption processes further investigations and calculations have to be made 3 5 partition coefficients distribution ratios partition coefficients in octanol water log kow are an indicator for hydrophilicity of a chemical species and give information about the distribution of the latter between two different phases whereas distribution ratios log dow refer to total concentrations of a given chemical distributed between two different phases kow dow when only one species of a chemical is present schwarzenbach et al 2003 log kow dow values are very often used as approximation for the partition coefficient between water and phospholipid membranes log klipw of a substance thus being an important factor in drug design and toxicity considerations endo et al 2011 mouritsen et al 2001 however this approximation is only valid for uncharged compounds although some new approaches have been published trying to include ionic species into prediction models bittermann et al 2014 zhao and abraham 2005 for ionic species in particular partition between two phases is dependent on the concentration and type of counter ions as ion pair formation and distribution must be added to the equilibrium consideration escher and sigg 2004 westall et al 1990 since qpcs bear a single positive charge and very often only calculated log dow values are available we decided to experimentally determine partition coefficients for the compounds used in the degradation experiments as it can be seen in table 3 experimental log dow values differ significantly from calculated values i e by five to six orders of magnitude low dow values might partly be explained by low counter ion concentration since no counter ions other than those from dissociated phosphonium salt molecules were present according to escher and sigg 2004 ion pair partitioning is about 10000 times higher as compared to ion partitioning but even under the assumption that the determined log dow values were solely for the ion partitioning and thus values for the ion pair partitioning about the factor 104 higher there still would be a gap of approx two orders of magnitude or more depending on the calculation method between calculated and experimental values so obviously common calculation methods and prediction models are not able to estimate the dow values of these charged substances properly the type of counter ion however as well as the structure of r side chains did not have a significant impact on the partition since log dow values were comparable for all four investigated substances not showing any prominent difference between r ph3p and bu4p or br and cl interestingly there are several publications using alkyl triphenylphosphonium homologues as probes to estimate the membrane potential of cells vesicles or liposomes and measuring their membrane partition coefficients ono et al 1994 yang et al 1999 2000 yang et al 2000 reported log klipw values between 1 20 and 3 02 for different qpcs increasing with the length of the alkyl chain partition of those compounds in lipid membrane layers is a bit surprising at first sight as one would expect a more hydrophilic behavior of those compounds based on the experimental log dow values we obtained on closer inspection however yang et al also stated that in absence of an external electric field or a so called electrogenic pumps translocation of alkyl triphenylphosphonium compounds through membranes is minimal and that they predominantly interact with the outer leaflet of a bilayer membrane yang et al 2000 this means that under some conditions phosphonium compounds may translocate through bilayer membranes while under other conditions they only bind to or penetrate the outer leaflet of lipid membranes which can be important for assessment of toxicity see also chapter below under the conditions used for the simple distribution experiments no external electric field etc the obtained log dow and log klipw values indicate that qpcs have kind of an amphiphilic character but that hydrophilic properties dominate their behavior especially for the compounds with short alkyl groups 3 6 toxicity 3 6 1 ros and cytotoxicity to detect precursor events which can result in genotoxicity and cytotoxicity intracellular reactive oxygen species ros were measured all tested substances led to an increase in reactive oxygen species the lowest concentration leading to an increase in ros levels lowest observed effect concentration loec is shown in table 4 since reactive oxygen species can lead to endogenous dna damage e g single strand breaks ap sites oxidatively modified dna bases and cytotoxicity the genotoxic and the cytotoxic potential of the phosphonium compounds were also investigated it was found that all tested phosphonium compounds with exception of tetrabutylphosphonium bromide bu4p br induced cytotoxicity in human cells but that for 8 out of 13 compounds loecs for ros appeared to be higher than or equal to cytotoxicity loecs thus for these substances cytotoxicity cannot be a result of ros since cell necrosis occurred at lower concentrations than generation of ros concerning the loecs some kind of grading for cytotoxicity could be observed with the highest effect for the reference substance tributylhexadecylphosphonium bromide c16h33 bu3p br 0 0006 mmol l tetraphenylphosphonium chloride ph4p cl showed second highest cytotoxicity 0 0032 mmol l followed by the n alkyl r me et pro bu and benzyltriphenylphosphonium bn ph3p br compounds which all showed comparable results ca 0 01 0 03 mmol l phosphonium compounds with ether groups r meome meocarbme seem to be less cytotoxic ca 0 1 0 2 mmol l while the phosphine oxides meome ph2po tppo had the highest loecs 0 2 2 mmol l among investigated compounds table 4 the comparison of bu4p br no cytotoxicity up to highest tested concentration with bu4p cl 0 5 mmol l indicated that the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of the investigated compounds was also influenced by the halogen counter ion concerning the specificity of the cytotoxicity comparison of cytotoxicity with baseline toxicity can reveal if cytotoxicity is caused by a specific effect baseline toxicity also referred to as narcosis is defined as a nonspecific reversible disturbance of the functioning of the membrane caused by accumulation of the pollutants in hydrophobic phases within the organism wezel and opperhuizen 1995 although any chemical can potentially elicit narcosis it might be of higher relevance for qpcs in particular since they have the potential to penetrate double layer membranes see section 3 5 so based on the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar published by escher et al 2017 we calculated effect concentrations ec50 for cytotoxicity and toxic ratios tr for qpcs for which experimental klipw values were available yang et al 2000 and plotted the calculated values predicted by the qsar compared to our experimental data see fig 4 and table s21 note that loec equals ec50 since loec was defined as the last data point where the amount of vital cells was still 50 the experimental log 1 ec50 values of all compounds were near to the values predicted by the qsar with solely ph4p lying slightly above the predicted baseline toxicity however escher et al proposed that values lying in the range of 0 1 tr 10 can be considered as baseline toxicants and that only values outside this range indicate further specific or reactive modes of action such as uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation acetylcholine esterase inhibition membrane irritation or seizure of the central nervous system escher et al 2017 hence as shown in fig 4 investigated qpcs can all be considered as baseline toxicants according to the procedure of escher et al 2017 3 6 2 genotoxicity the phosphonium compounds c16h33 bu3p br and meome ph2po showed a mutagenic potential during the initial screen for genotoxic impact of the test substances with the bacterial reverse mutation test ames test with s9 and without metabolic activation s9 the results are presented in table s22 as the lowest concentration with mutagenic effects induction factor 1 2 moreover the diverse phosphonium compounds resulted in different loecs for induction of micronuclei table 4 as overt cytotoxicity could lead to artefactual positive results regarding induction of micronuclei tested concentration values for micronucleus induction must lay outside the cytotoxic range therefore the following compounds were identified as potentially genotoxic in the micronucleus assay meocarbme ph3p br bu4p br meome ph3p cl and tppo the detected induction of micronuclei as measure of genotoxicity of the other tested substances can be considered as secondary effects of cytotoxicity overall considering the detected environmental concentrations of the investigated phosphonium compounds the concentrations leading to toxic effects were significantly higher however it should be kept in mind that a repeated or chronic exposure can occur c16h33 bu3p br and meome ph2po showed a mutagenic potential in the bacterial reverse mutation test and therefore dna reactivity but led to no induction of micronuclei in human cells thus a third genotoxic test is indicated to assess the genotoxic relevance of these compounds in humans meocarbme ph3p br bu4p br meome ph3p cl and tppo for which an induction of micronuclei in human cells was observed can be assessed most likely as genotoxic finally in terms of human toxicology and the associated precautionary reasons the concentration of these compounds with genotoxic potential should not be higher than 100 ng l in drinking water as the health related guide values concept for drinking water suggests for genotoxic substances dieter 2014 4 conclusion qpcs were detected in high concentrations in the german rivers elbe and rhine probably due to point emissions from the chemical industry due to the high consumptions of qpc as intermediate products in the wittig synthesis of olefins e g vitamin a and their use as phase transfer catalysts it can be expected that they are worldwide present in rivers and streams used as receiving water for the effluents of industrial wastewater treatment plants wwtp from chemical industry it has to be noted that intermediate products of chemical synthesis are not covered by reach registration or by any other product regulation as they are not defined as products hence they should not be discharged into in the aquatic environment although the production volumes for individual compounds e g meome ph3p are far higher than 100000 t a only in germany this regulation gap needs to be shortly closed as i qpcs are very likely only one representative of several other intermediate products of chemicals synthesis that are discharged into the aquatic environment ii are shown to be persistent accumulating on ss iii have been discharged for at least one decade with sometimes increasing quantities and iv even cytotoxic and genotoxic effects cannot be ruled out thus qpcs are potential candidates for new pbt compounds the questions arises which other synthesis intermediate chemicals are discharged by the chemical industry and are harmful for the aquatic urban water cycle since they are neither registered nor regulated at all however as industrial wwtps are point sources the emission of those synthesis intermediates can be managed either by technical solutions at the production plants or at the industrial wwtps for qpcs biodegradation and ozonation cannot help to remove these persistent compounds with electron deficits however processes
