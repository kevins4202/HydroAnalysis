12900,the utilisation of effluents as nutrient sources is an interesting alternative for microalgae production as it reduces production costs and prevents environmental contamination this work assesses the potential of producing the microalga nannochloropsis gaditana outdoors using pig slurry as the source of nutrients the experiments were carried out in a thin layer reactor operated in semi continuous mode at dilution rates of 0 30 and 0 40 day 1 during the autumn and summer respectively the biomass productivity ranged from 11 6 to 16 2 g m 2 day 1 in autumn and summer respectively the system was effective at removing n no3 0 1 0 2 g m 2 day 1 n nh4 4 0 5 0 g m 2 day 1 and p po4 3 0 15 0 24 g m 2 day 1 from the pig slurry the process was also able to reduce the content of pathogenic bacteria such as total coliforms sulphite reducing clostridia and salmonella despite being able to grow in pig slurry the use of this nutrient source led to a decrease in biomass productivity when compared to a medium of seawater supplemented with fertilisers the eicosapentaenoic acid 20 5 n3 concentration in the n gaditana biomass was 32 g 100 g 1 of total fatty acids for both autumn and summer when using pig slurry as the nutrient source the results suggest that the production of n gaditana could be coupled with the biological treatment of pig slurry allowing the recovery of nutrients while producing valuable biomass for the aquafeed industry the resulting biomass which has a high market value complied with the requirements of the aquaculture sector graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords waste management circular economy biomass eutrophication photosynthesis sustainability 1 introduction environmental pollution and global warming have prompted scientific and commercial interest in microalgal biotechnology aimed at producing commercially valuable and sustainable products that can be used in aquaculture agriculture food production cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 1 2 however despite a large number of scientific publications evaluating the potential applications of different strains and their optimal growth conditions the number of processes that have achieved commercial success is very limited 3 there is still a lack of research into the capacity of commercial scale photobioreactors used to produce microalgal culture at low cost and over long periods of time 4 5 high production costs are one of the main barriers for microalgae producers to overcome according to norsker et al 6 and stephens et al 7 production costs are directly linked to the photobioreactor used and the biomass productivities achieved although raceway and flat panel photobioreactors are the most widely utilised reactor designs for microalgae production at the pilot scale 8 9 thin layer cascade reactors have emerged as an attractive alternative this type of system offers a substantial increase in biomass productivity 10 being 18 and 45 higher than tubular 11 and raceway bioreactors 12 respectively in addition thin layer reactors have lower operating costs because their power consumption is less than other systems such as closed bioreactors 13 nutrient and water requirements also contribute substantially to the total production costs several reports have highlighted the importance of using cheap and available nutrients in order to ensure commercial success microalgae can grow in different culture environments this is beneficial because it allows us to take advantage of the nutrients present in livestock waste such as those in pig slurry 14 and wastewater from industrial household and agricultural activity 15 16 using the nitrogen and phosphorus that is naturally present in pig slurry as the sole nutrient source to produce microalgae has been previously reported 14 17 this strategy is particularly interesting because pig slurry represents a huge environmental problem so using it for microalgal biomass production would not only reduce its environmental impact but also allow a valuable product to be produced nevertheless producing microalgae using pig slurry as a nutrient substrate involves the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli clostridium salmonella spp listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter which exist in the pig slurry along with the microbial contamination that typically occurs when working in open systems 18 the nutrient content in pig slurry n nh4 and p po4 3 is exceptionally high and therefore it is important to regulate the slurry s nutrient concentration for optimal microalgae production this means that the slurry needs to be diluted with water to allow microalgal growth approximately 1 m3 of process water is required to produce 1 kg of microalgal biomass 19 however there is a group of microalgae that can grow in seawater and therefore do not compete for freshwater resources among the saltwater microalgae those of the nannochloropsis genus are especially interesting given their rapid growth high lipid content and robustness which means they can be produced in open reactors 20 these microalgae can be used in the aquafeed industry as a natural source of polyunsaturated fatty acids 21 nannochloropsis gaditana has been produced outdoors at a pilot scale in raceway and tubular reactors 22 23 however cultivating this microalga using thin layer cascade reactors has not yet been attempted moreover utilising pig slurry as the sole nutrient source to produce n gaditana is a novel strategy that could reduce production costs and therefore facilitate its industrial implementation the hypothesis of the present work is that it is possible to produce the microalga n gaditana using thin layer cascade photobioreactors at a pilot scale and using fresh pig slurry as the sole nutrient source the goal of the process is to transform the nutrients the main goals of this study included the assessment of the nutrient recovery capacity of the system and to identify if the microalga produced and accumulated polyunsaturated fatty acids which are valuable for aquafeed applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 inocula and culture medium the marine strain nannochloropsis gaditana was used the inoculum was maintained at 25 c ph 8 0 and 150 μmol photons m 2 s1 in batch mode until a concentration of 1 2 g l 1 was reached using the standard algal medium for saltwater microalgae strains the composition of the medium was 30 g l 1 nacl artificial seawater supplemented with 0 80 g l 1 ca no3 2 0 35 g l 1 mgso4 0 10 g l 1 kh2po4 and 0 03 g l 1 of karentol kenogard spain the inoculum was scaled up to pilot scale using 80 l bubble column bioreactors placed inside a greenhouse with constant aeration and ph control 8 0 0 1 the ph was controlled by the on demand injection of co2 in this case the culture medium was prepared using natural seawater supplemented with nutrients as described above followed by sterilization with ozone 2 2 biomass production pilot scale nannochloropsis gaditana production was conducted at the sabana demonstration facilities located at ifapa 36 48 n 2 43 w almería spain the biomass production was carried out using both seawater supplemented with fertilisers and pig slurry diluted with seawater nitrogen is present in pig slurry mainly as n nh4 at concentrations above 150 g l 1 the slurry used in this work was diluted down to 10 because n nh4 is toxic for microalgae at concentrations higher than 200 mg l 1 24 the n no3 concentration in the fertiliser based medium was calculated using the n nh4 content of the slurry based medium biomass production was carried out inside a greenhouse during the autumn and summer using a thin layer bioreactor with a total volume of 2400 l and an illuminated surface of 63 m2 in addition the thin layer bioreactor was provided with a 250 l bubble column with continuous air injection at a rate of 75 l min 1 to improve mass transfer and to desorb the gases fig 1 the ph temperature and dissolved oxygen were monitored online using probes installed at the end of the channel the environmental parameters solar radiation and temperature were likewise measured online a scada system was used to actuate the pumps and valves inside the system before starting the semi continuous experiments the thin layer bioreactor was operated in batch mode for one week to allow the microalgae to stabilize under the new conditions the biomass production was conducted operating in semi continuous mode at 0 30 day 1 and 0 40 day 1 in autumn and summer respectively the ph was kept at 8 0 by the on demand injection of co2 into the bubble column at 10 l min 1 the bioreactor was operated 24 h a day and semi continuous operation was maintained until a stable steady state was achieved meaning that the biomass concentration did not alter for a minimum of three days and the total volume of the reactor was replaced at least twice the daily evaporation inside the bioreactor was compensated for by adding freshwater 2 3 analytical determinations culture monitoring biomass concentration and photosynthetic activity was performed daily the biomass fatty acid profile as well as the microbial count and supernatant determinations were conducted in triplicate during the last three days of the steady state briefly the biomass concentration cb was measured daily by filtering 50 ml of culture using 1 μm pore diameter filters and drying the filtered biomass in an oven the oven temperature was kept at 80 c 1 c and the biomass was dried for at least 24 h the biomass productivity pb was calculated as the product of the biomass concentration and the dilution rate 0 30 or 0 40 day 1 depending on the season the status of the culture was measured by means of the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio fv fm using an aquapen ap 100 fluorometer photon system instruments the czech republic the optical density of the culture in the visible light range 400 700 nm was determined daily using a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s thermo fisher scientific spain the biomass extinction coefficient ka was calculated by dividing the average optical density abs by the product of the cb and the cuvettes light path p 0 01 m k a abs c b p the average irradiance in the photosynthetically active radiation range to which the cells were exposed in the culture iav was calculated as a function of the irradiance on the surface of the culture i 0 ka cb and the light path inside the bioreactor p i a v i 0 k a c b p 1 e k a c b p moreover the nutrient uptake was determined from the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus at the inlet and outlet of the bioreactor the removal efficiency re was calculated as the ratio between the nutrients at the outlet and the inlet effluents using the following equation re c i n c o u t c i n 100 the removal capacity rc was calculated as the total amount of nutrients removed per time and culture volume unit as shown below rc cin cout d the nutrient content was determined using methods described elsewhere 25 briefly phosphorus was measured by visible spectrophotometry through the phospho vanado molybdate complex ammonium was measured using the nessler reactive method while the nitrates were quantified calorimetrically between 220 and 275 nm according to the standard method 4500 no3 b using a spectrophotometer 2 4 microbial count once steady state was achieved at the different dilution rates 0 30 or 0 40 day 1 depending on the season a microbiological analysis was performed to detect the microbial load and the potential presence of pathogenic bacteria mesophilic aerobic microbiota were determined by plate count using nutritive agar panreac applichem barcelona spain incubation was carried out over 48 h at 30 c 26 the samples were diluted to the 10 5 decimal scale using pbs each dilution was inoculated in triplicate into sterile and disposable petri dishes total coliforms and e coli were determined using endo agar merck madrid spain as a differential culture media the petri dishes were incubated under controlled conditions at 36 c for 24 h sulfite polymyxin sulfadizine sps agar panreac applichem barcelona spain was used as a solid medium for detecting and enumerating sulphite reducing clostridia for this purpose once the samples were inoculated on the plates a layer of sps agar was added to create anaerobiosis in addition the plates were incubated in an anaerobic jar with anaerocult a merck madrid spain at 44 c for 48 h apart from plating filtrations were performed to determine the presence of e coli and sulphite reducing clostridia 1 ml 100 ml in the inlet and outlet waters of the reactors the results were expressed as log cfu ml the presence of salmonella was evaluated by inoculating 10 ml of each sample in a flask with 50 ml buffered peptone water bpw for pre enrichment at 37 c over 24 h a 0 1 ml aliquot was subsequently enriched in 10 ml of rappaport vassiliadis rv broth condalab madrid spain at 42 c for 48 h finally each rv broth culture was plated onto xylose lysine deoxycholate agar panreac applichem barcelona spain to check for the presence of salmonella the samples were then incubated at 37 c for 24 h kligler s medium condalab madrid spain was used to confirm the presence of salmonella suspected colonies 2 5 fatty acid profile of the biomass the saponifiable lipid content of the produced biomass was quantified by direct transesterification of the sls to fatty acid methyl esters fames the content of saponifiable lipids as well as the fatty acid profile of the biomass were determined following a methodology describes elsewhere 27 2 6 statistical analysis the results reported here are mean values of three independent experiments the standard deviation differences between seasons and culture conditions were analysed using analysis of variance anova with centurion xvi statistical software the criterion for least significant difference lsd was in all cases p 0 05 the relationships between the different variables were analysed using the bivariate pearson correlation p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass production several aspects need to be considered when producing microalgae using large reactors and pig slurry as the nutrient source among them the selection of 1 a robust and productive strain with tolerance to variable nutrient concentrations and external environmental conditions 2 a suitable photobioreactor design to provide the microalgae with their optimum growth conditions and 3 an optimal dilution rate to maximize productivity 28 in the present study biomass production was carried out in the autumn and summer operating the reactor at dilution rates of 0 30 or 0 40 day 1 respectively these rates were selected because previous studies had demonstrated that these values were optimal for these seasons 29 30 the biomass productivity values are shown in fig 2 overall biomass productivity was significantly affected by season dilution rate and nutrient source p 0 05 higher biomass productivities were observed when producing the biomass in seawater supplemented with commercial fertilisers where the areal productivity ranged from 24 1 to 28 1 g m 2 day 1 for autumn and summer respectively however when pig slurry was used as the nutrient source the productivity was lower ranging from 11 6 g m 2 day 1 autumn to 16 2 g m 2 day 1 summer the turbidity of the pig slurry and the presence of microorganisms and compounds could have limited microalgal growth indeed a recent study by ciardi et al 14 noted that pig slurry turbidity could represent a problem in outdoor production systems the productivities described were greater than those published by grivalský et al 31 who used 660 m2 thin layer cascades for chlorella production carried out at a site located in třeboň the czech republic they achieved average biomass productivity ranging from 14 g m 2 day 1 to about 17 18 g m 2 day 1 during the spring summer period these data demonstrate the influence of environmental conditions on microalgae productivity in almería the environmental conditions are favourable for achieving high biomass productivities in the present study higher productivities were observed in the summer than in the autumn this could be attributed not only to the higher light availability in summer than in autumn but also to the dilution rate of 0 4 day 1 as a larger percentage of culture was replaced daily with fresh media nutrient and light availability were higher san pedro et al 23 reported a lower maximum biomass yield 13 19 g m 2 day 1 at a dilution rate of 0 36 day 1 using the same strain in outdoor raceway ponds under continuous culture conditions terigar and theegala 32 found the highest biomass yield for nannochloropsis sp to be 43 4 g m 2 day 1 at a dilution rate of 0 16 day 1 in an outdoor continuous flow system these studies were carried out using raceway reactors the use of thin layer cascade reactors to produce n gaditana has not been attempted before although this photobioreactor design has been used to produce other microalgal strains in a recent study 30 found that s almeriensis productivity in a single channel thin layer reactor with a culture depth of 0 02 m was higher than that in raceway reactors where the culture depth was 0 14 m these results were similar to those of previous studies reported by morales amaral et al 33 in which they demonstrated the higher productivity of thin layer reactors compared to traditional raceways in the present study the fv fm values ranged from 0 55 to 0 65 depending on the season the dilution rate and the nutrient source used fig 2b no significant differences were observed in the fv fm values except for those obtained in the autumn when operating the reactor using seawater supplemented with fertilisers the slightly lower values observed in the summer could be attributed to photo inhibition caused by reversible damage to microalgae photosystem ii 34 the values reported here were within the optimal range for this strain demonstrating that the culture was not subjected to any stress conditions and that the selected strain could grow under the operational and environmental conditions imposed 3 2 nutrient recovery nitrogen and phosphorus uptake is directly linked to biomass productivity the lower the culture depth the higher the radiation inside the culture and thus the higher the nitrogen and phosphorus removal 35 36 fig 3a shows that nitrogen removal from the pig slurry was complete when the n no3 and n nh4 concentrations at the inflow were 0 1 0 2 g m 2 day 1 and 4 5 g m 2 day 1 respectively in contrast when using fertiliser as the nutrient source all the nitrogen was in the form of n no3 rather than ammonium and it was not completely removed the removal capacity was 2 9 g m 2 day 1 63 for summer and 2 5 g m 2 day 1 73 for autumn this does not mean that nitrogen consumption was higher when the media contained pig slurry indeed since most of the nitrogen present in the media was found as ammonia it is likely that the high recoveries observed were due to stripping nevertheless when the n no3 and n nh4 at the inlet increased the consumption increased as well this behaviour was observed in both media fig 3a a similar trend for ammonium removal was published by sánchez zurano et al 37 the authors found that using a thin layer cascade reactor scenedesmus sp can uptake n nh 4 entirely from wastewater the n nh 4 consumption ranged from 0 75 to 1 53 g m 2 day 1 a depuration efficiency greater than 90 whereas the nitrate consumption was lower than the ammonium consumption ranging from 0 to 0 11 g m 2 day 1 in a study by şirin and sillanpää 38 n oculata achieved 74 of total nitrogen removal when grown in municipal wastewater in a similar study carried out by sirakov and velichkova 39 n oculata grown in aquaculture wastewater were able to remove 78 4 of the total nitrogen and 92 of the nitrate from the wastewater stream phosphorus is an important macronutrient for the metabolism of microalgae because it can be incorporated into the biosynthesis of dna rna or lipids through phosphorylation 40 phosphorus removal presented an opposite pattern to that observed for nitrogen fig 3b when produced using seawater supplemented with fertilisers phosphorus removal was complete this took place as a result of cell uptake hence the high phosphorus removal rate could be explained by higher biomass productivity şirin and sillanpää 38 reported a similar trend for n oculata grown in municipal wastewater where the total phosphorus removal rate was higher than 90 however when pig slurry was used as the nutrient source not all the phosphorus in the media was consumed thus by applying a biomass balance the phosphorus uptake varied from 0 15 to 0 24 g m 2 day 1 for autumn and summer respectively it is likely that the culture was nitrogen limited and this led to the lower productivities observed moreover the pig slurry might have contained heavy metals or other compounds that limited microalgal growth but these were not determined in the present study the results agree with those reported by sánchez zurano et al 37 for scenedesmus sp grown in wastewater using a 32 m2 thin layer reactor in which the phosphorus uptake varied from 0 10 to 0 29 g m 2 day 1 for autumn and spring respectively in addition fig 3b shows that phosphorus removal was higher in summer because of the above mentioned higher biomass productivity in addition phosphorus removal presented a similar pattern to that observed for nitrogen removal that is to say when the p po4 3 in the inlet increased the uptake increased as well consequently looking at the productivity and nutrient removal results from the thin layer reactor it is evident that nannochloropsis gaditana demonstrated robust stability over the seasons evaluated with the removal capacity and productivities being especially influenced by the nutrient source and the environmental conditions 3 3 microbiological analysis as mentioned above the production of microalgae using pig slurry as the nutrient substrate entails the presence of pathogenic bacteria therefore it is important to assess the main bacterial groups present when producing n gaditana using pig slurry in order to evaluate the feasibility of the developed process in the present study we evaluated the aerobic mesophilic and heterotrophic bacteria count this group of bacteria are widely distributed and are present in for example soil air animal human bodies and all types of water 41 along with coliform bacteria even though these bacterial groups cannot be used as indicators of pathogenic conditions they do provide information about the microbial load present in the samples the specific pathogenic bacteria that usually appear in pig slurry treatment include e coli sulphite reducing clostridia and salmonella sp microbial analyses were carried out at the wastewater inlets and the water outlets after removing the microalgae bacteria biomass according to the mesophilic aerobic microbiota the microbial loads in the inlet wastewater 10 pig slurry were similar in summer and autumn log cfu ml 1 4 3 4 5 the same occurred in the inlet seawater supplemented media having a constant value over the summer and autumn log cfu ml 1 2 3 2 4 with regard to the outlet effluents a reduction was observed with respect to the microbiota detected in the inlets according to the total coliforms the values determined at both the slurry and fertiliser inlets were similar in summer and autumn log cfu ml 1 2 4 2 5 in the outlet waters a significant reduction in total coliforms was observed except when pig slurry was used as the nutrient source in summer in terms of pathogenic bacteria e coli sulphite reducing clostridia and salmonella sp were determined e coli was not detected in any sample neither at the wastewater inlet nor at the water outlet similarly salmonella sp was not detected in the inflow or outflow nonetheless it was detected in the raw pig manure before being diluted with seawater the seawater used during the trials had a concentration of 30 g l 1 of nacl previous studies have indicated that enteric bacteria such as e coli and salmonella sp are subjected to immediate osmotic shock under saline conditions their capacity to overcome these conditions could greatly influence their subsequent survival in the seawater 42 sulphite reducing clostridia was not detected in the samples produced using seawater supplemented with fertilisers whereas it did appear in the inflow and outflow from the reactor when using the pig slurry treatment during the summer the presence of sulphite reducing clostridia was measured in the inlet log cfu ml 1 1 4 and outlet of the microalgal culture log cfu ml 1 0 3 moreover these pathogenic bacteria appeared in the inflow log cfu ml 1 1 8 and outflow log cfu ml 1 0 5 of the trial carried out in the autumn a significant reduction p 0 01 was observed in the quantification of sulphite reducing clostridia before and after the microalgae based treatment this reduction might be explained by various mechanisms such as the competition for nutrients elevated ph and dissolved oxygen the presence of algal toxins or the adhesion and sedimentation of pathogens 43 specifically the removal of sulphite reducing clostridia widely described as obligate anaerobic bacteria is largely influenced by the high dissolved oxygen concentration reached during the daylight hours caused by photosynthetic activity which implies that they cannot survive in microalgal cultures 18 the absence of e coli in the outflow samples means that the water resulting from microalgae production complies with spanish regulations real decreto 1620 2007 3 4 fatty acid content one of the most important and interesting attributes of n gaditana is its fatty acid content and composition special attention must be paid to the eicosapentaenoic acid epa 20 5n3 content since microalgae from the nannochloropsis genus are considered an important source of this valuable fatty acid 44 epa is particularly interesting because of its health benefits 45 46 moreover n gaditana is one of the most extended microalgae strains used in aquaculture because of its fatty acid content and profile 47 to compare the fatty acid production of this microalga when using different nutrient sources it is important not only to obtain the highest fatty acid content but also the highest epa concentration possible fig 4a shows the fatty acid content wt of dry biomass of the samples obtained using the two culture media studied fig 4b shows the epa purity obtained in each case that is the percentage of epa with respect to the percentage of total fatty acids as shown in fig 4a the total fatty acid content of the dry microalgae biomass decreased as the dilution rate increased so for the two different nutrient sources studied in this work the percentage of fatty acids measured in the samples taken in autumn with a dilution rate of 0 3 day 1 were higher than those obtained in summer with a dilution rate of 0 4 day 1 the pig slurry based medium 4 45 and 4 01 for autumn and summer respectively and the fertiliser based medium 7 94 and 4 66 wt respectively other authors such as terigar and theegala 32 described similar behaviour and observed a decrease in the lipid content with increasing dilution rates in the nannochloropsis sp culture there were no significant differences in the saponifiable lipid content based on the nutrient source used or the season of the year and therefore to the dilution rates the saponifiable lipid content was lower than expected when compared to those reported by various authors for microalgae of the genus nannochloropsis who recorded a fatty acid content of 12 with respect to the dry biomass 48 49 in these studies the cells were grown in outdoor tubular photobioreactors using fertilisers as the nutrient source in any case it is well reported that to increase lipid accumulation it is necessary to grow the microalgae strains under stressful conditions such as in a nitrogen depleted environment although under these conditions the biomass productivity will decrease 21 table 1 shows the fatty acid composition of the n gaditana microalgal biomass under the different conditions studied in this work as one can observe in this table epa represented 32 1 of the total fatty acids in the mixture containing sea water 10 pig slurry confirming that it is possible to use this microalga under these culture conditions as the raw material for producing this valuable fatty acid authors such as kowthaman et al 50 have compared several microalgal species in terms of their lipid content highlighting species like phaeodactylum tricornutum nannochloropsis sp and dunaliella sp among others in any case microalgae from the genus nannochloropsis are often used as the raw material to produce lipids especially epa due to their high biomass accumulation rate successful large scale cultivation and high lipid content 20 51 many studies have shown that this microalga adapts to changes in the culture conditions by modifying its molecular composition therefore the lipid composition strongly depends on factors such as irradiance salinity nutrient limitation or temperature 22 concerning the fatty acid content species from the genus nannochloropsis can accumulate 10 25 wt in dry biomass 52 although this percentage depends on the culture conditions as mentioned above 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated the technical viability of producing the high value microalgae n gaditana outdoors using pilot scale thin layer cascade photobioreactors and pig slurry diluted with seawater as the sole nutrient source the studied strain showed itself to be robust and a promising candidate for large scale commercial production including in open systems despite being able to grow in a pig slurry medium the use of this nutrient source led to a decrease in biomass productivity when compared to seawater supplemented with fertilisers higher biomass productivities were achieved in summer than in autumn the treatment of the pig slurry using microalgae led to a decrease in the contents of mesophilic aerobic microbiota total coliforms and pathogenic bacteria including sulphite reducing clostridia and salmonella sp the produced biomass was rich in epa and other polyunsaturated fatty acids demonstrating the potential of the produced biomass for use

12900,the utilisation of effluents as nutrient sources is an interesting alternative for microalgae production as it reduces production costs and prevents environmental contamination this work assesses the potential of producing the microalga nannochloropsis gaditana outdoors using pig slurry as the source of nutrients the experiments were carried out in a thin layer reactor operated in semi continuous mode at dilution rates of 0 30 and 0 40 day 1 during the autumn and summer respectively the biomass productivity ranged from 11 6 to 16 2 g m 2 day 1 in autumn and summer respectively the system was effective at removing n no3 0 1 0 2 g m 2 day 1 n nh4 4 0 5 0 g m 2 day 1 and p po4 3 0 15 0 24 g m 2 day 1 from the pig slurry the process was also able to reduce the content of pathogenic bacteria such as total coliforms sulphite reducing clostridia and salmonella despite being able to grow in pig slurry the use of this nutrient source led to a decrease in biomass productivity when compared to a medium of seawater supplemented with fertilisers the eicosapentaenoic acid 20 5 n3 concentration in the n gaditana biomass was 32 g 100 g 1 of total fatty acids for both autumn and summer when using pig slurry as the nutrient source the results suggest that the production of n gaditana could be coupled with the biological treatment of pig slurry allowing the recovery of nutrients while producing valuable biomass for the aquafeed industry the resulting biomass which has a high market value complied with the requirements of the aquaculture sector graphical

that have achieved commercial success is very limited 3 there is still a lack of research into the capacity of commercial scale photobioreactors used to produce microalgal culture at low cost and over

bacteria such as escherichia coli clostridium salmonella spp listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter which exist in the pig slurry along with the microbial contamination that typically occurs when working in open systems 18 the nutrient content in pig slurry n nh4 and p po4 3 is exceptionally high and therefore it is important to regulate the slurry s nutrient concentration for optimal microalgae production this means that the slurry needs to be diluted with water to allow microalgal growth approximately 1 m3 of process water is required to produce 1 kg of microalgal biomass 19 however there is a group of microalgae that can grow in seawater and therefore do not compete for freshwater resources among the saltwater microalgae those of the nannochloropsis genus are especially

for saltwater microalgae strains the composition of the medium was 30 g l 1 nacl artificial seawater supplemented with 0 80 g l 1 ca no3 2 0 35 g l 1 mgso4 0 10 g l 1 kh2po4 and 0 03 g l 1 of karentol

down to 10 because n nh4 is toxic for microalgae at concentrations higher than 200 mg l 1 24 the n no3 concentration in the fertiliser based medium was calculated using the n nh4 content of the slurry based medium biomass production was carried out inside a greenhouse during the autumn and summer using a thin layer bioreactor with a total volume of 2400 l and an illuminated surface of 63 m2 in addition the thin layer bioreactor was provided with a 250 l bubble column with continuous air injection at a rate of 75 l min 1 to improve mass transfer and to desorb the gases fig 1 the ph temperature and dissolved oxygen were monitored online using probes installed at the end of the channel the environmental parameters solar radiation and temperature were likewise measured online a scada system was used to actuate the pumps and valves inside the system before starting the semi continuous experiments the thin layer bioreactor was operated in batch mode for one week to allow the microalgae to stabilize under the new conditions the biomass production was conducted operating in semi continuous mode at 0 30 day 1 and 0 40 day 1 in autumn and summer respectively the ph was kept at 8 0 by the on demand injection of co2 into the bubble column at 10 l min 1 the bioreactor was operated 24 h a day and semi continuous operation was maintained until a stable steady state was achieved meaning that the biomass concentration did not alter for a minimum of three days and the total volume of the reactor was replaced at least twice the daily evaporation inside the bioreactor was compensated for by adding freshwater 2 3 analytical determinations culture monitoring biomass concentration and photosynthetic activity was performed daily the biomass fatty acid profile as well as the microbial count and supernatant determinations were conducted in triplicate during the last three days of the steady state briefly the biomass concentration cb was measured daily by filtering 50 ml of culture using 1 μm pore diameter filters and drying the filtered biomass in an oven the oven temperature was kept at 80 c 1 c and the biomass was dried for at least 24 h the biomass productivity pb was calculated as the product of the biomass concentration and the dilution rate 0 30 or 0 40 day 1 depending on the season the status of the culture was measured by means of the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio fv fm using an aquapen ap 100 fluorometer photon system instruments the czech republic the optical density of the culture in the visible light range 400 700 nm was

calculated as a function of the irradiance on the surface of the culture i 0 ka cb and the light path inside the bioreactor p i a v i 0 k a c b p 1 e k a c b p moreover the nutrient uptake was determined from the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus at the inlet and outlet of the bioreactor the removal efficiency re was calculated as the ratio between the nutrients at the outlet and the inlet effluents using the following equation re c i n c o u t c i n 100 the removal capacity rc was calculated as the total amount of nutrients removed per time and culture volume unit as shown

2 4 microbial count once steady state was achieved at the different dilution rates 0 30 or 0 40 day 1 depending on the season a microbiological analysis was performed to detect the microbial load and the potential presence of pathogenic bacteria mesophilic aerobic microbiota were determined by plate count using nutritive agar panreac applichem barcelona spain incubation was carried out over 48 h at 30 c 26 the samples were diluted to the 10 5 decimal scale using pbs each dilution was inoculated in triplicate into sterile and disposable petri dishes total coliforms and e coli were determined using endo agar merck madrid spain as a differential culture media the petri dishes were incubated under controlled conditions at 36 c for 24 h sulfite polymyxin sulfadizine sps agar panreac applichem barcelona spain was used as a solid medium for detecting and enumerating sulphite reducing clostridia for this purpose once the samples were inoculated on the plates a layer of sps agar was added to create anaerobiosis in addition the plates were incubated in an anaerobic jar with anaerocult a merck madrid spain at 44 c for 48 h apart from plating filtrations were performed to determine the presence of e coli and sulphite reducing clostridia 1 ml 100 ml in the inlet and outlet waters of the reactors the results were expressed as log cfu ml the presence of salmonella was evaluated by inoculating 10 ml of each sample in a flask with 50 ml buffered peptone water bpw for pre enrichment at 37 c over 24 h a 0 1 ml aliquot was subsequently enriched in 10 ml of rappaport vassiliadis rv broth condalab madrid spain at 42 c for 48 h finally each rv broth culture was plated onto xylose lysine deoxycholate agar panreac applichem barcelona spain to check for the presence of salmonella the samples were then incubated at 37 c for 24 h kligler s medium condalab madrid spain was used to confirm the presence of salmonella suspected colonies 2 5 fatty acid profile of the biomass the saponifiable lipid content of the produced biomass was quantified by direct transesterification of the sls to fatty acid methyl esters fames the content of saponifiable lipids as well as the fatty acid profile of the biomass were determined following a methodology describes elsewhere 27 2 6 statistical analysis the results reported here are mean values of three independent experiments the standard deviation differences between seasons and culture conditions were analysed using analysis of variance anova with centurion xvi statistical software the criterion for least significant difference lsd was in all cases p 0 05 the relationships between the different variables were analysed using the bivariate pearson correlation p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass production several aspects need to be considered when producing microalgae using large reactors and pig slurry as the nutrient source among them the selection of 1 a robust and productive strain with tolerance to variable nutrient concentrations and external environmental conditions 2 a suitable photobioreactor design to provide the microalgae with their optimum growth conditions and 3 an optimal dilution rate to maximize productivity 28 in the present study biomass production was carried out in the autumn and summer operating the reactor at dilution rates of 0 30 or 0 40 day 1 respectively these rates were selected because previous studies had demonstrated that these values were optimal for these seasons 29 30 the biomass productivity values are shown in fig 2 overall biomass productivity was significantly affected by season dilution rate and nutrient source p 0 05 higher biomass productivities were observed when producing the biomass in seawater supplemented with commercial fertilisers where the areal productivity ranged from 24 1 to 28 1 g m 2 day 1 for autumn and summer respectively however when pig slurry was used as the nutrient source the productivity was lower ranging from 11 6 g m 2 day 1 autumn to 16 2 g m 2 day 1 summer the turbidity of the pig slurry and the presence of microorganisms and compounds could have limited microalgal growth indeed a recent study by ciardi et al 14 noted that pig slurry turbidity could represent a problem in outdoor production systems the productivities described were greater than those published by grivalský et al 31 who used 660 m2 thin layer cascades for chlorella production carried out at a site located in třeboň the czech republic they achieved average biomass productivity ranging from 14 g m 2 day 1 to about 17 18 g m 2 day 1 during the spring summer period these data demonstrate the influence of environmental conditions on microalgae productivity in almería the environmental conditions are favourable for achieving high biomass productivities in the present study higher productivities were observed in the summer than in the autumn this could be attributed not only to the higher light availability in summer than in autumn but also to the dilution rate of 0 4 day 1 as a larger percentage of culture was replaced daily with fresh media nutrient and light availability were higher san pedro et al 23 reported a lower maximum biomass yield 13 19 g m 2 day 1 at a dilution rate of 0 36 day 1 using the same strain in outdoor raceway ponds under continuous culture conditions terigar and theegala 32 found the highest biomass yield for nannochloropsis sp to be 43 4 g m 2 day 1 at a dilution rate of 0 16 day 1 in an outdoor continuous flow system these studies were carried out using raceway reactors the use of thin layer cascade reactors to produce n gaditana has not been attempted before although this photobioreactor design has been used to produce other microalgal strains in a recent study 30 found that s almeriensis productivity in a single channel thin layer reactor with a culture depth of 0 02 m was higher than that in raceway reactors where the culture depth was 0 14 m these results were similar to those of previous studies reported by morales amaral et al 33 in which they demonstrated the higher productivity of thin layer reactors compared to traditional raceways in the present study the fv fm values ranged from 0 55 to 0 65 depending on the season the dilution rate and the nutrient source used fig 2b no significant differences were observed in the fv fm values except for those obtained in the autumn when operating the reactor using seawater supplemented with fertilisers the slightly lower values observed in the summer could be attributed to photo inhibition caused by reversible damage to microalgae photosystem ii 34 the values reported here were within the optimal range for this strain demonstrating that the culture was not subjected to any stress conditions and that the selected strain could grow under the operational and environmental conditions imposed 3 2 nutrient recovery nitrogen and phosphorus uptake is directly linked to biomass productivity the lower the culture depth the higher the radiation inside the culture and thus the higher the nitrogen and phosphorus removal 35 36 fig 3a shows that nitrogen removal from the pig slurry was complete when the n no3 and n nh4 concentrations at the inflow were 0 1 0 2 g m 2 day 1 and 4 5 g m 2 day 1 respectively in contrast when using fertiliser as the nutrient source all the nitrogen was in the form of n no3 rather than ammonium and it was not completely removed the removal capacity was 2 9 g m 2 day 1 63 for summer and 2 5 g m 2 day 1 73 for autumn this does not mean that nitrogen consumption was higher when the media contained pig slurry indeed since most of the nitrogen present in the media was found as ammonia it is likely that the high recoveries observed were due to stripping nevertheless when the n no3 and n nh4 at the inlet increased the consumption increased as well this behaviour was observed in both media fig 3a a similar trend for ammonium removal was published by sánchez zurano et al 37 the authors found that using a thin layer cascade reactor scenedesmus sp can uptake n nh 4 entirely from wastewater the n nh 4 consumption ranged from 0 75 to 1 53 g m 2 day 1 a depuration efficiency greater than 90 whereas the nitrate consumption was lower than the ammonium consumption ranging from 0 to 0 11 g m 2 day 1 in a study by şirin and sillanpää 38 n oculata achieved 74 of total nitrogen removal when grown in municipal wastewater in a similar study carried out by sirakov and velichkova 39 n oculata grown in aquaculture wastewater were able to remove 78 4 of the total nitrogen and 92 of the nitrate from the wastewater stream phosphorus is an important macronutrient for the metabolism of microalgae because it can be incorporated into the biosynthesis of dna rna or lipids through phosphorylation 40 phosphorus removal presented an opposite pattern to that observed for nitrogen fig 3b when produced using seawater supplemented with fertilisers phosphorus removal was complete this took place as a result of cell uptake hence the high phosphorus removal rate could be explained by higher biomass productivity şirin and sillanpää 38 reported a similar trend for n oculata grown in municipal wastewater where the total phosphorus removal rate was higher than 90 however when pig slurry was used as the nutrient source not all the phosphorus in the media was consumed thus by applying a biomass balance the phosphorus uptake varied from 0 15 to 0 24 g m 2 day 1 for autumn and summer respectively it is likely that the culture was nitrogen limited and this led to the lower productivities observed moreover the pig slurry might have contained heavy metals or other compounds that limited microalgal growth but these were not determined in the present study the results agree with those reported by sánchez zurano et al 37 for scenedesmus sp grown in wastewater using a 32 m2 thin layer reactor in which the phosphorus uptake varied from 0 10 to 0 29 g m 2 day 1 for autumn and spring respectively in addition fig 3b shows that phosphorus removal was higher in summer because of the above mentioned higher biomass productivity in addition phosphorus removal presented a similar pattern to that observed for nitrogen removal that is to say when the p po4 3 in the inlet increased the uptake increased as well consequently looking at the productivity and nutrient removal results from the thin layer reactor it is evident that nannochloropsis gaditana demonstrated robust stability over the seasons evaluated with the removal capacity and productivities being especially influenced by the nutrient source and the environmental conditions 3 3 microbiological analysis as mentioned above the production of microalgae using pig slurry as the nutrient substrate entails the presence of pathogenic bacteria therefore it is important to assess the main bacterial groups present when producing n gaditana using pig slurry in order to evaluate the feasibility of the developed process in the present study we evaluated the aerobic mesophilic and heterotrophic bacteria count this group of bacteria are widely distributed and are present in for example soil air animal human bodies and all types of water 41 along with coliform bacteria even though these bacterial groups cannot be used as indicators of pathogenic conditions they do provide information about the microbial load present in the samples the specific pathogenic bacteria that usually appear in pig slurry treatment include e coli sulphite reducing clostridia and salmonella sp microbial analyses were carried out at the wastewater inlets and the water outlets after removing the microalgae bacteria biomass according to the mesophilic aerobic microbiota the microbial loads in the inlet wastewater 10 pig slurry were similar in summer and autumn log cfu ml 1 4 3 4 5 the same occurred in the inlet seawater supplemented media having a constant value over the summer and autumn log cfu ml 1 2 3 2 4 with regard to the outlet effluents a reduction was observed with respect to the microbiota detected in the inlets according to the total coliforms the values determined at both the slurry and fertiliser inlets were similar in summer and autumn log cfu ml 1 2 4 2 5 in the outlet waters a significant reduction in total coliforms was observed except when pig slurry was used as the nutrient source in summer in terms of pathogenic bacteria e coli sulphite reducing clostridia and salmonella sp were determined e coli was not detected in any sample neither at the wastewater inlet nor at the water outlet similarly salmonella sp was not detected in the inflow or outflow nonetheless it was detected in the raw pig manure before being diluted with seawater the seawater used during the trials had a concentration of 30 g l 1 of nacl previous studies have indicated that enteric bacteria such as e coli and salmonella sp are subjected to immediate osmotic shock under saline conditions their capacity to overcome these conditions could greatly influence their subsequent survival in the seawater 42 sulphite reducing clostridia was not detected in the samples produced using seawater supplemented with fertilisers whereas it did appear in the inflow and outflow from the reactor when using the pig slurry treatment during the summer the presence of sulphite reducing clostridia was measured in the inlet log cfu ml 1 1 4 and outlet of the microalgal culture log cfu ml 1 0 3 moreover these pathogenic bacteria appeared in the inflow log cfu ml 1 1 8 and outflow log cfu ml 1 0 5 of the trial carried out in the autumn a significant reduction p 0 01 was observed in the quantification of sulphite reducing clostridia before and after the microalgae based treatment this reduction might be explained by various mechanisms such as the competition for nutrients elevated ph and dissolved oxygen the presence of algal toxins or the adhesion and sedimentation of pathogens 43 specifically the removal of sulphite reducing clostridia widely described as obligate anaerobic bacteria is largely influenced by the high dissolved oxygen concentration reached during the daylight hours caused by photosynthetic activity which implies that they cannot survive in microalgal cultures 18 the absence of e coli in the outflow samples means that the water resulting from microalgae production complies with spanish regulations real decreto 1620 2007 3 4 fatty acid content one of the most important and interesting attributes of n gaditana is its fatty acid content and composition special attention must be paid to the eicosapentaenoic acid epa 20 5n3 content since microalgae from the nannochloropsis genus are considered an important source of this valuable fatty acid 44 epa is particularly interesting because of its health benefits 45 46 moreover n gaditana is one of the most extended microalgae strains used in aquaculture because of its fatty acid content and profile 47 to compare the fatty acid production of this microalga when using different nutrient sources it is important not only to obtain the highest fatty acid content but also the highest epa concentration possible fig 4a shows the fatty acid content wt of dry biomass of the samples obtained using the two culture media studied fig 4b shows the epa purity obtained in each case that is the percentage of epa with respect to the percentage of total fatty acids as shown in fig 4a the total fatty acid content of the dry microalgae biomass decreased as the dilution rate increased so for the two different nutrient sources studied in this work the percentage of fatty acids measured in the samples taken in autumn with a dilution rate of 0 3 day 1 were higher than those obtained in summer with a dilution rate of 0 4 day 1 the pig slurry based medium 4 45 and 4 01 for autumn and summer respectively and the fertiliser based medium 7 94 and 4 66 wt respectively other authors such as terigar and theegala 32 described similar behaviour and observed a decrease in the lipid content with increasing dilution rates in the nannochloropsis sp culture there were no significant differences in the saponifiable lipid content based on the nutrient source used or the season of the year and therefore to the dilution rates the saponifiable lipid content was lower than expected when compared to those reported by various authors for microalgae of the genus nannochloropsis who recorded a fatty acid content of 12 with respect to the dry biomass 48 49 in these studies the cells were grown in outdoor tubular photobioreactors using fertilisers as the nutrient source in any case it is well reported that to increase lipid accumulation it is necessary to grow the microalgae strains under stressful conditions such as in a nitrogen depleted environment although under these conditions the biomass productivity will decrease 21 table 1 shows the fatty acid composition of the n gaditana microalgal biomass under the different conditions studied in this work as one can observe in this table epa represented 32 1 of the total fatty acids in the mixture containing sea water 10 pig slurry confirming that it is possible to use this microalga under these culture conditions as the raw material for producing this valuable fatty acid authors such as kowthaman et al 50 have compared several microalgal species in terms of their lipid content highlighting species like phaeodactylum tricornutum nannochloropsis sp and dunaliella sp among others in any case microalgae from the genus nannochloropsis are often used as the raw material to produce lipids especially epa due to their high biomass accumulation rate successful large scale cultivation and high lipid content 20 51 many studies have shown that this microalga adapts to changes in the culture conditions by modifying its molecular composition therefore the lipid composition strongly depends on factors such as irradiance salinity nutrient limitation or temperature 22 concerning the fatty acid content species from the genus nannochloropsis can accumulate 10 25 wt in dry biomass 52 although this percentage depends on the culture conditions as mentioned above 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated the technical viability of producing the high value microalgae n gaditana outdoors using pilot scale thin layer cascade photobioreactors and pig slurry diluted with seawater as the sole nutrient source the studied strain showed itself to be robust and a promising candidate for large scale commercial production including in open systems despite being able to grow in a pig slurry medium the use of this nutrient source led to a decrease in biomass productivity when compared to seawater supplemented with fertilisers higher biomass productivities were achieved in summer than in autumn the treatment of the pig slurry using microalgae led to a decrease in the contents of mesophilic aerobic microbiota total coliforms and pathogenic bacteria including sulphite reducing clostridia and salmonella sp the produced biomass was rich in epa and other polyunsaturated fatty acids demonstrating the potential of the produced biomass for use

12901,nowadays the disposal of municipal wastewater by microalgae while extracting microalgal high value by products has become an emerging trend in this research direct current electrochemical treatment was used to improve microalgae biomass production and wastewater treatment effect simultaneously after electrochemical treatment the cell number biomass chlorophyll a content and lipid content of scenedesmus obliquus cultivated in bg11 medium were significantly increased respectively by 13 1 32 9 7 and 30 1 at the 1 0 a m2 direct current density when scenedesmus obliquus was cultured in real wastewater with electrochemical treatment at the 2 0 a m2 direct current density the biomass and lipid yield increased by 30 1 and 23 5 respectively while the removal of tp ammonia and tn was also obviously accelerated therefore the electrochemical cultivation of scenedesmus obliquus offers good prospects for wastewater treatment and resource recycling graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrochemical treatment scenedesmus obliquus microalgae growth municipal wastewater nutrient removal 1 introduction fossil fuels have played a significant and critical role in the industrial age but they are a non renewable resource according to statistics from the energy information administration eia global fossil fuel reserves will be exhausted in 5 decades 1 one of the alternatives for fossil fuels biofuels as a renewable and substitutive energy source has more relevant environmental advantages than other alternative energy sources 2 presently biofuels production can be divided into three generations 3 as the third generation biofuel microalgae have extremely strong photosynthetic efficiency a short growth cycle and high lipid content 4 economizing agricultural land less water usage and increased co2 sequestration are the main advantages of third generation biofuels 2 in addition biodiesel derived from microalgae may be more than ten times higher than second generation biofuels obtained from oilseed crops due to the higher oil content of microalgae 5 from 1978 to 1996 the aquatic species program asp project which is studied by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel of the united states began research on biodiesel production from microalgae 6 the project screened and obtained 300 algae strains with high lipid content from 1990 to 2000 the government of japan also invested in a project called the earth research and renewal technology project the project invested a total of about 2 5 billion u s dollars in screening out species of algae that tolerate high co2 concentrations grow fast and have high biomass 7 with the deepening of research on microalgae microalgae are also used to extract high value by products for instance it can be used as sources of protein carotenoids astaxanthin etc and even as food substitutes 8 11 scenedesmus obliquus is widely used as a target microalgae for biomass energy extraction 12 however many limiting factors hindered the prospect of biomass energy recycling from microalgae such as the price of culture media culture time and the cost of microalgae harvesting microalgae is not only used for biomass energy extraction 13 with the rapid socio economic development and the increasing emission of various pollutants the water pollution is becoming more serious 14 15 as a class of low level organisms capable of photosynthesis microalgae can effectively use nitrogen and phosphorus elements in sewage and are extensively studied in the field of water remediation 16 17 therefore it has become a feasible trend to use wastewater for microalgae culture in order to save the price of microalgae culture 18 since the concept of using microalgae to remove n and p elements from the sewage was introduced by oswald and gotaas in the 1950s the technology of wastewater treatment with microalgae has been rapidly developed 19 initially the wastewater was purified using principle of algal symbiosis between bacteria and microalgae in highly efficient algal ponds and then gradually microalgae were capable to treat tertiary wastewater 20 by the 1980s the application areas of microalgae technology were gradually expanded in the last decade or so there has been more and more studies related to the utilization of wastewater to directly cultivate microalgae for both water purification and nutrient recovery of wastewater 21 however the drawbacks of long growth time and low lipid content of microalgae restrict the further cost reduction the electric field as a biological stimulus acting on the organism will produce a series of electric field bioeffects 22 the biological effects of electric fields were first discovered in the middle of the 18th century in recent decades they have received the attention of scientists and been subjected to systematic and intensive research 23 24 in the 1960s murr l e and sidaway g h studied the effects of electric fields on plant respiration intensity and plant cell injury respectively 25 26 in the 1990s in the research of microbial denitrification tsong 27 declared that biofilm atp enzymes were capable of absorbing free energy and active from a regular alternating electric field these studies also noted that electric fields have a dual effect on organisms promoting growth and accelerating death for raising the efficiency of microalgal harvesting and extraction rate of high value by products electrical stimulation has been frequently used over years for the extraction of unknown lipids proteins and astaxanthin as well as to accelerate the flocculation effect of microalgae 28 29 however studies related to the use of current stimulation to enhance the biomass of microalgae are gradually being carried out buchmann et al 30 used a pulsed electric field pef to stimulate the arthrospira platensis before cultivation resulting in a 13 1 increase in microalgae biomass in the process of culturing haematococcus pluvialis a certain amount of direct current dc was applied periodically for a short period to increase their biomass by 20 and astaxanthin content by 10 31 sun et al 32 used an immobilization culture of microalgae in wastewater by dc electric field and the lipid content of chlorella increased by 29 62 and biomass by 40 therefore the use of electrical stimulation to promote the breeding of microalgae and the yield of high value by products is a very promising direction this research aimed to develop a system for boosting lipid output by using periodic dc electric fields for the growth of scenedesmus obliquus and reduce the price of biodiesel production by utilizing municipal wastewater as a culture medium for validation in this research we investigated the impacts of diverse electric field strengths on the cell number chlorophyll content biomass yield lipid yield and the changes of protein and polysaccharide content of scenedesmus obliquus by investigating the removal effect of total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 total nitrogen tn and other wastewater indicators we show a promising sewage treatment strategy and a novel idea for the design of wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrochemical treatment unit the electrochemical treatment was operated in a 1 l beaker the reactor volume was 1 l and the wastewater or culture medium

were applied to the microalgae 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 determination of dry microalgae weight and od the microalgal biomass was characterized by dry weight method 10 ml of the microalgae solution was filtered every day through 0 45 μm micropore filter papers the microalgae with the filter papers were then dried in an oven at 105 c for 4 h eventually the filter paper was cooled to room temperature on a desiccator and its weight was measured the weight difference between the filter paper after two drying times was the dry weight of microalgae to some extent microalgal optical density od was significantly and positively correlated with microalgal biomass by scanning the full spectrum of the microalgae solution it was finally determined that od680nm could represent the growth of the scenedesmus obliquus 2 4 2 determination of chlorophyll a in a large number of studies chlorophyll a was also used as an essential indicator of microalgal growth to measure the content of chlorophyll a 5 ml of the microalgae solution was gathered every day to centrifuge at 7000 r min for 10 min the supernatant was put off and 5 ml of 90 ethanol solution was added to the remaining algal sludge

10 min the extracts were taken for determination the absorbance values e were measured at 665 nm and 750 nm by spectrophotometer and then acidified by adding 1 drop of 1 mol l hcl solution for 8 min and the absorbance values a at 665 nm and 750 nm were measured after the acidification the concentration of chlorophyll a was calculated according to eq 1 1 c 1 27 9 e 665 e 750 a 665 a 750 v 1 v 2

electrochemical treatment resulted in an increase in these four indicators the results of the experiments are shown in fig 2 fig 2 a presents the increase in od680 of the scenedesmus obliquus upon application of diverse direct currents after the cultivation after seven days of cultivation the od680 of the scenedesmus obliquus with electrochemical treatment conditions of 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 were 1 73 2 0 and 1 9 respectively all three od680 values were higher than that of the control group meanwhile a number of scenedesmus obliquus cells were counted at the end of each day when the electrochemical treatment was applied as shown in fig 2 b after seven days cultivated in the bg11 medium the number of the scenedesmus obliquus with electrochemical treatment conditions of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 were both significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the control group the scenedesmus obliquus treated with the application of 1 0 a m2 current density can reach 6 48 109 cells l and 6 02 109 cells l with the application of 2 0 a m2 current density which was increased by 13 1 and 5 1 respectively over the control group at the same time this research evaluated the chlorophyll a content generated under diverse electrochemical treatments the changes in chlorophyll a content were similar to the changes in od680 as shown in fig 2 c the chlorophyll a content of the scenedesmus obliquus was increased significantly p 0 05 by 9 7 and 3 4 with 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 direct current density respectively the dry weight of the scenedesmus obliquus was measured for 7 days during the cultivation which are shown in fig 2 d after seven days of cultivation the dry weight of the scenedesmus obliquus in the electric treatment group with 1 0 a m2 current density could reach 0 751 g l while that of 2 0 a m2 was 0 721 g l compared to the control group the dry weight of these two groups increased significantly p 0 05 by 31 96 and 26 71 respectively in all seven days of the cultivation the electrochemical treatment group with 4 0 a m2 current density was lower than the control group both in terms of od680 cell number chlorophyll a and dry weight in the microscopic observations the treatment group with 4 0 a m2 current density had a few microalgal cell fragmentation during the first three days of the cultivation which was not found in the other electrochemical treatment groups the results of the experiments of she et al 37 showed that the continuous application of 10 ma direct current for 24 h destroyed the bacterial cells which was similar to the results of the current experiment however due to the short time of application only some of the cells were disrupted with the increase of the cultivation time the microalgae growth rate of this group was similar to the other groups in the last four days probably due to the gradual adaptation to the environmental stress with 4 0 a m2 current density these four indicators showed that when the applied current density was 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 the growth of the scenedesmus obliquus was promoted a prominent positive relevance was noteworthy between the chlorophyll content and microalgae growth 38 thus the experimental results indicated that electrochemical affects scenedesmus obliquus cells positively increasing the number of microalgae cells and consequently chlorophyll a content the result of experiments is accordant with previous researchers studies 39 3 2 effect of electrochemical treatment on division and intracellular substances in scenedesmus obliquus by the seventh day of the cultivation the microalgae cells division and their composition are shown in fig 3 a under normal culture conditions diploids tetraploids and octoploids are observed in most microalgae in the algal solution in this research most of the scenedesmus obliquus was in the form of tetraploids at the end of the cultivation with current densities of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 the percentage of octoploid microalgae cells was 21 2 and 18 3 respectively compared to only 11 22 in the control group according to microscopic observation most of the octoploid microalgae cells were in a divided state 40 this situation was accordant with the results of the experiments in section 3 1 regarding the number of microalgae cells where the application of electrochemical treatment promoted cell division 31 however a point of interest was that the percentage of octoploid microalgae cells also reached 15 11 with 4 0 a m2 current density this might be because higher current density promoted the aggregation of microalgal cells to some extent 41 this research focused on the lipid protein and polysaccharide content of the scenedesmus obliquus before and after the electrochemical treatment the biomass lipid yield and lipid content of the scenedesmus obliquus are shown in table 1 after seven days of the cultivation the biomass yield of the scenedesmus obliquus in the electric treatment group with 1 0 a m2 current density could reach 107 3 mg l d while that of 2 0 a m2 was 103 mg l d the lipid yield of the scenedesmus obliquus with 1 0 a m2 current density was 22 64 mg l d while that of 2 0 a m2 was 20 37 mg l d meanwhile the biomass and lipid yield of the control group were 81 27 and 13 18 mg l d respectively the treatment groups with a current intensity of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 achieved a significantly increase p 0 05 in dry weight and lipid yield compared to the control group the current density of 1 and 2 0 a m2 increased the lipid content of the scenedesmus obliquus by 30 1 and 21 9 respectively the current on the cathode plate provides electrons to the cell and may lead to excessive reduction of chloroplasts which then transform carbon molecules into lipids 42 it was also possible that the electrochemical treatment promoted the growth of microalgae resulting in faster uptake of n and p elements numerous researches have shown that the deficiency of n and p promoted the synthesis of lipids in microalgae cells 43 different from the control group the electrochemically treated municipal wastewater was more likely to provide a nitrogen deficient and phosphorus deficient culture environment for microalgae which increased the lipid content of microalgae changes in environmental conditions can dramatically affect the fatty acid composition of microalgae 44 there were obvious differences in the fatty acid composition of the scenedesmus obliquus cultivated under various current densities which are shown in table 2 the amount of c16 c18 was found to be above 97 of the total lipids across all the groups the higher c16 c18 level was considered to be more beneficial regarding the quality attributes of biodiesel 45 as the current density increases the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids mufa gradually increased which contributed to improving the fluidity of biodiesel 46 at the same time the polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa were reduced which improved the oxidative stability of biodiesel 47 the protein and polysaccharide content of the scenedesmus obliquus is shown in fig 3 b and c protein and polysaccharide production was significantly higher p 0 05 in the electric treatment groups with current intensities of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 compared to the control group as the applied current increased the biomass of the microalgae it was clear that low current density helps protein synthesis in microalgae the protein content of microalgae can reach 41 96 and 42 74 at 0 5 and 1 0 a m2 current densities respectively however the higher current density enhanced the polysaccharide content of microalgae cells in the control group the polysaccharide content of microalgae was only 14 23 the electrochemical treatment groups with current densities of 2 0 and 4 0 a m2 showed polysaccharide contents of 18 31 and 17 42 respectively this was accordant with the findings of many researchers that when certain physical stresses are applied to microalgae changes in the proteins and polysaccharides produced by the microalgae cells happen 48 on the one hand it was a stress response to external environmental changes and on the other hand physical stress contributed to the synthesis of these high value products ftir was used to characterize the changes of chemical functional groups of the scenedesmus obliquus cells with and without electrochemical treatment which are shown in fig 3 d from the experimental results it could be seen that the ftir absorption peak shifts of scenedesmus obliquus under electrochemical treatment were similar to those under non electrochemical treatment but the values of the absorption peak of scenedesmus obliquus under electrochemical treatment were significantly amplified the microalgae treated electrochemically with a current density of 1 0 a m2 showed obvious absorption peaks near 2920 cm 1 1648 cm 1 1544 cm 1 1456 cm 1 1384 cm 1 and 1240 cm 1 meanwhile the microalgae showed strong absorption peaks at 1456 cm 1 1240 cm 1 and 1048 cm 1after electrochemical treatment with 2 0 a m2 current density according to a previous study by murdock and wetzel 49 it could be analyzed that the absorption peak at 1244 1230 cm 1 was a raise in nucleic acids representing an increase in microalgae cells the amplified absorption peaks at 3400 3300 and 1655 1638 cm 1 were elevated in proteins the absorption peaks at 2930 2920 and 1456 1450 cm 1 were for the increase of lipid production and the absorption peaks at 1200 900 cm 1 were for the increase of polysaccharide content this was consistent with the results of section 3 2 which regarding the changes in protein and polysaccharide as well as lipid contents in microalgae this suggested that the application of a range of electrochemical stimuli accelerated the division and growth of microalgal cells in addition it had an impact on the biochemical composition of intracellular substances 3 3 effects of electrochemical treatment on the growth of scenedesmus obliquus and the removal of n and p elements in real wastewater this section focused on the growth of electrochemical treatment of the scenedesmus obliquus in municipal wastewater as well as tp ammonia nitrogen and tn from the wastewater during the process in the tests the scenedesmus obliquus with an original od680 of 0 12 was added to the supernatant of the municipal wastewater which was rested for 2 h the microalgae were cultured for 5 days the growth of microalgae was characterized by daily measurements of od680 as shown in fig 4 a for the 24 h the scenedesmus obliquus belonged to the adaptation phase then the electric treatment groups with current densities of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 were in the log phase of growth from the 24th h to the 84th h and finally the stabilization phase started on the 84th h slightly faster than the control group when the culture reached the 120th h the microalgae were harvested and the biomass lipid production and lipid content of the scenedesmus obliquus were measured which are shown in fig 4 b after five days of the cultivation the biomass yield of the scenedesmus obliquus in the electric treatment group with 2 0 a m2 current density could reach 115 3 mg l d while that of 1 0 a m2 was 108 3 mg l d the lipid yield of the scenedesmus obliquus in the electric treatment group with 2 a m2current density was 20 7 mg l d while that of 1 0 a m2 was 21 3 mg l d meanwhile the biomass yield and lipid yield of the control group were 88 1 and 19 6 mg l d respectively as compared with the control group the current density of 1 and 2 0 a m2 significantly increased p 0 05 biomass yield of the scenedesmus obliquus by 22 9 and 30 1 respectively compared to the 17 53 increase in biomass resulting from the application of nanosecond pulsed electric field treatment nspef only in the early exponential growth phase by haberkorn et al 50 the method used in this research was more effective in enhancing the biomass of microalgae significantly smaller differences in lipid content between the groups of the scenedesmus obliquus cultured in municipal wastewater compared to bg11 medium probably due to the relative lack of nutrients in municipal wastewater leading to the accumulation of lipid at the end of the culture when each group reached the stage of n and p elements deficiency in addition the effect of each treatment group on the removal of tp tn and ammonia nitrogen was discussed in the experiment which are shown in fig 4 c d and e by the end of the fifth day of cultivation all groups reached more than 80 for tp removal compared to the control group with 90 1 tp removal the electrochemical treatment groups with 1 and 2 a m2 current densities had removal efficiencies of 95 3 and 93 5 however the electrochemical treatment group with 2 a m2 current density had the best effect on tp removal on the fourth day there was some increase in the tp content on the fifth day which might be due to the fact that some microalgal cells were broken up due to reaching the stabilization stage more rapidly compared to the control group with 83 4 ammonia nitrogen removal the electrochemical treatment groups with current densities of 1 and 2 a m2 had removal efficiencies of 94 3 and 96 9 nevertheless the overall removal efficiency of tn was low and the highest removal efficiency reached 84 only at 2 a m2current density the possible reason was aeration and electrochemical treatment caused partial conversion of ammonia nitrogen to nitrate and nitrite nitrogen compared to ammonia nitrogen microalgae were slightly less effective in removing other forms of nitrogen from the result of the experiments both the biomass yield and the lipid yield were higher in the municipal wastewater for the scenedesmus obliquus than those in the bg11 medium probably because the bacteria in the effluent provided some help to the microalgae this study applied current densities 1 and 2 a m2 for municipal wastewater for 24 h to observe the changes in the total bacterial number and the results are shown in fig 4 f as compared with the control group the total number of bacteria in the electrochemical treatment group significantly increased p 0 05 by 19 3 and 27 8 respectively in addition the electrochemical group with 2 a m2 current density was more effective in promoting microalgae using wastewater compared to the bg11 medium probably also because the inhibition of protozoa such as rotifers was more pronounced at this current intensity reducing the damage to microalgae by predators in the effluent 51 52 wastewater treatment design can be improved by reducing costs through better culture control effective nutrient removal recycling of wastewater and increasing the lipid content of microalgae 53 the results of the experiment indicated that the application of a certain level of direct current during microalgal culture could effectively enhance the growth of microalgal cells and the accumulation of biomass and high value by products it also improved the treatment efficiency of wastewater by microalgae the whole process was easy to operate only adjustment of the current application time was required currents are suitable for large scale wastewater treatment and biofuel production 54 and are less costly and beneficial for industrial production compared to polymer substrates 55 it could also be used in conjunction with electrochemical flocculation and crushing of microalgae by varying the current magnitude providing a new insight for the front end treatment of biorefining and the design of microalgae wastewater treatment systems 4 conclusion the aim of this study is to examine the effect of diverse dc densities on the growth and high value by products production of the scenedesmus obliquus in bg11 medium the effect of dc density of 1 0 a m2 on the biomass and protein was more pronounced in municipal wastewater the dc density of 2 0 a m2 was more effective in promoting the growth and lipid production of microalgae this might be due to the complex composition of the real wastewater compared to the bg11 medium accompanied by an increase in the total number of bacteria which allowed the whole system to withstand greater current stress the following is the supplementary data related to this article table s1 bg11 medium 1 l table s1 supplementary data to this article

12901,nowadays the disposal of municipal wastewater by microalgae while extracting microalgal high value by products has become an emerging trend in this research direct current electrochemical treatment was used to improve microalgae biomass production and wastewater treatment effect simultaneously after electrochemical treatment the cell number biomass chlorophyll a content and lipid content of scenedesmus obliquus cultivated in bg11 medium were significantly increased respectively by 13 1 32 9 7 and 30 1 at the 1 0 a m2 direct current density when scenedesmus obliquus was cultured in real wastewater with electrochemical treatment at the 2 0 a m2 direct current density the biomass and lipid yield increased by 30 1 and 23 5 respectively while the removal of tp ammonia and tn was also obviously accelerated therefore the electrochemical cultivation of scenedesmus obliquus offers good prospects for wastewater treatment and resource recycling graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrochemical treatment scenedesmus obliquus microalgae growth municipal wastewater nutrient removal 1 introduction fossil fuels have played a significant and critical role in the industrial age but they are a non renewable resource according to statistics from the energy information administration eia global fossil fuel reserves will be exhausted in 5 decades 1 one of the alternatives for fossil fuels biofuels as a renewable and substitutive energy source has more relevant environmental advantages than other alternative energy sources 2 presently biofuels production can be divided into three generations 3 as the third generation biofuel microalgae have extremely strong photosynthetic efficiency a short growth cycle and high lipid content 4 economizing agricultural land less water usage and increased co2 sequestration are the main advantages of third generation biofuels 2 in addition biodiesel derived from microalgae may be more than ten times higher than second generation biofuels obtained from oilseed crops due to the higher oil content of microalgae 5 from 1978 to 1996 the aquatic species program asp project which is studied by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel of the united states began research on biodiesel production from microalgae 6 the project screened and obtained 300 algae strains with high lipid content from 1990 to 2000 the government of japan also invested in a project called the earth research and renewal technology project the project invested a total of about 2 5 billion u s dollars in screening out species of algae that tolerate high co2 concentrations grow fast and have high biomass 7 with the deepening of research on microalgae microalgae are also used to extract high value by products for instance it can be used as sources of protein carotenoids astaxanthin etc and even as food substitutes 8 11 scenedesmus obliquus is widely used as a target microalgae for biomass energy extraction 12 however many limiting factors hindered the prospect of biomass energy recycling from microalgae such as the price of culture media culture time and the cost of microalgae harvesting microalgae is not only used for biomass energy extraction 13 with the rapid socio economic development and the increasing emission of various pollutants the water pollution is becoming more serious 14 15 as a class of low level organisms capable of photosynthesis microalgae can effectively use nitrogen and phosphorus elements in sewage and are extensively studied in the field of water remediation 16 17 therefore it has become a feasible trend to use wastewater for microalgae culture in order to save the price of microalgae culture 18 since the concept of using microalgae to remove n and p elements from the sewage was introduced by oswald and gotaas in the 1950s the technology of wastewater treatment with microalgae has been rapidly developed 19 initially the wastewater was purified using principle of algal symbiosis between bacteria and microalgae in highly efficient algal ponds and then gradually microalgae were capable to treat tertiary wastewater 20 by the 1980s the application areas of microalgae technology were gradually expanded in the last decade or so there has been more and more studies related to the utilization of wastewater to directly cultivate microalgae for both water purification and nutrient recovery of wastewater 21 however the drawbacks of long growth time and low lipid content of microalgae restrict the further cost reduction the electric field as a biological stimulus acting on the organism will produce a series of electric field bioeffects 22 the biological effects of electric fields were first discovered in the middle of the 18th century in recent decades they have received the attention of scientists and been subjected to systematic and intensive research 23 24 in the 1960s murr l e and sidaway g h studied the effects of electric fields on plant respiration intensity and plant cell injury respectively 25 26 in the 1990s in the research of microbial denitrification tsong 27 declared that biofilm atp enzymes were capable of absorbing free energy and active from a regular alternating electric field these studies also noted that electric fields have a dual effect on organisms promoting growth and accelerating death for raising the efficiency of microalgal harvesting and extraction rate of high value by products electrical stimulation has been frequently used over years for the extraction of unknown lipids proteins and astaxanthin as well as to accelerate the flocculation effect of microalgae 28 29 however studies related to the use of current stimulation to enhance the biomass of microalgae are gradually being carried out buchmann et al 30 used a pulsed electric field pef to stimulate the arthrospira platensis before cultivation resulting in a 13 1 increase in microalgae biomass in the process of culturing haematococcus pluvialis a certain amount of direct current dc was applied periodically for a short period to increase their biomass by 20 and astaxanthin content by 10 31 sun et al 32 used an immobilization culture of microalgae in wastewater by dc electric field and the lipid content of chlorella increased by 29 62 and biomass by 40 therefore the use of electrical stimulation to promote the breeding of microalgae and the yield of high value by products is a very promising direction this research aimed to develop a system for boosting lipid output by using periodic dc electric fields for the growth of scenedesmus obliquus and reduce the price of biodiesel production by utilizing municipal wastewater as a culture medium for validation in this research we investigated the impacts of diverse electric field strengths on the cell number chlorophyll content biomass yield lipid yield and the changes of protein and polysaccharide content of scenedesmus obliquus by investigating the removal effect of total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 total nitrogen tn and other wastewater indicators we show a promising sewage treatment strategy and a novel idea for the design of wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrochemical treatment unit the electrochemical treatment was operated in a 1 l beaker the reactor volume was 1 l and the wastewater or culture medium

collected by culturing until the log phase the microalgae with an original od680 of 0 12 were inoculated and cultured in medium or municipal wastewater for 5 7 days throughout the experiment the light intensity was 5500 lx for 24 h and the aeration volume was 0 8 l min the experimental temperature was 24 2 c the different direct currents with current density gradients of 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 a m2 were applied to the microalgae 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 determination of dry microalgae weight and od the microalgal biomass was characterized by dry weight method 10 ml of the microalgae solution was filtered every day through 0 45 μm micropore filter papers the microalgae with the filter papers were then dried in an oven at 105 c for 4 h eventually the filter paper was cooled to room temperature on a desiccator and its weight was measured the weight difference between the filter paper after two drying times was the dry weight of microalgae to some extent microalgal optical density od was significantly and positively correlated with microalgal biomass by scanning the full spectrum of the microalgae solution it was finally determined that od680nm could represent the growth of the scenedesmus obliquus 2 4 2 determination of chlorophyll a in a large number of studies chlorophyll a was also used as an essential indicator of microalgal growth to measure the content of chlorophyll a 5 ml of the microalgae solution was gathered every day to centrifuge at 7000 r min for 10 min the supernatant was put off and 5 ml of 90 ethanol solution was added to the remaining algal sludge placed the centrifuge tube into a water bath at 75 c for 5 min extract was left to stand for 6 h at ambient temperature in the dark and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 7000 r min for 10 min the extracts were taken for determination the absorbance values e were measured at 665 nm and 750 nm by spectrophotometer and then acidified by adding 1 drop of 1 mol l hcl solution for 8 min and the absorbance values a at 665 nm and 750 nm were measured after the acidification the concentration of chlorophyll a was calculated according to eq 1 1 c 1 27 9 e 665 e 750 a 665 a 750 v 1 v 2 where c1is the concentration of chlorophyll a mg l v1 is the consumption of ethanol added v2 is the consumption of the water sample 2 4 3 determination of lipid production on the basis of the modified folch method total lipids l were extracted using a chloroform methanol 2 1 v v solvent mixture 33 after organic solvent was evaporated lipid extract in a pre weighing container was dried at 80 c for 30 min then cooled to room temperature in the dryer before being weighed again the weight difference between the initial container and the container after drying was the lipid yield 2 4 4 determination of protein and polysaccharide the microalgae solution was collected 30 ml from the device which was centrifuged at 3000 r min for 5 min deserted the supernatant and collected the algal cell precipitate 30 ml pbs cache solution was mixed with microalgae precipitate then it was repeatedly frozen and thawed four times in an ultra low temperature refrigerator and then crushed by an ultrasonic cell crusher for 15 min and finally the crushed algal solution was centrifuged at 3000 r min for 5 min and the supernatant was the algal cell protein polysaccharide extract the fast lowry method was used to determine the proteins of microalgae 34 the phenol sulfuric acid method was used to determine to the polysaccharide of microalgae 35 2 4 5 other analytical methods the concentration of the algae was measured with an automatic bacterial and algae identification counter m520 hangzhou xunshu china water quality was measured by standard methods 36 changes in the structure of functional groups of microalgae before and after electrochemical treatment were measured using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 2 4 6 data processing in this research all measurements were taken in triplicate the data were presented in graphical and tabular form and filed as mean standard deviation spss software was used to perform statistical analysis of the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of electrochemical treatment on scenedesmus obliquus scenedesmus obliquus cells at the end of log growth were collected from the laboratory and injected into sterilized bg11 medium with an initial od680 of 0 12 the effects of electrochemical treatments were discussed using diverse direct current densities 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 a m2 for 12 h every day in this research four indicators were selected to characterize the growth of the scenedesmus obliquus od number of cells chlorophyll a content and dry weight of microalgae every day the application of electrochemical treatment resulted in an increase in these four indicators the results of the experiments are shown in fig 2 fig 2 a presents the increase in od680 of the scenedesmus obliquus upon application of diverse direct currents after the cultivation after seven days of cultivation the od680 of the scenedesmus obliquus with electrochemical treatment conditions of 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 were 1 73 2 0 and 1 9 respectively all three od680 values were higher than that of the control group meanwhile a number of scenedesmus obliquus cells were counted at the end of each day when the electrochemical treatment was applied as shown in fig 2 b after seven days cultivated in the bg11 medium the number of the scenedesmus obliquus with electrochemical treatment conditions of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 were both significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the control group the scenedesmus obliquus treated with the application of 1 0 a m2 current density can reach 6 48 109 cells l and 6 02 109 cells l with the application of 2 0 a m2 current density which was increased by 13 1 and 5 1 respectively over the control group at the same time this research evaluated the chlorophyll a content generated under diverse electrochemical treatments the changes in chlorophyll a content were similar to the changes in od680 as shown in fig 2 c the chlorophyll a content of the scenedesmus obliquus was increased significantly p 0 05 by 9 7 and 3 4 with 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 direct current density respectively the dry weight of the scenedesmus obliquus was measured for 7 days during the cultivation which are shown in fig 2 d after seven days of cultivation the dry weight of the scenedesmus obliquus in the electric treatment group with 1 0 a m2 current density could reach 0 751 g l while that of 2 0 a m2 was 0 721 g l compared to the control group the dry weight of these two groups increased significantly p 0 05 by 31 96 and 26 71 respectively in all seven days of the cultivation the electrochemical treatment group with 4 0 a m2 current density was lower than the control group both in terms of od680 cell number chlorophyll a and dry weight in the microscopic observations the treatment group with 4 0 a m2 current density had a few microalgal cell fragmentation during the first three days of the cultivation which was not found in the other electrochemical treatment groups the results of the experiments of she et al 37 showed that the continuous application of 10 ma direct current for 24 h destroyed the bacterial cells which was similar to the results of the current experiment however due to the short time of application only some of the cells were disrupted with the increase of the cultivation time the microalgae growth rate of this group was similar to the other groups in the last four days probably due to the gradual adaptation to the environmental stress with 4 0 a m2 current density these four indicators showed that when the applied current density was 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 the growth of the scenedesmus obliquus was promoted a prominent positive relevance was noteworthy between the chlorophyll content and microalgae growth 38 thus the experimental results indicated that electrochemical affects scenedesmus obliquus cells positively increasing the number of microalgae cells and consequently chlorophyll a content the result of experiments is accordant with previous researchers studies 39 3 2 effect of electrochemical treatment on division and intracellular substances in scenedesmus obliquus by the seventh day of the cultivation the microalgae cells division and their composition are shown in fig 3 a under normal culture conditions diploids tetraploids and octoploids are observed in most microalgae in the algal solution in this research most of the scenedesmus obliquus was in the form of tetraploids at the end of the cultivation with current densities of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 the percentage of octoploid microalgae cells was 21 2 and 18 3 respectively compared to only 11 22 in the control group according to microscopic observation most of the octoploid microalgae cells were in a divided state 40 this situation was accordant with the results of the experiments in section 3 1 regarding the number of microalgae cells where the application of electrochemical treatment promoted cell division 31 however a point of interest was that the percentage of octoploid microalgae cells also reached 15 11 with 4 0 a m2 current density this might be because higher current density promoted the aggregation of microalgal cells to some extent 41 this research focused on the lipid protein and polysaccharide content of the scenedesmus obliquus before and after the electrochemical treatment the biomass lipid yield and lipid content of the scenedesmus obliquus are shown in table 1 after seven days of the cultivation the biomass yield of the scenedesmus obliquus in the electric treatment group with 1 0 a m2 current density could reach 107 3 mg l d while that of 2 0 a m2 was 103 mg l d the lipid yield of the scenedesmus obliquus with 1 0 a m2 current density was 22 64 mg l d while that of 2 0 a m2 was 20 37 mg l d meanwhile the biomass and lipid yield of the control group were 81 27 and 13 18 mg l d respectively the treatment groups with a current intensity of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 achieved a significantly increase p 0 05 in dry weight and lipid yield compared to the control group the current density of 1 and 2 0 a m2 increased the lipid content of the scenedesmus obliquus by 30 1 and 21 9 respectively the current on the cathode plate provides electrons to the cell and may lead to excessive reduction of chloroplasts which then transform carbon molecules into lipids 42 it was also possible that the electrochemical treatment promoted the growth of microalgae resulting in faster uptake of n and p elements numerous researches have shown that the deficiency of n and p promoted the synthesis of lipids in microalgae cells 43 different from the control group the electrochemically treated municipal wastewater was more likely to provide a nitrogen deficient and phosphorus deficient culture environment for microalgae which increased the lipid content of microalgae changes in environmental conditions can dramatically affect the fatty acid composition of microalgae 44 there were obvious differences in the fatty acid composition of the scenedesmus obliquus cultivated under various current densities which are shown in table 2 the amount of c16 c18 was found to be above 97 of the total lipids across all the groups the higher c16 c18 level was considered to be more beneficial regarding the quality attributes of biodiesel 45 as the current density increases the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids mufa gradually increased which contributed to improving the fluidity of biodiesel 46 at the same time the polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa were reduced which improved the oxidative stability of biodiesel 47 the protein and polysaccharide content of the scenedesmus obliquus is shown in fig 3 b and c protein and polysaccharide production was significantly higher p 0 05 in the electric treatment groups with current intensities of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 compared to the control group as the applied current increased the biomass of the microalgae it was clear that low current density helps protein synthesis in microalgae the protein content of microalgae can reach 41 96 and 42 74 at 0 5 and 1 0 a m2 current densities respectively however the higher current density enhanced the polysaccharide content of microalgae cells in the control group the polysaccharide content of microalgae was only 14 23 the electrochemical treatment groups with current densities of 2 0 and 4 0 a m2 showed polysaccharide contents of 18 31 and 17 42 respectively this was accordant with the findings of many researchers that when certain physical stresses are applied to microalgae changes in the proteins and polysaccharides produced by the microalgae cells happen 48 on the one hand it was a stress response to external environmental changes and on the other hand physical stress contributed to the synthesis of these high value products ftir was used to characterize the changes of chemical functional groups of the scenedesmus obliquus cells with and without electrochemical treatment which are shown in fig 3 d from the experimental results it could be seen that the ftir absorption peak shifts of scenedesmus obliquus under electrochemical treatment were similar to those under non electrochemical treatment but the values of the absorption peak of scenedesmus obliquus under electrochemical treatment were significantly amplified the microalgae treated electrochemically with a current density of 1 0 a m2 showed obvious absorption peaks near 2920 cm 1 1648 cm 1 1544 cm 1 1456 cm 1 1384 cm 1 and 1240 cm 1 meanwhile the microalgae showed strong absorption peaks at 1456 cm 1 1240 cm 1 and 1048 cm 1after electrochemical treatment with 2 0 a m2 current density according to a previous study by murdock and wetzel 49 it could be analyzed that the absorption peak at 1244 1230 cm 1 was a raise in nucleic acids representing an increase in microalgae cells the amplified absorption peaks at 3400 3300 and 1655 1638 cm 1 were elevated in proteins the absorption peaks at 2930 2920 and 1456 1450 cm 1 were for the increase of lipid production and the absorption peaks at 1200 900 cm 1 were for the increase of polysaccharide content this was consistent with the results of section 3 2 which regarding the changes in protein and polysaccharide as well as lipid contents in microalgae this suggested that the application of a range of electrochemical stimuli accelerated the division and growth of microalgal cells in addition it had an impact on the biochemical composition of intracellular substances 3 3 effects of electrochemical treatment on the growth of scenedesmus obliquus and the removal of n and p elements in real wastewater this section focused on the growth of electrochemical treatment of the scenedesmus obliquus in municipal wastewater as well as tp ammonia nitrogen and tn from the wastewater during the process in the tests the scenedesmus obliquus with an original od680 of 0 12 was added to the supernatant of the municipal wastewater which was rested for 2 h the microalgae were cultured for 5 days the growth of microalgae was characterized by daily measurements of od680 as shown in fig 4 a for the 24 h the scenedesmus obliquus belonged to the adaptation phase then the electric treatment groups with current densities of 1 0 and 2 0 a m2 were in the log phase of growth from the 24th h to the 84th h and finally the stabilization phase started on the 84th h slightly faster than the control group when the culture reached the 120th h the microalgae were harvested and the biomass lipid production and lipid content of the scenedesmus obliquus were measured which are shown in fig 4 b after five days of the cultivation the biomass yield of the scenedesmus obliquus in the electric treatment group with 2 0 a m2 current density could reach 115 3 mg l d while that of 1 0 a m2 was 108 3 mg l d the lipid yield of the scenedesmus obliquus in the electric treatment group with 2 a m2current density was 20 7 mg l d while that of 1 0 a m2 was 21 3 mg l d meanwhile the biomass yield and lipid yield of the control group were 88 1 and 19 6 mg l d respectively as compared with the control group the current density of 1 and 2 0 a m2 significantly increased p 0 05 biomass yield of the scenedesmus obliquus by 22 9 and 30 1 respectively compared to the 17 53 increase in biomass resulting from the application of nanosecond pulsed electric field treatment nspef only in the early exponential growth phase by haberkorn et al 50 the method used in this research was more effective in enhancing the biomass of microalgae significantly smaller differences in lipid content between the groups of the scenedesmus obliquus cultured in municipal wastewater compared to bg11 medium probably due to the relative lack of nutrients in municipal wastewater leading to the accumulation of lipid at the end of the culture when each group reached the stage of n and p elements deficiency in addition the effect of each treatment group on the removal of tp tn and ammonia nitrogen was discussed in the experiment which are shown in fig 4 c d and e by the end of the fifth day of cultivation all groups reached more than 80 for tp removal compared to the control group with 90 1 tp removal the electrochemical treatment groups with 1 and 2 a m2 current densities had removal efficiencies of 95 3 and 93 5 however the electrochemical treatment group with 2 a m2 current density had the best effect on tp removal on the fourth day there was some increase in the tp content on the fifth day which might be due to the fact that some microalgal cells were broken up due to reaching the stabilization stage more rapidly compared to the control group with 83 4 ammonia nitrogen removal the electrochemical treatment groups with current densities of 1 and 2 a m2 had removal efficiencies of 94 3 and 96 9 nevertheless the overall removal efficiency of tn was low and the highest removal efficiency reached 84 only at 2 a m2current density the possible reason was aeration and electrochemical treatment caused partial conversion of ammonia nitrogen to nitrate and nitrite nitrogen compared to ammonia nitrogen microalgae were slightly less effective in removing other forms of nitrogen from the result of the experiments both the biomass yield and the lipid yield were higher in the municipal wastewater for the scenedesmus obliquus than those in the bg11 medium probably because the bacteria in the effluent provided some help to the microalgae this study applied current densities 1 and 2 a m2 for municipal wastewater for 24 h to observe the changes in the total bacterial number and the results are shown in fig 4 f as compared with the control group the total number of bacteria in the electrochemical treatment group significantly increased p 0 05 by 19 3 and 27 8 respectively in addition the electrochemical group with 2 a m2 current density was more effective in promoting microalgae using wastewater compared to the bg11 medium probably also because the inhibition of protozoa such as rotifers was more pronounced at this current intensity reducing the damage to microalgae by predators in the effluent 51 52 wastewater treatment design can be improved by reducing costs through better culture control effective nutrient removal recycling of wastewater and increasing the lipid content of microalgae 53 the results of the experiment indicated that the application of a certain level of direct current during microalgal culture could effectively enhance the growth of microalgal cells and the accumulation of biomass and high value by products it also improved the treatment efficiency of wastewater by microalgae the whole process was easy to operate only adjustment of the current application time was required currents are suitable for large scale wastewater treatment and biofuel production 54 and are less costly and beneficial for industrial production compared to polymer substrates 55 it could also be used in conjunction with electrochemical flocculation and crushing of microalgae by varying the current magnitude providing a new insight for the front end treatment of biorefining and the design of microalgae wastewater treatment systems 4 conclusion the aim of this study is to examine the effect of diverse dc densities on the growth and high value by products production of the scenedesmus obliquus in bg11 medium the effect of dc density of 1 0 a m2 on the biomass and protein was more pronounced in municipal wastewater the dc density of 2 0 a m2 was more effective in promoting the growth and lipid production of microalgae this might be due to the complex composition of the real wastewater compared to the bg11 medium accompanied by an increase in the total number of bacteria which allowed the whole system to withstand greater current stress the following is the supplementary data related to this article table s1 bg11 medium 1 l table s1 supplementary data to this article

12902,cyanobacteria adversely affect drinking water treatment and the quality of the drinking water supply microcystis spp are the most abundant cyanobacteria in many surface water bodies throughout the world electrocoagulation flotation ecf treatment has attracted considerable attention as a means of cyanobacteria removal in this study ecf treatment was optimized by adjusting the initial ph electrode distance stirring speed and electrical conductivity k to maximize microcystis aeruginosa cell removal efficiency while meeting drinking water quality standards the treatment was performed for 200 ml m aeruginosa suspensions 2 106 cells ml using an aluminum anode and a graphite cathode at a constant direct current of 100 ma an initial ph of 6 a stirring speed of 200 rpm an electrode distance of 1 cm and k of 500 μs cm were selected as optimum conditions for the ecf treatment under these conditions m aeruginosa at a cell density of 2 106 cells ml was completely removed at a current density of 4 0 ma cm2 with an average energy consumption of 1 20 0 03 wh l the zeta potential varied from 18 49 3 mv to 1 15 0 38 mv which confirmed the complete removal of cells most importantly the ph aluminum concentration and total dissolved solids of the treated water met the drinking water quality standards of the world health organization the optimized ecf treatment was thus shown to be promising for the removal of m aeruginosa cells graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cyanobacteria removal microcystis aeruginosa removal electrocoagulation electrocoagulation flotation aluminum anode optimization 1 introduction cyanobacteria commonly known as blue green algae are photosynthetic microorganisms widely distributed in all forms of freshwater bodies throughout the world 1 2 under favorable conditions cyanobacteria populations usually increase explosively and form blooms in surface water bodies 2 cyanobacteria blooms cause numerous issues related to the formation of odor taste color and toxin by products that can pose potential threats to human and animal health 3 4 microcystis spp are major bloom forming and toxin producing cyanobacteria that are widely found in many surface freshwater bodies worldwide 5 most importantly drinking water treatment processes are affected by filter clogging and the production of cyanobacteria metabolites such as toxins compounds with an unpleasant taste and odor and precursor materials of disinfection by products dbps namely trihalomethane thm and haloacetic acid haa 6 7 therefore cyanobacteria must be removed at the primary stage of the water purification process chemical coagulation and sedimentation microfiltration flotation and the addition of chlorine dioxide clo2 potassium permanganate kmno4 and ozone o3 are used as conventional methods to remove cyanobacteria from drinking water nevertheless these methods are associated with many concerns such as high cost complexity and the formation of secondary pollutants for instance toxins 5 moreover since cyanobacteria are less dense than water as they include gas vacuoles in their cells it is difficult to remove them through sedimentation processes 3 accordingly electrocoagulation flotation ecf treatment has attached considerable attention as a means of cyanobacteria removal the ecf process has many advantages over conventional chemical coagulation the production of coagulants by electrolytic oxidation is highly efficient the dosage required to remove pollutants is low ecf operates in a wide ph range microbubbles help to separate pollutants by flotation and the ecf treatment does not remove alkalinity since hydroxide ions oh are generated at the cathode 3 8 9 most ecf experiments have been performed with aluminum al or iron fe electrodes to separate algae cyanobacteria and the results showed that al has a higher efficiency than fe 10 our previous study also demonstrated that al is a more effective anode material than copper cu fe and zinc zn for removing microcystis aeruginosa cells by ecf treatment 11 eqs 1 4 show the key reactions occurring during the ecf process with an al anode 3 11 14 at the al anode 1

anode through electrolytic oxidation and less soluble al precipitates are produced together with oh ions formed at the cathode 3 15 concurrently hydrogen and oxygen gas microbubbles are produced at the cathode and anode respectively coagulants associated with negatively charged cyanobacteria cells generate flocs and microbubbles that help to lift the flocs to the surface 3 16 even though ecf is efficient and has many advantages it should be optimized in terms of operating parameters to maximize the treatment efficiency with minimum electrode dissolution and minimum operational cost in terms of energy consumption while meeting drinking water quality standards the current density electrode material initial ph solution temperature electrolyte concentration electrical conductivity k electrolyte type stirring speed electrode distance and electrode configuration are important operating parameters in the ecf process a few laboratory scale investigations on the optimization of ecf treatment to remove m aeruginosa in terms of key parameters such as current density ph solution temperature cell density 3 and the effect of chloride ions cl have been reported 17 however there is little information on the optimization of ecf treatment for m aeruginosa removal with an al sacrificial anode in terms of stirring speed electrode distance and k furthermore knowledge of the appropriate ph of the solution is crucial for maximizing cell removal with minimum al solubility to reduce the use of downstream membranes 18 and ensure water potability in this laboratory scale study we used an al anode along with a graphite cathode to optimize ecf treatment in terms of initial ph stirring speed electrode distance and k to maximize the removal of m aeruginosa cells while meeting drinking water quality standards 2 materials and methods 2 1 ecf experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the ecf setup comprised a 200 ml glass container an al anode 2 5 cm 12 7 cm a graphite cathode 2 5

effective areas of the anode and cathode were maintained at 25 cm2 to maximize the surface area to volume ratio s v and to minimize the current density 19 2 2 experimental methodology batch experiments considering four operating parameters were carried out to optimize the ecf process to enhance m aeruginosa cell removal table 1 shows the different conditions used for each operating parameter each experiment was performed at ambient temperature 25 1 c using 200 ml of m aeruginosa suspension a constant current density of 4 ma cm2 was maintained for each set of experiments by applying a constant dc of 100 ma 13 to evaluate the optimum ph the initial ph was adjusted from 3 to 10 using 0 01 m hydrochloric acid hcl and 0 01 m sodium hydroxide naoh the other operating parameters i e stirring speed electrode distance and k were maintained constant at 200 rpm 2 cm and 5000 μs cm respectively to determine the optimum stirring speed the range of 0 500 rpm was tested with ph electrode distance and k maintained constant at 6 2 cm and 5000 μs cm respectively for electrode distance experiments the distance between electrodes was varied from 1 to 3 cm with the ph stirring speed and k maintained constant at 6 200 rpm and 5000 μs cm respectively to investigate the optimum k the initial k was adjusted from 500 to 5000 μs cm using 0 01 m sodium sulfate na2so4 with the ph stirring speed and electrode distance maintained constant at 6 200 rpm and 1 cm respectively under the optimum conditions ecf treatment was carried out for m aeruginosa cell suspension table 1

preparation of m aeruginosa cultures a bg 11 culture medium was prepared as described by rippka et al 21 to culture m aeruginosa cells samples were obtained from previously maintained m aeruginosa monocultures to initiate new cultures and a procedure similar to that in our previous study was carried out to prepare and maintain m aeruginosa cultures 11 flasks rubber stoppers and the bg 11 culture medium were sterilized at 121 c and 0 12 mpa for 20 min in an autoclave sp300 yamato scientific co ltd tokyo japan 22 and cultures were inoculated and maintained at 25 1 c in an incubator lh

aeruginosa cell suspension according to the world health organization who 26 three magnitude classes of cell abundance of cyanobacteria are used to categorize lakes in terms of the health risk of exposure low 20 000 cells ml moderate 20 000 cells ml 105 and high 105 cells ml 27 another magnitude class very high 106 cells ml was defined in a study carried out to measure the cyanobacteria bloom magnitude of lakes in florida and ohio in the united states 27 considering the cell density of this magnitude class we selected the initial cell density as 2 106 cells ml which is also similar to the concentrations used in previous studies 3 17 28 m aeruginosa cell cultures were harvested at the late exponential growth phase and diluted about fivefold with deionized water to obtain the required

out using ibm spss statistics 20 0 software the treatment time anode dissolution and m aeruginosa cell removal efficiency were compared among the different conditions of operating parameters by one way analysis of variance anova post hoc tukey hsd honestly significant difference tests to determine the optimal operating parameters an independent sample t test was used to identify the change in cell diameter due to ecf treatment all statistical analyses used a significance level of 5 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of optimum initial ph experiment 1 ph is the most important parameter of the ecf process in this study we demonstrated that an initial ph of 6 is optimum for the ecf treatment of m aeruginosa cells the initial average cell density and chl a concentration were 2 02 106 0 05 106 cells ml and 6 462 0 44 μg ml respectively as shown in fig 2 no significant difference was observed in terms of water clarity even though each ph showed the maximum removal of m aeruginosa cells the required time to achieve the maximum cell removal was longer with alkaline initial phs than with acidic initial phs fig 3 acidic initial phs 3 6 resulted in the maximum cell removal within a shorter treatment time than alkaline initial phs 7 after 5 min treatment time ph 3 resulted in the highest cell removal efficiency of 79 and phs 4 5 and 6 resulted in cell removal efficiencies of 69 67 and 64 respectively fig 3a after 10 min treatment time treatments carried out at acidic phs showed a cell removal efficiency close to maximum on the other hand phs 7 8 9 and 10 resulted in cell removal efficiencies of 85 71 40 and 22 respectively fig 3a simultaneously chl a concentration gradually decreased at each ph as cell removal progressed the chl a concentration of treated water samples ranged from 0 051 to 0 145 μg ml with phs 3 and 10 yielding the lowest and highest values respectively fig 3b a similar pattern was observed for od684 od730 and the turbidity of m aeruginosa suspension during treatment with different initial phs fig a 1 a denotes appendix a supplementary material cod is generally used as a measure of the susceptibility to the oxidation of the organic matter in water 35 therefore codcr results confirmed the removal of cyanobacteria cells since the initial average codcr 174 5 3 mg l was significantly reduced to 4 4 mg l with acidic initial phs fig 4 however it ranged from 4 to 6 mg l with alkaline phs the maximum codcr removal efficiency was 98 with phs 3 4 and 6 a slight reduction in removal efficiency was observed when ph was alkaline fig 4 as shown in fig 5 the shortest average treatment time to achieve maximum cell removal was observed to be 9 83 0 82 min at ph 3 however there was no significant difference in treatment time for initial phs 3 to 6 p 0 05 alkaline phs including neutral ph required longer treatment times to achieve the maximum cell removal 16 08 1 36 21 83 1 51 32 33 3 72 and 44 17 4 02 min at phs 7 8 9 and 10 respectively fig 5 the treatment times to achieve the maximum removal with phs 8 9 and 10 were significantly higher than those with other initial phs f 7 40 187 369 p 0 05 a similar result was reported by goa et al 3 for m aeruginosa they demonstrated that at low initial phs 4 7 m aeruginosa was successfully removed and cell removal was reduced when ph was increased from 7 to 10 this phenomenon is described by the pourbaix diagram which predicts the metal forms expected from electrocoagulation ec in aqueous systems it graphically represents the thermodynamic equilibria of solubilized metal species at a specific ph and redox potential 10 36 in the case of al the pourbaix diagram suggests that the formation of insoluble aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 is favored from phs 4 to 10 37 38 however the chelation of al ions with the presence of organics in cyanobacteria may interfere with the prediction 10 at phs lower than 4 trivalent aluminum al3 is formed owing to the amphoteric behavior of al oh 3 which is the most toxic form of al and less effective in water treatment 39 at phs 5 and 6 monomeric hydroxoaluminum cations e g al oh 2 and al oh 2 and polymeric species e g al2 oh 2 4 al2 oh 5 and al13o4 oh 24 7 are formed by hydrolysis when ph is close to neutral amphoteric solid al oh 3 is dominant 15 40 41 under neutral and acidic conditions ph 5 7 positively charged precipitates are formed as combinations of hydroxoaluminum cations and al oh 3 and they are attached to negatively charged cells in accordance with the principle of charge neutralization then hydrogen microbubbles assist their separation from water 3 when ph becomes alkaline the solubility of al oh 3 increases monomeric hydroxoaluminum anions such as aluminate al oh 4 are dominant 40 and negatively charged precipitates are formed as a result the adsorption capacity of negatively charged cells decreases and ecf shows low efficiency under alkaline conditions 15 however sweep flocculation becomes predominant with increasing electrolysis time and the continuous production of al coagulants therefore the treatment time required to achieve maximum cell removal is longer 3 42 and consequently the energy consumption increases fig 5 at a constant k of 5000 10 μs cm the average voltage required to maintain a constant current of 100 ma was nearly constant at 2 9 0 1 v under all phs therefore the treatment time was the only factor for changing the energy consumption the lowest and highest energy consumptions were observed to be 0 24 and 1 07 wh l at phs 3 and 10 respectively at ph 6 the treatment time and energy consumption were 12 1 05 min and 0 29 wh l respectively fig 5 gao et al 3 also achieved 100 m aeruginosa removal with an energy consumption of 0 4 wh l at phs 4 7 while poelman et al 43 achieved 90 microalgae separation with an energy consumption of 0 3 wh l of however tumsri et al 44 reported that 1 84 wh l energy was required for the complete removal of 105 cells ml of chlorella vulgaris in addition cl ions were added to the cell suspension as a result of ph adjustment using hcl the anode oxidizes the cl ions to form active chlorine species such as chlorine hypochlorous acid and or hypochlorite which act as oxidants therefore at lower phs cell removal is enhanced by oxidation 10 17 45 46 as illustrated in fig 6 both theoretical and actual anode dissolutions increased with treatment time and ph the faradaic efficiency was higher than 100 at each ph ranging between 114 and 134 with phs 5 and 8 yielding the highest and lowest values respectively in other words the actual anode dissolution is slightly higher than the theoretical anode dissolution at each ph chen et al 47 reported that the faradaic efficiency for an al electrode can be varied from 120 to 140 visigalli et al 10 also reported that the theoretical anodic dissolution is normally exceeded in actual ecf applications as a result of the chemical dissolution of the electrode surface the generation of oxygen at the anode favors chemical dissolution 10 48 and cl ions that are responsible for pitting corrosion increase the rate of anode dissolution 47 the lowest observed anode dissolution was 39 3 mg l at ph 3 nevertheless there was no significant difference in anode dissolution at phs 3 6 p 0 05 the anode dissolutions at phs 8 and 9 were significantly higher than those at other phs f 7 40 186 52 p 0 001 because at lower phs charge neutralization was dominant and a lower al dosage was sufficient for cell removal at higher phs a higher al dosage was needed to realize the same removal efficiency because the sweep flocculation mechanism was dominant 3 15 in addition the lowest observed soluble al concentration of treated water was 0 1 mg l at ph 6 fig 6 this value meets al standards for drinking water defined by the united states environmental protection agency secondary drinking water regulation 0 05 0 2 mg l canadian operational guidance 0 1 0 2 mg l who maximum 0 2 mg l al and ministry of health labour and welfare of japan 0 2 mg l 49 51 this was because the minimum solubility of al oh 3 is normally between phs 5 3 and 6 8 at 25 c and it is predominant over other al species 52 anderson et al 53 also showed that the soluble al concentration does not exceed 0 1 mg l if ph is less than 7 3 at 25 c in contrast we found that the soluble al concentration significantly increased f 7 16 75 116 p 0 001 at lower phs 3 and 4 and higher phs 9 and 10 with longer treatment times the highest average soluble al concentration was 17 55 1 48 mg l at ph 10 and phs 3 and 4 resulted in average soluble al concentrations of treated water of 13 54 2 28 and 7 68 1 49 mg l respectively fig 6 this is because the solubility of al is greatly increased by the amphoteric effect when ph becomes acidic or alkaline 54 57 considering the treatment time and soluble al concentration the initial ph 6 was selected as the optimum level for further experiments furthermore because of the formation of oh ions at the cathode 58 the ph of the treated water significantly increased at acidic initial phs 3 6 but only slightly increased when ph was around 7 8 on the other hand a slight reduction in the ph of treated water was observed when treatment was carried out with the initial ph 9 or 10 according to chen et al 59 at high phs al oh 3 utilizes oh ions to produce al oh 4 as a result ph decreases however only slight reductions in k tds and salinity that were not significant were observed after treatment table a 1 3 2 determination of optimum stirring speed experiment 2 the stirring speed is one of the most important operating parameters of ecf treatment the stirring of the solution is essential to equalize the al coagulants so that they interact with the cyanobacteria suspension to generate flocs 10 and homogenize the ph and temperature of the solution 60 when stirring is carried out floc sedimentation does not occur the ecf process generates hydrogen microbubbles that lift the cyanobacteria flocs 3 in this study the stirring speed was changed from 0 to 500 rpm to identify its optimum value the average initial cell density and chl a concentration were 2 16 106 0 07 106 cells ml and 6 745 0 492 μg ml respectively as shown in fig 7a a considerable removal of cells was observed at stirring speeds of 200 300 and 400 rpm up to 10 min of treatment with little subsequent reduction 66 94 and 100 cell removal at 5 10 and 12 min respectively similarly the chl a concentration and cod decreased to 0 056 μg ml and 4 mg l after 12 min of treatment respectively at stirring speeds of 200 400 rpm fig 7b fig a 2 shows the variations of od684 od730 turbidity and cell density of the m aeruginosa suspension with treatment time at different stirring speeds the stirring speeds from 200 to 400 rpm showed superior performance to those of 0 100 and 500 rpm in treating m aeruginosa a previous study on the use of ec to treat carwash wastewater demonstrated that increasing the stirring speed from 150 to 250 rpm increased the removal efficiency this is because at optimum stirring speeds flocs are formed and flocculate easily owing to mass transfer within the reactor and the formation of metal oxide passivation layer on the surface of the electrode decreases 61 in contrast m aeruginosa flocs tended to settle at the bottom and on the walls of the container at low stirring speeds of 0 and 100 rpm the optimum stirring speed is crucial as low stirring speeds do not properly homogenize the solution to ensure contact between the coagulants and the cells and tend to cause the sedimentation of cell flocs while high stirring speeds generate high shear forces that break down cell flocs and disturb the smooth coagulation flocculation process 10 60 gönder et al 61 also demonstrated a decrease in the removal efficiency of ec when the stirring speed was increased from 250 to 350 rpm stirring speeds from 200 to 400 rpm showed satisfactory performance without the settling of cells at the bottom of the container or their attachment to the container walls therefore the optimum stirring speed was taken to be 200 rpm considering the power consumption of the magnetic stirrer in each batch experiment the average voltage required to maintain a constant current of 100 ma was 2 9 0 2 v at k of 5000 10 μs cm therefore the power consumption was almost constant at 0 29 wh l for a 12 min treatment time no significant reduction in k tds and salinity were observed after treatment table a 2 since the treatment time and initial ph were 12 min and 6 respectively the anode dissolution ranged from 36 to 42 mg l and the soluble al concentration in the treated water was 0 2 mg l regardless of the stirring speed 3 3 determination of optimum electrode distance experiment 3 in this section we demonstrate the effect of the interelectrode distance on the removal of m aeruginosa cells an initial cell density of 2 19 106 0 09 106 cells ml was used in each set of experiments the initial chl a concentration was 6 603 0 59 μg ml as shown in fig 8a for 5 min treatment electrode distances of 1 and 3 cm showed the highest and lowest performance levels 75 and 28 for 1 and 3 cm respectively cell removal after 5 min treatment was significantly lower at an electrode distance of 3 cm than at an electrode distance of 1 cm f 2 6 30 45 p 0 001 the removal of cells at an electrode distance of 2 cm was slightly lower than that at an electrode distance of 1 cm f 2 6 30 45 p 0 511 but it was significantly higher than that at an electrode distance of 3 cm f 2 6 30 45 p 0 002 the treatment with an electrode distance of 1 cm showed the greatest cell removal at 10 min 97 f 2 6 44 223 p 0 001 after 11 min treatment almost 100 of the cells were removed in an experiment with an electrode distance of 1 cm numerous studies on the optimization of the interelectrode distance in the ec technique have suggested that the optimal interelectrode distance is 1 cm for the treatment of textile wastewater 62 nitrate total hardness calcium magnesium 63 saline water 64 and phosphate 65 ghernaout et al 66 also showed that the treatment efficiency increases with decreasing electrode distance for the removal of microalgae using electroflotation according to martinez villafane et al 67 more gas bubbles are formed when the interelectrode distance is narrower consequently the probability of collisions between coagulants and cells increases owing to the formation of turbulence enhancing the treatment efficiency in contrast 12 and 15 min treatments were required in experiments with electrode distances of 2 and 3 cm to achieve the maximum cell removal fig 8a the chl a concentration and cod were reported to be 0 064 μg ml and 4 mg l respectively after 12 min treatment also indicating cell removal fig 8b fig a 3 shows the variations of od684 od730 turbidity and cell density of m aeruginosa suspension with the treatment time for different electrode distances at a constant k 5000 10 μs cm the voltage required to maintain a constant current of 100 ma was decreased as the electrode distance decreased fig 9 accordingly treatments carried out with a 1 cm electrode distance showed the minimum energy consumption owing to the reduction in the voltage required from 3 4 0 1 to 2 5 0 1 v to maintain a current of 100 ma the highest energy consumption occurred when the electrode distance was 3 cm fig 9 a wider gap between electrodes increases the resistance of the system as a result of electrolyte and or electrode ohmic loss 68 then the voltage drops with the decrease in electrical current in contrast a narrower gap between electrodes results in lower solution resistance and ohmic loss 69 70 therefore the optimal electrode distance for further experiments was considered to be 1 cm in addition the anode dissolution ranged from 36 to 40 mg l for 12 min treatment and the soluble al concentration in the treated water was 0 2 mg l regardless of the electrode distance this was because al normally has minimum solubility at ph 6 fig 6 furthermore there were no significant differences in physical parameters such as k tds and salinity table a 3 before and after treatment 3 4 determination of optimum electrical conductivity experiment 4 the k of the solution plays a vital role in ecf treatment we showed that there was no significant difference in the treatment upon changing k of the solutions since we maintained a constant current throughout each treatment each set of treatments was carried out for 12 min as previous experiments had revealed 12 1 05 min to be the optimum treatment time at ph 6 to achieve the maximum removal of m aeruginosa cells here the initial ph stirring speed and electrode distance were maintained constant at 6 200 rpm and 1 cm respectively in each experiment the average initial cell density and chl a concentration were 1 99 106 0 08 106 cells ml and 6 128 0 239 μg ml respectively as shown in fig 10a most of the cells 90 were removed at each k for up to a treatment time of 10 min after which there was little further reduction a similar pattern was observed at each k for the removal of chl a with increasing treatment time fig 10b fig a 4 shows the variations of od684 od730 turbidity and cell density of m aeruginosa suspension with the treatment time for different k values as tabulated in table 3 the voltage required to maintain a constant current increased with decreasing k the lowest and highest voltages required to maintain a current of 100 ma were observed at k values of 5000 and 500 μs cm respectively the energy consumption simultaneously increased with voltage accordingly the highest and lowest energy consumptions were observed at k values of 500 and 5000 μs cm respectively high k may lead to a reduced power consumption in the ecf process 10 owing to the reduced voltage this is because as the number of charged particles in the solution increases electrons more easily flow in the system 71 the salinity of the solution also increased when k was increased table 3 increasing the k of a solution is effective for decreasing the energy consumption via the reduction in resistivity to minimize the required voltage nevertheless tds and the salinity level of the solution increased when k was increased using an electrolyte for example na2so4 there may be a high cost associated with treatment to reduce tds and salinity to meet drinking water quality standards according to who a tds level of less than 300 mg l in drinking water is considered to be excellent 72 therefore the k of the cell suspension should be maintained lower than 500 μs cm so that the tds level in treated water is lower than the 300 mg l 72 in addition there was no significant difference in anode dissolution 38 44 mg l or faradaic efficiency 109 131 among the k values obtained the highest faradaic efficiency was observed in the ongoing experiment with the highest electrolyte concentration k 5000 μs cm this is because the chemical dissolution of the anode increased owing to pitting corrosion caused by cl ions 47 most importantly the soluble al concentration in treated water at each k was 0 2 mg l except in the treatment carried out with k of 5000 μs cm 0 6 mg l 3 5 ecf treatment under optimum treatment conditions experiment 5 on the basis of the above results an initial ph of 6 a stirring speed of 200 rpm an electrode distance of 1 cm and k of 500 μs cm were selected with a treatment time of 12 min under these optimum conditions the required average voltage was 12 3 0 4 v and the energy consumption was 1 20 0 03 wh l for 100 cell removal the anode dissolution ranged from 36 to 39 mg l with the faradaic efficiency of 109 4 under the optimum conditions the faradaic efficiency was low owing to the reduced pitting corrosion caused by cl ions 47 this is because we used 500 μs cm as the optimum k which was the minimum electrolyte na2so4 concentration the soluble al concentration in treated water was 0 1 mg l which meets al standards for drinking water 49 51 furthermore k tds and salinity in treated water were 457 18 μs cm 298 13 mg l and 0 22 0 04 ppt respectively also meeting drinking water quality standards 72 fig 11 shows the appearance of m aeruginosa suspension with increasing treatment time under the optimum treatment conditions the water clarity gradually improved with the treatment time m aeruginosa cell flocs were displaced by the microbubbles produced at the cathode and anode see video b 1 fig 11 shows the appearance of m aeruginosa suspension with increasing treatment time under the optimum treatment conditions the water clarity gradually improved with the treatment time m aeruginosa cell flocs were displaced by the microbubbles produced at the cathode and anode see video b 1 fig 12 shows a selection of m aeruginosa cells image analysis software bz x800 analyzer was used to measure the cell diameter before and after ecf treatment the areas of individual cells were manually selected using circles and polygons provided by the image analysis software to find the area and diameter of each cell the diameters of m aeruginosa cells before and after ecf treatment were statistically analyzed to identify the impact of ecf treatment on the size of cells the average cell diameter before ecf treatment was 5 45 1 2 μm after ecf treatment under optimum operating conditions the cell diameter decreased to 5 01 1 2 μm however this decrease was not statistically significant p 0 05 the compression of cells as a result of the stress applied by the electrical field and the salinity of the solution caused the expulsion of intracellular materials 17 the dispersion stability of the particles in the solution was measured using the zeta potential which is an important indicator in identifying the effective surface charge 73 as shown in fig 13 the initial average zeta potential of the m aeruginosa suspension was 24 51 3 38 mv after adjusting the ph and k of the suspension it increased to 18 49 3 mv the ecf treatment increased the zeta potential to 1 15 0 38 mv this was due to the destabilization of negatively charged suspended cells via the change in their steady state owing to the formation of positively charged al precipitates by al oh 3 and hydroxoaluminum cations upon the dissolution of al ions from the anode 3 15 thus enhancing the separation of m aeruginosa from water as shown in table 4 the average ph of the m aeruginosa suspension was alkaline because of the consumption of carbon dioxide in the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria high do values can also be expected as a result of the photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa there was no significant reduction in do after adjusting the ph and k however do was reduced to 6 6 0 71 mg l after 12 min ecf treatment under optimum conditions table 4 under acidic conditions cathodic reactions are dominant and the cathodic reduction of oxygen occurs 74 75 the initial ph of the suspension was adjusted to 6 and it increased to 6 67 0 19 after ecf treatment owing to the formation of oh ions at the cathode 76 the initial orp of the suspension increased after adding hcl and na2so4 electrolyte to adjust the ph and k after ecf treatment the orp decreased to 55 12 mv table 4 the orp characterizes the oxidation reduction state of water 35 a high positive orp shows the prevailing oxidizing condition and do increases with the orp 77 no dh was detected in the initial m aeruginosa suspension or after adjusting the ph and k table 4 however after treatment with ecf 0 608 0 095 mg l dh was detected as a result of the generation of hydrogen microbubbles at the cathode according to kikuchi et al 78 hydrogen generated by ec shows anti oxidative properties if hydrogen particles have a diameter of less than 600 nm they are considered to be colloids these colloidal hydrogen particles cannot be measured as hydrogen using dh meters fig 14 shows codcr and doc values before and after ecf treatment the initial codcr and doc concentrations were 174 5 3 and 14 56 1 62 mg l respectively a codcr reduction of 98 was reported after ecf treatment owing to the removal of a considerable number of cells whereas doc showed a 56 reduction algal organic matter aom is responsible for doc concentration and is composed of a wide range of chemical compounds 79 the composition of aom is categorized as peptide protein and non peptide organic matter with a broad range of molecular weights mws 79 81 in general coagulation is not effective in removing low mw organic molecules but is highly effective in removing large mw organic molecules 79 safarikova et al 81 showed that high mw proteins of m aeruginosa mw 10 kda are completely removed by al coagulants whereas low mw peptides of m aeruginosa mw 10 kda remain in the solution however further studies on the composition and characteristics of aom particularly the mw distribution charge hydrophobicity and protein content are necessary to clarify its treatability 79 3 6 comparison with conventional treatment methods we demonstrated that there is 100 removal efficiency for an m aeruginosa cell density of 2 106 cells ml under optimum ecf conditions many researchers have compared m aeruginosa cell removal efficiencies obtained using various coagulants such as magnetic nanoparticles alum polyaluminum chloride pacl and peroxymonosulfate pms for example jiang et al 82 reported 100 m aeruginosa removal efficiency under an optimal dosage of 2 mg l magnetic nanoparticles at ph 10 ma et al 83 reported a cell removal efficiency of only about 65 with an alum dosage of 4 1 mg l at an initial m aeruginosa of 2 2 106 cells ml cell density lapsongpon et al 84 demonstrated that 30 mg l alum is sufficient to achieve 90 m aeruginosa cell removal efficiency at ph 7 5 zhang et al 85 reported 89 m aeruginosa cell removal efficiency with a pacl dosage of 3 mg l which increased to 93 5 upon sonication for 60 s with an initial cell density and ph of 106 cells ml and 7 3 7 9 respectively wang et al 28 found that 9 85 mg l pms and 41 31 mg l fe ii are required to obtain 94 3 m aeruginosa removal efficiency for 2 106 cells ml density nishi et al 86 applied coagulation flocculation with moringa oleifera coagulant to remove microcystis sp they reported 91 efficiency for cell removal at a coagulant dosage of 250 mg l most of these studies were conducted using m aeruginosa cultured under controlled laboratory conditions a few studies were carried out using natural water alfafara et al 87 tested the effectiveness of an ecf reactor for removing algae from eutrophied lake water microcystis sp was the dominant species in the lake water and they achieved a removal efficiency of 100 with al alloy anodes within 15 min bench scale coagulation experiments carried out by julio et al 88 showed that 70 mg l alum 35 mg l pacl 55 mg l fecl3 and 0 6 mg l polymer were the optimum dosages to achieve 100 cell removal from river water nevertheless excessive dosage of coagulants potentially cause chemical or physiological stress to cyanobacteria cell membranes and lead to the release of aom including toxins 89 90 in general efficient chemical coagulation occurs in a specific ph range even though we selected the optimum ph of ecf of 6 the results of this study showed that ecf can be effective in a wide ph range of 3 7 overall the ecf treatment has been shown to be promising for the removal of m aeruginosa cells from the perspective of application the compact size ease of automation and low capital and operational costs of the proposed method are considered as major advantages over conventional treatment methods 10 4 conclusions in this study we optimized ecf treatment to maximize m aeruginosa cell removal efficiency while meeting who drinking water standards in terms of ph al concentration and tds the optimum treatment conditions achieved were initial ph 6 stirring speed 200 rpm electrode distance 1 cm and k 500 μs cm under the optimum conditions 2 106 m aeruginosa cells per ml were completely removed at a current density of 4 0 ma cm2 with an anode dissolution of 38 2 mg l and an energy consumption of 1 20 0 03 wh l the zeta potential varied from 18 49 3 mv to 1 15 0 38 mv as a result of the destabilization of suspended cells which confirmed the complete removal of cells the ecf treatment with low energy consumption showed superior performance to conventional chemical treatment technologies in removing m aeruginosa cells since this method promotes the aggregation of cell groups without applying pressure it prevents the leaching of dissolved organic matter due to cell destruction aggregated organic matter flocs are easy to remove from the system in addition in the literature most ecf experiments were carried out in batch reactors with only a few reactors in continuous operations 10 the ratio of the current intensity to the cyanobacteria cell loading rate can be considered as a useful operating and scale up parameter in continuous operations 87 therefore further studies on the continuous flow process are required from an application perspective the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary material image 1 video b 1

12902,cyanobacteria adversely affect drinking water treatment and the quality of the drinking water supply microcystis spp are the most abundant cyanobacteria in many surface water bodies throughout the world electrocoagulation flotation ecf treatment has attracted considerable attention as a means of cyanobacteria removal in this study ecf treatment was optimized by adjusting the initial ph electrode distance stirring speed and electrical conductivity k to maximize microcystis aeruginosa cell removal efficiency while meeting drinking water quality standards the treatment was performed for 200 ml m aeruginosa suspensions 2 106 cells ml using an aluminum anode and a graphite cathode at a constant direct current of 100 ma an initial ph of 6 a stirring speed of 200 rpm an electrode distance of 1 cm and k of 500 μs cm were selected as optimum conditions for the ecf treatment under these conditions m aeruginosa at a cell density of 2 106 cells ml was completely removed at a current density of 4 0 ma cm2 with an average energy consumption of 1 20 0 03 wh l the zeta potential varied from 18 49 3 mv to 1 15 0 38 mv which confirmed the complete removal of cells most importantly the ph aluminum concentration and total dissolved solids of the treated water met the drinking water quality standards of the world health organization the optimized ecf treatment was thus shown to be promising for the removal of m aeruginosa cells graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cyanobacteria removal microcystis aeruginosa removal electrocoagulation electrocoagulation flotation aluminum anode optimization 1 introduction cyanobacteria commonly known as blue green algae are photosynthetic microorganisms widely distributed in all forms of freshwater bodies throughout the world 1 2 under favorable conditions cyanobacteria populations usually increase explosively and form blooms in surface water bodies 2 cyanobacteria blooms cause numerous issues related to the formation of odor taste color and toxin by products that can pose potential threats to human and animal health 3 4 microcystis spp are major bloom forming and toxin producing cyanobacteria that are widely found in many surface freshwater bodies worldwide 5 most importantly drinking water treatment processes are affected by filter clogging and the production of cyanobacteria metabolites such as toxins compounds with an unpleasant taste and odor and precursor materials of disinfection by products dbps namely trihalomethane thm and haloacetic acid haa 6 7 therefore cyanobacteria must be removed at the primary stage of the water purification process chemical coagulation and sedimentation microfiltration flotation and the addition of chlorine dioxide clo2 potassium permanganate kmno4 and ozone o3 are used as conventional methods to remove cyanobacteria from drinking water nevertheless these methods are associated with many concerns such as high cost complexity and the formation of secondary pollutants for instance toxins 5 moreover since cyanobacteria are less dense than water as they include gas vacuoles in their cells it is difficult to remove them through sedimentation processes 3 accordingly electrocoagulation flotation ecf treatment has attached considerable attention as a means of cyanobacteria removal the ecf process has many advantages over conventional chemical coagulation the production of coagulants by electrolytic oxidation is highly efficient the dosage required to remove pollutants is low ecf operates in a wide ph range microbubbles help to separate pollutants by flotation and the ecf treatment does not remove alkalinity since hydroxide ions oh are generated at the cathode 3 8 9 most ecf experiments have been performed with aluminum al or iron fe electrodes to separate algae cyanobacteria and the results showed that al has a higher efficiency than fe 10 our previous study also demonstrated that al is a more effective anode material than copper cu fe and zinc zn for removing microcystis aeruginosa cells by ecf treatment 11 eqs 1 4 show the key reactions occurring during the ecf process with an al anode 3 11 14 at the al anode 1

anode through electrolytic oxidation and less soluble al precipitates are produced together with oh ions formed at the cathode 3 15 concurrently hydrogen and oxygen gas microbubbles are produced at the cathode and anode respectively coagulants associated with negatively charged cyanobacteria cells generate flocs and microbubbles that help to lift the flocs to the surface 3 16 even though ecf is efficient and has many advantages it should be optimized in terms of operating parameters to maximize the treatment efficiency with minimum electrode dissolution and minimum operational cost in terms of energy consumption while meeting drinking water quality standards the current density electrode material initial ph solution temperature electrolyte concentration electrical conductivity k electrolyte type stirring speed electrode distance and electrode configuration are important operating parameters in the ecf process a few laboratory scale investigations on the optimization of ecf treatment to remove m aeruginosa in terms of key parameters such as current density ph solution temperature cell density 3 and the effect of chloride ions cl have been reported 17 however there is little information on the optimization of ecf treatment for m aeruginosa removal with an al sacrificial anode in terms of stirring speed electrode distance and k furthermore knowledge of the appropriate ph of the solution is crucial for maximizing cell removal with minimum al solubility to reduce the use of downstream membranes 18 and ensure water potability in this laboratory scale study we used an al anode along with a graphite cathode to optimize ecf treatment in terms of initial ph stirring speed electrode distance and k to maximize the removal of m aeruginosa cells while meeting drinking water quality standards 2 materials and methods 2 1 ecf experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the ecf setup comprised a 200 ml glass container an al anode 2 5 cm 12 7 cm a graphite cathode 2 5 cm 13 cm ajax scientific ltd scarborough ontario canada a regulated direct current dc digital power supply unit pmc35 2a kikusui kanagawa japan and a magnetic stirrer pc 320 corning new york usa the effective areas of the anode and cathode were maintained at 25 cm2 to maximize the surface area to volume ratio s v and to minimize the current density 19 2 2 experimental methodology batch experiments considering four operating parameters were carried out to optimize the ecf process to enhance m aeruginosa cell removal table 1 shows the different conditions used for each operating parameter each experiment was performed at ambient temperature 25 1 c using 200 ml of m aeruginosa suspension a constant current density of 4 ma cm2 was maintained for each set of experiments by applying a constant dc of 100 ma 13 to evaluate the optimum ph the initial ph was adjusted from 3 to 10 using 0 01 m hydrochloric acid hcl and 0 01 m sodium hydroxide naoh the other operating parameters i e stirring speed electrode distance and k were maintained constant at 200 rpm 2 cm and 5000 μs cm respectively to determine the optimum stirring speed the range of 0 500 rpm was tested with ph electrode distance and k maintained constant at 6 2 cm and 5000 μs cm respectively for electrode distance experiments the distance between electrodes was varied from 1 to 3 cm with the ph stirring speed and k maintained constant at 6 200 rpm and 5000 μs cm respectively to investigate the optimum k the initial k was adjusted from 500 to 5000 μs cm using 0 01 m sodium sulfate na2so4 with the ph stirring speed and electrode distance maintained constant at 6 200 rpm and 1 cm respectively under the optimum conditions ecf treatment was carried out for m aeruginosa cell suspension table 1

preparation of m aeruginosa cultures a bg 11 culture medium was prepared as described by rippka et al 21 to culture m aeruginosa cells samples were obtained from previously maintained m aeruginosa monocultures to initiate new cultures and a procedure similar to that in our previous study was carried out to prepare and maintain m aeruginosa cultures 11 flasks rubber stoppers and the bg 11 culture medium were sterilized at 121 c and 0 12 mpa for 20 min in an autoclave sp300 yamato scientific co ltd tokyo japan 22 and cultures were inoculated and maintained at 25 1 c in an incubator lh

aeruginosa cell suspension according to the world health organization who 26 three magnitude classes of cell abundance of cyanobacteria are used to categorize lakes in terms of the health risk of exposure low 20 000 cells ml moderate 20 000 cells ml 105 and high 105 cells ml 27 another magnitude class very high 106 cells ml was defined in a study carried out to measure the cyanobacteria bloom

mm respectively the detection limit was 0 1 mg l 2 6 statistical analysis all data graphs were created using originlab 2022 originlab corporation massachusetts usa statistical analyses were carried out using ibm spss statistics 20 0 software the treatment time anode dissolution and m aeruginosa cell removal efficiency were compared among the different conditions of operating parameters by one way analysis of variance anova post hoc tukey hsd honestly significant difference tests to determine the optimal operating parameters an independent sample t test was used to identify the change in cell diameter due to ecf treatment all statistical analyses used a significance level of 5 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of optimum initial ph experiment 1 ph is the most important parameter of the ecf process in this study we demonstrated that an initial ph of 6 is optimum for the ecf treatment of m aeruginosa cells the initial average cell density and chl a concentration were 2 02 106 0 05 106 cells ml and 6 462 0 44 μg ml respectively as shown in fig 2 no significant difference was observed in terms of water clarity even though each ph showed the maximum removal of m aeruginosa cells the required time to achieve the maximum cell removal was longer with alkaline initial phs than with acidic initial phs fig 3 acidic initial phs 3 6 resulted in the maximum cell removal within a shorter treatment time than alkaline initial phs 7 after 5 min treatment time ph 3 resulted in the highest cell removal efficiency of 79 and phs 4 5 and 6 resulted in cell removal efficiencies of 69 67 and 64 respectively fig 3a after 10 min treatment time treatments carried out at acidic phs showed a cell removal efficiency close to maximum on the other hand phs 7 8 9 and 10 resulted in cell removal efficiencies of 85 71 40 and 22 respectively fig 3a simultaneously chl a concentration gradually decreased at each ph as cell removal progressed the chl a concentration of treated water samples ranged from 0 051 to 0 145 μg ml with phs 3 and 10 yielding the lowest and highest values respectively fig 3b a similar pattern was observed for od684 od730 and the turbidity of m aeruginosa suspension during treatment with different initial phs fig a 1 a denotes appendix a supplementary material cod is generally used as a measure of the susceptibility to the oxidation of the organic matter in water 35 therefore codcr results confirmed the removal of cyanobacteria cells since the initial average codcr 174 5 3 mg l was significantly reduced to 4 4 mg l with acidic initial phs fig 4 however it ranged from 4 to 6 mg l with alkaline phs the maximum codcr removal efficiency was 98 with phs 3 4 and 6 a slight reduction in removal efficiency was observed when ph was alkaline fig 4 as shown in fig 5 the shortest average treatment time to achieve maximum cell removal was observed to be 9 83 0 82 min at ph 3 however there was no significant difference in treatment time for initial phs 3 to 6 p 0 05 alkaline phs including neutral ph required longer treatment times to achieve the maximum cell removal 16 08 1 36 21 83 1 51 32 33 3 72 and 44 17 4 02 min at phs 7 8 9 and 10 respectively fig 5 the treatment times to achieve the maximum removal with phs 8 9 and 10 were significantly higher than those with other initial phs f 7 40 187 369 p 0 05 a similar result was reported by goa et al 3 for m aeruginosa they demonstrated that at low initial phs 4 7 m aeruginosa was successfully removed and cell removal was reduced when ph was increased from 7 to 10 this phenomenon is described by the pourbaix diagram which predicts the metal forms expected from electrocoagulation ec in aqueous systems it graphically represents the thermodynamic equilibria of solubilized metal species at a specific ph and redox potential 10 36 in the case of al the pourbaix diagram suggests that the formation of insoluble aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 is favored from phs 4 to 10 37 38 however the chelation of al ions with the presence of organics in cyanobacteria may interfere with the prediction 10 at phs lower than 4 trivalent aluminum al3 is formed owing to the amphoteric behavior of al oh 3 which is the most toxic form of al and less effective in water treatment 39 at phs 5 and 6 monomeric hydroxoaluminum cations e g al oh 2 and al oh 2 and polymeric species e g al2 oh 2 4 al2 oh 5 and al13o4 oh 24 7 are formed by hydrolysis when ph is close to neutral amphoteric solid al oh 3 is dominant 15 40 41 under neutral and acidic conditions ph 5 7 positively charged precipitates are formed as combinations of hydroxoaluminum cations and al oh 3 and they are attached to negatively charged cells in accordance with the principle of charge neutralization then hydrogen microbubbles assist their separation from water 3 when ph becomes alkaline the solubility of al oh 3 increases monomeric hydroxoaluminum anions such as aluminate al oh 4 are dominant 40 and negatively charged precipitates are formed as a result the adsorption capacity of negatively charged cells decreases and ecf shows low efficiency under alkaline conditions 15 however sweep flocculation becomes predominant with increasing electrolysis time and the continuous production of al coagulants therefore the treatment time required to achieve maximum cell removal is longer 3 42 and consequently the energy consumption increases fig 5 at a constant k of 5000 10 μs cm the average voltage required to maintain a constant current of 100 ma was nearly constant at 2 9 0 1 v under all phs therefore the treatment time was the only factor for changing the energy consumption the lowest and highest energy consumptions were observed to be 0 24 and 1 07 wh l at phs 3 and 10 respectively at ph 6 the treatment time and energy consumption were 12 1 05 min and 0 29 wh l respectively fig 5 gao et al 3 also achieved 100 m aeruginosa removal with an energy consumption of 0 4 wh l at phs 4 7 while poelman et al 43 achieved 90 microalgae separation with an energy consumption of 0 3 wh l of however tumsri et al 44 reported that 1 84 wh l energy was required for the complete removal of 105 cells ml of chlorella vulgaris in addition cl ions were added to the cell suspension as a result of ph adjustment using hcl the anode oxidizes the cl ions to form active chlorine species such as chlorine hypochlorous acid and or hypochlorite which act as oxidants therefore at lower phs cell removal is enhanced by oxidation 10 17 45 46 as illustrated in fig 6 both theoretical and actual anode dissolutions increased with treatment time and ph the faradaic efficiency was higher than 100 at each ph ranging between 114 and 134 with phs 5 and 8 yielding the highest and lowest values respectively in other words the actual anode dissolution is slightly higher than the theoretical anode dissolution at each ph chen et al 47 reported that the faradaic efficiency for an al electrode can be varied from 120 to 140 visigalli et al 10 also reported that the theoretical anodic dissolution is normally exceeded in actual ecf applications as a result of the chemical dissolution of the electrode surface the generation of oxygen at the anode favors chemical dissolution 10 48 and cl ions that are responsible for pitting corrosion increase the rate of anode dissolution 47 the lowest observed anode dissolution was 39 3 mg l at ph 3 nevertheless there was no significant difference in anode dissolution at phs 3 6 p 0 05 the anode dissolutions at phs 8 and 9 were significantly higher than those at other phs f 7 40 186 52 p 0 001 because at lower phs charge neutralization was dominant and a lower al dosage was sufficient for cell removal at higher phs a higher al dosage was needed to realize the same removal efficiency because the sweep flocculation mechanism was dominant 3 15 in addition the lowest observed soluble al concentration of treated water was 0 1 mg l at ph 6 fig 6 this value meets al standards for drinking water defined by the united states environmental protection agency secondary drinking water regulation 0 05 0 2 mg l canadian operational guidance 0 1 0 2 mg l who maximum 0 2 mg l al and ministry of health labour and welfare of japan 0 2 mg l 49 51 this was because the minimum solubility of al oh 3 is normally between phs 5 3 and 6 8 at 25 c and it is predominant over other al species 52 anderson et al 53 also showed that the soluble al concentration does not exceed 0 1 mg l if ph is less than 7 3 at 25 c in contrast we found that the soluble al concentration significantly increased f 7 16 75 116 p 0 001 at lower phs 3 and 4 and higher phs 9 and 10 with longer treatment times the highest average soluble al concentration was 17 55 1 48 mg l at ph 10 and phs 3 and 4 resulted in average soluble al concentrations of treated water of 13 54 2 28 and 7 68 1 49 mg l respectively fig 6 this is because the solubility of al is greatly increased by the amphoteric effect when ph becomes acidic or alkaline 54 57 considering the treatment time and soluble al concentration the initial ph 6 was selected as the optimum level for further experiments furthermore because of the formation of oh ions at the cathode 58 the ph of the treated water significantly increased at acidic initial phs 3 6 but only slightly increased when ph was around 7 8 on the other hand a slight reduction in the ph of treated water was observed when treatment was carried out with the initial ph 9 or 10 according to chen et al 59 at high phs al oh 3 utilizes oh ions to produce al oh 4 as a result ph decreases however only slight reductions in k tds and salinity that were not significant were observed after treatment table a 1 3 2 determination of optimum stirring speed experiment 2 the stirring speed is one of the most important operating parameters of ecf treatment the stirring of the solution is essential to equalize the al coagulants so that they interact with the cyanobacteria suspension to generate flocs 10 and homogenize the ph and temperature of the solution 60 when stirring is carried out floc sedimentation does not occur the ecf process generates hydrogen microbubbles that lift the cyanobacteria flocs 3 in this study the stirring speed was changed from 0 to 500 rpm to identify its optimum value the average initial cell density and chl a concentration were 2 16 106 0 07 106 cells ml and 6 745 0 492 μg ml respectively as shown in fig 7a a considerable removal of cells was observed at stirring speeds of 200 300 and 400 rpm up to 10 min of treatment with little subsequent reduction 66 94 and 100 cell removal at 5 10 and 12 min respectively similarly the chl a concentration and cod decreased to 0 056 μg ml and 4 mg l after 12 min of treatment respectively at stirring speeds of 200 400 rpm fig 7b fig a 2 shows the variations of od684 od730 turbidity and cell density of the m aeruginosa suspension with treatment time at different stirring speeds the stirring speeds from 200 to 400 rpm showed superior performance to those of 0 100 and 500 rpm in treating m aeruginosa a previous study on the use of ec to treat carwash wastewater demonstrated that increasing the stirring speed from 150 to 250 rpm increased the removal efficiency this is because at optimum stirring speeds flocs are formed and flocculate easily owing to mass transfer within the reactor and the formation of metal oxide passivation layer on the surface of the electrode decreases 61 in contrast m aeruginosa flocs tended to settle at the bottom and on the walls of the container at low stirring speeds of 0 and 100 rpm the optimum stirring speed is crucial as low stirring speeds do not properly homogenize the solution to ensure contact between the coagulants and the cells and tend to cause the sedimentation of cell flocs while high stirring speeds generate high shear forces that break down cell flocs and disturb the smooth coagulation flocculation process 10 60 gönder et al 61 also demonstrated a decrease in the removal efficiency of ec when the stirring speed was increased from 250 to 350 rpm stirring speeds from 200 to 400 rpm showed satisfactory performance without the settling of cells at the bottom of the container or their attachment to the container walls therefore the optimum stirring speed was taken to be 200 rpm considering the power consumption of the magnetic stirrer in each batch experiment the average voltage required to maintain a constant current of 100 ma was 2 9 0 2 v at k of 5000 10 μs cm therefore the power consumption was almost constant at 0 29 wh l for a 12 min treatment time no significant reduction in k tds and salinity were observed after treatment table a 2 since the treatment time and initial ph were 12 min and 6 respectively the anode dissolution ranged from 36 to 42 mg l and the soluble al concentration in the treated water was 0 2 mg l regardless of the stirring speed 3 3 determination of optimum electrode distance experiment 3 in this section we demonstrate the effect of the interelectrode distance on the removal of m aeruginosa cells an initial cell density of 2 19 106 0 09 106 cells ml was used in each set of experiments the initial chl a concentration was 6 603 0 59 μg ml as shown in fig 8a for 5 min treatment electrode distances of 1 and 3 cm showed the highest and lowest performance levels 75 and 28 for 1 and 3 cm respectively cell removal after 5 min treatment was significantly lower at an electrode distance of 3 cm than at an electrode distance of 1 cm f 2 6 30 45 p 0 001 the removal of cells at an electrode distance of 2 cm was slightly lower than that at an electrode distance of 1 cm f 2 6 30 45 p 0 511 but it was significantly higher than that at an electrode distance of 3 cm f 2 6 30 45 p 0 002 the treatment with an electrode distance of 1 cm showed the greatest cell removal at 10 min 97 f 2 6 44 223 p 0 001 after 11 min treatment almost 100 of the cells were removed in an experiment with an electrode distance of 1 cm numerous studies on the optimization of the interelectrode distance in the ec technique have suggested that the optimal interelectrode distance is 1 cm for the treatment of textile wastewater 62 nitrate total hardness calcium magnesium 63 saline water 64 and phosphate 65 ghernaout et al 66 also showed that the treatment efficiency increases with decreasing electrode distance for the removal of microalgae using electroflotation according to martinez villafane et al 67 more gas bubbles are formed when the interelectrode distance is narrower consequently the probability of collisions between coagulants and cells increases owing to the formation of turbulence enhancing the treatment efficiency in contrast 12 and 15 min treatments were required in experiments with electrode distances of 2 and 3 cm to achieve the maximum cell removal fig 8a the chl a concentration and cod were reported to be 0 064 μg ml and 4 mg l respectively after 12 min treatment also indicating cell removal fig 8b fig a 3 shows the variations of od684 od730 turbidity and cell density of m aeruginosa suspension with the treatment time for different electrode distances at a constant k 5000 10 μs cm the voltage required to maintain a constant current of 100 ma was decreased as the electrode distance decreased fig 9 accordingly treatments carried out with a 1 cm electrode distance showed the minimum energy consumption owing to the reduction in the voltage required from 3 4 0 1 to 2 5 0 1 v to maintain a current of 100 ma the highest energy consumption occurred when the electrode distance was 3 cm fig 9 a wider gap between electrodes increases the resistance of the system as a result of electrolyte and or electrode ohmic loss 68 then the voltage drops with the decrease in electrical current in contrast a narrower gap between electrodes results in lower solution resistance and ohmic loss 69 70 therefore the optimal electrode distance for further experiments was considered to be 1 cm in addition the anode dissolution ranged from 36 to 40 mg l for 12 min treatment and the soluble al concentration in the treated water was 0 2 mg l regardless of the electrode distance this was because al normally has minimum solubility at ph 6 fig 6 furthermore there were no significant differences in physical parameters such as k tds and salinity table a 3 before and after treatment 3 4 determination of optimum electrical conductivity experiment 4 the k of the solution plays a vital role in ecf treatment we showed that there was no significant difference in the treatment upon changing k of the solutions since we maintained a constant current throughout each treatment each set of treatments was carried out for 12 min as previous experiments had revealed 12 1 05 min to be the optimum treatment time at ph 6 to achieve the maximum removal of m aeruginosa cells here the initial ph stirring speed and electrode distance were maintained constant at 6 200 rpm and 1 cm respectively in each experiment the average initial cell density and chl a concentration were 1 99 106 0 08 106 cells ml and 6 128 0 239 μg ml respectively as shown in fig 10a most of the cells 90 were removed at each k for up to a treatment time of 10 min after which there was little further reduction a similar pattern was observed at each k for the removal of chl a with increasing treatment time fig 10b fig a 4 shows the variations of od684 od730 turbidity and cell density of m aeruginosa suspension with the treatment time for different k values as tabulated in table 3 the voltage required to maintain a constant current increased with decreasing k the lowest and highest voltages required to maintain a current of 100 ma were observed at k values of 5000 and 500 μs cm respectively the energy consumption simultaneously increased with voltage accordingly the highest and lowest energy consumptions were observed at k values of 500 and 5000 μs cm respectively high k may lead to a reduced power consumption in the ecf process 10 owing to the reduced voltage this is because as the number of charged particles in the solution increases electrons more easily flow in the system 71 the salinity of the solution also increased when k was increased table 3 increasing the k of a solution is effective for decreasing the energy consumption via the reduction in resistivity to minimize the required voltage nevertheless tds and the salinity level of the solution increased when k was increased using an electrolyte for example na2so4 there may be a high cost associated with treatment to reduce tds and salinity to meet drinking water quality standards according to who a tds level of less than 300 mg l in drinking water is considered to be excellent 72 therefore the k of the cell suspension should be maintained lower than 500 μs cm so that the tds level in treated water is lower than the 300 mg l 72 in addition there was no significant difference in anode dissolution 38 44 mg l or faradaic efficiency 109 131 among the k values obtained the highest faradaic efficiency was observed in the ongoing experiment with the highest electrolyte concentration k 5000 μs cm this is because the chemical dissolution of the anode increased owing to pitting corrosion caused by cl ions 47 most importantly the soluble al concentration in treated water at each k was 0 2 mg l except in the treatment carried out with k of 5000 μs cm 0 6 mg l 3 5 ecf treatment under optimum treatment conditions experiment 5 on the basis of the above results an initial ph of 6 a stirring speed of 200 rpm an electrode distance of 1 cm and k of 500 μs cm were selected with a treatment time of 12 min under these optimum conditions the required average voltage was 12 3 0 4 v and the energy consumption was 1 20 0 03 wh l for 100 cell removal the anode dissolution ranged from 36 to 39 mg l with the faradaic efficiency of 109 4 under the optimum conditions the faradaic efficiency was low owing to the reduced pitting corrosion caused by cl ions 47 this is because we used 500 μs cm as the optimum k which was the minimum electrolyte na2so4 concentration the soluble al concentration in treated water was 0 1 mg l which meets al standards for drinking water 49 51 furthermore k tds and salinity in treated water were 457 18 μs cm 298 13 mg l and 0 22 0 04 ppt respectively also meeting drinking water quality standards 72 fig 11 shows the appearance of m aeruginosa suspension with increasing treatment time under the optimum treatment conditions the water clarity gradually improved with the treatment time m aeruginosa cell flocs were displaced by the microbubbles produced at the cathode and anode see video b 1 fig 11 shows the appearance of m aeruginosa suspension with increasing treatment time under the optimum treatment conditions the water clarity gradually improved with the treatment time m aeruginosa cell flocs were displaced by the microbubbles produced at the cathode and anode see video b 1 fig 12 shows a selection of m aeruginosa cells image analysis software bz x800 analyzer was used to measure the cell diameter before and after ecf treatment the areas of individual cells were manually selected using circles and polygons provided by the image analysis software to find the area and diameter of each cell the diameters of m aeruginosa cells before and after ecf treatment were statistically analyzed to identify the impact of ecf treatment on the size of cells the average cell diameter before ecf treatment was 5 45 1 2 μm after ecf treatment under optimum operating conditions the cell diameter decreased to 5 01 1 2 μm however this decrease was not statistically significant p 0 05 the compression of cells as a result of the stress applied by the electrical field and the salinity of the solution caused the expulsion of intracellular materials 17 the dispersion stability of the particles in the solution was measured using the zeta potential which is an important indicator in identifying the effective surface charge 73 as shown in fig 13 the initial average zeta potential of the m aeruginosa suspension was 24 51 3 38 mv after adjusting the ph and k of the suspension it increased to 18 49 3 mv the ecf treatment increased the zeta potential to 1 15 0 38 mv this was due to the destabilization of negatively charged suspended cells via the change in their steady state owing to the formation of positively charged al precipitates by al oh 3 and hydroxoaluminum cations upon the dissolution of al ions from the anode 3 15 thus enhancing the separation of m aeruginosa from water as shown in table 4 the average ph of the m aeruginosa suspension was alkaline because of the consumption of carbon dioxide in the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria high do values can also be expected as a result of the photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa there was no significant reduction in do after adjusting the ph and k however do was reduced to 6 6 0 71 mg l after 12 min ecf treatment under optimum conditions table 4 under acidic conditions cathodic reactions are dominant and the cathodic reduction of oxygen occurs 74 75 the initial ph of the suspension was adjusted to 6 and it increased to 6 67 0 19 after ecf treatment owing to the formation of oh ions at the cathode 76 the initial orp of the suspension increased after adding hcl and na2so4 electrolyte to adjust the ph and k after ecf treatment the orp decreased to 55 12 mv table 4 the orp characterizes the oxidation reduction state of water 35 a high positive orp shows the prevailing oxidizing condition and do increases with the orp 77 no dh was detected in the initial m aeruginosa suspension or after adjusting the ph and k table 4 however after treatment with ecf 0 608 0 095 mg l dh was detected as a result of the generation of hydrogen microbubbles at the cathode according to kikuchi et al 78 hydrogen generated by ec shows anti oxidative properties if hydrogen particles have a diameter of less than 600 nm they are considered to be colloids these colloidal hydrogen particles cannot be measured as hydrogen using dh meters fig 14 shows codcr and doc values before and after ecf treatment the initial codcr and doc concentrations were 174 5 3 and 14 56 1 62 mg l respectively a codcr reduction of 98 was reported after ecf treatment owing to the removal of a considerable number of cells whereas doc showed a 56 reduction algal organic matter aom is responsible for doc concentration and is composed of a wide range of chemical compounds 79 the composition of aom is categorized as peptide protein and non peptide organic matter with a broad range of molecular weights mws 79 81 in general coagulation is not effective in removing low mw organic molecules but is highly effective in removing large mw organic molecules 79 safarikova et al 81 showed that high mw proteins of m aeruginosa mw 10 kda are completely removed by al coagulants whereas low mw peptides of m aeruginosa mw 10 kda remain in the solution however further studies on the composition and characteristics of aom particularly the mw distribution charge hydrophobicity and protein content are necessary to clarify its treatability 79 3 6 comparison with conventional treatment methods we demonstrated that there is 100 removal efficiency for an m aeruginosa cell density of 2 106 cells ml under optimum ecf conditions many researchers have compared m aeruginosa cell removal efficiencies obtained using various coagulants such as magnetic nanoparticles alum polyaluminum chloride pacl and peroxymonosulfate pms for example jiang et al 82 reported 100 m aeruginosa removal efficiency under an optimal dosage of 2 mg l magnetic nanoparticles at ph 10 ma et al 83 reported a cell removal efficiency of only about 65 with an alum dosage of 4 1 mg l at an initial m aeruginosa of 2 2 106 cells ml cell density lapsongpon et al 84 demonstrated that 30 mg l alum is sufficient to achieve 90 m aeruginosa cell removal efficiency at ph 7 5 zhang et al 85 reported 89 m aeruginosa cell removal efficiency with a pacl dosage of 3 mg l which increased to 93 5 upon sonication for 60 s with an initial cell density and ph of 106 cells ml and 7 3 7 9 respectively wang et al 28 found that 9 85 mg l pms and 41 31 mg l fe ii are required to obtain 94 3 m aeruginosa removal efficiency for 2 106 cells ml density nishi et al 86 applied coagulation flocculation with moringa oleifera coagulant to remove microcystis sp they reported 91 efficiency for cell removal at a coagulant dosage of 250 mg l most of these studies were conducted using m aeruginosa cultured under controlled laboratory conditions a few studies were carried out using natural water alfafara et al 87 tested the effectiveness of an ecf reactor for removing algae from eutrophied lake water microcystis sp was the dominant species in the lake water and they achieved a removal efficiency of 100 with al alloy anodes within 15 min bench scale coagulation experiments carried out by julio et al 88 showed that 70 mg l alum 35 mg l pacl 55 mg l fecl3 and 0 6 mg l polymer were the optimum dosages to achieve 100 cell removal from river water nevertheless excessive dosage of coagulants potentially cause chemical or physiological stress to cyanobacteria cell membranes and lead to the release of aom including toxins 89 90 in general efficient chemical coagulation occurs in a specific ph range even though we selected the optimum ph of ecf of 6 the results of this study showed that ecf can be effective in a wide ph range of 3 7 overall the ecf treatment has been shown to be promising for the removal of m aeruginosa cells from the perspective of application the compact size ease of automation and low capital and operational costs of the proposed method are considered as major advantages over conventional treatment methods 10 4 conclusions in this study we optimized ecf treatment to maximize m aeruginosa cell removal efficiency while meeting who drinking water standards in terms of ph al concentration and tds the optimum treatment conditions achieved were initial ph 6 stirring speed 200 rpm electrode distance 1 cm and k 500 μs cm under the optimum conditions 2 106 m aeruginosa cells per ml were completely removed at a current density of 4 0 ma cm2 with an anode dissolution of 38 2 mg l and an energy consumption of 1 20 0 03 wh l the zeta potential varied from 18 49 3 mv to 1 15 0 38 mv as a result of the destabilization of suspended cells which confirmed the complete removal of cells the ecf treatment with low energy consumption showed superior performance to conventional chemical treatment technologies in removing m aeruginosa cells since this method promotes the aggregation of cell groups without applying pressure it prevents the leaching of dissolved organic matter due to cell destruction aggregated organic matter flocs are easy to remove from the system in addition in the literature most ecf experiments were carried out in batch reactors with only a few reactors in continuous operations 10 the ratio of the current intensity to the cyanobacteria cell loading rate can be considered as a useful operating and scale up parameter in continuous operations 87 therefore further studies on the continuous flow process are required from an application perspective the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary material image 1 video b 1

process becoming a drawback that needs solution a new system coupling electrooxidation and electrodialysis was recently proposed for micropollutants removal since ionic interactions between micropollutants and ion exchange membranes were already proven despite this the transport of pharmaceutical through ion exchange membranes under the application of an electric field is still unclear and pathless to fill this gap the transport of atenolol atl at under and overlimiting current conditions was evaluated in an electrodialysis cell for the first time as an initial step to the application of the hybrid process this study focused on the interaction and transport of atl through the cation exchange membrane cem considering atl cationic aspect different current densities 5 10

pharmaceutical compounds of the most varied classes are commonly identified in samples from different water matrices including surface water groundwater drinking water and wastewaters among them β blockers have been detected in different places around the world in concentrations ranging from μg l to ng l 1 5 the β blocker atenolol atl is among the most sold and consumed drugs worldwide 6 in brazil this pharmaceutical is included in a social program that provides medication to the population 7 and for this reason it has been detected in water samples from different places within the country 8 12 conventional water and wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove micropollutants which implies that the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals for example are insufficient or even non existent in this regard electrooxidation emerges as technology capable of achieving high removal rates of that compounds this process presents simple operation and maintenance and the organic compound is degraded via reactions with electrogenerated reactive species mainly the hydroxyl radical 13 despite electrooxidation offers good results in terms of degradation and mineralization of organic compounds there is an important drawback related to the process the low concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the environment in order to be oxidized the contaminant must reach the anode surface and if it is present in low concentration the mass transfer from the bulk solution to the anode is hampered 14 to overcome this limitation new strategies should be investigated 15 a new reactor setup has been studied to optimize the removal rates by adding an ion exchange membrane in the system 16 therefore the cathodic reactions are avoided and the contaminant is held near the anode improving its oxidation this two compartment reactor has proven to be effective in the removal of different pharmaceuticals despite of the anode material 17 18 however some studies have shown that micropollutants can interact with the ion exchange membranes and some attention should be addressed to this matter 19 21 most of these studies evaluated the transport and interactions between the pharmaceuticals and membranes but the experiments were carried out without the application of an electric field or applying a single value of current density and so has not evaluated the effect of this operational parameter on the process 19 20 22 23 roman et al 24 evaluated the effect of different current densities but emphasized the discussion on the effect of ph on the organic micropollutants transport through iem also vanoppen et al 21 evaluated different current densities in a solution containing a concentration of salt 6 orders of magnitude greater than organic ones and stated that the transport of the latter occurs only when the salt is depleted from the solution besides that recent studies have proven that is possible to couple electrodialysis and electrooxidation in a single batch reactor to treat solutions containing micropollutants by concentrating and oxidizing them simultaneously 25 27 these studies have focused on pesticides so far and for this reason our group intends to investigate this integrated technique on the removal of pharmaceutical contaminated water and wastewater the purpose of this work is to evaluate the transport of atl through ion exchange membrane and establish the interactions that occurs between them aiming a hybrid process in the future this hybrid process integrates both electrodialysis and electrooxidation allowing to concentrate and oxidize atl simultaneously so the present work is focused on an initial study of how the electric field can affect the transport and in which conditions this concentration would be optimized the investigation consists of electrodialysis experiments with a 0 375 mm atl as a model pollutant evaluating four different current density conditions 5 10 15 and 25 ma cm2 the interactions between the atl and the ion exchange membrane were also elucidated by ion uptake and reverse polarity experiments 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals ion exchange membranes and solutions atl active compound 99 was purchased in a local drugstore na2so4 kcl and h2so4 of analytical grade were also utilized for the preparation of electrolytic solutions ionsep hc c and ionsep hc a membranes were used as cation exchange membrane cem and anion exchange membrane aem respectively the properties of these membranes are reported elsewhere 28 29 a working solution containing 0 375 mm of atl and 0 021 m of na2so4 was used in ed and in ion uptake experiments databases of the speciation of atl and literature indicate that its pka is near 9 7 below this value it is positively charged whereas above it has no charge 30 31 considering that the ph of most water matrices tends to be neutral an initial ph near 6 was chosen in this study so that the solution ph was adjusted to 6 0 2 by adding a 0 5 m h2so4 solution for the electrodialysis experiments two other electrolyte solutions were prepared with 0 021 m and 0 035 m of na2so4 and were used in the concentrate compartments and as electrode rinse respectively for the ion uptake experiments a 0 1 m of kcl solution was also used distilled and deionized water was employed to prepare electrodialysis and ion uptake solutions while milli q direct water was used to prepare analytical and standards solutions 2 2 ion uptake experiments first pieces of membranes of the same size were cut and equilibrated in two different solutions for 24 h under stirring condition i 0 375 mm of atl and ii 0 375 mm atl 0 021 m na2so4 after this these membranes were washed with distilled water several times and put into equilibration in 0 1 m kcl solution for another 24 h also under stirring condition finally the atl content in this soak solution was measured the mass of the dry membranes was measured on an analytical balance a schematic representation can be found in fig s1 in supplementary material 2 3 experimental setup limiting current density and ed experiments a lab scale cell with five compartments was used in the experiments fig s2 in supplementary material the compartments were separated by two cem and two aem membranes alternately arranged the effective area of the membranes was 16 cm2 the electrodes consisted of 4 4 cm plates of commercial ti 70 tio2 30 ruo2 the limiting current density of the cem ilim cem was estimated by applying successive increasing current densities in steps of 2 ma every 30 s according to the procedure described in other studies 29 32 the membrane potential was measured with platinum wire electrodes coupled to digital multimeters electrodialysis experiments were performed at room temperature in galvanostatic mode at a constant current density value with isolated recirculation in each compartment at batch mode and at a flow rate of 85 l h initially a sequence of individual experiments was performed evaluating four different current densities 5 10 15 and 25 ma cm2 in these experiments the working solution containing atl was fed only in the central compartment while the concentrate compartments were fed with the 0 021 m of na2so4 solution fig s3 in supplementary material before each experiment the solutions were left in the system for a 24 h equilibration period and triplicates were done for all evaluated conditions after that a single electrodialysis experiment was conducted applying an inverse polarity and using na2so4 solutions without atl in all compartments fig s4 in supplementary material the main objective of this experiment was to evaluate the release of atl possibly sorbed in the membrane during the previous experiments finally to better understand the atl transport through the cem a singular batch of continuous experiments was performed using a new set of membranes for that the same electrodialysis setup was used fig s3 in supplementary material and the same current condition was applied repeatedly 2 4 analysis during the electrodialysis experiments the cell potential ph and conductivity of all solutions were monitored aliquots were collected at pre established times and atl concentration was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a thermo scientific dionex ics 3000 associated to a thermo scientific ultimate 3000 the equipment was fitted with a c18 dionex column 120 å 4 6 10 mm and 3 μm phosphate buffer of ph 3 and acetonitrile 40 60 were used as mobile phase with a flow rate of 0 75 ml min a sample volume of 20 μl was injected into the equipment for analysis the photodiode array detector was fixed at λ 225 nm and under these conditions the atl retention time was 2 min an analysis of the membrane morphology was performed using a scanning electron microscope phenom prox thermofisher operated at 10 kv for this purpose the membrane was placed in a sampler without prior metallization to avoid any surface modification 3 results and discussion 3 1 atl cem interaction and determination of limiting current density interactions and attractive repulsive forces between membranes and organic molecules determine their transport in electrodialysis systems to evaluate the ion exchange between the membrane used in this study and atl ion uptake experiments were carried out for that two solutions were evaluated one containing only atl and the other a mixture of atl and na2so4 in the first one the calculated loading of atl in the membrane was 0 08 meq g while in the second it was 0 03 meq g this decrease in the number of atl molecules exchanged in the membrane with the presence of na ions indicates that the na interact more easily with the membrane and therefore will be more easily transported when compared to atl this may be also associated with the fact that na ions are in much higher concentration than the atl and because they are smaller in size 21 furthermore the iec provided by the manufacturer is 2 0 meq g and the difference in the values obtained experimentally with atl may also be related to the presence of protons in solution as a function of ph adjustment what involves that not all fixed charges of the membrane can be equilibrated with atl fig 1a shows the polarization curve obtained for the cem placed in the central compartment and surrounded by the working solution at low current densities the membrane potential increases linearly with the increase in the current density value presenting a quasi ohmic behavior by increasing the current density concentration gradients develop near the membrane interface involving the dilution of ions on one side of the membrane diluted compartment and an accumulation of ions on the other cationic concentrate compartment the formation of concentration gradients is a consequence of the higher cation permeation rates through the membrane phase as compared with their motion across the bulk solution when the concentration of ions near the diluted side of the membrane approaches zero a change in the slope is observed increasing the system resistance the current density corresponding to the beginning of this limiting state named as limiting current density ilim cem appears close to 13 ma cm2 commonly a third region appears in the polarization curves which is characterized by an increase in the slope because of the activation of mass transport mechanisms typical of overlimiting conditions but in this particular case the third region cannot be seen within the evaluated voltage range after determining the ilim cem electrodialysis experiments were carried out to evaluate the atl transport at underlimiting and overlimiting conditions the experimental time was fixed at a maximum of 4 h in general the ions scarcity promoted by their migration from the diluted to adjacent compartments causes an increase in the cell potential values ucell fig 1b at underlimiting conditions a linear behavior was observed when applying 5 ma cm2 when the ucell value remained constant the same behavior was observed when applying 10 ma cm2 but only up to an experimental time of 2 h when there is a trend change with a sudden exponential increase of the ucell this could be linked to a concentration polarization effect caused by the scarcity of ions near the membrane solution interface situation in which the ilim cem is reached or also just to the gradual dilution of the central compartment regarding overlimiting conditions 15 and 25 ma cm2 ucell presented an exponential raise linked to a faster depletion of ions near the membrane surface increasing the system electric resistance notoriously 33 in these two cases the experimental time was limited by the voltage of the power supply 3 2 conductivity behavior and ph evaluation during the experiments the conductivity of aqueous solutions is an important parameter to be evaluated in the electrodialysis process it is associated with the presence of ions in solution and ensures the proper application of an electrical field within an electrodialysis cell although atl presents charge at the selected ph it does not have the ionic strength to influence the conductivity of the solution all initial solutions presented the same conductivity table 1 regardless of the presence of atl so this parameter is associated with the ionic conductivity of na and so4 2 ions besides that these two ions are in a much higher concentration than atl as discussed above when ions from the diluted compartment migrate towards the concentrate ones the process is limited by the high resistivity of the medium as expected the conductivity of the diluted compartment dropped with time reaching low values limiting the process mainly when operated under overlimiting conditions likewise the conductivity of the cathodic and anodic concentrate compartments increased not only due to the ions that migrated from the diluted compartment but also from the rinse solution flowing through the electrode compartments the solution ph is also expected to play an important role in the process considering that the atl molecule presents different charges as a function of ph to ensure that atl was positively charged an initial ph value of 6 was chosen in this study typical of natural sources of water the evolution of ph was monitored in the different compartments fig 2 the ph in the cathodic compartment decreased and in the anodic compartment increased with time except for the condition of 5 ma cm2 when the ph values did not change as expected at overlimiting conditions fig 2 c and d this effect was more noteworthy this may be linked to the water dissociation phenomenon characteristic of systems operated above the ilim in which water molecules are dissociated into h and oh ions at the membrane surface 34 the oh ions generated in the cem remain in the diluted compartment while the h permeate through it towards the cathodic concentrate compartment causing the drop in the ph of this solution over time in contrast the water dissociation in the anion exchange membrane aem causes the h to remain in the diluted compartment and the oh to permeate it leading to an increase in the ph of the anionic concentrate compartment the water dissociation phenomena occur more easily on aem as compared to cem 35 and that is why the ph of the diluted compartment tends to decay with time besides that when applying 10 ma cm2 fig 2b there is a shift in the behavior of the anodic concentrate curve at the time of 2 h when a sudden increase in the ph values occurred this finding agrees with what was previously discussed indicating that after this time at this current density the system starts to operate above the ilim cem favoring the water dissociation finally in all experimental conditions the ph of the diluted compartment was always below the pka value thus it can be ensured that atl was positively charged in the bulk solution during the experiments 3 3 influence of current density condition on atl transport a previous study 21 points out that the transport of charged organic molecules in electrodialysis processes is mostly driven by diffusion and is inversely proportional to the current density this would happen due to the longer experimental time achieved when lower current densities are applied and with that the molecule would have more time to diffuse however this behavior was not observed in this study the evolution of atl with time in the diluted and cathodic concentrate is shown in fig 3 all current density conditions promoted atl transport from the diluted to the concentrate compartments at underlimiting conditions when applying 5 ma cm2 there was a removal of only 7 after 4 h but this value increases up to 84 by applying 10 ma cm2 fig 3a and b at this current density as previously discussed the system shifts from under to overlimiting conditions during the electrodialysis experiment and this could improve the atl transport it looks as if when the ilim cem is reached na ions may have been depleted and the atl starts to cross the membrane faster when the system was operated at overlimiting conditions the removal of atl from the diluted compartment was almost complete fig 3c and d achieving removals of 98 and 96 when applying 15 ma cm2 and 25 ma cm2 respectively thus contrary to what the literature indicates an increase in the current density accelerates the transport of atl this finding can be confirmed by the ionic flux j calculated by the following eq 1 36 37 1 j mg c m 2 h v c t c 0 a m t where v is the volume of the compartment l c t is the final concentration mm c 0 is the initial concentration mm a m is the effective membrane area cm2 and t is the time h the ionic flux calculation is an important parameter that can be used to shed light on the fate of atl within the electrodialysis cells since the evaluated current densities were applied during different experimental times an important increment in atl ionic flux in both compartments was observed when the current density was increased table 2 it must be noted that the flux in the diluted compartment is negative according to the decreasing concentration with time by that it can be inferred that the ionic flux of atl and the applied current density are clearly related to each other despite the almost total removal of atl from the diluted compartment its concentration in the cathodic concentrate could not reach concentrations higher than 0 150 mm this difference in the mass balance between the compartments suggests that part of atl is retained in the membrane roman et al 20 indicate that positively charged pharmaceuticals can interact with iem by electrostatic forces and π π interactions promoting their strong adsorption on the membrane and therefore presenting low transport rates through them however the na ions in the solution are at a much higher concentration than atl have a smaller size and greater mobility which promotes a preferential interaction of the membrane with these ions in relation to atl as demonstrated in the ion uptake experiments this could explain how the concentration of atl in the diluted compartment drops almost to zero while in the cathodic concentrate it increases slowly the results obtained when applying 5 ma cm2 fig 3a were quite unexpected since the removal of atl in the diluted compartment 0 026 mm is smaller than the increase in concentration in the cathodic concentrate 0 086 mm this could indicate that the atl detected in the cathodic concentrate is related to a content that was initially inside the membrane matrix rather than in the central diluted compartment 3 4 dynamics of atl transport through cem since iem are subject to the occurrence of fouling poisoning when exposed to solutions containing organics an experiment with inverse polarity was carried out for this experiment the central compartment was fed with the same solution used in the concentrate ones 0 021 m na2so4 without atl and a current density of 15 ma cm2 was applied for 3 h fig s4 in supplementary material all solutions were left in the system for 72 h before the electrical current application which corresponds to the aliquot analyzed at the time of 0 h fig 4 just after the equilibration time with the na2so4 solution without the application of a current density 0 089 and 0 095 mm of atl were measured in diluted and cathodic concentrate compartments respectively this content is related to the detachment of atl that is most likely adhered by ionic interactions to the surface of the cem that separates the two compartments after applying an electric field in reversed bias the atl in the cathodic concentrate compartment migrates to the diluted one at the final time 0 338 mm of atl was detected in the diluted compartment central while in the cathodic concentrate no content was observed the difference in the values between the two compartments indicates that the atl retained inside the membrane also migrates towards the central compartment at the anodic concentrate compartment no atl was observed as expected since it is positively charged and cannot interact with the positively charged functional groups of the aem however considering that in the previous electrodialysis experiments both aem and cem from the central compartment diluted were left in equilibration with the working solution containing atl and that both membranes have the same polymeric matrix it indicates that atl molecules may link to the membrane by electrostatic interactions with the functional groups rather than by adsorption on the membrane matrix as other studies suggests 20 24 finally the detachment of the atl without the application of an electric field can possibly indicate that these electrostatic interactions with the cem functional groups are weak 38 the atl content that remains inside the membrane can easily cross it when a current density is applied again to obtain more information regarding the dynamics of atl transport through the membrane and to elucidate the reason why the mass balance between the flux of atl in the diluted and cathodic concentrate compartments did not match table 2 another singular batch of experiments was done using the cell configuration demonstrated in fig s3 in supplementary material a new set of membranes was employed in a continuous experiment in which the same condition of 15 ma cm2 was evaluated repeatedly before each cycle the membranes were left out in an equilibration time of 24 h just like in the previous experiments according to roman et al 24 positively charged drugs adsorb almost completely and immediately when in contact with iem but probably would not penetrate its polymeric structure i e the adsorption would only take place on the surface layer of the membrane however in all experiments shown in fig 5 the atl concentration decreased in the central compartment from the beginning of the experiments whereas an increase in atl concentration in the cathodic concentrate compartment could only be noticed after the third experiment conducted in sequence another study evaluated the transport of atl through iem and also found that its transport occurs only after a certain time of current application 19 this may indicate that the atl detected in the cathodic concentrate compartment is not only associated with the amount that is transported during the experiment itself but also with a content present inside the membrane due to the equilibration and previous experiments which ends up permeating the membrane with the application of an electric field as discussed before this could justify why the atl concentration in the cathodic concentrate is higher than the removal from the diluted compartment when applying 5 ma cm2 fig 3a as previously mentioned 3 5 evaluation of cem before and after experiments finally the cem that separates the diluted and the cathodic concentrate used in the continuous experiments was subjected to scanning electron microscopy analysis to characterize its morphology and identify possible changes during the process the heterogeneity of the membrane can be visualized by the random distribution of functional groups lighter spots fixed in the polymer matrix in the original membrane fig 6a 39 however when analyzing the images obtained from the membranes after use fig 6b cavities in the polymer structure were observed black dots pismenskaya et al 40 explain that these cavities may be the result of the electrochemical degradation of the polymer matrix which has its chains ruptured by the action of a high electric field and by the presence of h and oh ions generated at the membrane solution interface in overlimiting conditions the flow of the bulk solution ends up washing the surface of the membrane and removing the products of its degradation and then there is the appearance of the cavities 4 conclusions underlimiting and overlimiting conditions were evaluated towards the atl transport through a cem the decrease of atl concentration in the diluted compartment and its increase in the cathodic concentrate presents a direct relation with the applied current density confirmed by the ionic flux values it indicates that for charged atl the transport through the membrane will be mostly driven by the current density an experiment with inverse polarity revealed that atl membrane adsorption interactions are reversible and can be modulated by the imposition of an electric field it probably occurs as a result of weak electrostatic interactions between atl and the functional groups on the membrane matrix at overlimiting condition the atl removal in the diluted compartment was almost complete while at underlimiting conditions the removals were 7 and 84 by applying 5 ma cm2 and 10 ma cm2 respectively finally a difference in the mass balance between the compartments was identified during the individual experiments and in the continuous ones indicating that part of the atl sorbed on the membrane permeates in subsequent experiments with a new application of an electric field considering the data obtained in this study it is possible to state that overlimiting current condition provides better results towards atl transport through cem besides that the results obtained in this study indicates that the pharmaceuticals low concentration would no longer be an issue in the electrooxidation process and that the hybrid process would be a

the same current condition was applied repeatedly 2 4 analysis during the electrodialysis experiments the cell potential ph and conductivity of all solutions were monitored aliquots were collected at pre established times and atl concentration was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a thermo scientific dionex ics 3000 associated to a thermo scientific ultimate 3000 the equipment was fitted with a c18 dionex column 120 å 4 6 10 mm and 3 μm phosphate buffer of ph 3 and acetonitrile 40 60 were used as mobile phase with a flow rate of 0 75 ml min a sample volume of 20 μl was injected into the equipment for analysis the photodiode array detector was fixed at λ 225 nm and under these conditions the atl retention time was 2 min an analysis of the membrane morphology was performed using a scanning electron microscope phenom prox thermofisher operated at 10 kv for this purpose the membrane was placed in a sampler without prior metallization to avoid any surface modification 3 results and discussion 3 1 atl cem interaction and determination of limiting current density interactions and attractive repulsive forces between membranes and organic molecules determine their transport in electrodialysis systems to evaluate the ion exchange between the membrane used in this study and atl ion uptake experiments were carried out for that two solutions were evaluated one containing only atl and the other a mixture of atl and na2so4 in the first one the calculated loading of atl in the membrane was 0 08 meq g while in the second it was 0 03 meq g this decrease in the number of atl molecules exchanged in the membrane with the presence of na ions indicates that the na interact more easily with the membrane and therefore will be more easily transported when compared to atl this may be also associated with the fact that na ions are in much higher concentration than the atl and because they are smaller in size 21 furthermore the iec provided by the manufacturer is 2 0 meq g and the difference in the values obtained experimentally with atl may also be related to the presence of protons in solution as a function of ph adjustment what involves that not all fixed charges of the membrane can be equilibrated with atl fig 1a shows the polarization curve obtained for the cem placed in the central compartment and surrounded by the working solution at low current densities the membrane potential increases linearly with the increase in the current density value presenting a quasi ohmic behavior by increasing the current density concentration gradients develop near the membrane interface involving the dilution of ions on one side of the membrane diluted compartment and an accumulation of ions on the other cationic concentrate compartment the formation of concentration gradients is a consequence of the higher cation permeation rates through the membrane phase as compared with their motion across the bulk solution when the concentration of ions near the diluted side of the membrane approaches zero a change in the slope is observed increasing the system resistance the current density corresponding to the beginning of this limiting state named as limiting current density ilim cem appears close to 13 ma cm2 commonly a third region appears in the polarization curves which is characterized by an increase in the slope because of the activation of mass transport mechanisms typical of overlimiting conditions but in this particular case the third region cannot be seen within the evaluated voltage range after determining the ilim cem electrodialysis experiments were carried out to evaluate the atl transport at underlimiting and overlimiting conditions the experimental time was fixed at a maximum of 4 h in general the ions scarcity promoted by their migration from the diluted to adjacent compartments causes an increase in the cell potential values ucell fig 1b at underlimiting conditions a linear behavior was observed when applying 5 ma cm2 when the ucell value remained constant the same behavior was observed when applying 10 ma cm2 but only up to an experimental time of 2 h when there is a trend change with a sudden exponential increase of the ucell this could be linked to a concentration polarization effect caused by the scarcity of ions near the membrane solution interface situation in which the ilim cem is reached or also just to the gradual dilution of the central compartment regarding overlimiting conditions 15 and 25 ma cm2 ucell presented an exponential raise linked to a faster depletion of ions near the membrane surface increasing the system electric resistance notoriously 33 in these two cases the experimental time was limited by the voltage of the power supply 3 2 conductivity behavior and ph evaluation during the experiments the conductivity of aqueous solutions is an important parameter to be evaluated in the electrodialysis process it is associated with the presence of ions in solution and ensures the proper application of an electrical field within an electrodialysis cell although atl presents charge at the selected ph it does not have the ionic strength to influence the conductivity of the solution all initial solutions presented the same conductivity table 1 regardless of the presence of atl so this parameter is associated with the ionic conductivity of na and so4 2 ions besides that these two ions are in a much higher concentration than atl as discussed above when ions from the diluted compartment migrate towards the concentrate ones the process is limited by the high resistivity of the medium as expected the conductivity of the diluted compartment dropped with time reaching low values limiting the process mainly when operated under overlimiting conditions likewise the conductivity of the cathodic and anodic concentrate compartments increased not only due to the ions that migrated from the diluted compartment but also from the rinse solution flowing through the electrode compartments the solution ph is also expected to play an important role in the process considering that the atl molecule presents different charges as a function of ph to ensure that atl was positively charged an initial ph value of 6 was chosen in this study typical of natural sources of water the evolution of ph was monitored in the different compartments fig 2 the ph in the cathodic compartment decreased and in the anodic compartment increased with time except for the condition of 5 ma cm2 when the ph values did not change as expected at overlimiting conditions fig 2 c and d this effect was more noteworthy this may be linked to the water dissociation phenomenon characteristic of systems operated above the ilim in which water molecules are dissociated into h and oh ions at the membrane surface 34 the oh ions generated in the cem remain in the diluted compartment while the h permeate through it towards the cathodic concentrate compartment causing the drop in the ph of this solution over time in contrast the water dissociation in the anion exchange membrane aem causes the h to remain in the diluted compartment and the oh to permeate it leading to an increase in the ph of the anionic concentrate compartment the water dissociation phenomena occur more easily on aem as compared to cem 35 and that is why the ph of the diluted compartment tends to decay with time besides that when applying 10 ma cm2 fig 2b there is a shift in the behavior of the anodic concentrate curve at the time of 2 h when a sudden increase in the ph values occurred this finding agrees with what was previously discussed indicating that after this time at this current density the system starts to operate above the ilim cem favoring the water dissociation finally in all experimental conditions the ph of the diluted compartment was always below the pka value thus it can be ensured that atl was positively charged in the bulk solution during the experiments 3 3 influence of current density condition on atl transport a previous study 21 points out that the transport of charged organic molecules in electrodialysis processes is mostly driven by diffusion and is inversely proportional to the current density this would happen due to the longer experimental time achieved when lower current densities are applied and with that the molecule would have more time to diffuse however this behavior was not observed in this study the evolution of atl with time in the diluted and cathodic concentrate is shown in fig 3 all current density conditions promoted atl transport from the diluted to the concentrate compartments at underlimiting conditions when applying 5 ma cm2 there was a removal of only 7 after 4 h but this value increases up to 84 by applying 10 ma cm2 fig 3a and b at this current density as previously discussed the system shifts from under to overlimiting conditions during the electrodialysis experiment and this could improve the atl transport it looks as if when the ilim cem is reached na ions may have been depleted and the atl starts to cross the membrane faster when the system was operated at overlimiting conditions the removal of atl from the diluted compartment was almost complete fig 3c and d achieving removals of 98 and 96 when applying 15 ma cm2 and 25 ma cm2 respectively thus contrary to what the literature indicates an increase in the current density accelerates the transport of atl this finding can be confirmed by the ionic flux j calculated by the following eq 1 36 37 1 j mg c m 2 h v c t c 0 a m t where v is the volume of the compartment l c t is the final concentration mm c 0 is the initial concentration mm a m is the effective membrane area cm2 and t is the time h the ionic flux calculation is an important parameter that can be used to shed light on the fate of atl within the electrodialysis cells since the evaluated current densities were applied during different experimental times an important increment in atl ionic flux in both compartments was observed when the current density was increased table 2 it must be noted that the flux in the diluted compartment is negative according to the decreasing concentration with time by that it can be inferred that the ionic flux of atl and the applied current density are clearly related to each other despite the almost total removal of atl from the diluted compartment its concentration in the cathodic concentrate could not reach concentrations higher than 0 150 mm this difference in the mass balance between the compartments suggests that part of atl is retained in the membrane roman et al 20 indicate that positively charged pharmaceuticals can interact with iem by electrostatic forces and π π interactions promoting their strong adsorption on the membrane and therefore presenting low transport rates through them however the na ions in the solution are at a much higher concentration than atl have a smaller size and greater mobility which promotes a preferential interaction of the membrane with these ions in relation to atl as demonstrated in the ion uptake experiments this could explain how the concentration of atl in the diluted compartment drops almost to zero while in the cathodic concentrate it increases slowly the results obtained when applying 5 ma cm2 fig 3a were quite unexpected since the removal of atl in the diluted compartment 0 026 mm is smaller than the increase in concentration in the cathodic concentrate 0 086 mm this could indicate that the atl detected in the cathodic concentrate is related to a content that was initially inside the membrane matrix rather than in the central diluted compartment 3 4 dynamics of atl transport through cem since iem are subject to the occurrence of fouling poisoning when exposed to solutions containing organics an experiment with inverse polarity was carried out for this experiment the central compartment was fed with the same solution used in the concentrate ones 0 021 m na2so4 without atl and a current density of 15 ma cm2 was applied for 3 h fig s4 in supplementary material all solutions were left in the system for 72 h before the electrical current application which corresponds to the aliquot analyzed at the time of 0 h fig 4 just after the equilibration time with the na2so4 solution without the application of a current density 0 089 and 0 095 mm of atl were measured in diluted and cathodic concentrate compartments respectively this content is related to the detachment of atl that is most likely adhered by ionic interactions to the surface of the cem that separates the two compartments after applying an electric field in reversed bias the atl in the cathodic concentrate compartment migrates to the diluted one at the final time 0 338 mm of atl was detected in the diluted compartment central while in the cathodic concentrate no content was observed the difference in the values between the two compartments indicates that the atl retained inside the membrane also migrates towards the central compartment at the anodic concentrate compartment no atl was observed as expected since it is positively charged and cannot interact with the positively charged functional groups of the aem however considering that in the previous electrodialysis experiments both aem and cem from the central compartment diluted were left in equilibration with the working solution containing atl and that both membranes have the same polymeric matrix it indicates that atl molecules may link to the membrane by electrostatic interactions with the functional groups rather than by adsorption on the membrane matrix as other studies suggests 20 24 finally the detachment of the atl without the application of an electric field can possibly indicate that these electrostatic interactions with the cem functional groups are weak 38 the atl content that remains inside the membrane can easily cross it when a current density is applied again to obtain more information regarding the dynamics of atl transport through the membrane and to elucidate the reason why the mass balance between the flux of atl in the diluted and cathodic concentrate compartments did not match table 2 another singular batch of experiments was done using the cell configuration demonstrated in fig s3 in supplementary material a new set of membranes was employed in a continuous experiment in which the same condition of 15 ma cm2 was evaluated repeatedly before each cycle the membranes were left out in an equilibration time of 24 h just like in the previous experiments according to roman et al 24 positively charged drugs adsorb almost completely and immediately when in contact with iem but probably would not penetrate its polymeric structure i e the adsorption would only take place on the surface layer of the membrane however in all experiments shown in fig 5 the atl concentration decreased in the central compartment from the beginning of the experiments whereas an increase in atl concentration in the cathodic concentrate compartment could only be noticed after the third experiment conducted in sequence another study evaluated the transport of atl through iem and also found that its transport occurs only after a certain time of current application 19 this may indicate that the atl detected in the cathodic concentrate compartment is not only associated with the amount that is transported during the experiment itself but also with a content present inside the membrane due to the equilibration and previous experiments which ends up permeating the membrane with the application of an electric field as discussed before this could justify why the atl concentration in the cathodic concentrate is higher than the removal from the diluted compartment when applying 5 ma cm2 fig 3a as previously mentioned 3 5 evaluation of cem before and after experiments finally the cem that separates the diluted and the cathodic concentrate used in the continuous experiments was subjected to scanning electron microscopy analysis to characterize its morphology and identify possible changes during the process the heterogeneity of the membrane can be visualized by the random distribution of functional groups lighter spots fixed in the polymer matrix in the original membrane fig 6a 39 however when analyzing the images obtained from the membranes after use fig 6b cavities in the polymer structure were observed black dots pismenskaya et al 40 explain that these cavities may be the result of the electrochemical degradation of the polymer matrix which has its chains ruptured by the action of a high electric field and by the presence of h and oh ions generated at the membrane solution interface in overlimiting conditions the flow of the bulk solution ends up washing the surface of the membrane and removing the products of its degradation and then there is the appearance of the cavities 4 conclusions underlimiting and overlimiting conditions were evaluated towards the atl transport through a cem the decrease of atl concentration in the diluted compartment and its increase in the cathodic concentrate presents a direct relation with the applied current density confirmed by the ionic flux values it indicates that for charged atl the transport through the membrane will be mostly driven by the current density an experiment with inverse polarity revealed that atl membrane adsorption interactions are reversible and can be modulated by the imposition of an electric field it probably occurs as a result of weak electrostatic interactions between atl and the functional groups on the membrane matrix at overlimiting condition the atl removal in the diluted compartment was almost complete while at underlimiting conditions the removals were 7 and 84 by applying 5 ma cm2 and 10 ma cm2 respectively finally a difference in the mass balance between the compartments was identified during the individual experiments and in the continuous ones indicating that part of the atl sorbed on the membrane permeates in subsequent experiments with a new application of an electric field considering the data obtained in this study it is possible to state that overlimiting current condition provides better results towards atl transport through cem besides that the results obtained in this study indicates that the pharmaceuticals low concentration would no longer be an issue in the electrooxidation process and that the hybrid process would be a feasible strategy to treat solutions containing atl or even other pharmaceutical compounds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

12904,water sterilization efficiency is affected by water flow patterns and irradiance distribution which in turn are affected by reactor design in this study a planar flow reactor with a serpentine channel was used to treat drinking water by using 278 nm ultraviolet uv c light emitting diodes the effects of various water flow rates channel widths and baffle lengths were investigated to understand their effects on fluid mixing and flow trajectory the experimental results revealed that the uv reactor with a channel width of 13 mm exhibited the highest log inactivation value for escherichia coli among the reactors with three different channel widths this is because this width maximized the exposure time and increased the secondary flow at the turn regions in the serpentine channel furthermore the baffle length dramatically affected the flow trajectory circulation zones and microbial exposure time this length was optimized at 22 mm for all the investigated flow rates the developed uv reactor achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log for e coli at a maximum water flow rate of 80 ml min graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords uv c led planar reactor serpentine

microorganisms 6 9 mbonimpa et al 10 used mercury lamps to inactivate bacteria and viruses in water the emission spectra of these lamps were adjusted using optical filters and wavelengths above 320 nm were inefficient for escherichia coli inactivation in recent years uv light emitting diodes leds have rapidly replaced mercury lamps for microbial inactivation li et al 11 used numerical analysis to investigate flow trajectories and dose distribution in a uv reactor their results revealed that the water flow rate and uv transmittance affected the dose distribution in microorganisms xiao et al 12

et al 13 and rattanakul et al 14 used different wavelengths of uv leds to inactivate pathogenic species energy consumption differs among uv leds at different wavelengths the quantum efficiency of uv leds is strongly related to the emission wavelength 15 16 the radiative recombination efficiency decreases as the wavelength increases reactor design has a considerable effect on the fluence received by microorganisms in water because of its substantial influence on irradiance distribution and microbial exposure time cao et al 17 applied numerical simulations to investigate the water distribution inside a uv reactor a higher uv dosage was observed in baffled reactors than in unbaffled reactors because of the higher residence time of fluid particles and radiation intensity in baffled reactors long et al 18 used ansys fluent to simulate water velocities and microbial concentrations in a reactor the flow reactor without baffles exhibited the largest recirculation zones baffle arrangements

are key elements of uv reactor design increases in mixing of microbial enhanced the efficiency of the uv irradiation process aral and demirel 20 used a patented baffle to treat potable water in a contact tank the slot baffle increased mixing efficiency more efficiently than did the classical baffle which resulted in a reduction in energy consumption by the disinfection system devia orjuela et al 21 applied a flat plate baffle in a reactor for wastewater treatment this baffle enhanced the photocatalytic reaction by increasing the mixing and residence time wols et al 22 and zhang et al 23 used computational fluid dynamics to evaluate the water disinfection efficiency of ozone contactors their results revealed that vertical baffles can reduce recirculation and improve the efficiency of water disinfection according to literature radiation intensity microbial exposure time and mixing of organisms affected water disinfection efficiency of uv reactors therefore the design of the flow channel is important to improve the reactor performance on the basis of our previous study 24 a serpentine channel configuration was used in a planar flow reactor to improve the disinfection efficiency for e coli in water in contrast with parallel channel designs the serpentine channel configuration can induce secondary flow at channel turns thereby enhancing the mixing efficiency of fluid particles an increase of uv fluence for microbial inactivation was expected along the flow trajectory a numerical simulation was performed to analyze fluid motion in the serpentine channel and to improve the water disinfection performance of the reactor the effects of flow rate channel width and baffle length were investigated to optimize the efficiency of the uv reactor 2 experiments flow channel design considerably affects microbial inactivation in water however few studies have investigated flow channel designs for water disinfection reactor thus fuel cells 25 and ozone sterilization tanks 26 were used as references in designing the flow channel of the present water disinfection reactor a serpentine channel configuration was integrated into a planar uv reactor to improve the efficiency of e coli inactivation the advantages of the serpentine flow channel include increases in exposure time and fluid particle mixing which result in increases in the uv fluence for microbial inactivation flow rate channel width and baffle length substantially influence fluid motion in the flow channel 27 30 these design parameters have complex interactions and affect reactor performance for water disinfection fig 1 presents a schematic of the planar uv reactor with a four turn serpentine channel the length and width of the flow reactor were 70 and 35 mm respectively plane a preturn region and plane b turn region were selected as cross sections to analyze the velocity components of the water in the channel fig 2 presents an exploded view diagram of the planar flow reactor reactors with different channel widths c w and baffle lengths b l were produced using a three dimensional printer the uv module comprised eight uv c leds each of which had a light output power of 10 mw at a rated current of 100 ma inactivation kinetics describes the sensitivity of bacteria to uv light exposure in this study a linear first order model was used to describe the correlation between the log inactivation and the uv fluence 31 1 log n t n k fluence where n and n t indicate the number of colonies before and after uv irradiation respectively and k is the inactivation rate constant e coli ifo 3301 was used as the test strain in this study to validate the water disinfection efficiency of the developed planar flow reactor the process of e coli enumeration is described in the previous study 32 uv dose estimation for microorganisms in water can be difficult because of disordered flow trajectories along the serpentine channel the irradiance distribution is also nonuniform for microorganisms because of the limited beam angle of uv leds because the thickness of the water layer is only 10 mm uv light absorption by the water was ignored in this study the average irradiance was used to define the uv fluence for microbial inactivation a uv detector was placed 1 5 mm above the uv module to measure the irradiance on the water surface fig 3 the irradiance measurement was performed at a constant interval of 5 mm on the water surface the measurement results were used to define the average irradiance and evaluate the uv fluence 3 simulations the simulation was used to analyze the exposure time circulation zones and secondary flow in the serpentine channel the flow pattern has considerable effects on microbial inactivation the realizable k ε model was used to simulate flow fields in the serpentine channel using the ansys 33 2 ρ t ρ v 0 3 ρ v t ρ v v p τ ρg f where ρ is the water density v is the velocity and f p and τ are the turbulent dispersion force pressure and stress tensor respectively the microbial exposure time was obtained using the particle tracing method 34 4 f du dt m p dq dt in which f m p and q indicate the force mass and position of the particle respectively the newtonian formulation was used in the simulation the particle diameter was 0 5 μm 35 a total of 10 000 particles were used to simulate the particle trajectories along the serpentine channel 4 results and discussion the serpentine channel was integrated into the planar uv reactor to increase uv fluence for microbial inactivation thereby improving the reactor performance for sterilizing e coli integrating a serpentine flow channel into the uv reactor was expected to increase the microbial exposure time and the mixing efficiency of microorganisms the effects of channel width baffle length and flow rate were investigated to optimize the reactor performance 4 1 channel width fig 4 presents e coli inactivation values as a function of water flow rate e coli inactivation experiments were conducted using the planar flow reactor under three channel widths c w 7 11 and 13 mm the maximum channel width of the present flow reactor was 13 mm the effects of channel width and baffle length on microbial exposure time and secondary flow in the serpentine channel were investigated as presented in fig 4 the log inactivation decreased as the flow rate increased from 40 to 120 ml min this decrease in the log inactivation is similar for all types of uv reactors and is attributed to a decrease in exposure time fig 5 when c w 13 mm the flow reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency for e coli under various flow rates because the microbial exposure time increased as the cross sectional area of the flow channel increased the flow reactor achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log at the maximum flow rates of 80 and 51 ml min for channel widths of 13 and 11 mm respectively the maximum water disinfection flow rate increased by 36 when the channel width was increased from 11 to 13 mm when c w 7 mm the flow reactor did not achieve an inactivation of 4 0 log in the investigated flow rate range the aforementioned results were compared with those obtained for a uv reactor without a serpentine channel because of the high average water velocity and large circulation zones inside its flow channel the flow reactor without a serpentine channel exhibited a lower disinfection efficiency than did the flow reactor with a serpentine channel under all channel widths increasing the mixing of fluid particles is an efficient method for increasing uv fluence 32 36 and turn induced secondary flow enhances mixing 37 to understand the velocity components inside the serpentine channel the simulated water flow trajectory was analyzed at various channel widths fig 6 a c the water velocity decreased substantially when the channel width was increased from 7 to 13 mm the results revealed that water rotated forward along the flow channel and induced circulation zones in the turn regions especially when c w 13 mm fig 7 a c presents the water velocity in plane b for various channel widths the flow pattern depicted in fig 7 a exhibits a vortex pair in the turn region flow acceleration and deceleration induced a considerable pressure gradient between the inner and outer walls in the turn regions the pressure was higher at the outer wall than at the inner wall thus water was forced toward the inner wall moreover the sharp turn of the fluid flow induced centrifugal force which pushed the fluid toward the outer wall therefore a vortex pair developed in plane b if c w 7 mm the spanwise velocity component increased with the baffle width as presented in fig 7 b and c fig 8 a and b illustrates the development of the fluid flow in planes a and b at a flow rate of 60 ml min for plane a the velocity components v x and v y indicate the spanwise velocity and streamwise velocity of the water respectively for plane b the spanwise velocity is v y and the streamwise velocity is v x as presented in fig 8 a left the secondary flow was small in plane a an increase in channel width marginally increased the magnitude of secondary flow but also reduced the streamwise velocity the streamwise velocity fig 8 a right dominated the water velocity v b in the preturn section in the turn region the streamwise velocity exhibited significant transverse variation when c w 7 mm as presented in fig 8 b left this result is attributed to the strong vortex pair in the turn region the magnitude of the secondary flow in the turn region was almost five times higher than in the preturn section fig 8 b right the reversal in the spanwise velocity was clear when c w 7 mm and this backflow was caused by vortices along the transverse direction furthermore the secondary flow increased dramatically as the channel width increased from 7 to 13 mm fig 9 presents the fluence response curves for various channel widths different fluences were obtained by adjusting the flow rate under the same uv fluence the planar uv reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency for e coli when c w 13 mm because of the increased mixing in the turn regions in the serpentine channel with a channel width of 13 mm the reactor achieved an inactivation rate of 4 0 log at a uv fluence of 15 6 mj cm2 using the linear regression fit with a channel width of 7 mm the reactor was unable to achieve an inactivation rate of 4 0 log in the investigated flow rate range 4 2 effects of baffle length the baffle length of the serpentine channel is another key design parameter that affects fluid motion inside a planar uv reactor and thus affects the reactor performance for sterilizing microorganisms changes in baffle length substantially affect flow trajectory and microbial exposure time fig 10 presents the correlations between the exposure time and the baffle length at varying flow rates from 40 to 120 ml min the exposure time clearly increased as the baffle length was increased from 14 to 22 mm the flow reactor exhibited the longest exposure time when b l 22 mm under various flow rates when b l 22 mm the exposure time decreased as the baffle length increased increases in exposure time increased the uv fluence and thus increase the reactor performance this result is attributed to changes in flow trajectory in the serpentine channel as presented in fig 11 a d at a baffle length of 30 mm fig 11 a the fluid particles had the longest flow length from the water inlet to the outlet but also had the highest average water velocity because of flow acceleration in the turn region when b l 22 mm fig 11 b the flow reactor exhibited the lowest average water velocity at all flow rates and thus had the highest microbial exposure time the results thus indicate that the flow length and average water velocity were optimized at a baffle length of 22 mm the flow length was substantially shorter under baffle lengths of 14 and 18 mm than under a baffle length of 22 mm fig 11 c and d respectively simulations revealed that the uv reactor had the largest circulation zones in the turn regions when the baffle length was 14 mm circulation inside the flow reactor can be considered ineffective for water disinfection and thus inhibit reactor performance fig 12 presents the log inactivation as a function of baffle length at various flow rates in the experiments the reactor had a constant channel width of 13 mm the log inactivation increased as the baffle length increased from 14 to 22 mm because of the increase in the microbial exposure time when b l 22 mm the maximum log inactivation values of 4 8 4 3 4 0 and 3 6 were achieved under flow rates of 40 60 80 and 120 ml min respectively the maximum flow rate at which the water disinfection reactor achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log was 80 ml min when b l 22 mm this maximum flow rate was 2 8 times higher than that obtained using a parallel channel 24 when b l 22 mm the log inactivation decreased with the baffle length because of the increase in the average water velocity and circulation zones in the turn regions 5 conclusion in this study a planar water disinfection reactor with a serpentine channel was developed to inactivate e coli for obtaining potable water the flow rate channel width and baffle length considerably affected the fluid motion in the developed reactor the turn induced secondary flow in the serpentine channel improved the reactor performance for sterilizing e coli when c w 13 mm the planar flow reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency because of the corresponding long uv exposure time under the same uv fluence the reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency when c w 13 mm because of the increased mixing in the turn regions an optimal log inactivation was achieved with a baffle length is 22 mm because the optimal combination of flow length and average water velocity was achieved at this baffle length this combination resulted in the longest exposure time for microbial inactivation the planar flow reactor with a serpentine channel achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log for e coli at a maximum flow rate of 80 ml min under a channel width of 13 mm and a baffle length of 22 mm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

contact tank the slot baffle increased mixing efficiency more efficiently than did the classical baffle which resulted in a reduction in energy consumption by the disinfection system devia orjuela et al 21 applied a flat plate baffle in a reactor for wastewater treatment this baffle enhanced the photocatalytic reaction by increasing the mixing and residence time wols et al 22 and zhang et al 23 used computational fluid dynamics to evaluate the water disinfection efficiency of ozone contactors their results revealed that vertical baffles can reduce recirculation and improve the efficiency of water disinfection according to literature radiation intensity microbial exposure time and mixing of organisms affected water disinfection efficiency of uv reactors therefore the design of the flow channel is important to improve the reactor performance on the basis of our previous study 24 a serpentine channel configuration was used in a planar flow reactor to improve the disinfection efficiency for e coli in water in contrast with parallel channel designs the serpentine channel configuration can induce secondary flow at channel turns thereby enhancing the mixing efficiency of fluid particles an increase of uv fluence for microbial inactivation was expected along the flow trajectory a numerical simulation was performed to analyze fluid motion in the serpentine channel and to improve the water disinfection performance of the reactor the effects of flow rate channel width and baffle length were investigated to optimize the efficiency of the uv reactor 2 experiments flow channel design considerably affects microbial inactivation in water however few studies have investigated flow channel designs for water disinfection reactor thus fuel cells 25 and ozone sterilization tanks 26 were used as references in designing the flow channel of the present water disinfection reactor a serpentine channel configuration was integrated into a planar uv reactor to improve the efficiency of e coli inactivation the advantages of the serpentine flow channel include increases in exposure time and fluid particle mixing which result in increases in the uv fluence for microbial inactivation flow rate channel width and baffle length substantially influence fluid motion in the flow channel 27 30 these design parameters have complex interactions and affect reactor performance for water disinfection fig 1 presents a schematic of the planar uv reactor with a four turn serpentine channel the length and width of the flow reactor were 70 and 35 mm respectively plane a preturn region and plane b turn region were selected as cross sections to analyze the velocity components of the water in the channel fig 2 presents an exploded view diagram of the planar flow reactor reactors with different channel widths c w and baffle lengths b l were produced using a three dimensional printer the uv module comprised eight uv c leds each of which had a light output power of 10 mw at a rated current of 100 ma inactivation kinetics describes the sensitivity of bacteria to uv light exposure in this study a linear first order model was used to describe the correlation between the log inactivation and the uv fluence 31 1 log n t n k fluence where n and n t indicate the number of colonies before and after uv irradiation respectively and k is the inactivation rate constant e coli ifo 3301 was used as the test strain in this study to validate the water disinfection efficiency of the developed planar flow reactor the process of e coli enumeration is described in the previous study 32 uv dose estimation for microorganisms in water can be difficult because of disordered flow trajectories along the serpentine channel the irradiance distribution is also nonuniform for microorganisms because of the limited beam angle of uv leds because the thickness of the water layer is only 10 mm uv light absorption by the water was ignored in this study the average irradiance was used to define the uv fluence for microbial inactivation a uv detector was placed 1 5 mm above the uv module to measure the irradiance on the water surface fig 3 the irradiance measurement was performed at a constant interval of 5 mm on the water surface the measurement results were used to define the average irradiance and evaluate the uv fluence 3 simulations the simulation was used to analyze the exposure time circulation zones and secondary flow in the serpentine channel the flow pattern has considerable effects on microbial inactivation the realizable k ε model was used to simulate flow fields in the serpentine channel using the ansys 33 2 ρ t ρ v 0 3 ρ v t ρ v v p τ ρg f where ρ is the water density v is the velocity and f p and τ are the turbulent dispersion force pressure and stress tensor respectively the microbial exposure time was obtained using the particle tracing method 34 4 f du dt m p dq dt in which f m p and q indicate the force mass and position of the particle respectively the newtonian formulation was used in the simulation the particle diameter was 0 5 μm 35 a total of 10 000 particles were used to simulate the particle trajectories along the serpentine channel 4 results and discussion the serpentine channel was integrated into the planar uv reactor to increase uv fluence for microbial inactivation thereby improving the reactor performance for sterilizing e coli integrating a serpentine flow channel into the uv reactor was expected to increase the microbial exposure time and the mixing efficiency of microorganisms the effects of channel width baffle length and flow rate were investigated to optimize the reactor performance 4 1 channel width fig 4 presents e coli inactivation values as a function of water flow rate e coli inactivation experiments were conducted using the planar flow reactor under three channel widths c w 7 11 and 13 mm the maximum channel width of the present flow reactor was 13 mm the effects of channel width and baffle length on microbial exposure time and secondary flow in the serpentine channel were investigated as presented in fig 4 the log inactivation decreased as the flow rate increased from 40 to 120 ml min this decrease in the log inactivation is similar for all types of uv reactors and is attributed to a decrease in exposure time fig 5 when c w 13 mm the flow reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency for e coli under various flow rates because the microbial exposure time increased as the cross sectional area of the flow channel increased the flow reactor achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log at the maximum flow rates of 80 and 51 ml min for channel widths of 13 and 11 mm respectively the maximum water disinfection flow rate increased by 36 when the channel width was increased from 11 to 13 mm when c w 7 mm the flow reactor did not achieve an inactivation of 4 0 log in the investigated flow rate range the aforementioned results were compared with those obtained for a uv reactor without a serpentine channel because of the high average water velocity and large circulation zones inside its flow channel the flow reactor without a serpentine channel exhibited a lower disinfection efficiency than did the flow reactor with a serpentine channel under all channel widths increasing the mixing of fluid particles is an efficient method for increasing uv fluence 32 36 and turn induced secondary flow enhances mixing 37 to understand the velocity components inside the serpentine channel the simulated water flow trajectory was analyzed at various channel widths fig 6 a c the water velocity decreased substantially when the channel width was increased from 7 to 13 mm the results revealed that water rotated forward along the flow channel and induced circulation zones in the turn regions especially when c w 13 mm fig 7 a c presents the water velocity in plane b for various channel widths the flow pattern depicted in fig 7 a exhibits a vortex pair in the turn region flow acceleration and deceleration induced a considerable pressure gradient between the inner and outer walls in the turn regions the pressure was higher at the outer wall than at the inner wall thus water was forced toward the inner wall moreover the sharp turn of the fluid flow induced centrifugal force which pushed the fluid toward the outer wall therefore a vortex pair developed in plane b if c w 7 mm the spanwise velocity component increased with the baffle width as presented in fig 7 b and c fig 8 a and b illustrates the development of the fluid flow in planes a and b at a flow rate of 60 ml min for plane a the velocity components v x and v y indicate the spanwise velocity and streamwise velocity of the water respectively for plane b the spanwise velocity is v y and the streamwise velocity is v x as presented in fig 8 a left the secondary flow was small in plane a an increase in channel width marginally increased the magnitude of secondary flow but also reduced the streamwise velocity the streamwise velocity fig 8 a right dominated the water velocity v b in the preturn section in the turn region the streamwise velocity exhibited significant transverse variation when c w 7 mm as presented in fig 8 b left this result is attributed to the strong vortex pair in the turn region the magnitude of the secondary flow in the turn region was almost five times higher than in the preturn section fig 8 b right the reversal in the spanwise velocity was clear when c w 7 mm and this backflow was caused by vortices along the transverse direction furthermore the secondary flow increased dramatically as the channel width increased from 7 to 13 mm fig 9 presents the fluence response curves for various channel widths different fluences were obtained by adjusting the flow rate under the same uv fluence the planar uv reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency for e coli when c w 13 mm because of the increased mixing in the turn regions in the serpentine channel with a channel width of 13 mm the reactor achieved an inactivation rate of 4 0 log at a uv fluence of 15 6 mj cm2 using the linear regression fit with a channel width of 7 mm the reactor was unable to achieve an inactivation rate of 4 0 log in the investigated flow rate range 4 2 effects of baffle length the baffle length of the serpentine channel is another key design parameter that affects fluid motion inside a planar uv reactor and thus affects the reactor performance for sterilizing microorganisms changes in baffle length substantially affect flow trajectory and microbial exposure time fig 10 presents the correlations between the exposure time and the baffle length at varying flow rates from 40 to 120 ml min the exposure time clearly increased as the baffle length was increased from 14 to 22 mm the flow reactor exhibited the longest exposure time when b l 22 mm under various flow rates when b l 22 mm the exposure time decreased as the baffle length increased increases in exposure time increased the uv fluence and thus increase the reactor performance this result is attributed to changes in flow trajectory in the serpentine channel as presented in fig 11 a d at a baffle length of 30 mm fig 11 a the fluid particles had the longest flow length from the water inlet to the outlet but also had the highest average water velocity because of flow acceleration in the turn region when b l 22 mm fig 11 b the flow reactor exhibited the lowest average water velocity at all flow rates and thus had the highest microbial exposure time the results thus indicate that the flow length and average water velocity were optimized at a baffle length of 22 mm the flow length was substantially shorter under baffle lengths of 14 and 18 mm than under a baffle length of 22 mm fig 11 c and d respectively simulations revealed that the uv reactor had the largest circulation zones in the turn regions when the baffle length was 14 mm circulation inside the flow reactor can be considered ineffective for water disinfection and thus inhibit reactor performance fig 12 presents the log inactivation as a function of baffle length at various flow rates in the experiments the reactor had a constant channel width of 13 mm the log inactivation increased as the baffle length increased from 14 to 22 mm because of the increase in the microbial exposure time when b l 22 mm the maximum log inactivation values of 4 8 4 3 4 0 and 3 6 were achieved under flow rates of 40 60 80 and 120 ml min respectively the maximum flow rate at which the water disinfection reactor achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log was 80 ml min when b l 22 mm this maximum flow rate was 2 8 times higher than that obtained using a parallel channel 24 when b l 22 mm the log inactivation decreased with the baffle length because of the increase in the average water velocity and circulation zones in the turn regions 5 conclusion in this study a planar water disinfection reactor with a serpentine channel was developed to inactivate e coli for obtaining potable water the flow rate channel width and baffle length considerably affected the fluid motion in the developed reactor the turn induced secondary flow in the serpentine channel improved the reactor performance for sterilizing e coli when c w 13 mm the planar flow reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency because of the corresponding long uv exposure time under the same uv fluence the reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency when c w 13 mm because of the increased mixing in the turn regions an optimal log inactivation was achieved with a baffle length is 22 mm because the optimal combination of flow length and average water velocity was achieved at this baffle length this combination resulted in the longest exposure time for microbial inactivation the planar flow reactor with a serpentine channel achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log for e coli at a maximum flow rate of 80 ml min under a channel width of 13 mm and a baffle length of 22 mm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests
