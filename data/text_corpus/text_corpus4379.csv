21895,using structural control methods to suppress structural loads of offshore wind turbines is an economical and feasible solution note that the dynamic responses of offshore wind turbines are generally analyzed under the parked condition and the blades are usually modeled with a lumped mass actually the geometrical properties and rotational speed of blades can significantly affect the wind turbine performances therefore these simplifications may result in inaccurate evaluation for the wind turbine dynamic responses and then further influence the evaluation of the load mitigation effect of a control system moreover the vibration behaviors and structural responses of the wind turbine can be influenced by soil structure interaction in this work the structural responses of a bottom fixed offshore wind turbine that suffers combined wind and wave excitations are explored the blade model is explicitly established and soil structure interaction is also taken into account the dynamic responses of the wind turbine as well as the vibration mitigation effects of a single tuned mass damper stmd and a multiple tmds mtmd system are examined furthermore the sensitivity analysis for the tmd tuning frequency and the robustness of the mtmd system are investigated under the assumption that some tmds in mtmd do not work properly keywords stmd mtmd load reduction soil structure interaction parked condition normal operation condition 1 introduction in recent years offshore wind power generation has been growing rapidly all over the world due to advantages such as high quality wind resources and less visual effects aggarwal et al 2017 in order to capture more wind energy offshore wind turbines are becoming slender and taller thus leading to considerable structural vibration under complex and changeable marine environment as a result the safety and serviceability of the wind turbine system are reduced duenas osorio and basu 2008 for this structural vibration control approaches which have been widely adopted in civil buildings bigdeli and kim 2016 yamanaka and okuda 2005 lu et al 2018 are recently being applied to suppress the dynamic responses of the offshore wind turbines many kinds of vibration control devices have been developed to mitigate structural vibration of a system among them a few devices such as tuned mass dampers tmds si et al 2014 tuned liquid column dampers tlcds chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 pendulum tuned mass dampers ptmds sun and jahangiri 2018 and tuned liquid dampers tlds ha and cheong 2016 have been widely used due to their capability of improving dynamic responses of a system these control devices are adopted as passive si et al 2014 dinh and basu 2015 active fitzgerald et al 2013 fitzgerald and basu 2014 and semi active arrigan et al 2011 caterino 2015 modes among the three modes the passive control strategy is the easiest to implement and does not need external energy housner et al 1997 this method has been used by many researchers to improve the structural responses of wind turbines lackner and rotea 2011 installed a passive tmd in the nacelle to reduce the wind turbine tower top displacement in another study stewart and lackner 2013 investigated the dynamic responses of 5 mw bottom fixed and floating wind turbines coupled with tmds located in the nacelle in their research simplified models of wind turbines were proposed to optimize tmd parameters fully coupled simulations were also performed in fast sc lackner and rotea 2011 passive tmd was also presented in ref tong et al 2017 where a finite dimensional state space model of a monopile turbine tower was derived and two tmds were applied to control the wind turbine vibration moreover fitzgerald and basu 2016 developed an euler lagrangian wind turbine mathematical model to consider the structural dynamics of the wind turbine system also the interaction between the blade and the tower including a passive tmd was considered however the vibration suppression performance of a single tmd stmd system is sensitive to the frequency ratio between the tmd and the structure because of the change of frequencies of the structure or and the tmd the performance of stmd will be significantly affected in view of this igusa and xu igusa et al 1991 developed multiple tuned mass dampers mtmd to suppress the structural responses of a system with variable vibration frequencies the basic principle of mtmd is that the tuning frequencies of a certain number of small tmds are distributed around the dominant natural frequency of the controlled structure so that the mtmd system has stronger robustness abe and fujino 1994 investigated the characteristics and efficiency of mtmd by using the perturbation approach and igusa and xu 1994 solved the optimal control problem recently the mtmd system has been extended to the wind turbines to improve their structural responses such as the researches by zuo et al 2017 and hussan et al 2018 in these studies the effect of blade rotation on performances of control devices was not considered however ghassempour et al 2019 have pointed out that the dynamic behaviors of wind turbines are significantly influenced by their operational states in the dynamic response analysis of wind turbines even if it is only for the wind turbine tower the influence of blades should be considered rosales gonzalez 2016 based on the previous excellent work on tmd application to offshore wind turbines dinh and basu 2015 lackner and rotea 2011 zuo et al 2017 hussan et al 2018 ghassempour et al 2019 the emphasis of this paper is to perform a detailed investigation into the dynamic characteristics of a bottom fixed offshore wind turbine subjected to combined wind and wave loadings under the normal operational and parked conditions so as to serve as the design basis of a mtmd system as a comparison the vibration reduction effect of stmd is also provided in order to evaluate the performance of the stmd and mtmd systems a coupled simulation model of the wind turbine with soil structure interaction considered is implemented through multi body dynamics code simpack simpack 2016 based on this the present paper is organized as follows in section 2 the research objective is introduced and a coupled simulation model of the wind turbine is established combining the multi body dynamics model and the variable speed variable pitch control strategy in section 3 analysis on effect of soil structure interaction is performed section 4 evaluates the dynamic responses of the original wind turbine under selected load cases section 5 investigates the load improvement effects of both stmd and mtmd under the normal operational and parked conditions and the robustness of mtmd is also studied at last the conclusions are provided 2 simulation model of the wind turbine 2 1 research object in this work the nrel 5 mw three bladed wind turbine is studied as an example this turbine has been studied by many researchers and its properties are well defined in many previous studies jonkman et al 2009 jonkman and musial 2010 for brevity only some main structural parameters are given in this paper the detailed information can be found in refs jonkman et al 2009 jonkman and musial 2010 the diameters at the tower base and tower top are 6 m with a thickness of 0 027 m and 3 87 m with a thickness of 0 019 m respectively the tower diameter and thickness are assumed to be linearly tapered from base to top the tower base is located at a height of 10 m above the mean sea level the monopile extends from the tower base down to the seabed which is at 20 m below the mean sea level the total length of the blade is 61 5 m and the blade pitch axis passes through each airfoil section at 25 chord table 1 lists the main parameters of the wind turbine 2 2 multi body model of the wind turbine high fidelity analysis of wind turbine characteristics referring to the interaction of its aspects such as aerodynamics hydrodynamics servo and structural dynamics is needed to design wind turbines with high performance the analysis tool should be multifunctional and flexible to ensure that engineers can explore various design details and frameworks the multidisciplinary method to complicate system modeling provided by general multi body modeling tools has become an inevitable choice to solve these problems which has been confirmed by the increasing attention of academic and industrial research in this field lee and hodges 2004 recently many commercial codes can be used to perform wind turbine simulations for example simpack simpack 2016 as a widely used and known multi body tool can be applied to simulate wind turbines one of its advantages is that it can model gearbox dynamic characteristics in detail the research by li et al 2017 indicated that the gear contact in the gearbox can affect the wind turbine performances in their research the drivetrain model with one planetary stage and two parallel stages from the gearbox reliability collaborative project link et al 2011 was used and tuned for matching the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 therefore in the present work according to the previous study by one of authors jin et al 2016 a drivetrain model including a gearbox that was explored for a 5 mw bottom fixed offshore wind turbine is applied and further adjusted to match the nrel 5 mw monopile offshore wind turbine in the modeling process the flexible bodies are built by using the finite element fe method in order to decrease the degree of freedom dof number of fe models and reduce simulation time the modal superposition technique is adopted the detailed drivetrain model contains two parallel gear stages and a planetary gear stage and comprises the gear meshing stiffness during modeling in order to achieve various wind turbine simulations blades tower and drivetrain are modeled as substructures that can be conveniently replaced the topology of the complete 5 mw monopile offshore wind turbine and the gearbox model are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively 2 3 coupled simulation model in this work the environmental factors are focused on the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loadings the aerodynamic loads are calculated by using the blade element momentum bem theory manwell et al 2010 hydrodynamic loadings acting on the supporting structure are determined by using the morison s equation bossanyi 2000 note that wind and waves are assumed to be in the fore aft direction of the wind turbine in this study in order to ensure the normal operation of the turbine system a conventional variable speed variable pitch vsvp control strategy from the offshore code comparison collaboration project is applied in this work jonkman et al 2009 this strategy contains a torque controller and a pitch controller which operate independently at various operating regions of wind turbines below the rated wind speed the pitch angle is fixed at a constant value to capture the most wind energy the relationship between the generator torque and the generator speed is quadratic parabola above the rated wind speed the blade performs pitch action to stabilize power output the change of generator torque is inversely proportional to the generator speed fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the coupled simulation model 3 effect of soil structure interaction on wind turbine dynamics 3 1 modeling of soil structure interaction in previous researches foundations of wind turbines are usually regarded as rigid where the influence of soil structure interaction is not considered recently some significant studies on soil structure interaction related to wind turbines have been carried out to improve this simplification the research by murtagh et al 2005 indicated that the flexible foundation can reduce the fundamental natural frequency of wind turbines moreover in ref bush and manuel 2009 the rigid and flexible foundations were compared showing that soil structure interaction can influence the structural responses of the wind turbine therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of soil structure on the monopile wind turbine a simplified pile soil interaction model in the fore aft and side to side directions is shown in fig 4 based on the study in ref sun and jahangiri 2018 translational springs coefficients k x and k y and rotational springs coefficients k α and k β are used to present the soil structure interaction translational dash pot damper coefficients c x and c y and rotational dash pot damper coefficients c α and c β are used to present the soil damping properties according to the research by carswell et al 2015 k x and k y are set as 3 89e9 n m and k α and k β are set as 1 14e11 nm rad to present the clay soil condition soil damping properties c x c y c α and c β are selected so that the corresponding damping ratios are 0 6 sun and jahangiri 2018 3 2 analysis on effect of soil structure interaction in order to explore the influence of soil structure interaction on dynamic responses of the wind turbine twelve evaluation indicators are selected in this section these indicators are the standard deviations std and the 95th percentiles of the out of plane force and bending moment at the blade root represented by rootfx and rootmy respectively the fore aft force and bending moment at the tower top represented by yawbrfx and yawbrmy respectively and the fore aft force and bending moment at the tower base represented by twrbsfx and twrbsmy respectively the standard deviation of loads can be regarded as an easy to calculate index of fatigue and the 95th percentile load can be extrapolated to predict the ultimate loads figs 5 and 6 show respectively the time histories and the corresponding spectra of structural loads with and without considering soil structure interaction under the normal operational condition from these figures it is observed that the effect of soil structure interaction on dynamic responses of blades is relatively small this can be confirmed by fig 6 a and b in which the frequency domain responses of blade loads with and without considering the soil structure interaction are almost the same the spectra in fig 6 c f clearly illustrate that the frequency corresponding to the first tower fore aft mode is slightly lowered when the soil structure interaction is considered from 0 28 hz to 0 27 hz based on these analyses it is concluded that the soil structure interaction changes the inherent characteristics of the wind turbine system which in turn influence the dynamic responses of the wind turbine system therefore the effect of the soil structure interaction is significant to determine the tuning frequency of tmd discussed in section 5 4 system dynamics of the original wind turbine 4 1 load case setting in order to explore the dynamic behaviors of the original offshore wind turbine under normal operational and parked conditions six combined wind and wave cases are selected according to the iec 61400 3 standard iec wind turbines 2009 as shown in table 2 in the table h s and t s are the significant wave height and the wave peak spectral period respectively jonswap spectrum is applied to model the irregular sea state iec wind turbines 2009 kaimal spectrum kaimal et al 1972 is adopted to generate the turbulent wind for the parked condition a turbulent wind of 37 m s is chosen si et al 2014 the total simulation time is 800 s and the first 200 s is omitted to allow dissipation of system transient characteristics therefore the remaining 600s is in accordance with the standard procedure to consider the normal operational condition of wind turbines resor 2013 leu et al 2014 4 2 dynamic responses of the original wind turbine the normal operational cases are firstly considered the fore aft displacement shear force and bending moment at the tower top and the out of plane shear force at the blade root are analyzed in the frequency domain as shown in fig 7 from the figure nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine system are found specifically the frequencies corresponding to the dominant energy in the spectrum of the tower top fore aft displacement generally exist in the spectrum of the blade root out of plane shear force such as 0 27 hz under load case 1 this is expected because the inertial and aerodynamic loadings with respect to the rotor dynamics acting on the wind turbine tower top components which generally depending on the operational states of the turbine rotor ghassempour et al 2019 by contrary for some load cases the frequencies corresponding to the dominant energy in the spectrum of the out of plane shear force at the blade root are not present in the spectrum of the tower top fore aft displacement such as 0 2 hz corresponding to the one per revolution 1p load of blades for load case 5 many factors cause this nonlinear behavior such as the aerodynamic forces nonlinearly depended on the wind speed and the change of blade pitch angles adjusted by the control system this non linearity may invalidate the vibration suppression effect of a single tmd whose natural frequency is tuned to one certain value under some load cases which will be evaluated in section 5 additionally the linear characteristics of the wind turbine system are observed concretely all main frequencies in the frequency responses of the fore aft displacement at the tower top are reflected in the spectra of the fore aft shear force and or bending moment at the tower top which proves the linear behaviors of the tower furthermore it is observed that most of peaks in the spectra are close to 0 27 hz which corresponds to the first tower fore aft structural mode of the turbine system furthermore it can be observed from fig 7 c e that when the wind turbine operates at or above the rated wind speed the 1p and 3p blade loads are dominated in the responses of the blade root out of plane shear force and the tower top fore aft bending moment respectively the parked case i e load case 6 is further analyzed as shown in fig 7 f the peak concentrated near the first tower fore aft vibration frequency is clearly visible additionally all dominant frequencies in the spectrum of the out of plane shear force at the blade root are reflected in spectra of the fore aft shear force and bending moment at the tower top this indicates that the wind turbine system exhibits almost linear structural responses and is dominated by the first tower fore aft structural mode at the parked condition additionally it is observed from fig 7 that the frequency domain responses of variables for the wind and wave case are almost consistent with those for the only wind case this indicates that the wave excitations have little influence on wind turbine responses 5 structural responses of the wind turbine system coupled with tmds the focus of this section is to design the single tmd stmd and multiple tmds mtmd systems and to explore the dynamic responses of the wind turbine coupled with stmd mtmd 5 1 design of the stmd mtmd system tmd parameters need to be determined include the mass spring stiffness and damping constant in this paper tmd mass is set to 44000 kg accounting for approximately 5 of the total mass of the wind turbine system which is consistent with ref ghassempour et al 2019 moreover in order to control the tower vibration the natural frequency of stmd is tuned to that of the first tower fore aft mode lackner and rotea 2011 thus the parameters of stmd can be determined as shown in table 3 as a comparison various mtmd systems are designed in this work the basic principle of designing a mtmd system is to adjust the natural frequency of each tmd in mtmd to distribute around the target frequency in the present paper the assumptions of a mtmd system reported in ref nagarajaiah and sonmez 2007 are applied each tmd in a mtmd system is assumed to have the same mass and damping ratios i e m tmd1 m tmd2 m tmdn and ζ tmd1 ζ tmd2 ζ tmdn but have different spring stiffness k tmd1 k tmd2 k tmdn the total mass ratio of mtmd μ mtmd and the mass ratio of the ith tmd μ tmdi are defined as 9 μ mtmd n m tmd m total μ tmd i μ mtmd n where m total is the total mass of the controlled system the tuning value of the frequency of the ith tmd is defined as ghosh and basu 2007 10 α tmd i 1 4 ζ t 2 μ tmd i 2 ζ t 2 1 1 μ tmd i 3 where ζ t represents the damping ratio of the first tower fore aft structural mode the tuning frequency ω tmd i damping coefficient d tmd i and spring stiffness k tmd i of the ith tmd can be determined 11 ω tmd i α tmd i ω tmd i d tmd i 2 m tmd i ω tmd i ζ tmdn k tmd i m tmd i ω tmd i 2 note that ω tmd i should be between ω t 1 0 556 μ tmd and ω t 1 0 556 μ tmd igusa and xu 1994 where ω t is the natural frequency of the first tower fore aft structural mode the damping ratio of each tmd should satisfy the following condition igusa and xu 1994 12 0 77 β ζ tmd 0 556 μ tmd where β denotes the frequency spacing furthermore in the present paper in order to explore the effect of the number of tmds in mtmd on the vibration suppression performance three mtmd systems are proposed as shown in table 3 in the table 2 mtmd 6 mtmd and 10 mtmd present that the numbers of tmds in the mtmd system are 2 6 and 10 respectively fig 8 shows the top view of various tmd arrangements in the nacelle for stmd its volume is about 5 6 m3 assuming that the mass block of tmd is comprised of steel material density is 7850 kg m3 which only accounts for approximately 0 9 of the nacelle space therefore based on the perspective of volume requirements it can be regarded as a feasible tmd dimension note that for brevity the interaction between the tmds and the components such as the gearbox is not considered when the tmds are installed in the nacelle 5 2 dynamic response of the wind turbine coupled with tmds in this section the evaluation indices used to examine the effect of soil structure interaction in section 3 2 are again applied to evaluate the load reduction effect of different tmd arrangements figs 9 and 10 show respectively the percent improvement of the standard deviation std and the 95th percentile of structural loads with various tmd arrangements for six load cases note that in the two figures the negative values mean that the results with tmd control are larger than those without tmd in view of simplicity two time domain results load case 3 and load case 6 are exhibited as shown in figs 11 and 12 moreover in order to further investigate the vibration suppression effect of tmd the corresponding frequency domain responses are provided as shown in figs 13 and 14 based on these figures some remarks are presented as following firstly stmd mtmd can generally suppress the standard deviation and the 95th percentile of structural loads but the control effect on the former is better particularly the improvement percentages of the tower base loads are generally larger than those of other loads on the contrary stmd mtmd has negligible control effects on the blade structural response as shown in figs 11 and 12 the curves with different tmd arrangements are almost coincident with the curve with no tmd control this indicates that an additional control approach is needed to suppress the blade vibration based on this the suppression effect of stmd mtmd on the tower top fore aft bending moment which is related to the blade load is limited secondly the percentages of improvement in evaluation indices by stmd mtmd under the parked condition load case 6 are larger than those under the normal operational cases as shown in fig 14 the peaks at the tower first fore aft vibration mode are significantly lowered by stmd mtmd it can be known that the operational states of the wind turbine can influence the control effect of tmd thirdly when comparing the results of stmd and mtmd it is interesting to find out that the load mitigation effect of mtmd is significant than that of stmd which is consistent with other findings as observed in the dynamic responses of the original wind turbine discussed in section 4 2 the wind turbine exhibits nonlinear characteristics when it is in the normal operational state specifically the vibration energy is not concentrated at a single frequency due to the influence of the wind turbine operational states stmd can only be tuned to one specific frequency to suppress the corresponding vibration thus exhibiting a limited performance due to the nonlinear characteristics of the normal operating wind turbine fourthly it is observed that the load inhibition effects of mtmd generally become better with the increase of the number of tmd especially for the parked condition note that the vibration control effects of 6 mtmd and10 mtmd are slightly improved compared with the 2 mtmd case and even become worse for some loads such as the tower base bending moment under load case 5 as shown in figs 9 e and 10 e fifthly it can be found that the energy component of dynamic responses of the system at the low frequency region gradually increases with the increase of the wave peak spectral period and the mean wind speed while the tmd system is tuned for the first tower fore aft mode 0 27hz the broadband excitation of the waves and wind at low frequency region significantly impacts the structural responses and therefore the effects of stmd mtmd are modest as shown in fig 11 the differences among time histories of structural loads with various tmd configurations are small this observation highlights a problem with the passive tmd system and also motivates the potential of an active control approach sixthly it can be found from figs 13 and 14 that due to the application of stmd mtmd the natural frequency of the tower first fore aft mode is lowered compared with the case without tmd on the contrary the rotational frequency of the rotor is not changed which once again shows the necessity of the blade vibration control method for the sake of simplicity only the displacement time histories of the 2 mtmd system under the parked condition are provided as shown in fig 15 it is observed that tmds move around its original position like a high frequency damper 5 3 sensitivity analysis for the tmd tuning frequency in order to study the sensitivity of tuning frequencies of tmd additional eight tuning frequencies i e 0 10 hz 0 15 hz 0 20 hz 0 24hz 0 37hz 0 48hz 0 58 hz and 0 72hz are selected these frequencies are chosen as to encompass the frequency scope of interest in fig 7 note that for brevity of this paper the sensitivity analysis is performed only for the stmd case for the mtmd case the conclusions are similar the following figures i e figs 16 and 17 show the sensitivity analysis results for different tmd tuning frequencies from figs 16 and 17 a first significant observation is that the tower top fore aft bending moment the blade root out of plane shear force and the lade root out of plane bending moment are slightly affected by various tmd tuning frequencies because the frequency contents of these variables are not changed due to the application of tmd in addition the load reduction performances of tmd are good at some tuning frequencies but are not effective at some others due to different operational states of the wind turbine for example the tmd performs well when its frequency is tuned to 0 37 hz for load case 1 0 24 hz for load case 3 and 0 20 hz for load case 5 note that due to the tuning frequency 0 24 hz is very close to the natural frequency of the main structure therefore this tuning frequency also exhibits relatively significant vibration control performance moreover the maximum load suppression ratios are not the same for various tmd frequencies under the normal operational conditions however when the natural frequency of tmd is tuned to 0 48 hz 0 58hz and 0 72 hz respectively the performance of tmd is generally negative these frequencies are mainly reflected in the spectra of the tower top fore aft bending moment and not are reflected in the spectra of the tower top fore aft displacement as shown in fig 7 5 4 robust performance of the mtmd system for the stmd system its vibration suppression performance will be considerably affected when tmd cannot work properly if a single large tmd is split into multiple small tmds vibration mitigation performance of the tmd system may not be significantly affected when one or more tmds lose their functions in this section some tmds are simulated as not working properly to evaluate the robust performance of the designed mtmd system in this section the robustness of the 10 mtmd system is investigated for the sake of generality five failure cases of mtmd are taken into account as shown in table 4 in case 1 tmd1 is assumed to be invalid in case 2 tmd2 and tmd10 do not work well in case 3 tmd1 tmd2 and tmd3 lose their functions in case 4 tmd4 tmd5 tmd6 and tmd7 are malfunctioning in case 5 tmd6 tmd7 tmd8 tmd9 and tmd10 cannot work well in the research on the robustness of mtmd the masses of disabled tmds will be retained and are fixed at their original positions zuo et al 2017 for brevity when investigating the robustness of mtmd only the standard deviation and the 95th percentile of tower base bending moments under load case 4 and 6 are considered fig 18 shows the load improvement percentage from the case without tmd for different tmd failure conditions under two load cases fig 19 shows comparisons of time domain and frequency domain results under various failure cases as a comparison the results with well functioning 10 mtmd and without tmd control are also provided combining the above figures some remarks can be concluded overall the load reduction performance of the mtmd system with failure tmds decreases with the increase of the number of failed tmds which is expected because the functions of some tmds are disabled note that considering the effect of other tmds that still work properly the amplitudes of structural responses are still smaller than the case without tmd as shown in fig 19 however the specific representations under the two load cases are different in detail under the parked condition the load reduction performance of the mtmd system with failure tmds decreases continually with the increase of the number of failed tmds which is related to the linear behaviors of the parked wind turbine however under load case 4 the normal operation condition nonlinear characteristics between the performance of mtmd with failure tmds and the number of failure tmds can be observed particularly the load reduction effect of mtmd with failure tmds improves for some failure cases failure cases 1 and 2 these results show the significant robustness of the mtmd system 6 conclusions in this work stmd and mtmd systems are used to mitigate the structural vibration of the monopile offshore wind turbine subjected to combined effects of wind and wave loadings under the normal power production and the parked conditions in order to accurately evaluate the wind turbine dynamic responses and the vibration control effect of stmd and mtmd a detailed wind turbine model with soil structure interaction included is built then the influences of soil structure interaction on dynamic responses of the wind turbine are analyzed based on the natural frequency analysis of the wind turbine the tuning frequencies of stmd and mtmd are determined the vibration control effects of the designed tmd systems are then evaluated under different load cases through comparing the case without tmd moreover the robust performance of the 10 mtmd system is investigated based on the simulation results some conclusions are obtained as follows 1 the natural frequency of the tower is lowered when the soil structure interaction is taken into account on the contrary the soil structure interaction has little effect on the natural frequency of the blade therefore the effect of soil structure interaction on blade responses is less than that on tower base responses 2 when the wind turbine operates normally it exhibits nonlinear behaviors because of many factors such as the aerodynamic forces nonlinearly depended on the wind speed and the change of blade pitch angles adjusted by the control system 3 generally the suppression effect of stmd mtmd on the standard deviation of structural loads is better than that on the 95th percentile loads in addition stmd mtmd can effectively mitigate the tower base loads but has negligible control effects on the blade structural responses which indicates the necessity of controlling blade vibrations moreover the vibration mitigation effect of mtmd is better compared with stmd 4 due to the nonlinear characteristics of the operating wind turbine the load improvement effects of stmd mtmd under the normal operational condition are less than those under the parked condition moreover the optimal tuning frequency of tmd should be adjusted for various operational conditions of the wind turbine 5 the load inhibition performances of mtmd generally become better with the increase of the number of tmd especially for the parked condition note that the vibration control effects of 6 mtmd and10 mtmd are only slightly improved compared with those of 2 mtmd particularly the 10 mtmd system exhibits significant robust performance when some tmds are assumed to be invalid especially under the parked condition 6 generally the passive tmd has considerable effects for mitigating the structural responses because of the vibration of structural modes but not because of the broadband external loadings when the structural loading spectrum is dominated by the vibration of structural modes or when the structural mode coincides with the main energy of the external excitation passive tmd can provide significant vibration suppression effect otherwise the effectiveness of passive tmd will be limited it is worth pointing out that the interaction between the tmds and the components such as the gearbox in the nacelle is not considered in this paper if considering this the nacelle configuration needs to be re designed which will be discussed in the future research additionally an active structural control method will also be investigated in the future work acknowledgment this paper is sponsored by national natural science foundation of china approval no 51975066 
21895,using structural control methods to suppress structural loads of offshore wind turbines is an economical and feasible solution note that the dynamic responses of offshore wind turbines are generally analyzed under the parked condition and the blades are usually modeled with a lumped mass actually the geometrical properties and rotational speed of blades can significantly affect the wind turbine performances therefore these simplifications may result in inaccurate evaluation for the wind turbine dynamic responses and then further influence the evaluation of the load mitigation effect of a control system moreover the vibration behaviors and structural responses of the wind turbine can be influenced by soil structure interaction in this work the structural responses of a bottom fixed offshore wind turbine that suffers combined wind and wave excitations are explored the blade model is explicitly established and soil structure interaction is also taken into account the dynamic responses of the wind turbine as well as the vibration mitigation effects of a single tuned mass damper stmd and a multiple tmds mtmd system are examined furthermore the sensitivity analysis for the tmd tuning frequency and the robustness of the mtmd system are investigated under the assumption that some tmds in mtmd do not work properly keywords stmd mtmd load reduction soil structure interaction parked condition normal operation condition 1 introduction in recent years offshore wind power generation has been growing rapidly all over the world due to advantages such as high quality wind resources and less visual effects aggarwal et al 2017 in order to capture more wind energy offshore wind turbines are becoming slender and taller thus leading to considerable structural vibration under complex and changeable marine environment as a result the safety and serviceability of the wind turbine system are reduced duenas osorio and basu 2008 for this structural vibration control approaches which have been widely adopted in civil buildings bigdeli and kim 2016 yamanaka and okuda 2005 lu et al 2018 are recently being applied to suppress the dynamic responses of the offshore wind turbines many kinds of vibration control devices have been developed to mitigate structural vibration of a system among them a few devices such as tuned mass dampers tmds si et al 2014 tuned liquid column dampers tlcds chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 pendulum tuned mass dampers ptmds sun and jahangiri 2018 and tuned liquid dampers tlds ha and cheong 2016 have been widely used due to their capability of improving dynamic responses of a system these control devices are adopted as passive si et al 2014 dinh and basu 2015 active fitzgerald et al 2013 fitzgerald and basu 2014 and semi active arrigan et al 2011 caterino 2015 modes among the three modes the passive control strategy is the easiest to implement and does not need external energy housner et al 1997 this method has been used by many researchers to improve the structural responses of wind turbines lackner and rotea 2011 installed a passive tmd in the nacelle to reduce the wind turbine tower top displacement in another study stewart and lackner 2013 investigated the dynamic responses of 5 mw bottom fixed and floating wind turbines coupled with tmds located in the nacelle in their research simplified models of wind turbines were proposed to optimize tmd parameters fully coupled simulations were also performed in fast sc lackner and rotea 2011 passive tmd was also presented in ref tong et al 2017 where a finite dimensional state space model of a monopile turbine tower was derived and two tmds were applied to control the wind turbine vibration moreover fitzgerald and basu 2016 developed an euler lagrangian wind turbine mathematical model to consider the structural dynamics of the wind turbine system also the interaction between the blade and the tower including a passive tmd was considered however the vibration suppression performance of a single tmd stmd system is sensitive to the frequency ratio between the tmd and the structure because of the change of frequencies of the structure or and the tmd the performance of stmd will be significantly affected in view of this igusa and xu igusa et al 1991 developed multiple tuned mass dampers mtmd to suppress the structural responses of a system with variable vibration frequencies the basic principle of mtmd is that the tuning frequencies of a certain number of small tmds are distributed around the dominant natural frequency of the controlled structure so that the mtmd system has stronger robustness abe and fujino 1994 investigated the characteristics and efficiency of mtmd by using the perturbation approach and igusa and xu 1994 solved the optimal control problem recently the mtmd system has been extended to the wind turbines to improve their structural responses such as the researches by zuo et al 2017 and hussan et al 2018 in these studies the effect of blade rotation on performances of control devices was not considered however ghassempour et al 2019 have pointed out that the dynamic behaviors of wind turbines are significantly influenced by their operational states in the dynamic response analysis of wind turbines even if it is only for the wind turbine tower the influence of blades should be considered rosales gonzalez 2016 based on the previous excellent work on tmd application to offshore wind turbines dinh and basu 2015 lackner and rotea 2011 zuo et al 2017 hussan et al 2018 ghassempour et al 2019 the emphasis of this paper is to perform a detailed investigation into the dynamic characteristics of a bottom fixed offshore wind turbine subjected to combined wind and wave loadings under the normal operational and parked conditions so as to serve as the design basis of a mtmd system as a comparison the vibration reduction effect of stmd is also provided in order to evaluate the performance of the stmd and mtmd systems a coupled simulation model of the wind turbine with soil structure interaction considered is implemented through multi body dynamics code simpack simpack 2016 based on this the present paper is organized as follows in section 2 the research objective is introduced and a coupled simulation model of the wind turbine is established combining the multi body dynamics model and the variable speed variable pitch control strategy in section 3 analysis on effect of soil structure interaction is performed section 4 evaluates the dynamic responses of the original wind turbine under selected load cases section 5 investigates the load improvement effects of both stmd and mtmd under the normal operational and parked conditions and the robustness of mtmd is also studied at last the conclusions are provided 2 simulation model of the wind turbine 2 1 research object in this work the nrel 5 mw three bladed wind turbine is studied as an example this turbine has been studied by many researchers and its properties are well defined in many previous studies jonkman et al 2009 jonkman and musial 2010 for brevity only some main structural parameters are given in this paper the detailed information can be found in refs jonkman et al 2009 jonkman and musial 2010 the diameters at the tower base and tower top are 6 m with a thickness of 0 027 m and 3 87 m with a thickness of 0 019 m respectively the tower diameter and thickness are assumed to be linearly tapered from base to top the tower base is located at a height of 10 m above the mean sea level the monopile extends from the tower base down to the seabed which is at 20 m below the mean sea level the total length of the blade is 61 5 m and the blade pitch axis passes through each airfoil section at 25 chord table 1 lists the main parameters of the wind turbine 2 2 multi body model of the wind turbine high fidelity analysis of wind turbine characteristics referring to the interaction of its aspects such as aerodynamics hydrodynamics servo and structural dynamics is needed to design wind turbines with high performance the analysis tool should be multifunctional and flexible to ensure that engineers can explore various design details and frameworks the multidisciplinary method to complicate system modeling provided by general multi body modeling tools has become an inevitable choice to solve these problems which has been confirmed by the increasing attention of academic and industrial research in this field lee and hodges 2004 recently many commercial codes can be used to perform wind turbine simulations for example simpack simpack 2016 as a widely used and known multi body tool can be applied to simulate wind turbines one of its advantages is that it can model gearbox dynamic characteristics in detail the research by li et al 2017 indicated that the gear contact in the gearbox can affect the wind turbine performances in their research the drivetrain model with one planetary stage and two parallel stages from the gearbox reliability collaborative project link et al 2011 was used and tuned for matching the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 therefore in the present work according to the previous study by one of authors jin et al 2016 a drivetrain model including a gearbox that was explored for a 5 mw bottom fixed offshore wind turbine is applied and further adjusted to match the nrel 5 mw monopile offshore wind turbine in the modeling process the flexible bodies are built by using the finite element fe method in order to decrease the degree of freedom dof number of fe models and reduce simulation time the modal superposition technique is adopted the detailed drivetrain model contains two parallel gear stages and a planetary gear stage and comprises the gear meshing stiffness during modeling in order to achieve various wind turbine simulations blades tower and drivetrain are modeled as substructures that can be conveniently replaced the topology of the complete 5 mw monopile offshore wind turbine and the gearbox model are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively 2 3 coupled simulation model in this work the environmental factors are focused on the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loadings the aerodynamic loads are calculated by using the blade element momentum bem theory manwell et al 2010 hydrodynamic loadings acting on the supporting structure are determined by using the morison s equation bossanyi 2000 note that wind and waves are assumed to be in the fore aft direction of the wind turbine in this study in order to ensure the normal operation of the turbine system a conventional variable speed variable pitch vsvp control strategy from the offshore code comparison collaboration project is applied in this work jonkman et al 2009 this strategy contains a torque controller and a pitch controller which operate independently at various operating regions of wind turbines below the rated wind speed the pitch angle is fixed at a constant value to capture the most wind energy the relationship between the generator torque and the generator speed is quadratic parabola above the rated wind speed the blade performs pitch action to stabilize power output the change of generator torque is inversely proportional to the generator speed fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the coupled simulation model 3 effect of soil structure interaction on wind turbine dynamics 3 1 modeling of soil structure interaction in previous researches foundations of wind turbines are usually regarded as rigid where the influence of soil structure interaction is not considered recently some significant studies on soil structure interaction related to wind turbines have been carried out to improve this simplification the research by murtagh et al 2005 indicated that the flexible foundation can reduce the fundamental natural frequency of wind turbines moreover in ref bush and manuel 2009 the rigid and flexible foundations were compared showing that soil structure interaction can influence the structural responses of the wind turbine therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of soil structure on the monopile wind turbine a simplified pile soil interaction model in the fore aft and side to side directions is shown in fig 4 based on the study in ref sun and jahangiri 2018 translational springs coefficients k x and k y and rotational springs coefficients k α and k β are used to present the soil structure interaction translational dash pot damper coefficients c x and c y and rotational dash pot damper coefficients c α and c β are used to present the soil damping properties according to the research by carswell et al 2015 k x and k y are set as 3 89e9 n m and k α and k β are set as 1 14e11 nm rad to present the clay soil condition soil damping properties c x c y c α and c β are selected so that the corresponding damping ratios are 0 6 sun and jahangiri 2018 3 2 analysis on effect of soil structure interaction in order to explore the influence of soil structure interaction on dynamic responses of the wind turbine twelve evaluation indicators are selected in this section these indicators are the standard deviations std and the 95th percentiles of the out of plane force and bending moment at the blade root represented by rootfx and rootmy respectively the fore aft force and bending moment at the tower top represented by yawbrfx and yawbrmy respectively and the fore aft force and bending moment at the tower base represented by twrbsfx and twrbsmy respectively the standard deviation of loads can be regarded as an easy to calculate index of fatigue and the 95th percentile load can be extrapolated to predict the ultimate loads figs 5 and 6 show respectively the time histories and the corresponding spectra of structural loads with and without considering soil structure interaction under the normal operational condition from these figures it is observed that the effect of soil structure interaction on dynamic responses of blades is relatively small this can be confirmed by fig 6 a and b in which the frequency domain responses of blade loads with and without considering the soil structure interaction are almost the same the spectra in fig 6 c f clearly illustrate that the frequency corresponding to the first tower fore aft mode is slightly lowered when the soil structure interaction is considered from 0 28 hz to 0 27 hz based on these analyses it is concluded that the soil structure interaction changes the inherent characteristics of the wind turbine system which in turn influence the dynamic responses of the wind turbine system therefore the effect of the soil structure interaction is significant to determine the tuning frequency of tmd discussed in section 5 4 system dynamics of the original wind turbine 4 1 load case setting in order to explore the dynamic behaviors of the original offshore wind turbine under normal operational and parked conditions six combined wind and wave cases are selected according to the iec 61400 3 standard iec wind turbines 2009 as shown in table 2 in the table h s and t s are the significant wave height and the wave peak spectral period respectively jonswap spectrum is applied to model the irregular sea state iec wind turbines 2009 kaimal spectrum kaimal et al 1972 is adopted to generate the turbulent wind for the parked condition a turbulent wind of 37 m s is chosen si et al 2014 the total simulation time is 800 s and the first 200 s is omitted to allow dissipation of system transient characteristics therefore the remaining 600s is in accordance with the standard procedure to consider the normal operational condition of wind turbines resor 2013 leu et al 2014 4 2 dynamic responses of the original wind turbine the normal operational cases are firstly considered the fore aft displacement shear force and bending moment at the tower top and the out of plane shear force at the blade root are analyzed in the frequency domain as shown in fig 7 from the figure nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine system are found specifically the frequencies corresponding to the dominant energy in the spectrum of the tower top fore aft displacement generally exist in the spectrum of the blade root out of plane shear force such as 0 27 hz under load case 1 this is expected because the inertial and aerodynamic loadings with respect to the rotor dynamics acting on the wind turbine tower top components which generally depending on the operational states of the turbine rotor ghassempour et al 2019 by contrary for some load cases the frequencies corresponding to the dominant energy in the spectrum of the out of plane shear force at the blade root are not present in the spectrum of the tower top fore aft displacement such as 0 2 hz corresponding to the one per revolution 1p load of blades for load case 5 many factors cause this nonlinear behavior such as the aerodynamic forces nonlinearly depended on the wind speed and the change of blade pitch angles adjusted by the control system this non linearity may invalidate the vibration suppression effect of a single tmd whose natural frequency is tuned to one certain value under some load cases which will be evaluated in section 5 additionally the linear characteristics of the wind turbine system are observed concretely all main frequencies in the frequency responses of the fore aft displacement at the tower top are reflected in the spectra of the fore aft shear force and or bending moment at the tower top which proves the linear behaviors of the tower furthermore it is observed that most of peaks in the spectra are close to 0 27 hz which corresponds to the first tower fore aft structural mode of the turbine system furthermore it can be observed from fig 7 c e that when the wind turbine operates at or above the rated wind speed the 1p and 3p blade loads are dominated in the responses of the blade root out of plane shear force and the tower top fore aft bending moment respectively the parked case i e load case 6 is further analyzed as shown in fig 7 f the peak concentrated near the first tower fore aft vibration frequency is clearly visible additionally all dominant frequencies in the spectrum of the out of plane shear force at the blade root are reflected in spectra of the fore aft shear force and bending moment at the tower top this indicates that the wind turbine system exhibits almost linear structural responses and is dominated by the first tower fore aft structural mode at the parked condition additionally it is observed from fig 7 that the frequency domain responses of variables for the wind and wave case are almost consistent with those for the only wind case this indicates that the wave excitations have little influence on wind turbine responses 5 structural responses of the wind turbine system coupled with tmds the focus of this section is to design the single tmd stmd and multiple tmds mtmd systems and to explore the dynamic responses of the wind turbine coupled with stmd mtmd 5 1 design of the stmd mtmd system tmd parameters need to be determined include the mass spring stiffness and damping constant in this paper tmd mass is set to 44000 kg accounting for approximately 5 of the total mass of the wind turbine system which is consistent with ref ghassempour et al 2019 moreover in order to control the tower vibration the natural frequency of stmd is tuned to that of the first tower fore aft mode lackner and rotea 2011 thus the parameters of stmd can be determined as shown in table 3 as a comparison various mtmd systems are designed in this work the basic principle of designing a mtmd system is to adjust the natural frequency of each tmd in mtmd to distribute around the target frequency in the present paper the assumptions of a mtmd system reported in ref nagarajaiah and sonmez 2007 are applied each tmd in a mtmd system is assumed to have the same mass and damping ratios i e m tmd1 m tmd2 m tmdn and ζ tmd1 ζ tmd2 ζ tmdn but have different spring stiffness k tmd1 k tmd2 k tmdn the total mass ratio of mtmd μ mtmd and the mass ratio of the ith tmd μ tmdi are defined as 9 μ mtmd n m tmd m total μ tmd i μ mtmd n where m total is the total mass of the controlled system the tuning value of the frequency of the ith tmd is defined as ghosh and basu 2007 10 α tmd i 1 4 ζ t 2 μ tmd i 2 ζ t 2 1 1 μ tmd i 3 where ζ t represents the damping ratio of the first tower fore aft structural mode the tuning frequency ω tmd i damping coefficient d tmd i and spring stiffness k tmd i of the ith tmd can be determined 11 ω tmd i α tmd i ω tmd i d tmd i 2 m tmd i ω tmd i ζ tmdn k tmd i m tmd i ω tmd i 2 note that ω tmd i should be between ω t 1 0 556 μ tmd and ω t 1 0 556 μ tmd igusa and xu 1994 where ω t is the natural frequency of the first tower fore aft structural mode the damping ratio of each tmd should satisfy the following condition igusa and xu 1994 12 0 77 β ζ tmd 0 556 μ tmd where β denotes the frequency spacing furthermore in the present paper in order to explore the effect of the number of tmds in mtmd on the vibration suppression performance three mtmd systems are proposed as shown in table 3 in the table 2 mtmd 6 mtmd and 10 mtmd present that the numbers of tmds in the mtmd system are 2 6 and 10 respectively fig 8 shows the top view of various tmd arrangements in the nacelle for stmd its volume is about 5 6 m3 assuming that the mass block of tmd is comprised of steel material density is 7850 kg m3 which only accounts for approximately 0 9 of the nacelle space therefore based on the perspective of volume requirements it can be regarded as a feasible tmd dimension note that for brevity the interaction between the tmds and the components such as the gearbox is not considered when the tmds are installed in the nacelle 5 2 dynamic response of the wind turbine coupled with tmds in this section the evaluation indices used to examine the effect of soil structure interaction in section 3 2 are again applied to evaluate the load reduction effect of different tmd arrangements figs 9 and 10 show respectively the percent improvement of the standard deviation std and the 95th percentile of structural loads with various tmd arrangements for six load cases note that in the two figures the negative values mean that the results with tmd control are larger than those without tmd in view of simplicity two time domain results load case 3 and load case 6 are exhibited as shown in figs 11 and 12 moreover in order to further investigate the vibration suppression effect of tmd the corresponding frequency domain responses are provided as shown in figs 13 and 14 based on these figures some remarks are presented as following firstly stmd mtmd can generally suppress the standard deviation and the 95th percentile of structural loads but the control effect on the former is better particularly the improvement percentages of the tower base loads are generally larger than those of other loads on the contrary stmd mtmd has negligible control effects on the blade structural response as shown in figs 11 and 12 the curves with different tmd arrangements are almost coincident with the curve with no tmd control this indicates that an additional control approach is needed to suppress the blade vibration based on this the suppression effect of stmd mtmd on the tower top fore aft bending moment which is related to the blade load is limited secondly the percentages of improvement in evaluation indices by stmd mtmd under the parked condition load case 6 are larger than those under the normal operational cases as shown in fig 14 the peaks at the tower first fore aft vibration mode are significantly lowered by stmd mtmd it can be known that the operational states of the wind turbine can influence the control effect of tmd thirdly when comparing the results of stmd and mtmd it is interesting to find out that the load mitigation effect of mtmd is significant than that of stmd which is consistent with other findings as observed in the dynamic responses of the original wind turbine discussed in section 4 2 the wind turbine exhibits nonlinear characteristics when it is in the normal operational state specifically the vibration energy is not concentrated at a single frequency due to the influence of the wind turbine operational states stmd can only be tuned to one specific frequency to suppress the corresponding vibration thus exhibiting a limited performance due to the nonlinear characteristics of the normal operating wind turbine fourthly it is observed that the load inhibition effects of mtmd generally become better with the increase of the number of tmd especially for the parked condition note that the vibration control effects of 6 mtmd and10 mtmd are slightly improved compared with the 2 mtmd case and even become worse for some loads such as the tower base bending moment under load case 5 as shown in figs 9 e and 10 e fifthly it can be found that the energy component of dynamic responses of the system at the low frequency region gradually increases with the increase of the wave peak spectral period and the mean wind speed while the tmd system is tuned for the first tower fore aft mode 0 27hz the broadband excitation of the waves and wind at low frequency region significantly impacts the structural responses and therefore the effects of stmd mtmd are modest as shown in fig 11 the differences among time histories of structural loads with various tmd configurations are small this observation highlights a problem with the passive tmd system and also motivates the potential of an active control approach sixthly it can be found from figs 13 and 14 that due to the application of stmd mtmd the natural frequency of the tower first fore aft mode is lowered compared with the case without tmd on the contrary the rotational frequency of the rotor is not changed which once again shows the necessity of the blade vibration control method for the sake of simplicity only the displacement time histories of the 2 mtmd system under the parked condition are provided as shown in fig 15 it is observed that tmds move around its original position like a high frequency damper 5 3 sensitivity analysis for the tmd tuning frequency in order to study the sensitivity of tuning frequencies of tmd additional eight tuning frequencies i e 0 10 hz 0 15 hz 0 20 hz 0 24hz 0 37hz 0 48hz 0 58 hz and 0 72hz are selected these frequencies are chosen as to encompass the frequency scope of interest in fig 7 note that for brevity of this paper the sensitivity analysis is performed only for the stmd case for the mtmd case the conclusions are similar the following figures i e figs 16 and 17 show the sensitivity analysis results for different tmd tuning frequencies from figs 16 and 17 a first significant observation is that the tower top fore aft bending moment the blade root out of plane shear force and the lade root out of plane bending moment are slightly affected by various tmd tuning frequencies because the frequency contents of these variables are not changed due to the application of tmd in addition the load reduction performances of tmd are good at some tuning frequencies but are not effective at some others due to different operational states of the wind turbine for example the tmd performs well when its frequency is tuned to 0 37 hz for load case 1 0 24 hz for load case 3 and 0 20 hz for load case 5 note that due to the tuning frequency 0 24 hz is very close to the natural frequency of the main structure therefore this tuning frequency also exhibits relatively significant vibration control performance moreover the maximum load suppression ratios are not the same for various tmd frequencies under the normal operational conditions however when the natural frequency of tmd is tuned to 0 48 hz 0 58hz and 0 72 hz respectively the performance of tmd is generally negative these frequencies are mainly reflected in the spectra of the tower top fore aft bending moment and not are reflected in the spectra of the tower top fore aft displacement as shown in fig 7 5 4 robust performance of the mtmd system for the stmd system its vibration suppression performance will be considerably affected when tmd cannot work properly if a single large tmd is split into multiple small tmds vibration mitigation performance of the tmd system may not be significantly affected when one or more tmds lose their functions in this section some tmds are simulated as not working properly to evaluate the robust performance of the designed mtmd system in this section the robustness of the 10 mtmd system is investigated for the sake of generality five failure cases of mtmd are taken into account as shown in table 4 in case 1 tmd1 is assumed to be invalid in case 2 tmd2 and tmd10 do not work well in case 3 tmd1 tmd2 and tmd3 lose their functions in case 4 tmd4 tmd5 tmd6 and tmd7 are malfunctioning in case 5 tmd6 tmd7 tmd8 tmd9 and tmd10 cannot work well in the research on the robustness of mtmd the masses of disabled tmds will be retained and are fixed at their original positions zuo et al 2017 for brevity when investigating the robustness of mtmd only the standard deviation and the 95th percentile of tower base bending moments under load case 4 and 6 are considered fig 18 shows the load improvement percentage from the case without tmd for different tmd failure conditions under two load cases fig 19 shows comparisons of time domain and frequency domain results under various failure cases as a comparison the results with well functioning 10 mtmd and without tmd control are also provided combining the above figures some remarks can be concluded overall the load reduction performance of the mtmd system with failure tmds decreases with the increase of the number of failed tmds which is expected because the functions of some tmds are disabled note that considering the effect of other tmds that still work properly the amplitudes of structural responses are still smaller than the case without tmd as shown in fig 19 however the specific representations under the two load cases are different in detail under the parked condition the load reduction performance of the mtmd system with failure tmds decreases continually with the increase of the number of failed tmds which is related to the linear behaviors of the parked wind turbine however under load case 4 the normal operation condition nonlinear characteristics between the performance of mtmd with failure tmds and the number of failure tmds can be observed particularly the load reduction effect of mtmd with failure tmds improves for some failure cases failure cases 1 and 2 these results show the significant robustness of the mtmd system 6 conclusions in this work stmd and mtmd systems are used to mitigate the structural vibration of the monopile offshore wind turbine subjected to combined effects of wind and wave loadings under the normal power production and the parked conditions in order to accurately evaluate the wind turbine dynamic responses and the vibration control effect of stmd and mtmd a detailed wind turbine model with soil structure interaction included is built then the influences of soil structure interaction on dynamic responses of the wind turbine are analyzed based on the natural frequency analysis of the wind turbine the tuning frequencies of stmd and mtmd are determined the vibration control effects of the designed tmd systems are then evaluated under different load cases through comparing the case without tmd moreover the robust performance of the 10 mtmd system is investigated based on the simulation results some conclusions are obtained as follows 1 the natural frequency of the tower is lowered when the soil structure interaction is taken into account on the contrary the soil structure interaction has little effect on the natural frequency of the blade therefore the effect of soil structure interaction on blade responses is less than that on tower base responses 2 when the wind turbine operates normally it exhibits nonlinear behaviors because of many factors such as the aerodynamic forces nonlinearly depended on the wind speed and the change of blade pitch angles adjusted by the control system 3 generally the suppression effect of stmd mtmd on the standard deviation of structural loads is better than that on the 95th percentile loads in addition stmd mtmd can effectively mitigate the tower base loads but has negligible control effects on the blade structural responses which indicates the necessity of controlling blade vibrations moreover the vibration mitigation effect of mtmd is better compared with stmd 4 due to the nonlinear characteristics of the operating wind turbine the load improvement effects of stmd mtmd under the normal operational condition are less than those under the parked condition moreover the optimal tuning frequency of tmd should be adjusted for various operational conditions of the wind turbine 5 the load inhibition performances of mtmd generally become better with the increase of the number of tmd especially for the parked condition note that the vibration control effects of 6 mtmd and10 mtmd are only slightly improved compared with those of 2 mtmd particularly the 10 mtmd system exhibits significant robust performance when some tmds are assumed to be invalid especially under the parked condition 6 generally the passive tmd has considerable effects for mitigating the structural responses because of the vibration of structural modes but not because of the broadband external loadings when the structural loading spectrum is dominated by the vibration of structural modes or when the structural mode coincides with the main energy of the external excitation passive tmd can provide significant vibration suppression effect otherwise the effectiveness of passive tmd will be limited it is worth pointing out that the interaction between the tmds and the components such as the gearbox in the nacelle is not considered in this paper if considering this the nacelle configuration needs to be re designed which will be discussed in the future research additionally an active structural control method will also be investigated in the future work acknowledgment this paper is sponsored by national natural science foundation of china approval no 51975066 
21896,cavitation effects play a substantial role in the dynamic response of marine structures in the previous numerical studies it s assumed that the incident explosive loading is reflected by the horizontal free surface but the cavitation phenomenon near the water wave has rarely been investigated in this paper we propose a novel 2d underwater explosion undex model which can be applied to study undex cavitation characteristics near the water wave on the basis of the local discontinuous galerkin method the 2d far field undex model is established to simulate the propagation of incident shock loading in fluid domain in order to consider the water wave effects in the numerical model the undex model is combined with the nonlinear stokes wave theory the effects of stokes wave pressure are introduced into the cavitation model and the influences of the water wave profile on undex loading characteristics are included in the present model by comparing with an underwater explosion experiment the present model is verified in simulating the shock wave propagation and exhibits better properties than the acoustic finite element method by means of the present model the effects of the water wave phase angle and wave length on the cavitation characteristics are investigated it s found that the cavitation duration of the region below wave crests is prolonged while the cavitation duration of the region below wave troughs is shortened the present model can be further extended to study the influence of irregular waves on the undex loading characteristics keywords underwater explosion cavitation characteristics water wave local discontinuous galerkin method 1 introduction when the underwater explosion undex shock wave reaches the free surface reflection of the pressure wave could form bulk cavitation phenomenon the cavitated zone has a profound effect on the dynamic response of marine structures floated on the free surface shin and santiago 1998 van aanhold et al 1998 it would even threaten the security of naval ships and submarines therefore the research on undex cavitation characteristics is essential for shock resistance design and improving warship survivability this study focuses on the numerical simulation of far field undex where the stand off distance reaches about 3 5 times the maximum bubble radius on the assumption of compressible inviscid and adiabatic flow the fluid flow is governed by second order wave equation geers and zhang 1994 klenow 2006 simulia abaqus 6 11 2011 wu et al 2019 some numerical methods have been widely employed to solve the wave equation to simulate the undex phenomenon e g acoustic finite element method afem fathallah et al 2014 jen 2009 and spectral element method sprague and geers 2003 2004 2006 etc on the assumption that the fluid velocity potential satisfies the wave equation the doubly asymptotic approximations daa method geers 1978 geers and zhang 1994 is presented to handle the shock structure interaction problems but the undex shock loading is a discontinuous wave these continuous numerical methods i e daa afem and spectral element method have difficulties in capturing the fluid discontinuities the computational results will face the inherent numerical difficulties including the numerical dispersion of the shock front and spurious oscillations behind the shock front klenow and brown 2010 wu et al 2019 the discontinuous galerkin dg method is able to exhibit good robustness when it s adopted to solve hyperbolic problems baccouch 2012 2014a the dg method can sharply capture the discontinuities of physical variables between the discretized spatial grid baccouch 2014a b chou et al 2014 cockburn et al 1989 1990 cockburn and shu 1989 xing et al 2013 dg method was first proposed by reed and hill 1973 to handle the neutron transport problems up to now dg method has been successfully used to simulate undex phenomenon jin et al 2017 2019 park 2008 2019 wang et al 2016 besides based on the local discontinuous galerkin ldg method the axisymmetric model has been established to calculate the undex shock and cavitation loading the ldg model can capture the high resolution shock wave and eliminate nonphysical oscillations behind the shock front wu et al 2019 the cavitation phenomena caused by undex near free surface have been studied extensively gong and lam 2006 liu et al 2003 sprague and geers 2001 wu et al 2019 2020 in all the previous studies the free surface is assumed as the horizontal surface however the water wave will exist at the sea surface in real ocean environment the gravity wave surface will have an influence on reflecting effects of the incident shock wave and cavitation characteristics to our knowledge there are few papers discussing the undex cavitation phenomenon near water wave this paper aims to explore the undex cavitation characteristics near water wave the present numerical model differs from the model published previously wu et al 2019 in two main aspects firstly the existence of gravity wave will affect the undex loading distribution in fluid domain in this paper we propose a novel undex model which can be employed to investigate cavitation characteristics near water wave in the present model we combine the undex model with the stokes wave theory and introduce the effects of stokes wave pressure into the cavitation model secondly the axisymmetric model in reference wu et al 2019 cannot be applied to describe the water wave geometric shape thus we establish a two dimensional undex numerical model discretized by unstructured triangular grids in this paper compared with three dimensional real model the two dimensional model can reduce the considerable computational cost and qualitatively investigate the undex cavitation phenomenon near water wave the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the undex physical model near water wave is introduced in details in section 3 based on the ldg method and stokes wave theory we establish the two dimensional numerical model which can calculate the undex shock and cavitation loading near water wave in section 4 the numerical verification is conducted and the effects of the water wave phase angle and water wave length on the cavitation loading are studied qualitatively in section 5 some conclusions are made from this research 2 physical problem 2 1 basic equation the schematic diagram of far field undex model is illustrated in fig 1 the incident wave is produced by the charge located outside the computational domain the reflection of the incident shock wave will form on the fluid field boundaries the configuration of the cartesian coordinate system o xy adopted in this study is shown in fig 1 where the origin locates at the center of the wave surface with y axis pointing towards the outside of fluid domain on the assumption of inviscid compressible and adiabatic fluid the fluid disturbed by far field undex can be considered as the acoustic medium which can undergo small pressure variations klenow 2006 shin and geers 1995 sprague and geers 2006 wu et al 2019 the acoustic dynamic pressure p can be determined by the second order wave

ω w is the wave circular frequency ς w is the wave phase angle and c w is the wave phase velocity of stokes wave eq 2 describes the water wave profile in the two dimensions two dimensional model can simplify the physical problems and save the calculation time especially in large scale problems in the present study the cavitation characteristics near the water wave are studied qualitatively by two dimensional model undex shock wave is a transient impact process occurring on the order of micro seconds cole 1948 compared with shock wave propagation velocity the water wave phase velocity is extremely small therefore the motion of the water wave can be neglected during the shock wave propagation process eq 2 provides the gravity wave profile as a geometric boundary condition the time t is set as 0 in eq 2 2 2 2 incident wave field in this study the shock wave impinges on the computational domain from an explosive charge external source the charge is located at the position x 0 and the incident wave field is enforced as the boundary condition at the bottom surface of the fluid domain when the wave phase angle ς w 0 and π the charge source point is below the wave crest and trough respectively the incident wave field p i at the position x j can be expressed as 3 p i x j τ p t τ p x x j where p t is the temporal part of the incident pressure at the stand off point x 0 and p x x represents the spatial variation of the columnar wave emanating from the source point x s τ is the retarded time which means that the pressure amplitude observed at the point x j is delayed by the time required for the incident wave to travel from the standoff point x 0 to the point x j simulia abaqus 6 11 the detailed expression of the retarded time is 4 τ t r j r 0 c where r 0 x s x 0 r j is the distance to the source point x s because the computational model is established in the two dimensional domain in this paper the spherical incident wave in 3d domain will be changed into 2d

effects because the cut off model can perform almost identically to cavitation models that consider phase transition liu et al 2004 klenow and brown 2010 xie et al 2007 the absolute pressure of the acoustic fluid element is the sum of static pressure and dynamic pressure caused by undex if the top surface is a horizontal free surface the static pressure p 0 is the hydrostatic pressure p 0 p a t m ρ g y however if the top surface is a water wave the existence of water wave will have an influence on the pressure distribution in the fluid domain the static pressure of the fluid particle includes two parts hydrostatic pressure and stokes wave pressure p w a v e 7 p 0 p a t m ρ g y p w a v e compared with shock wave propagation velocity the fluid particle velocity is low thus it s

cavitation model can be simplified as the pressure cutoff model where the cavitation occurs when the absolute pressure drops lower than a low pressure limit p c wardlaw and luton 2007 wardlaw found that the cavitation limit p c has little influence on the solution as long as p c is much less than 1 bar and positive park 2008 wardlaw and luton 2007 the value of cavitation limit p c 0 used in this study the dynamic pressure is determined by the following criterion 8 p max p v p c p 0 where p v is the pseudopressure of the fluid particle 3 numerical scheme 3 1 space discretization in this paper

the dynamic pressure p 4 results and discussions 4 1 convergence test and verification to verify the convergence properties of the two dimensional ldg model the case for a plane wave propagation near a horizontal free surface is tested the width and depth of fluid domain are 0 1 and 4 m the top surface is the free surface with the atmospheric pressure p a t m 0 101 m p a the incident plane wave exponentially decaying with a pressure amplitude of 1 57 mpa is enforced at the bottom surface the decay time of the incident wave is 1 0 ms the rigid wall boundary conditions are prescribed at the left and right side the fluid domain is discretized into 4 triangular elements in the x direction and it s discretized into 100 150 and 200 triangular elements in the y direction respectively the triangular mesh for fluid domain is shown in fig 4 the acoustic finite element method afem and ldg method are adopted to calculate the model with the same parameters respectively in this paper the afem is solved by means of the abaqus software simulia abaqus 6 11 a comparison about absolute pressure at the position 0 1 m is made between the ldg result and afem result for the same case in fig 5 the damping coefficient is set as 0 3 in this section the afem result discretized by finer mesh n x 4 n y 700 is regarded as the reference solution the convergence of the ldg method is shown in fig 5 a it can be seen that with the mesh refinement the ldg solution converges to the exact solution gradually fig 5 b shows that the results calculated by the ldg method are more accurate than those obtained by the afem with the same mesh n y 100 as shown in the local magnification in fig 5 b and the ldg model can eliminate nonphysical oscillations during the later stage overall the ldg model can calculate the incident pressure amplitude precisely compared with the afem discretized with the same mesh the ldg model shows faster convergence to evaluate the present ldg model we compare the numerical result with experimental results in the bulk cavitation experiment a weight of 30 8 kg pentolite charge exploded at the position 0 21 3 m beneath water and the absolute pressure at the location 51 8 m 3 05 m was measured marcus 1983 in the numerical simulation we establish the axisymmetric fluid domain whose radius and depth are 300 m and 10 m respectively zong et al 2014 the upper surface of the fluid domain is the free surface and the lower surface is the non reflective boundary the left side is the symmetric axis the size of the discretized elements is 0 1 m the damping coefficient b 1 is set as 0 06 the afem and ldg method are adopted to calculate the model with the same parameters respectively a comparison about the absolute pressure at the measurement point is made as shown in fig 6 in general the peak pressure and cavitation loading calculated by the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental result as depicted in the figure the ldg result is more close to the experimental result compared with the afem result the ldg model shows higher accuracy than the afem in capturing shock wave 4 2 the effects of the water wave phase angle in this section eq 2 is used to establish the third order stokes wave surface and simulate the water wave profile the depth and width of the 2d fluid field are 30 m and 100 m respectively the whole fluid field is discretized into unstructured triangular elements whose size is 0 3 m the upper surface is the gravity wave surface with the atmospheric pressure p a t m 0 101 m p a and the incident shock wave is enforced at the bottom surface the positions of standoff point and source point are 0 30 m and 0 50 m respectively the two sides of fluid domain are set as the non reflecting boundaries which can used to simulate the infinite domain the value of variables i e water wave length λ w water wave amplitude a w and weight of charge w keep constant in this section by changing the water wave phase angle we investigate the influence of wave phase angle on the cavitation characteristics we set the wave length λ w 10 m the wave amplitude a w 0 7 m the weight of charge w 2 kg and the wave phase angle ς w 0 π 4 π respectively as mentioned above the propagation speed of shock wave is much higher than the phase velocity of the water wave the motion of the water wave is neglected in this study the position of source point is fixed in this study therefore the wave phase angle only influences the relation position between the source point and wave crests or troughs the damping coefficient b 1 is set as 0 1 at first some typical cases are chosen to study the basic physical phenomenon fig 7 shows the absolute pressure contour in the fluid field with the different wave phase angles the unit of pressure in figs 7 and 11 is pa as shown in figure the pressure distributions with different parameters are similar before the shock wave reaches gravity wave surface initially the cylindiral shock wave propagates in 2d fluid domain when ς w π the source point and standoff point are below the wave trough the center of the shock front strong discontinuous face of pressure reaches the gravity wave surface first as shown in fig 7 a t 20 66 ms when ς w 0 the source point and standoff point are below the wave crest in this case the shock front reaches the wave troughs in central part of wave surface rather than the center of gravity wave surface as shown in fig 7 b t 20 79 ms the pressure wave reflected by water wave symmetrically propagates in the fluid domain and the pressure distribution is symmetrical about the x axis in these two cases due to the effects of curvature of wave the reflected wave appears wave like shape with the majority of shock front approaching the gravity wave surface the dilational reflected wave spreads gradually a large region of low pressure zone appears near the gravity wave surface when the water wave phase angle ς w π 4 the wave height on interval x 2 2 is higher than that on interval x 2 4 thus the shock front within the range of x 2 4 approaches the wave trough first and the dilational reflected wave begins to form at the same time as given in fig 7 c t 20 60 ms under the action of the asymmetric water wave boundary the reflected wave propagates in the fluid domain asymmetrically the low pressure region would form near the gravity wave surface due to the reflected rarefaction wave fig 8 presents the formation and growth of the cavitation zone with different phase angles if the absolute pressure of fluid elements is lower than the cavitation limit fluid elements will undergo the cavitation the cavitation zone is marked with the red color in fig 8 the growth trends of the cavitation zone near water wave are similar in this study the shock front approaches the wave trough in the central part of the water wave first and the reflected wave forms at the same time the region near the wave trough undergoes cavitation first with the shock wave propagating the cavitation zone expands to the neighbouring wave crests afterwards a large region of cavitation zone appears near the water wave at last the cavitation zone begins to shrink and the whole cavitation region is split into several small parts as illustrated in fig 8 the central part of cavitation zone firstly collapses due to the curvature effects of wave crests the reflected wave is focused on the curvature center therefore the cavitation duration of the region below wave crests is prolonged however the curvature effects of wave troughs make the reflected wave diffuse it weakens the cavitation effects of the region below wave troughs thus the cavitation duration of the region below wave troughs is shortened fig 9presents the cavitation phenomenon near free surface with the same parameters as shown in fig 9 under the action of boundary effects caused by the horizontal free surface the cavitation region only undergoes the growth and collapse period the cavitation region won t split into several small parts which differs from the cavitation phenomenon near water wave fig 10 shows the history curve of the absolute pressure at the test point the spatial coordinates of the test point are 0 2 m under the disturbance action of the stokes wave pressure the initial static pressure at the test point are different as shown in fig 10 when the phase angle ς w 0 the test point is located below the wave crest under the action of boundary effects the reflected wave is focused near the test point thus the cavitation duration with ς w 0 is the longest however when ς w π the test point is located below the wave trough the weaken effects by wave trough make cavitation duration shorter than the other cases when ς w π the peak value of incident pressure is the lowest it can be explained as follows the weight of charge and denotation distance are kept constant in this section but the atmospheric pressure on the water wave can have an influence on pressure distribution in fluid domain thus the distance between the test point and gravity wave surface will influence the amplitude of incident pressure when ς w π the wave height is the lowest in these cases the decrease effect on the amplitude of incident pressure is the most obvious besides the wave height at the test point will influence the time when the test point begins to undergo cavitation when ς w 0 the wave height is highest and the time when the reflected pressure wave reaches the test point will be delayed thus the test point undergoes cavitation lastest in these cases 4 3 the effects of the water wave length in this section the effects of water wave length on cavitation characteristics are investigated the input information of gravity wave surface are changed the wave phase angle ς w is set as zero in this section the wave length λ w is chosen as 20 m and 25 m respectively and the other parameters and variables are the same as that in section 4 2 fig 11 gives the absolute pressure contour of fluid field it can be seen that the propagation trends of incident pressure wave are similar to the case with λ w 10 m the formation growth and collapse of cavitation region are given in fig 12 the cavitation phenomena near the water wave appear different scenarios with different wave lengths the wave amplitude a w is fixed in this paper thus with the increase of wave length the curvature of wave surface decreases it leads to the fact that the boundary effects caused by water wave are weakened from figs 8 a and fig 12 it can be seen that the cavitation zone below wave crest shrinks gradually in the depth direction with the increase of λ w for the case with λ w 20 25 m the cavitation duration of the region near the position x 0 is prolonged the cavitation effects below the other wave crests aren t strengthened obviously compared with the case with λ w 10 m the curvature of gravity wave surface will influence the reflecting characteristics of incident explosive loading it will change the cavitation phenomenon in turn the diffusion and concentration of the pressure wave can be obviously observed only under the condition that the curvature of water wave is much larger than the curvature of shock front 5 conclusions in this study on the basis of ldg method and stokes wave theory we establish the 2d far field undex numerical model on unstructured triangular grids which can simulate the propagation of incident shock wave in 2d fluid domain and investigate the cavitation characteristics near the stokes wave several conclusions are drawn as follows i the effects of water wave on the undex loading characteristics are mainly in two aspects first the water wave changes the distribution of hydrostatic pressure in fluid domain the fluid particles are influenced by the stokes wave pressure second the curvature of gravity wave surface is shown to play a profound role in the reflecting characteristics of incident explosive loading it will change the cavitation phenomenon in turn ii the rarefaction wave reflected by water wave is focused on the curvature center of wave crests the cavitation duration of the region below wave crests is prolonged however the curvature effects of wave troughs make the reflected wave diffuse and the cavitation duration of the region below wave troughs is shortened iii the cavitation phenomena near the water wave appear different scenarios with different wave lengths the diffusion and concentration of the pressure wave can be obviously observed only under the condition that the curvature of gravity wave surface is much larger than the curvature of shock front the present model can be further extended to study the influence of irregular waves on the undex

21896,cavitation effects play a substantial role in the dynamic response of marine structures in the previous numerical studies it s assumed that the incident explosive loading is reflected by the horizontal free surface but the cavitation phenomenon near the water wave has rarely been investigated in this paper we propose a novel 2d underwater explosion undex model which can be applied to study undex cavitation characteristics near the water wave on the basis of the local discontinuous galerkin method the 2d far field undex model is established to simulate the propagation of incident shock loading in fluid domain in order to consider the water wave effects in the numerical model the undex model is combined with the nonlinear stokes wave theory the effects of stokes wave pressure are introduced into the cavitation model and the influences of the water wave profile on undex loading characteristics are included in the present model by comparing with an underwater explosion experiment the present model is verified in simulating the shock wave propagation and exhibits better properties than the acoustic finite element method by means of the present model the effects of the water wave phase angle and wave length on the cavitation characteristics are investigated it s found that the cavitation duration of the region below wave crests is prolonged while the cavitation duration of the region below wave troughs is shortened the present model can be further extended to study the influence of irregular waves on the undex loading characteristics keywords underwater explosion cavitation characteristics water wave local discontinuous galerkin method 1 introduction when the underwater explosion undex shock wave reaches the free surface reflection of the pressure wave could form bulk cavitation phenomenon the cavitated zone has a profound effect on the dynamic response of marine structures floated on the free surface shin and santiago 1998 van aanhold et al 1998 it would even threaten the security of naval ships and submarines therefore the research on undex cavitation characteristics is essential for shock resistance design and improving warship survivability this study focuses on the numerical simulation of far field undex where the stand off distance reaches about 3 5 times the maximum bubble radius on the assumption of compressible inviscid and adiabatic flow the fluid flow is governed by second order wave equation geers and zhang 1994 klenow 2006 simulia abaqus 6 11 2011 wu et al 2019 some numerical methods have been widely

etc on the assumption that the fluid velocity potential satisfies the wave equation the doubly asymptotic approximations daa method geers 1978 geers and zhang 1994 is presented to handle the shock structure interaction problems but the undex shock loading is a discontinuous wave these continuous numerical methods i e daa afem and spectral element method have difficulties in capturing the fluid discontinuities the computational results will face the inherent numerical difficulties including the numerical dispersion of the shock front and spurious oscillations behind the shock front klenow and brown 2010 wu et al 2019 the discontinuous galerkin dg method is able to exhibit good robustness when it s adopted to solve hyperbolic problems baccouch 2012 2014a the dg method can sharply

2016 besides based on the local discontinuous galerkin ldg method the axisymmetric model has been established to calculate the undex shock and cavitation loading the ldg model can capture the high

2006 liu et al 2003 sprague and geers 2001 wu et al 2019 2020 in all the previous studies the free surface is assumed as the horizontal surface however the water wave will exist at the sea surface in real ocean environment the gravity wave surface will have an influence on reflecting effects of the incident shock wave and cavitation characteristics to our knowledge there are few papers discussing the undex cavitation phenomenon near water wave this paper aims to explore the undex cavitation characteristics near water wave the present numerical model differs from the model published previously wu et al 2019 in two main aspects firstly the existence of gravity wave will affect the undex loading distribution in fluid domain in this paper we propose a novel undex model which can be employed to investigate cavitation characteristics near water wave in the present model we combine the undex model with the stokes wave theory and introduce the effects of stokes wave pressure into the cavitation model secondly the axisymmetric model in reference wu et al 2019 cannot be applied to describe the water wave geometric shape thus we establish a two dimensional undex numerical model discretized by unstructured triangular grids in this paper compared with three dimensional real model the two dimensional model can reduce the considerable computational cost and qualitatively investigate the undex cavitation phenomenon near water wave the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the undex physical model near water wave is introduced in details in section 3 based on the ldg method and stokes wave theory we establish the two dimensional numerical model which can calculate the undex shock and cavitation loading near water wave in section 4 the numerical verification is conducted and the effects of the water wave phase angle and water wave length on the cavitation loading are studied qualitatively in section 5 some conclusions are made from this research 2 physical problem 2 1 basic equation the schematic diagram of far field undex model is illustrated in fig 1 the incident wave is produced by the charge located outside the computational domain the reflection of the incident shock wave will form on the fluid field boundaries the configuration of the cartesian coordinate system o xy adopted in this study is shown in fig 1 where the origin locates at the center of the wave surface with y axis pointing towards the outside of fluid domain on the assumption of inviscid compressible and adiabatic fluid the fluid disturbed by far field undex can be considered as the acoustic medium which can undergo small pressure variations klenow 2006 shin and geers 1995 sprague and geers 2006 wu et al 2019 the acoustic dynamic pressure p can be determined by the second order wave equation 1 p c 2 δ p where the dot denotes the time derivative the sound speed in the fluid domain c k f ρ f we set the bulk modulus k f 2 14 g p a and fluid density ρ f 1000 k g m 3 in this paper 2 2 boundary conditions 2 2 1 gravity wave surface the top surface of the fluid domain is the gravity wave surface the dynamic pressure on the gravity wave surface satisfies the dirichlet boundary condition p 0 and the third order nonlinear stokes wave theory is adopted to simulate the gravity wave effects liu et al 2018 the wave height η w satisfies the following equation η w x t a w cos θ w 1

ω w is the wave circular frequency ς w is the wave phase angle and c w is the wave phase velocity of stokes wave eq 2 describes the water wave profile in the two dimensions two dimensional model can simplify the physical problems and save the calculation time especially in large scale problems in the present study the cavitation characteristics near the water wave are studied qualitatively by two dimensional model undex shock wave is a transient impact process occurring on the order of micro seconds cole 1948 compared with shock wave propagation velocity the water wave phase velocity is extremely small therefore the motion of the water wave can be neglected during the shock wave propagation process eq 2 provides the gravity wave profile as a geometric boundary condition the time t is set as 0 in eq 2 2 2 2 incident wave field in this study the shock wave impinges on the computational domain from an explosive charge external source the charge is located at the position x 0 and the incident wave field is enforced as the boundary condition at the bottom surface of the fluid domain when the wave phase angle ς w 0 and π the charge source point is below the wave crest and trough respectively the incident wave field p i at the position x j can be expressed as 3 p i x j τ p t τ p x x j where p t is the temporal part of the incident pressure at the stand off point x 0 and p x x represents the spatial variation of the columnar wave emanating from the source point x s τ is the retarded time which means that the pressure amplitude observed at the point x j is delayed by the time required for the incident wave to travel from the standoff point x 0 to the point x j simulia abaqus 6 11 the detailed expression of the retarded time is 4 τ t r j r 0 c where r 0 x s x 0 r j is the distance to the source point x s because the computational model is established in the two dimensional domain in this paper the spherical incident wave in 3d domain will be changed into 2d columnar incident wave for 2d columnar wave r j x s x j simulia abaqus 6 11 differing from spherical wave the 2d columnar incident wave decays with r j 1 2 in spatial domain for the plane wave r j x j x s x 0 x s x s x 0 simulia abaqus 6 11 we can derive that the acoustic pressure induced by the incident wave field at the location x j satisfies p n g n n g n 1 c p t 1 2 r j p t r 0 1 2 r j 3 2 x j x s c o l u m n a r w a v e 5 g n 1 c p t 1 r 0 x 0 x s p l a n e w a v e where n denotes the outward normal unit vector on the fluid boundary for the denotation of the charge p t is determined by the weight of charge w depth of charge h and the denotation distance d which can refer to geers and hunter 2002 in details 2 2 3 non reflective boundary the non reflective boundary conditions are enforced at two sides of fluid domain the acoustic pressure on the non reflective boundary satisfies the following equation wu et al 2019 6 p n ρ f c 1 p ρ f a 1 p where the boundary condition parameters 1 c 1 and 1 a 1 are related to the geometric shape 1 c 1 1 ρ f k f and 1 a 1 0 on the plane 2 3 cavitation model for far field udnex the pressure cut off model can be employed to simulate the cavitation effects because the cut off model can perform almost identically to cavitation models that consider phase transition liu et al 2004 klenow and brown 2010 xie et al 2007 the absolute pressure of the acoustic fluid element is the sum of static pressure and dynamic pressure caused by undex if the top surface is a horizontal free surface the static pressure p 0 is the hydrostatic pressure p 0 p a t m ρ g y however if the top surface is a water wave the existence of water wave will have an influence on the pressure distribution in the fluid domain the static pressure of the fluid particle includes two parts hydrostatic pressure and stokes wave pressure p w a v e 7 p 0 p a t m ρ g y p w a v e compared with shock wave propagation velocity the fluid particle velocity is low thus it s reasonable to ignore the nonlinear terms in the stokes wave pressure the stokes wave pressure can be approximated by the first order wave pressure for the third order stokes wave the first order wave pressure p w a v e ρ a w c w 2 k w e k w y cos θ w for the explosion problem the duration of cavitation is very short we can assume that the cavitation phenomenon happens instantaneously the cavitation model can be simplified as the pressure cutoff model where the cavitation occurs when the absolute pressure drops lower than a low pressure limit p c wardlaw and luton 2007 wardlaw found that the cavitation limit p c has little influence on the solution as long as p c is much less than 1 bar and positive park 2008 wardlaw and luton 2007 the value of cavitation limit p c 0 used in this study the dynamic pressure is determined by the following criterion 8 p max p v p c p 0 where p v is the pseudopressure of the fluid particle 3 numerical scheme 3 1 space discretization in this paper

the dynamic pressure p 4 results and discussions 4 1 convergence test and verification to verify the convergence properties of the two dimensional ldg model the case for a plane wave propagation near a horizontal free surface is tested the width and depth of fluid domain are 0 1 and 4 m the top surface is the free surface with the atmospheric pressure p a t m 0 101 m p a the incident plane wave exponentially decaying with a pressure amplitude of 1 57 mpa is enforced at the bottom surface the decay time of the incident wave is 1 0 ms the rigid wall boundary conditions are prescribed at the left and right side the fluid domain is discretized into 4 triangular elements in the x direction and it s discretized into 100 150 and 200 triangular elements in the y direction respectively the triangular mesh for fluid domain is shown in fig 4 the acoustic finite element method afem and ldg method are adopted to calculate the model with the same parameters respectively in this paper the afem is solved by means of the abaqus software simulia abaqus 6 11 a comparison about absolute pressure at the position 0 1 m is made between the ldg result and afem result for the same case in fig 5 the damping coefficient is set as 0 3 in this section the afem result discretized by finer mesh n x 4 n y 700 is regarded as the reference solution the convergence of the ldg method is shown in fig 5 a it can be seen that with the mesh refinement the ldg solution converges to the exact solution gradually fig 5 b shows that the results calculated by the ldg method are more accurate than those obtained by the afem with the same mesh n y 100 as shown in the local magnification in fig 5 b and the ldg model can eliminate nonphysical oscillations during the later stage overall the ldg model can calculate the incident pressure amplitude precisely compared with the afem discretized with the same mesh the ldg model shows faster convergence to evaluate the present ldg model we compare the numerical result with experimental results in the bulk cavitation experiment a weight of 30 8 kg pentolite charge exploded at the position 0 21 3 m beneath water and the absolute pressure at the location 51 8 m 3 05 m was measured marcus 1983 in the numerical simulation we establish the axisymmetric fluid domain whose radius and depth are 300 m and 10 m respectively zong et al 2014 the upper surface of the fluid domain is the free surface and the lower surface is the non reflective boundary the left side is the symmetric axis the size of the discretized elements is 0 1 m the damping coefficient b 1 is set as 0 06 the afem and ldg method are adopted to calculate the model with the same parameters respectively a comparison about the absolute pressure at the measurement point is made as shown in fig 6 in general the peak pressure and cavitation loading calculated by the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental result as depicted in the figure the ldg result is more close to the experimental result compared with the afem result the ldg model shows higher accuracy than the afem in capturing shock wave 4 2 the effects of the water wave phase angle in this section eq 2 is used to establish the third order stokes wave surface and simulate the water wave profile the depth and width of the 2d fluid field are 30 m and 100 m respectively the whole fluid field is discretized into unstructured triangular elements whose size is 0 3 m the upper surface is the gravity wave surface with the atmospheric pressure p a t m 0 101 m p a and the incident shock wave is enforced at the bottom surface the positions of standoff point and source point are 0 30 m and 0 50 m respectively the two sides of fluid domain are set as the non reflecting boundaries which can used to simulate the infinite domain the value of variables i e water wave length λ w water wave amplitude a w and weight of charge w keep constant in this section by changing the water wave phase angle we investigate the influence of wave phase angle on the cavitation characteristics we set the wave length λ w 10 m the wave amplitude a w 0 7 m the weight of charge w 2 kg and the wave phase angle ς w 0 π 4 π respectively as mentioned above the propagation speed of shock wave is much higher than the phase velocity of the water wave the motion of the water wave is neglected in this study the position of source point is fixed in this study therefore the wave phase angle only influences the relation position between the source point and wave crests or troughs the damping coefficient b 1 is set as 0 1 at first some typical cases are chosen to study the basic physical phenomenon fig 7 shows the absolute pressure contour in the fluid field with the different wave phase angles the unit of pressure in figs 7 and 11 is pa as shown in figure the pressure distributions with different parameters are similar before the shock wave reaches gravity wave surface initially the cylindiral shock wave propagates in 2d fluid domain when ς w π the source point and standoff point are below the wave trough the center of the shock front strong discontinuous face of pressure reaches the gravity wave surface first as shown in fig 7 a t 20 66 ms when ς w 0 the source point and standoff point are below the wave crest in this case the shock front reaches the wave troughs in central part of wave surface rather than the center of gravity wave surface as shown in fig 7 b t 20 79 ms the pressure wave reflected by water wave symmetrically propagates in the fluid domain and the pressure distribution is symmetrical about the x axis in these two cases due to the effects of curvature of wave the reflected wave appears wave like shape with the majority of shock front approaching the gravity wave surface the dilational reflected wave spreads gradually a large region of low pressure zone appears near the gravity wave surface when the water wave phase angle ς w π 4 the wave height on interval x 2 2 is higher than that on interval x 2 4 thus the shock front within the range of x 2 4 approaches the wave trough first and the dilational reflected wave begins to form at the same time as given in fig 7 c t 20 60 ms under the action of the asymmetric water wave boundary the reflected wave propagates in the fluid domain asymmetrically the low pressure region would form near the gravity wave surface due to the reflected rarefaction wave fig 8 presents the formation and growth of the cavitation zone with different phase angles if the absolute pressure of fluid elements is lower than the cavitation limit fluid elements will undergo the cavitation the cavitation zone is marked with the red color in fig 8 the growth trends of the cavitation zone near water wave are similar in this study the shock front approaches the wave trough in the central part of the water wave first and the reflected wave forms at the same time the region near the wave trough undergoes cavitation first with the shock wave propagating the cavitation zone expands to the neighbouring wave crests afterwards a large region of cavitation zone appears near the water wave at last the cavitation zone begins to shrink and the whole cavitation region is split into several small parts as illustrated in fig 8 the central part of cavitation zone firstly collapses due to the curvature effects of wave crests the reflected wave is focused on the curvature center therefore the cavitation duration of the region below wave crests is prolonged however the curvature effects of wave troughs make the reflected wave diffuse it weakens the cavitation effects of the region below wave troughs thus the cavitation duration of the region below wave troughs is shortened fig 9presents the cavitation phenomenon near free surface with the same parameters as shown in fig 9 under the action of boundary effects caused by the horizontal free surface the cavitation region only undergoes the growth and collapse period the cavitation region won t split into several small parts which differs from the cavitation phenomenon near water wave fig 10 shows the history curve of the absolute pressure at the test point the spatial coordinates of the test point are 0 2 m under the disturbance action of the stokes wave pressure the initial static pressure at the test point are different as shown in fig 10 when the phase angle ς w 0 the test point is located below the wave crest under the action of boundary effects the reflected wave is focused near the test point thus the cavitation duration with ς w 0 is the longest however when ς w π the test point is located below the wave trough the weaken effects by wave trough make cavitation duration shorter than the other cases when ς w π the peak value of incident pressure is the lowest it can be explained as follows the weight of charge and denotation distance are kept constant in this section but the atmospheric pressure on the water wave can have an influence on pressure distribution in fluid domain thus the distance between the test point and gravity wave surface will influence the amplitude of incident pressure when ς w π the wave height is the lowest in these cases the decrease effect on the amplitude of incident pressure is the most obvious besides the wave height at the test point will influence the time when the test point begins to undergo cavitation when ς w 0 the wave height is highest and the time when the reflected pressure wave reaches the test point will be delayed thus the test point undergoes cavitation lastest in these cases 4 3 the effects of the water wave length in this section the effects of water wave length on cavitation characteristics are investigated the input information of gravity wave surface are changed the wave phase angle ς w is set as zero in this section the wave length λ w is chosen as 20 m and 25 m respectively and the other parameters and variables are the same as that in section 4 2 fig 11 gives the absolute pressure contour of fluid field it can be seen that the propagation trends of incident pressure wave are similar to the case with λ w 10 m the formation growth and collapse of cavitation region are given in fig 12 the cavitation phenomena near the water wave appear different scenarios with different wave lengths the wave amplitude a w is fixed in this paper thus with the increase of wave length the curvature of wave surface decreases it leads to the fact that the boundary effects caused by water wave are weakened from figs 8 a and fig 12 it can be seen that the cavitation zone below wave crest shrinks gradually in the depth direction with the increase of λ w for the case with λ w 20 25 m the cavitation duration of the region near the position x 0 is prolonged the cavitation effects below the other wave crests aren t strengthened obviously compared with the case with λ w 10 m the curvature of gravity wave surface will influence the reflecting characteristics of incident explosive loading it will change the cavitation phenomenon in turn the diffusion and concentration of the pressure wave can be obviously observed only under the condition that the curvature of water wave is much larger than the curvature of shock front 5 conclusions in this study on the basis of ldg method and stokes wave theory we establish the 2d far field undex numerical model on unstructured triangular grids which can simulate the propagation of incident shock wave in 2d fluid domain and investigate the cavitation characteristics near the stokes wave several conclusions are drawn as follows i the effects of water wave on the undex loading characteristics are mainly in two aspects first the water wave changes the distribution of hydrostatic pressure in fluid domain the fluid particles are influenced by the stokes wave pressure second the curvature of gravity wave surface is shown to play a profound role in the reflecting characteristics of incident explosive loading it will change the cavitation phenomenon in turn ii the rarefaction wave reflected by water wave is focused on the curvature center of wave crests the cavitation duration of the region below wave crests is prolonged however the curvature effects of wave troughs make the reflected wave diffuse and the cavitation duration of the region below wave troughs is shortened iii the cavitation phenomena near the water wave appear different scenarios with different wave lengths the diffusion and concentration of the pressure wave can be obviously observed only under the condition that the curvature of gravity wave surface is much larger than the curvature of shock front the present model can be further extended to study the influence of irregular waves on the undex

tognarelli et al 2004 carried out experiments of a flexible riser in uniform and linearly sheared currents respectively to study the viv features in different flow conditions trim et al 2005 also carried out a series of experiments at the same flow conditions viv responses of a bare riser and a riser with various strake arrangements were mainly investigated chaplin et al 2005a 2005b conducted experiments of a vertical riser in stepped current with different top tension and the corresponding reynolds number re ranging from 3080 to 26600 lie and kaasen 2006 employed the modal analysis method that had been used by chaplin et al 2005b to analyze the vibration features of a large scale riser in linearly sheared flow song et al 2016 investigated the distribution of drag force coefficients along the flexible riser span experiencing sheared flow through model tests song et al 2011 sanaati and kato 2012 and gedikli and dahl 2017 carried out experiments of a flexible riser exposed to uniform flow too multi modes vibration effects of axial stiffness and pre tension and mode excitation hysteresis features were studied in order to fully investigate the flow field around the flexible cylinder the three dimensional numerical model is used in some researches holmes et al 2006 combined three dimensional cfd solutions with structural models in simulating viv of a straked riser huang et al 2007 huang and chen 2007 presented a cfd approach for viv prediction using the urans method on the three dimensional overset grid system numerical results on viv of a flexible riser experiencing uniform flow and sheared flow were in good agreement with experimental results and previous publication data wang and xiao 2016 adopted the large eddy simulation les method with the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme in simulating viv response of a riser in uniform flow and sheared flow respectively using the ansys mfx multi field solver although the three dimensional simulation method can reflect detailed flow characteristics costs of the corresponding computational resources and the computational time are extremely huge especially when the cylinder aspect ratio l d where l is the axial cylinder length and d is the cylinder diameter is very large therefore the traditional two dimensional strip method used to predict the viv response of risers was proposed by willden and graham 2001 2004 to reduce both the computational resources and the computational time into an acceptable range the strip method considered that the fluid flow was locally two dimensional without spanwise correlation and simplified the three dimensional fluid field into several two dimensional strips uniformly distributed along the cylinder span this method owns high computational efficiency and accuracy that has been verified through previous researches such as meneghini et al 2004 and yamamoto et al 2004 adopting the two dimensional strip method duan et al 2016a 2018 developed the viv foam sjtu solver and carried out numerical simulations on viv of a vertical riser exposed to the stepped current based on the experiments of chaplin et al 2005b to verify the validity of the solver duan et al 2016b 2017 then studied effects of the cylinder aspect ratio l d and the top tension t on viv response fu et al 2016 2017 fu and wan 2017 mainly studied the effects of the cylinder mass ratio m m m ρ where m is the mass of the cylinder and m ρ is the mass of the displaced water the current profile and the cylinder top end excitation on viv response of a single cylinder using the viv foam sjtu solver fu et al 2018 then further expanded the capacity of the solver in simulating viv of a flexible cylinder experiencing oscillatory flow and validate its reliability compared with standard model experiments of fu et al 2013 however the computational accuracy is hard to guarantee during high re number flow condition or complicated fluid structure interaction fsi problems combining the advantages of considering the axial correlation effects from the three dimensional method and the low computational resources and computational time cost from the traditional two dimensional strip method bao et al 2016 proposed the three dimensional strip model or named the generalized thick strip model for viv prediction of a long flexible cylinder using the direct numerical simulation dns method then bao et al 2019 conducted simulations on viv of a single cylinder in uniform flow comparisons between experimental results and simulation results proved the validity of the thick strip method in this paper the new viv3d foam sjtu solver is developed through modifying the previous viv foam sjtu solver by replacing the two dimensional strip model with the three dimensional strip model and is applied to predict viv response of a flexible cylinder exposed to the uniform flow and the stepped flow this paper is organized as follows the first section gives a brief introduction to the numerical methodology the second section presents comparisons on viv responses from present simulation experiments and published data in the uniform flow condition while the fluid strip thickness dependence study is also conducted in a detailed manner the third section verifies the modified solver through comparisons on viv features of a vertical flexible cylinder in stepped flow and the final section concludes the paper 2 numerical method 2 1 hydrodynamic governing equations hydrodynamic forces acted on the flexible cylinder are calculated from the viscous force and the pressure in each fluid strip integrated over all boundary meshes on the cylinder surface in order to solve the incompressible fluid flow locally the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method is employed while the sst k ω turbulence model put forward by menter 1993 is used to compute the reynolds stress with no wall functions used in present studies considering the cost of computational resources and the computational accuracy in the initial branch the rans method is more appropriate for the prediction of hydrodynamic forces than the large eddy simulation les method and the direct numerical simulation dns method in this paper and the rans method has been widely used in viv simulations such as duan et al 2017 2018 and fu et al 2018 the continuity and the momentum equations for turbulent flow are written as eq 1 and eq 2 1 u i x i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j 2 μ s i j ρ u j u i where μ is the constant dynamic viscosity ρ is the constant density s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the mean rate of the strain tensor ρ u j u i is referred as the reynolds stress τ i j computed by τ i j ρ u j u i 2 μ t s i j 2 3 ρ k δ i j where μ t is the turbulent viscosity and k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulent energy computing from the fluctuating velocity field δ i j is the kronecke function the sst k ω turbulence model put forward by menter 1993 consists of turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ω transport equations of k and ω can be written as eq 3 and eq 4 3 ρ k t τ i j u i x j β ρ ω k x j μ σ k μ t k x j 4 ρ ω t γ μ t τ i j u i x j β ρ ω 2 x j μ σ ω μ t ω x

outside the cylinder surface which is defined as followed 5 ϕ f 1 ϕ 1 1 f 1 ϕ 2 6 f 1 tanh arg 1 4 7 arg 1 min max k β ω d 500 ν d 2 ω 4 ρ σ ω 2 k c d k ω d 2 8 c d k ω max 2 ρ σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j 10 20 9 f 2 tanh arg 2 2 10 arg 2 max 2 k β ω d 500 ν d 2 ω where β 0 09 σ k 1 σ ω 1 β 1 a 1 γ 1 are the empirical coefficients in the k ω model and σ k 2 σ ω 2 β 2 γ 2 are the empirical coefficients in the k ε model 2 2 structural governing equations each thick fluid strip is independent and the connection between all strips is realized through the interpolation of the inline and the crossflow vibrations of the cylinder the flexible cylinder is assumed to be an euler bernoulli bending beam model with an axial pretension the vibration of the model is solved through the fem method and the structural governing equations in each structural element are written as eq 11 and eq 12 11 m x c x k x f x 12 m y c y k y f y where m c k are the mass the damping and the stiffness of the structural element f x f y are the inline and the crossflow hydrodynamic forces respectively hence the mass spring damping mck equations of the whole system can be expressed as eq 13 and eq 14 13 m x c x k x f h x 14 m y c y k y f h y where m c k are the mass damping and stiffness matrixes of the system f h x f h y are hydrodynamic force vectors in the inline and crossflow directions meanwhile the rayleigh damping is adopted to generate the damping matrix replacing the practical damping as shown in eq 15 and eq 16 15 c a 0 m a 1 k 16 a 0 a 1 2 ς f n 1 f n 2 2 π f n 1 f n 2 1 2 π where a 0 and a 1 are proportionality coefficient ς is the damping ratio f n 1 and f n 2 are the first and the second natural frequencies of the cylinder 2 3 three dimensional strip model the schematic diagram of the traditional two dimensional strip theory is shown in fig 1 due to the simplification on discretizing the three dimensional fluid field around the cylinder into several two dimensional fluid strips the axial correlation and the three dimensional characteristic of the shedding vortices are neglected resulting in the underestimation of the hydrodynamic forces especially at complicated flow fields then the underestimated hydrodynamic forces will be transferred to the structural field and contribute to the inaccurate prediction of the vibration amplitudes compared to the experimental results especially at high re number experimental conditions to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional two dimensional strip method bao et al 2016 proposed the generalized thick strip model considering the spanwise correlation of the flow field locally and the method had been validated in predicting viv responses of a flexible cylinder by bao et al 2019 in this paper the thick strip model has been adopted to modify the previous viv foam sjtu solver and develop a new viv3d foam sjtu solver through replacing the two dimensional fluid strips with locally three dimensional thick fluid strips as shown in fig 2 in our thick strip strategy the thickness of the thick fluid strip is an integer multiple of the structural element length as shown in fig 3 each thick strip owns its corresponding controlling axial length to conduct interpolation of the hydrodynamic forces and the vibration displacement between the thick fluid strip and the cylinder meanwhile each thick strip contains the same number of computational boundaries at the cylinder surface for the calculation of hydrodynamic forces in both directions which own the same length as one structural element in each time step hydrodynamic forces will be calculated in each thick strip and be transferred into uniformly distributed loads applied to the corresponding structural elements adopting the cubic spline interpolation method then the inline and the crossflow vibrations of the cylinder are calculated using the fem method through the newmark β algorithm which has been explained by tang 2002 and clough 2003 in detail then vibration displacements of all nodes in both directions can be obtained which will be used to update the computational mesh of each thick fluid strip the computational mesh update strategy is shown in fig 4 where the boundary points are uniformly distributed on the cylinder surface in each thick strip in order to guarantee the boundary mesh fitting the deformation shape of the corresponding cylinder part the boundary points at the same axial position will be given the same vibration displacements in both x and y directions from the cylinder through the cubic spline interpolation method the computational mesh will then be updated on the basis of the motions of the boundary points using the dynamic grid technique in the openfoam at each time step 3 viv prediction in the uniform flow condition 3 1 simulation model numerical simulations have been carried out based on the experiments of lehn 2003 and the three dimensional simulation of wang and xiao 2016 the model cylinder is located in the uniform flow with the cylinder aspect ratio l d 481 5 and the flow velocity u 0 2 m s main parameters of the model cylinder and the experimental setup are listed in table 1 all strips share the same computational mesh and boundary conditions detailed mesh around the cylinder in the thick fluid strip is shown in fig 5 the computational domain is 40d in the inline direction 20d in the crossflow direction and 1 100 l in the vertical direction as shown in fig 5 a where 10 thick fluid strips are uniformly located along the cylinder span the computational mesh distribution is shown in fig 5 c in order to capture physical quantities in the boundary layer of the cylinder such as the velocity u and the pressure p meshes near the cylinder surface are refined with no wall function used considering the choose of the sst k ω turbulent model and the re number the y is set to be around 1 0 in all simulations to guarantee that meshes in the boundary layer of the flexible cylinder are fine enough to improve the computational accuracy of hydrodynamic forces corresponding boundary conditions are set as shown in fig 5 b and c velocity inlet condition is specified at the inlet boundary and pressure outlet condition is applied in the outlet boundary wall condition is specified at the cylinder surface boundary while symmetry conditions are for the top bottom left and right boundaries the flexible cylinder is discretized into 200 structural elements with 201 nodes in total the time step is set as 0 001s to ensure the courant number co lower than 5 0 during the implicit solution process which guarantees the stability and the convergence rate in all simulations corresponding definition of the courant number is shown in eq 17 17 c o u δ t δ x where u is the flow velocity δt is the time step δx is the size of the computational mesh near the cylinder surface all simulations are computed in the high performance computing hpc clusters adopting the parallel computing method to increase the computing efficiency which decreases the computational time to around 20 30s for each time step correspondingly one node with 28 cores are adopted for every 5 0 million cells 3 2 mesh convergence study the computational mesh convergence study is carried out among three meshes with 2 12 million 3 07 million and 4 13 million computational cells respectively to choose the appropriate mesh as the basic computational model time history of vibration displacements along the cylinder in both directions among three mesh resolutions are shown in fig 6 it can be found that locations near z l 0 5 present stable viv phenomenon with comparatively large vibration amplitude in the crossflow direction with the equilibrium position kept around 0 as shown in fig 6 a c e while similar vibration features can be observed near z l 0 7 and 0 3 in the inline direction while the equilibrium position increases from around 0 2d to 0 6d and then decreases to 0 2d along the cylinder span fig 7 shows the vibration root mean square rms amplitude comparisons among experiments of lehn 2003 simulation results of wang and xiao 2016 and present simulation results in both directions the rms amplitude can be obtained through eq 18 and eq 19 18 a y r m s z t t s t e a y z t 2 19 a x r m s z t t s t e a x z t a x z 2 where a y rms is the crossflow rms amplitude a x rms is the inline rms amplitude z is the axial location t s is the start time of the chosen interval t e is the end time of the chosen interval a x z is the equilibrium position along the cylinder in the inline direction during the chosen interval the rms amplitudes are in good agreement along the cylinder span as shown in fig 7 a the maximum non dimensional rms vibration amplitude around 0 4d and the corresponding location around 0 55z l are captured accurately although comparatively larger errors exist in the inline rms amplitude comparisons as shown in fig 7 b both the middle mesh and the fine mesh capture the upper vibration rms amplitude point around 0 092d at 0 22z l while only the middle mesh captures the nether vibration rms amplitude point around 0 098d at 0 77z l moreover the rms amplitude of the middle mesh agrees better with the model experiment than that from wang and xiao 2016 especially in the inline direction based on the discussions above and taking the cost of computational resources into account the middle mesh with an axial thickness of 1 100 l is chosen as the basic computational model for the following simulations 3 3 strip thickness effects on the viv prediction fig 8 shows comparison on the vortex shedding feature of a flexible cylinder in the stepped flow condition between the two dimensional strip model and the thick strip model it can be seen that vortices shed from the cylinder surface are out of phase along the cylinder span as well as the wake structure from fig 8 a meanwhile three dimensional wake fields can be observed in fig 8 b and the wake structures will become more complicated around location where violent vibration appears effects of the three dimensional fluid strip thickness on viv responses are mainly discussed in this section 6 computational models with the fluid strip thickness varying from 1 200 l to 1 20 l are employed to study its influence on the viv prediction in total corresponding grid number of each case is shown in table 2 which increases from 1 06 million cells to 10 6 million cells three dimensional fluid strip models and the corresponding mesh distribution of one strip with different thickness are shown in fig 8 when the strip thickness is around 1 200 l the fluid strip only covers 5 percent of the cylinder length as shown in fig 9 a which is similar to the traditional two dimensional strip model when the strip thickness increases to 1 20 l the fluid strips cover half the cylinder length that can be considered similar to the three dimensional model as shown in fig 9 f all models are generated on the basis of the middle mesh above with the same grid distribution in the x y plane and the same layers per structural element length in the axial direction comparison on the crossflow rms amplitude among present simulation results the three dimensional simulation of wang and xiao 2016 and the experiment of lehn 2003 is shown in fig 10 obvious errors can be found between the simulation with 1 200 l strip thickness and the result of lehn 2003 the axial location corresponding to the maximum rms amplitude is over predicted at around 0 6 l compared to around 0 55 l in the experiment with the increase of the fluid strip thickness both the maximum rms amplitude and the corresponding axial location are predicted more accurately simulation errors decrease rapidly between present simulations and wang and xiao 2016 when the fluid strip thickness is larger than 1 100 l which also signifies that the three dimensional characteristics of the wake structures beginning to be captured at 1 100 l fluid strip thickness it can be concluded that the thin fluid strip thickness of the computational model may contribute to the inaccurate prediction of hydrodynamic forces which then leads to the prediction errors in cylinder vibrations the dependence of the fluid strip thickness on viv responses are dictated by the behavior of the wake structures in each thick strip vibration frequency responses along the cylinder and the corresponding modal weights instantaneous spanwise wake structures of the flow for different strip thickness are shown in fig 11 these figures are generated through extracting three contour surfaces from the three dimensional vorticity q calculated using the openfoam and then colored by the flow velocity u for clearer demonstration it can be observed that the wake structure presents two dimensional vortex shedding characteristics at thin strip thickness which is very similar to the result calculated from the traditional two dimensional strip model shown in fig 8 a the shedding vortices hardly deform in the axial direction and keep the cylindrical shape even though at the locations around z l 0 5 where drastic crossflow vibration happens and z l 0 25 and 0 75 where drastic inline vibration happens as shown in fig 11 a when the strip thickness increases to 1 100 l three dimensional vortex shedding phenomenon begins to appear especially at locations where drastic vibrations exist while the two dimensional wake structures can also be observed at locations with weak viv responses as shown in fig 11 b however the contour surface near the separation points along the cylinder span shows none wavy vortex generated near the cylinder surface due to the limitation of the strip thickness it also means that the axial correlation length is larger than the strip thickness of 1 100 l with the strip thickness increases to 1 50 l and the larger ones fully three dimensional wake structures cover almost all fluid strips as shown from fig 11 c f meanwhile the cylindrical type of three dimensional vorticity becomes twisty resulting from the vibrations in both directions and the axial correlation effects wake structures present similar features among the strip thickness of 3 100 l 1 25 l and 1 20 l which can be considered that the strip thickness is large enough to cover the correlation length and the three dimensionality is fully developed comparisons on the wake structures and the corresponding stream line graphs of the fifth strip between the strip thickness of 1 50 l and 1 20 l respectively are shown in fig 12 all two dimensional stream line graphs are extracted uniformly along the selected thick strip and colored using the same parameter as the wake structure it can be observed from fig 12 a f that a vortex has been shed from the cylinder surface and the distribution of the stream line around the vortex shows high similarity in the axial direction thus none wavy type of vortex appears and the shedding vortex near the cylinder will show the cylindrical shape however the three dimensional feature of the flow field will make the shedding vortex develop towards disordered and generate the discrete small vortices far from the cylinder surface as illustrated in fig 12 a which leads to the axial variation of the latter vortices with blue color an obvious wavy type of vortex can be observed in fig 12 g when the strip thickness reaches 1 20 l corresponding stream line graphs from fig 12 h r show remarkable variation on the velocity distribution at both the vicinity of the cylinder surface and the distal end of the flow field along the axial direction the magnitude of the contour region with red color under the cylinder fluctuates along the strip span synchronized with the axial deformation of the shedding wavy vortex shown in fig 12 g in order to analyze the modal vibration features of the flexible cylinder the modal decomposition method is adopted which has been verified by chaplin et al 2005a and fu et al 2018 the vibration displacements of the cylinder in both directions can be divided into a series of modal shapes as followed 20 ϕ n z sin n π l z 21 x z t n 1 n u n t ϕ n z 22 y z t n 1 n v n t ϕ n z where z is the axial location of the cylinder nodes l is the cylinder length n 1 2 3 and etc x z t is the inline displacement y z t is the crossflow displacement u n t is the time dependent modal weight in the inline direction v n t is the time dependent modal weight in the crossflow direction and n is the mode number in each time step the instantaneous modal weights of each mode can be calculated and the dominant vibration mode of the cylinder can be judged through the modal weight comparison during the analyzed interval non dimensional crossflow modal weights of the flexible cylinder for the first four orders with different strip thickness are shown in fig 13 it can be concluded that the dominant vibration mode keeps the same first mode in all simulation models in the crossflow direction as the experiment although the non dimensional modal weight of the second vibration mode reaches around 0 2 it is still covered by the first mode resulting in the hidden of the second mode meanwhile non dimensional modal weights of the third mode and the fourth mode are extremely small compared to the first mode that contribute to the single mode vibration phenomenon which agree with the vibration frequency responses in fig 14 the fast fourier transform algorithm fft is adopted to calculate the vibration frequency responses of nodes uniformly located along the cylinder span as shown in fig 14 it can be found that only one frequency peak corresponding to around 1 6 hz appears in almost all nodes the peak amplitude of the dominant vibration frequency increases and then decreases along the cylinder presenting similar variation as the vibration rms amplitude which contribute to the appearance of the first dominant vibration mode in fig 13 the dominant vibration frequency shows a narrow bandwidth when the strip thickness is 1 200 l with the increase of the strip thickness the bandwidth increases too and more peaks with comparative small values appear around the dominant vibration frequency that may result from the three dimensional feature of the flow field especially at large strip thickness model 4 viv prediction in the stepped flow condition 4 1 simulation model in order to verify the viv3d foam sjtu solver furtherly numerical simulations based on the experiments of chaplin et al 2005a and huera huarte 2006 are conducted comparisons have been conducted among the present simulations the experimental results and the published data in a detailed manner the lower 45 part of the vertical cylinder model is located in the uniform flow as shown in fig 5 a while the upper part is in still water that generates the stepped flow condition three groups of top tension t and flow velocities u are chosen main parameters of the cylinder model and the corresponding simulation conditions are shown in table 3 and table 4 the computational model and the corresponding mesh distribution based on the middle mesh case in the previous part are shown in fig 15 the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis is also adopted with the cylinder model been discrete into 200 elements during the calculation of structural vibrations through the fem method considering the computational cost and the computational efficiency the thickness of each fluid strip is set as 1 100 l that the three dimensional vortex shedding phenomenon will appear at locations where drastic axial deformation happens through researches of willden and graham 2001 2004 they found that a minimum of three fluid strips were required per vibration mode for the correct capture on the axial variation of the phasing of the hydrodynamic forces with respect to the cylinder vibration therefore 20 thick fluid strips containing 40 structural elements are used and uniformly located along the cylinder span which are sufficient to capture the maximum fourth mode in the crossflow direction and seventh mode in the inline direction thus the lower 9 strips are set the same flow velocity as the experiments and the flow velocity in the rest strip are set zero to simulate the still water condition the computational model is shown in fig 15 b while boundary conditions of each thick fluid strip are the same as that shown in fig 5 b there are 6 16 million cells in total and the mesh distribution in the x y plane is shown in fig 15 c which is similar to that shown in fig 5 c 4 2 comparisons on viv responses the experimental results from chaplin et al 2005a the blind prediction results from chaplin et al 2005a different simulation codes used in their researches and the present simulation results are compared in a detailed manner in this part as shown in table 5 the norsk hydro the usp university of são paulo the deepflow institut francais du pétrole and the vivic developed by graham and willden 2004 at imperial college london are simulation codes developed by former researchers using computational fluid dynamic techniques combined with two dimensional strip method it can be found that the predicted results on the maximum non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude are 0 772 and 0 791 in case 7 and case 9 using the viv3d foam sjtu solver which are closer to the experimental results of 0 764 and 0 784 than the simulation results from almost other simulation codes although the computational error reaches around 13 6 in case 8 that is larger than the result from the usp the validity of the solver can still be verified through comparisons above spatiotemporal vibration displacement contours in both the crossflow and the inline directions among three computational cases are shown in fig 16 the crossflow vibration shows the second mode shape in case 7 the third mode shape in case 8 and the fourth mode shape in case 9 while the typical standing wave phenomenon is observed from fig 16 a c and e it can be found that the non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude decreases from around 0 8 to 0 5 and then increases with both the top tension and the flow velocity increase meanwhile the corresponding inline mode shapes are the fourth mode the sixth mode and the seventh mode respectively the obvious travelling wave phenomenon can be observed during the time span and the non dimensional inline vibration amplitude behaves similar variation as that in the crossflow direction which decreases from around 0 2 to 0 15 and then increases to 0 25 comparatively the maximum non dimensional inline vibration amplitudes are 0 211 0 101 and 0 301 respectively in the experiments that is similar to the variation shown in the inline spatiotemporal contours from fig 16 b d and f the modal decomposition results and the corresponding modal vibration frequency in both directions among three computational conditions are shown in fig 17 through comparisons on the temporal modal weights among different vibration modes it can be concluded that both the crossflow and the inline vibrations present the single dominant vibration mode phenomenon corresponding vibration modes are the second mode the third mode and the fourth mode in the crossflow direction and the fourth mode the sixth mode and the seventh mode in the inline direction modal vibration features show high similarity compared with the spatiotemporal contours in fig 16 with the increase of the cylinder top tension and the flow velocity effects of higher vibration modes are enhanced obviously especially in the inline direction as shown in fig 17 e where values of the third modal weight is close to that of the dominant fourth mode however the controlling effects of the dominant vibration mode cover the effects of other vibration modes contributing to the behavior of the single mode vibration phenomenon comparisons on the dominant vibration modes between experiments of chaplin et al 2005a and present simulations are shown in table 6 where good agreements are obtained in all computational conditions the dominant inline vibration mode is twice of the dominant crossflow vibration mode in case 7 and case 8 while it decreases to 1 75 times of the dominant crossflow vibration mode in case 9 as for the corresponding dominant vibration frequency features it increases from around 1 0 hz to around 2 0 hz with an interval of around 0 5 hz in the crossflow direction along with the increase of the top tension and the flow velocity meanwhile the dominant inline vibration frequency increases from around 2 hz to around 4 hz with an interval of 1 hz which is twice of the dominant crossflow vibration frequency in all computational conditions comparisons on the dominant vibration frequencies between the experiments and the present simulations among three computational conditions in the crossflow direction are shown in table 7 the predicted dominant vibration frequencies are 0 902 hz 1 5 hz and 1 9 hz respectively from the present simulations while the experimental results present 0 995 hz 1 345 hz and 1 966 hz respectively among these cases the maximum computational error reaches 11 5 in case 8 and the minimum error only reaches 3 36 in case 9 corresponding vibration frequency contours along the cylinder span in both directions are shown in fig 18 it can be observed from fig 18 a c and e that the vibration frequency regions are mainly located around the dominant vibration frequency in the crossflow direction the variation of the frequency region along the cylinder span presents the same modes as shown in the vibration displacement contours in fig 16 meanwhile similar phenomenon can be observed from fig 18 b d and f in the inline direction the only difference is that lower vibration frequency components paly non negligible effects on viv responses in the inline direction contributing to the obvious first mode inline deformation of the cylinder especially at high re condition as shown in fig 18 f where the lower vibration frequency around 0 2 hz presents the same magnitude of spectral density as the dominant vibration frequency while the corresponding dominant vibration frequencies are 1 899 hz 2 9 hz and 3 897 hz respectively in the inline direction that are twice of the crossflow vibration frequencies the instantaneous wake structures of the cylinder with different top tensions and flow velocities are shown in fig 19 respectively it can be found that the obvious vortex shedding phenomenon can be observed on the lower part of the cylinder the wavy type of vortices near the separation points also appears especially at location where dramatic vibration occurs however the wake structures are not fully developed at all fluid strips due to the combined effects of the strip thickness and the corresponding vibration amplitude such as the third strip in fig 19 a and the fifth strip in fig 19 g contributing to the effect of the stepped flow condition the generated vortices in the lower nine strips are shedding in the inline direction while vortices in the upper eleven strips are shed mainly in the crossflow direction with comparative smaller magnitude as comparisons among fig 19 b e h and fig 19 c f i it can be concluded that the vortex shedding direction in the lower strips mainly controlled by the incoming flow while the vortex shedding direction in the upper strips is determined by the vibration strength of the cylinder in both directions with the increase of the top tension and the flow velocity the vortices strength and the three dimensional vortex shedding characteristic of the upper strips become more obvious which develops from the cylindrical vortices to the discrete small vortices as shown from fig 19 c f and i 5 conclusions the new viv3d foam sjtu solver is developed by using three dimensional strip model or named the thick strip model to modify the previous viv foam sjtu solver with considering the axial correlation of the flow field in each fluid strip and adopted to predict viv responses of flexible cylinders the validity of the viv3d foam sjtu solver has been verified through a series of comparisons among experimental results published data and present simulation results two benchmark experiments from lehn 2003 in the uniform flow condition and chaplin et al 2005a in the stepped flow condition are mainly chosen and compared in detail viv responses of the vibration rms amplitude the dominant vibration mode and the dominant vibration frequency from present simulations show good agreement with the experiments the fluid strip thickness dependence study is conducted in the uniform flow condition with the increase of the strip thickness the three dimensional vortex shedding phenomenon becomes more obvious and the wavy type of vortices can be observed near the separation points when the strip thickness is lower than 1 200 l the vortex shedding phenomenon presents high similarity to that calculated from the two dimensional strip model the flow fields will be fully developed when the corresponding strip thickness is larger than 3 100 l both the cylindrical type of vortices and the discrete vortices can be observed in the wake structures when the strip thickness is around 1 100 l combing the vortex

the axial length of the flexible cylinder the flow field of all fluid strips will be fully developed when the strip thickness reaches 3 100 l considering the cost of computational resources and the computational efficiency the strip thickness around 1 50 l is recommend for future researches keywords vortex induced vibration three dimensional strip model uniform flow stepped flow viv3d foam sjtu solver 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible riser has been extensively studied over the past decades around the world in order to understand the characteristic of viv experimental and numerical methods are mainly adopted corresponding reviews can be referred to sarpkaya 1979 2004 bearman 1984 2011 williamson and govardhan 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 huang et al 2009 wu et al 2012 chen et al 2016 and wan and duan 2017 as for model experiments viv of a flexible cylinder in steady flow conditions such as uniform flow sheared flow and stepped flow are mainly investigated tognarelli et al 2004 carried out experiments of a flexible riser in uniform and linearly sheared currents respectively to study the viv features in different flow conditions trim et al 2005 also carried out a series of experiments at the same flow conditions viv responses of a bare riser and a riser with various strake arrangements were mainly investigated chaplin et al 2005a 2005b conducted experiments of a vertical riser in stepped current with different top tension and the corresponding reynolds number re ranging from 3080 to 26600 lie and kaasen 2006 employed the modal analysis method that had been used by chaplin et al 2005b to analyze the vibration features of a large scale riser in linearly sheared flow song et al 2016 investigated the distribution of drag force coefficients along the flexible riser span experiencing sheared flow through model tests song et al 2011 sanaati and kato 2012 and gedikli and dahl 2017 carried out experiments of a flexible riser exposed to uniform flow too multi modes vibration effects of axial stiffness and pre tension and mode excitation hysteresis features were studied in order to fully investigate the flow field around the flexible cylinder the three dimensional numerical model is used in some researches holmes et al 2006 combined three dimensional cfd solutions with structural models in simulating viv of a straked riser huang et al 2007 huang and chen 2007 presented a cfd approach for viv prediction using the urans method on the three dimensional overset grid system numerical results on viv of a flexible riser experiencing uniform flow and sheared flow were in good agreement with experimental results and previous publication data wang and xiao 2016 adopted the large eddy simulation les method with the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme in simulating viv response of a riser in uniform flow and sheared flow respectively using the ansys mfx multi field solver although the three dimensional simulation method can reflect detailed flow characteristics costs of the corresponding computational resources and the computational time are extremely huge especially when the cylinder aspect ratio l d where l is the axial cylinder length and d is the cylinder diameter is very large therefore the traditional two dimensional strip method used to predict the viv response of risers was proposed by willden and graham 2001 2004 to reduce both the computational resources and the computational time into an acceptable range the strip method considered that the fluid flow was locally two dimensional without spanwise correlation and simplified the three dimensional fluid field into several two dimensional strips uniformly distributed along the cylinder span this method owns high computational efficiency and accuracy that has been verified through previous researches such as meneghini et al 2004 and yamamoto et al 2004 adopting the two dimensional strip method duan et al 2016a 2018 developed the viv foam sjtu solver and carried out numerical simulations on viv of a vertical riser exposed to the stepped current based on the experiments of chaplin et al 2005b to verify the validity of the solver duan et al 2016b 2017 then studied effects of the cylinder aspect ratio l d and the top tension t on viv response fu et al 2016 2017 fu and wan 2017 mainly studied the effects of the cylinder mass ratio m m m ρ where m is the mass of the cylinder and m ρ is the mass of the displaced water the current profile and the cylinder top end excitation on viv response of a single cylinder using the viv foam sjtu solver fu et al 2018 then further expanded the capacity of the solver in simulating viv of a flexible cylinder experiencing oscillatory flow and validate its reliability compared with standard model experiments of fu et al 2013 however the computational accuracy is hard to guarantee during high re number flow condition or complicated fluid structure interaction fsi problems combining the advantages of considering the axial correlation effects from the three dimensional method and the low computational resources and computational time cost from the traditional two dimensional strip method bao et al 2016 proposed the three dimensional strip model or named the generalized thick strip model for viv prediction of a long flexible cylinder using the direct numerical simulation dns method then bao et al 2019 conducted simulations on viv of a single cylinder in uniform flow comparisons between experimental results and simulation results proved the validity of the thick strip method in this paper the new viv3d foam sjtu solver is developed through modifying the previous viv foam sjtu solver by replacing the two dimensional strip model with the three dimensional strip model and is applied to predict viv response of a flexible cylinder exposed to the uniform flow and the stepped flow this paper is organized as follows the first section gives a brief introduction to the numerical methodology the second section presents comparisons on viv responses from present simulation experiments and published data in the uniform flow condition while the fluid strip thickness dependence study is also conducted in a detailed manner the third section verifies the modified solver through comparisons on viv features of a vertical flexible cylinder in stepped flow and the final section concludes the paper 2 numerical method 2 1 hydrodynamic governing equations hydrodynamic forces acted on the flexible cylinder are calculated from the viscous force and the pressure in each fluid strip integrated over all boundary meshes on the cylinder surface in order to solve the incompressible fluid flow locally the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method is employed while the sst k ω turbulence model put forward by menter 1993 is used to compute the reynolds stress with no wall functions used in present studies considering the cost of computational resources and the computational accuracy in the initial branch the rans method is more appropriate for the prediction of hydrodynamic forces than the large eddy simulation les method and the direct numerical simulation dns method in this paper and the rans method has been widely used in viv simulations such as duan et al 2017 2018 and fu et al 2018 the continuity and the momentum equations for turbulent flow are written as eq 1 and eq 2 1 u i x i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j 2 μ s i j ρ u j u i where μ is the constant dynamic viscosity ρ is the constant density s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the mean rate of the strain tensor ρ u j u i is referred as the reynolds stress τ i j computed by τ i j ρ u j u i 2 μ t s i j 2 3 ρ k δ i j where μ t is the turbulent viscosity and k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulent energy computing from the fluctuating velocity field δ i j is the kronecke function the sst k ω turbulence model put forward by menter 1993 consists of turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ω transport equations of k and ω can be written as eq 3 and eq 4 3 ρ k t τ i j u i x j β ρ ω k x j μ σ k μ t k x j 4 ρ ω t γ μ t τ i j u i x j β ρ ω 2 x j μ σ ω μ t ω x

outside the cylinder surface which is defined as followed 5 ϕ f 1 ϕ 1 1 f 1 ϕ 2 6 f 1 tanh arg 1 4 7 arg 1 min max k β ω d 500 ν d 2 ω 4 ρ σ ω 2 k c d k ω d 2 8 c d k ω max 2 ρ σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j 10 20 9 f 2 tanh arg 2 2 10 arg 2 max 2 k β ω d 500 ν d 2 ω where β 0 09 σ k 1 σ ω 1 β 1 a 1 γ 1 are the empirical coefficients in the k ω model and σ k 2 σ ω 2 β 2 γ 2 are the empirical coefficients in the k ε model 2 2 structural governing equations each thick fluid strip is independent and the connection between all strips is realized through the interpolation of the inline and the crossflow vibrations of the cylinder the flexible cylinder is assumed to be an euler bernoulli bending beam model with an axial pretension the vibration of the model is solved through the fem method and the structural governing equations in each structural element are written as eq 11 and eq 12 11 m x c x k x f x 12 m y c y k y f y where m c k are the mass the damping and the stiffness of the structural element f x f y are the inline and the crossflow hydrodynamic forces respectively hence the mass spring damping mck equations of the whole system can be expressed as eq 13 and eq 14 13 m x c x k x f h x 14 m y c y k y f h y where m c k are the mass damping and stiffness matrixes of the system f h x f h y are hydrodynamic force vectors in the inline and crossflow directions meanwhile the rayleigh damping is adopted to generate the damping matrix replacing the practical damping as shown in eq 15 and eq 16 15 c a 0 m a 1 k 16 a 0 a 1 2 ς f n 1 f n 2 2 π f n 1 f n 2 1 2 π where a 0 and a 1 are proportionality coefficient ς is the damping ratio f n 1 and f n 2 are the first and the second natural frequencies of the cylinder 2 3 three dimensional strip model the schematic diagram of the traditional two dimensional strip theory is shown in fig 1 due to the simplification on discretizing the three dimensional fluid field around the cylinder into several two dimensional fluid strips the axial correlation and the three dimensional characteristic of the shedding vortices are neglected resulting in the underestimation of the hydrodynamic forces especially at complicated flow fields then the underestimated hydrodynamic forces will be transferred to the structural field and contribute to the inaccurate prediction of the vibration amplitudes compared to the experimental results especially at high re number experimental conditions to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional two dimensional strip method bao et al 2016 proposed the generalized thick strip model considering the spanwise correlation of the flow field locally and the method had been validated in predicting viv responses of a flexible cylinder by bao et al 2019 in this paper the thick strip model has been adopted to modify the previous viv foam sjtu solver and develop a new viv3d foam sjtu solver through replacing the two dimensional fluid strips with locally three dimensional thick fluid strips as shown in fig 2 in our thick strip strategy the thickness of the thick fluid strip is an integer multiple of the structural element length as shown in fig 3 each thick strip owns its corresponding controlling axial length to conduct interpolation of the hydrodynamic forces and the vibration displacement between the thick fluid strip and the cylinder meanwhile each thick strip contains the same number of computational boundaries at the cylinder surface for the calculation of hydrodynamic forces in both directions which own the same length as one structural element in each time step hydrodynamic forces will be calculated in each thick strip and be transferred into uniformly distributed loads applied to the corresponding structural elements adopting the cubic spline interpolation method then the inline and the crossflow vibrations of the cylinder are calculated using the fem method through the newmark β algorithm which has been explained by tang 2002 and clough 2003 in detail then vibration displacements of all nodes in both directions can be obtained which will be used to update the computational mesh of each thick fluid strip the computational mesh update strategy is shown in fig 4 where the boundary points are uniformly distributed on the cylinder surface in each thick strip in order to guarantee the boundary mesh fitting the deformation shape of the corresponding cylinder part the boundary points at the same axial position will be given the same vibration displacements in both x and y directions from the cylinder through the cubic spline interpolation method the computational mesh will then be updated on the basis of the motions of the boundary points using the dynamic grid technique in the openfoam at each time step 3 viv prediction in the uniform flow condition 3 1 simulation model numerical simulations have been carried out based on the experiments of lehn 2003 and the three dimensional simulation of wang and xiao 2016 the model cylinder is located in the uniform flow with the cylinder aspect ratio l d 481 5 and the flow velocity u 0 2 m s main parameters of the model cylinder and the experimental setup are listed in table 1 all strips share the same computational mesh and boundary conditions detailed mesh around the cylinder in the thick fluid strip is shown in fig 5 the computational domain is 40d in the inline direction 20d in the crossflow direction and 1 100 l in the vertical direction as shown in fig 5 a where 10 thick fluid strips are uniformly located along the cylinder span the computational mesh distribution is shown in fig 5 c in order to capture physical quantities in the boundary layer of the cylinder such as the velocity u and the pressure p meshes near the cylinder surface are refined with no wall function used considering the choose of the sst k ω turbulent model and the re number the y is set to be around 1 0 in all simulations to guarantee that meshes in the boundary layer of the flexible cylinder are fine enough to improve the computational accuracy of hydrodynamic forces corresponding boundary conditions are set as shown in fig 5 b and c velocity inlet condition is specified at the inlet boundary and pressure outlet condition is applied in the outlet boundary wall condition is specified at the cylinder surface boundary while symmetry conditions are for the top bottom left and right boundaries the flexible cylinder is discretized into 200 structural elements with 201 nodes in total the time step is set as 0 001s to ensure the courant number co lower than 5 0 during the implicit solution process which guarantees the stability and the convergence rate in all simulations corresponding definition of the courant number is shown in eq 17 17 c o u δ t δ x where u is the flow velocity δt is the time step δx is the size of the computational mesh near the cylinder surface all simulations are computed in the high performance computing hpc clusters adopting the parallel computing method to increase the computing efficiency which decreases the computational time to around 20 30s for each time step correspondingly one node with 28 cores are adopted for every 5 0 million cells 3 2 mesh convergence study the computational mesh convergence study is carried out among three meshes with 2 12 million 3 07 million and 4 13 million computational cells respectively to choose the appropriate mesh as the basic computational model time history of vibration displacements along the cylinder in both directions among three mesh resolutions are shown in fig 6 it can be found that locations near z l 0 5 present stable viv phenomenon with comparatively large vibration amplitude in the crossflow direction with the equilibrium position kept around 0 as shown in fig 6 a c e while similar vibration features can be observed near z l 0 7 and 0 3 in the inline direction while the equilibrium position increases from around 0 2d to 0 6d and then decreases to 0 2d along the cylinder span fig 7 shows the vibration root mean square rms amplitude comparisons among experiments of lehn 2003 simulation results of wang and xiao 2016 and present simulation results in both directions the rms amplitude can be obtained through eq 18 and eq 19 18 a y r m s z t t s t e a y z t 2 19 a x r m s z t t s t e a x z t a x z 2 where a y rms is the crossflow rms amplitude a x rms is the inline rms amplitude z is the axial location t s is the start time of the chosen interval t e is the end time of the chosen interval a x z is the equilibrium position along the cylinder in the inline direction during the chosen interval the rms amplitudes are in good agreement along the cylinder span as shown in fig 7 a the maximum non dimensional rms vibration amplitude around 0 4d and the corresponding location around 0 55z l are captured accurately although comparatively larger errors exist in the inline rms amplitude comparisons as shown in fig 7 b both the middle mesh and the fine mesh capture the upper vibration rms amplitude point around 0 092d at 0 22z l while only the middle mesh captures the nether vibration rms amplitude point around 0 098d at 0 77z l moreover the rms amplitude of the middle mesh agrees better with the model experiment than that from wang and xiao 2016 especially in the inline direction based on the discussions above and taking the cost of computational resources into account the middle mesh with an axial thickness of 1 100 l is chosen as the basic computational model for the following simulations 3 3 strip thickness effects on the viv prediction fig 8 shows comparison on the vortex shedding feature of a flexible cylinder in the stepped flow condition between the two dimensional strip model and the thick strip model it can be seen that vortices shed from the cylinder surface are out of phase along the cylinder span as well as the wake structure from fig 8 a meanwhile three dimensional wake fields can be observed in fig 8 b and the wake structures will become more complicated around location where violent vibration appears effects of the three dimensional fluid strip thickness on viv responses are mainly discussed in this section 6 computational models with the fluid strip thickness varying from 1 200 l to 1 20 l are employed to study its influence on the viv prediction in total corresponding grid number of each case is shown in table 2 which increases from 1 06 million cells to 10 6 million cells three dimensional fluid strip models and the corresponding mesh distribution of one strip with different thickness are shown in fig 8 when the strip thickness is around 1 200 l the fluid strip only covers 5 percent of the cylinder length as shown in fig 9 a which is similar to the traditional two dimensional strip model when the strip thickness increases to 1 20 l the fluid strips cover half the cylinder length that can be considered similar to the three dimensional model as shown in fig 9 f all models are generated on the basis of the middle mesh above with the same grid distribution in the x y plane and the same layers per structural element length in the axial direction comparison on the crossflow rms amplitude among present simulation results the three dimensional simulation of wang and xiao 2016 and the experiment of lehn 2003 is shown in fig 10 obvious errors can be found between the simulation with 1 200 l strip thickness and the result of lehn 2003 the axial location corresponding to the maximum rms amplitude is over predicted at around 0 6 l compared to around 0 55 l in the experiment with the increase of the fluid strip thickness both the maximum rms amplitude and the corresponding axial location are predicted more accurately simulation errors decrease rapidly between present simulations and wang and xiao 2016 when the fluid strip thickness is larger than 1 100 l which also signifies that the three dimensional characteristics of the wake structures beginning to be captured at 1 100 l fluid strip thickness it can be concluded that the thin fluid strip thickness of the computational model may contribute to the inaccurate prediction of hydrodynamic forces which then leads to the prediction errors in cylinder vibrations the dependence of the fluid strip thickness on viv responses are dictated by the behavior of the wake structures in each thick strip vibration frequency responses along the cylinder and the corresponding modal weights instantaneous spanwise wake structures of the flow for different strip thickness are shown in fig 11 these figures are generated through extracting three contour surfaces from the three dimensional vorticity q calculated using the openfoam and then colored by the flow velocity u for clearer demonstration it can be observed that the wake structure presents two dimensional vortex shedding characteristics at thin strip thickness which is very similar to the result calculated from the traditional two dimensional strip model shown in fig 8 a the shedding vortices hardly deform in the axial direction and keep the cylindrical shape even though at the locations around z l 0 5 where drastic crossflow vibration happens and z l 0 25 and 0 75 where drastic inline vibration happens as shown in fig 11 a when the strip thickness increases to 1 100 l three dimensional vortex shedding phenomenon begins to appear especially at locations where drastic vibrations exist while the two dimensional wake structures can also be observed at locations with weak viv responses as shown in fig 11 b however the contour surface near the separation points along the cylinder span shows none wavy vortex generated near the cylinder surface due to the limitation of the strip thickness it also means that the axial correlation length is larger than the strip thickness of 1 100 l with the strip thickness increases to 1 50 l and the larger ones fully three dimensional wake structures cover almost all fluid strips as shown from fig 11 c f meanwhile the cylindrical type of three dimensional vorticity becomes twisty resulting from the vibrations in both directions and the axial correlation effects wake structures present similar features among the strip thickness of 3 100 l 1 25 l and 1 20 l which can be considered that the strip thickness is large enough to cover the correlation length and the three dimensionality is fully developed comparisons on the wake structures and the corresponding stream line graphs of the fifth strip between the strip thickness of 1 50 l and 1 20 l respectively are shown in fig 12 all two dimensional stream line graphs are extracted uniformly along the selected thick strip and colored using the same parameter as the wake structure it can be observed from fig 12 a f that a vortex has been shed from the cylinder surface and the distribution of the stream line around the vortex shows high similarity in the axial direction thus none wavy type of vortex appears and the shedding vortex near the cylinder will show the cylindrical shape however the three dimensional feature of the flow field will make the shedding vortex develop towards disordered and generate the discrete small vortices far from the cylinder surface as illustrated in fig 12 a which leads to the axial variation of the latter vortices with blue color an obvious wavy type of vortex can be observed in fig 12 g when the strip thickness reaches 1 20 l corresponding stream line graphs from fig 12 h r show remarkable variation on the velocity distribution at both the vicinity of the cylinder surface and the distal end of the flow field along the axial direction the magnitude of the contour region with red color under the cylinder fluctuates along the strip span synchronized with the axial deformation of the shedding wavy vortex shown in fig 12 g in order to analyze the modal vibration features of the flexible cylinder the modal decomposition method is adopted which has been verified by chaplin et al 2005a and fu et al 2018 the vibration displacements of the cylinder in both directions can be divided into a series of modal shapes as followed 20 ϕ n z sin n π l z 21 x z t n 1 n u n t ϕ n z 22 y z t n 1 n v n t ϕ n z where z is the axial location of the cylinder nodes l is the cylinder length n 1 2 3 and etc x z t is the inline displacement y z t is the crossflow displacement u n t is the time dependent modal weight in the inline direction v n t is the time dependent modal weight in the crossflow direction and n is the mode number in each time step the instantaneous modal weights of each mode can be calculated and the dominant vibration mode of the cylinder can be judged through the modal weight comparison during the analyzed interval non dimensional crossflow modal weights of the flexible cylinder for the first four orders with different strip thickness are shown in fig 13 it can be concluded that the dominant vibration mode keeps the same first mode in all simulation models in the crossflow direction as the experiment although the non dimensional modal weight of the second vibration mode reaches around 0 2 it is still covered by the first mode resulting in the hidden of the second mode meanwhile non dimensional modal weights of the third mode and the fourth mode are extremely small compared to the first mode that contribute to the single mode vibration phenomenon which agree with the vibration frequency responses in fig 14 the fast fourier transform algorithm fft is adopted to calculate the vibration frequency responses of nodes uniformly located along the cylinder span as shown in fig 14 it can be found that only one frequency peak corresponding to around 1 6 hz appears in almost all nodes the peak amplitude of the dominant vibration frequency increases and then decreases along the cylinder presenting similar variation as the vibration rms amplitude which contribute to the appearance of the first dominant vibration mode in fig 13 the dominant vibration frequency shows a narrow bandwidth when the strip thickness is 1 200 l with the increase of the strip thickness the bandwidth increases too and more peaks with comparative small values appear around the dominant vibration frequency that may result from the three dimensional feature of the flow field especially at large strip thickness model 4 viv prediction in the stepped flow condition 4 1 simulation model in order to verify the viv3d foam sjtu solver furtherly numerical simulations based on the experiments of chaplin et al 2005a and huera huarte 2006 are conducted comparisons have been conducted among the present simulations the experimental results and the published data in a detailed manner the lower 45 part of the vertical cylinder model is located in the uniform flow as shown in fig 5 a while the upper part is in still water that generates the stepped flow condition three groups of top tension t and flow velocities u are chosen main parameters of the cylinder model and the corresponding simulation conditions are shown in table 3 and table 4 the computational model and the corresponding mesh distribution based on the middle mesh case in the previous part are shown in fig 15 the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis is also adopted with the cylinder model been discrete into 200 elements during the calculation of structural vibrations through the fem method considering the computational cost and the computational efficiency the thickness of each fluid strip is set as 1 100 l that the three dimensional vortex shedding phenomenon will appear at locations where drastic axial deformation happens through researches of willden and graham 2001 2004 they found that a minimum of three fluid strips were required per vibration mode for the correct capture on the axial variation of the phasing of the hydrodynamic forces with respect to the cylinder vibration therefore 20 thick fluid strips containing 40 structural elements are used and uniformly located along the cylinder span which are sufficient to capture the maximum fourth mode in the crossflow direction and seventh mode in the inline direction thus the lower 9 strips are set the same flow velocity as the experiments and the flow velocity in the rest strip are set zero to simulate the still water condition the computational model is shown in fig 15 b while boundary conditions of each thick fluid strip are the same as that shown in fig 5 b there are 6 16 million cells in total and the mesh distribution in the x y plane is shown in fig 15 c which is similar to that shown in fig 5 c 4 2 comparisons on viv responses the experimental results from chaplin et al 2005a the blind prediction results from chaplin et al 2005a different simulation codes used in their researches and the present simulation results are compared in a detailed manner in this part as shown in table 5 the norsk hydro the usp university of são paulo the deepflow institut francais du pétrole and the vivic developed by graham and willden 2004 at imperial college london are simulation codes developed by former researchers using computational fluid dynamic techniques combined with two dimensional strip method it can be found that the predicted results on the maximum non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude are 0 772 and 0 791 in case 7 and case 9 using the viv3d foam sjtu solver which are closer to the experimental results of 0 764 and 0 784 than the simulation results from almost other simulation codes although the computational error reaches around 13 6 in case 8 that is larger than the result from the usp the validity of the solver can still be verified through comparisons above spatiotemporal vibration displacement contours in both the crossflow and the inline directions among three computational cases are shown in fig 16 the crossflow vibration shows the second mode shape in case 7 the third mode shape in case 8 and the fourth mode shape in case 9 while the typical standing wave phenomenon is observed from fig 16 a c and e it can be found that the non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude decreases from around 0 8 to 0 5 and then increases with both the top tension and the flow velocity increase meanwhile the corresponding inline mode shapes are the fourth mode the sixth mode and the seventh mode respectively the obvious travelling wave phenomenon can be observed during the time span and the non dimensional inline vibration amplitude behaves similar variation as that in the crossflow direction which decreases from around 0 2 to 0 15 and then increases to 0 25 comparatively the maximum non dimensional inline vibration amplitudes are 0 211 0 101 and 0 301 respectively in the experiments that is similar to the variation shown in the inline spatiotemporal contours from fig 16 b d and f the modal decomposition results and the corresponding modal vibration frequency in both directions among three computational conditions are shown in fig 17 through comparisons on the temporal modal weights among different vibration modes it can be concluded that both the crossflow and the inline vibrations present the single dominant vibration mode phenomenon corresponding vibration modes are the second mode the third mode and the fourth mode in the crossflow direction and the fourth mode the sixth mode and the seventh mode in the inline direction modal vibration features show high similarity compared with the spatiotemporal contours in fig 16 with the increase of the cylinder top tension and the flow velocity effects of higher vibration modes are enhanced obviously especially in the inline direction as shown in fig 17 e where values of the third modal weight is close to that of the dominant fourth mode however the controlling effects of the dominant vibration mode cover the effects of other vibration modes contributing to the behavior of the single mode vibration phenomenon comparisons on the dominant vibration modes between experiments of chaplin et al 2005a and present simulations are shown in table 6 where good agreements are obtained in all computational conditions the dominant inline vibration mode is twice of the dominant crossflow vibration mode in case 7 and case 8 while it decreases to 1 75 times of the dominant crossflow vibration mode in case 9 as for the corresponding dominant vibration frequency features it increases from around 1 0 hz to around 2 0 hz with an interval of around 0 5 hz in the crossflow direction along with the increase of the top tension and the flow velocity meanwhile the dominant inline vibration frequency increases from around 2 hz to around 4 hz with an interval of 1 hz which is twice of the dominant crossflow vibration frequency in all computational conditions comparisons on the dominant vibration frequencies between the experiments and the present simulations among three computational conditions in the crossflow direction are shown in table 7 the predicted dominant vibration frequencies are 0 902 hz 1 5 hz and 1 9 hz respectively from the present simulations while the experimental results present 0 995 hz 1 345 hz and 1 966 hz respectively among these cases the maximum computational error reaches 11 5 in case 8 and the minimum error only reaches 3 36 in case 9 corresponding vibration frequency contours along the cylinder span in both directions are shown in fig 18 it can be observed from fig 18 a c and e that the vibration frequency regions are mainly located around the dominant vibration frequency in the crossflow direction the variation of the frequency region along the cylinder span presents the same modes as shown in the vibration displacement contours in fig 16 meanwhile similar phenomenon can be observed from fig 18 b d and f in the inline direction the only difference is that lower vibration frequency components paly non negligible effects on viv responses in the inline direction contributing to the obvious first mode inline deformation of the cylinder especially at high re condition as shown in fig 18 f where the lower vibration frequency around 0 2 hz presents the same magnitude of spectral density as the dominant vibration frequency while the corresponding dominant vibration frequencies are 1 899 hz 2 9 hz and 3 897 hz respectively in the inline direction that are twice of the crossflow vibration frequencies the instantaneous wake structures of the cylinder with different top tensions and flow velocities are shown in fig 19 respectively it can be found that the obvious vortex shedding phenomenon can be observed on the lower part of the cylinder the wavy type of vortices near the separation points also appears especially at location where dramatic vibration occurs however the wake structures are not fully developed at all fluid strips due to the combined effects of the strip thickness and the corresponding vibration amplitude such as the third strip in fig 19 a and the fifth strip in fig 19 g contributing to the effect of the stepped flow condition the generated vortices in the lower nine strips are shedding in the inline direction while vortices in the upper eleven strips are shed mainly in the crossflow direction with comparative smaller magnitude as comparisons among fig 19 b e h and fig 19 c f i it can be concluded that the vortex shedding direction in the lower strips mainly controlled by the incoming flow while the vortex shedding direction in the upper strips is determined by the vibration strength of the cylinder in both directions with the increase of the top tension and the flow velocity the vortices strength and the three dimensional vortex shedding characteristic of the upper strips become more obvious which develops from the cylindrical

probability distribution bending stress 1 introduction compared with nearshore aquaculture cages offshore cages have many challenges such as complex mooring mode higher construction difficulty and higher safety requirement which are caused by complex offshore environment including larger waves strong wind and turbulent current when these environmental loads act on the cage it will cause devastating damage furthermore if the cage structure is not strong enough the huge economic losses will be caused therefore it is of great significance to study the dynamic response of deep sea cage under these environmental loads dynamic response of single floating collar single net and cage under hydrodynamic loads are the main three parts of the dynamic response research of the cage by model tests and numerical simulations kristiansen and faltinsen 2009 studied the two dimensional hydrodynamical problems of a floating circular cylinder in waves lee et al 2009 established a mass spring

net the structure was programmed on the basis of finite element method and the mooring system of the structure was designed lader and enerhaug 2005 and lader et al 2007 conducted experiments on the hydrodynamic forces acting on the net including different current velocity and different solid ratio of net the conclusion was that the size and form of the cage had a great influence on its

irregular waves the heave motion of the floater satisfies the gauss distribution after time frequency transformation by combining different wave spectrums with bending stress formulas the most probable maximum normalized bending stress distribution on the floater is extended from circular frequency of zero to arbitrary value which revises the original calculation method and enriches the calculation conditions 2 basic theory and numerical model as a slender flexible structure the basic components of the cage such as floating collar net will produce large deformation in the process of movement in the past most scholars regarded the floating collar as a rigid body and used the rigid body hypothesis to analyze nowadays there are many researchers who consider the floating collar as flexible body to calculate and analyze in this paper morison s empirical formula is used as the basic calculation theory and the linear wave airy wave in deep water is used as the wave theory of numerical simulation the floating collar and net are equivalent the floating collar is simulated by buoyancy distribution method li and fu 2013 truss element is used to simulate the net by mesh clustering method however when the buoyancy distribution method is used the buoyancy of the overlapping area of the coupling beams cannot be calculated by the software the larger the number of coupling beams the greater the error is to reduce the overlapping area the method is improved to reduce the number of coupling beams from 11 to 7 furthermore the semi submerged floating collar is ensured to calculate buoyancy with enough coupling beams which reduces the computational difficulty and improves the computational stability and efficiency 2 1 wave conditions 2 1 1 regular wave in

faltinsen 1990 proposed that the narrowband wave spectrum satisfies rayleigh distribution with the prerequisite of the instantaneous wave elevation satisfying the gauss distribution if the random variables obey the probability distribution of position and scale parameter the probability density function is 7 f x 1 2 π σ exp x μ 2 2 σ 2 recorded as χ n μ σ 2 the mathematical expectation is μ

section is on the waterline when it is semi immersed and the neutral axis of each coupling beam is in the horizontal direction 2 4 numerical model 2 4 1 floating collar floating collar model simulated by coupled beam is shown in fig 2 the coordinate origin of the geodetic coordinate system x y z is defined as the circle center of the floating collar the positive direction of the x axis is the direction of wave propagation and the z axis is positive upward in the vertical direction the mooring system is simulated by horizontal non linear springs since the mooring lines can only be tensioned but not pressed the spring tension in compression is defined as zero and the pre tension of spring needs to be defined before modeling it is necessary to calculate the gravity and buoyancy of the floating collar the parameters of the single floating collar are shown in table 1 and the cross sectional properties of 7 beams are shown in table 2 where d f and d s f is the diameter and section diameter of the floating collar t f is the thickness of the pipe e f is the elastic modulus ρ f is the density of the floating collar and s f m is the stiffness of the mooring lines the section properties of each distributed beams are calculated and listed in table 2 where h represents the relative distance from the center of each distributed beam section to the center of the whole floater section r and i respectively symbolize the radius and inertia moment of each distributed beam section the density and elastic modules of each beam are set as 512 kg m3 and 4901 4401 mpa respectively 2 4 2 cage the numerical model of cage is shown in fig 3 the mooring system of the cage is also simulated by the nonlinear spring with horizontal arrangement table 3 shows the parameters of cage 3 dynamic response of floating collar under regular and irregular waves 3 1 dynamic response of floating collar under regular waves the wave conditions used in the numerical simulation are shown in table 4 the wave period of the test model is 1 6 s and the ratio of the experimental model to the numerical simulation of the collar is 1 20 due to the dominant wave in the operating conditions only the froude similarity is considered in the calculation the wave period used in the numerical simulation by froude similarity criterion is 7 2s where h λ is wave steepness t m is experiment period t s is numerical period h is wave height according to formula 5 c m 2 0 c d 1 2 d 0 3 u 0 ρ 1024 u v p and a p can be calculated by table 4 the heave motion comparison between 7 and 11 distributed coupled beams under different wave conditions are depicted in fig 4 the abscissa is the ratio of the motion time t to the wave period t s and the ordinate is the ratio of the heave amplitude η 33 of the motion to the wave amplitude a when the wave steepness is large such as h λ 1 15 and h λ 1 30 the heave motion curves of the 7 and 11 coupled beams have non smoothness near the extreme points when the wave steepness is small such as h λ 1 60 the peak portion of 7 coupled beams is more reasonable than that of the 11 coupled beams compared with original buoyancy distribution method the improved buoyancy distribution method reduces the errors caused by the overlap of coupled beams lowers the difficulty of calculation and improves the stability and efficiency of calculation it can achieve the purpose of calculating the buoyancy of the floating collar immersed in the underwater part 3 2 dynamic responses of floating collar under irregular waves considering the accuracy and efficiency of calculation 71 regular waves are superposed to simulate the irregular waves the frequency range of regular wave is from 2 0 rad s to 12 5 rad s the frequency interval is 0 15 rad s the significant wave height is 0 16 m and the peak period is 1 6 s as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 in this paper γ 2 3 2 1 hydroelastic displacement responses the floating collar size used is shown in table 5 under irregular waves with significant wave height of 0 16 m and spectral peak period of 1 6s the displacements of point a b c and d on the single floating collar are shown in fig 7 there exist similarities between the motion response of a single floating collar in irregular waves and that in regular waves under the action of the nonlinear wave force the floating collar will also produce displacement in x direction furthermore due to the structural deformation the point b and d have obvious displacement in y direction and the absolute motion response displacements of the two points are equal compared with single floating collar there is no obvious displacement of point b and d in y direction on the cage because of the large net coat damping 3 2 2 probability distribution of heave motion the essence of fourier principle is that any continuous measured time domain signal can be expressed by infinite superposition of the sinusoidal signals with different frequencies the fourier transform algorithm based on this principle can accumulatively calculate the frequency amplitude and phase of different sinusoidal signals in the original signal therefore the frequency domain distribution of the heave motion response of floating collar under irregular waves is obtained by fft as shown in fig 8 the comparison between the response amplitude distribution of the floating collar heave motion based on fft and the gauss distribution is shown in fig 8 the blue solid line is the response amplitude of the floating collar heave motion in frequency domain the horizontal coordinate ω is the circular frequency the vertical coordinate s h e a v e is the response amplitude of the floating collar heave motion in frequency domain and ζ is dimensionless coefficient in this paper ζ 28 the black solid line is the gauss distribution satisfying χ n 3 927 0 5 faltinsen 1990 proposed that the narrowband wave spectrum satisfies rayleigh distribution on the premise that the instantaneous wave elevation satisfies the gauss distribution according to fig 8 the frequency domain distribution of the response amplitude of heave motion approximately satisfies the expected 3 927 gauss distribution with a variance of 0 5 but there are some errors the main sources of the errors are as follows 1 since the irregular wave is generated by random wave theory the heave motion of the floating collar will inevitably produce errors under this approximate simulation method 2 fft program of matlab may lead to some errors which are mainly related to sampling frequency and sampling time the characteristics of fft determine that higher sampling frequency and longer sampling time do not ensure more accurate calculation results hence the sampling frequency and sampling time need to be properly selected however fig 8 reflects the reliability of irregular wave spectrum generation in this paper to a certain extent and provides theoretical basis for numerical calculation and experiment of floating collar and cage 3 2 3 response spectrum of heave motion according to equation 8 transfer function between heave motion of floating collar and spectrum can be obtained here θ 0 c 0 015 m b w 0 03 m d 1 5 m a 33 and b 33 can be calculated by li and faltinsen 2018 fig 9 shows transfer function between heave motion of floating collar and the spectrum related to the circular frequency the abscissa ω is the circular frequency and the ordinate t 3 c is the absolute value of the transfer function it can be concluded from fig 9 that the value of the transfer function tends to 1 when ω goes to 0 namely the heave motion of the floating collar is approximating the motion of the wave with the increase of the circular frequency i e the wavelength increases the transfer function decays rapidly at first then changes like wave form and each peak value of the transfer function decreases continuously according to equations 2 and 4 fig 10 and fig 11 are jonswap wave spectrum and issc wave spectrum respectively where h s i 0 12 m and t s i 1 7 s are respectively based on froude similarity when the floating collar is under the action of irregular waves the response spectrum of its heave motion is 16 s i 3 ω θ t 3 c ω θ 2 s ω s ω is the selected wave spectrum fig 12 and fig 13 are response spectra of heave motion of the floating collar under jonswap and issc spectrum in frequency domain respectively the abscissa ω is the circular frequency and the ordinate s i j o n s w a p and si issc are the spectral density of heave motion response of the floating collar since the response spectrum of heave motion in frequency domain of the floating collar is the product of the square of transfer function and the spectrum it can be concluded from figs 9 13 that the wave spectrum has a great influence on response spectrum of the floating collar motion in frequency domain because circular frequencies corresponding to the peak energy points of jonswap spectrum and issc spectrum are different the peak value of the motion response amplitude is different from that of the multiplied transfer function it can be concluded that response amplitude of floating collar motion in issc spectrum has only one obvious peak value while in jonswap spectrum there are two obvious peaks and the peaks corresponding to the circular frequency is the same as the maximum energy peak value corresponding to the circle frequency therefore in actual sea conditions it is important to determine and select the spectrum when judging the response amplitude of collar heave motion under irregular waves 3 2 4 the most probable maximum normalized bending stress compared with nearshore area the application of deep water gravity cage in the offshore area faces several new problems such as construction difficulty mooring complexity cage overweight and wave dissipation equipment installation due to long term exposure to complex and harsh sea conditions the net cage will withstand various environmental loads such as wind wave and current and will also be affected by environmental corrosion and marine biological attachment besides structural safety problems are prone to cause damage to the entire cage structure in addition over extrusion of cage space results in insufficient water circulation and nutrition in the cage which leads to structural and functional failures therefore the analysis of the bending stress of floating collar structure under irregular waves is of great significance to the functional design and safety application of gravity cages in deep water in this section the most probable maximum normalized bending stress of different size collars is calculated when the circular frequency is 0 and the circular frequency is 0 10 rad s under different wave spectra the comparison of different sizes of collars is shown in table 6 because of symmetry of the structure the x axis is taken as the symmetrical axis and only half of the floating collar results are taken for analysis fig 14 shows the most probable maximum normalized bending stress of floating collars at different scales when the circular frequency is zero or in irregular waves χ σ is the most probable maximum normalized bending stress h 1 3 is significant wave height and the stress position on floating collars is determined by x r cos β it can be concluded from fig 14 that the trend of the most probable maximum normalized bending stress curve of floating collars is basically the same under different wave spectra but the amplitude is different by comparing fig 14 a b and fig 14 e f it can be concluded that the most probable maximum normalized bending stress amplitudes of floating collars with different sizes are different under issc wave spectrum compared with fig 14 c d and fig 14 g h under jonswap wave spectrum the most probable maximum normalized bending stress amplitudes of floating collars are basically the same thus the size of the collar has great influence on the most probable maximum normalized bending stress amplitudes under issc wave spectrum when the circular frequency is 0 rad s the bending stress figure is basically symmetrical since added mass tends to be infinite and damping coefficient tends to be 0 when the frequency is 0 while added mass is related to the mode when the circular frequency is 0 rad s to 10 rad s the bending stress of the floating collar at head sea is greater than that at following sea and the calculation results are more accurate as shown in fig 14 e f g h 4 dynamic response of cage under waves and current 4 1 motion comparison the wave conditions of cage are shown in table 7 where t c is wave period h λ is wave steepness h c is wave height v 1 and v 2 are different current velocities the heave motion of cage under different wave periods and current velocities are shown in fig 15 the abscissa t is the time of motion and the ordinate is response amplitude of the cage under waves and current h λ is wave steepness the blue solid line black dotted line and red solid line in the figure represent with wave steepness of 1 15 1 30 and 1 60 respectively fig 15 shows that heave motion of the cage under regular waves is not necessarily symmetrical with respect to the water surface with the increase of wavelength heave motion amplitude of the cage increases gradually and heave motion curves gradually moves towards the horizontal plane when the space between each coupled beam is the same as the magnitude of wave height the buoyancy of the floating collar is sensitive to the change of wave height due to the change of buoyancy heave motion of the cage presents strong non linearity 4 2 net comparison fig 16 a e is a comparison of the first 5 s of the cage the left column and the right column are the cages that define the twine property and the cages that do not define the twine property it can be concluded that when the twine property is not defined the twine of the net is loose and the motion of the net under waves is not in conformity with the actual situation when the twine property is defined the whole cage moves under regular waves which accords with the actual deformation of the net therefore the definition of the twine property has a great influence on the motion pattern of cage the deformation of the net under regular waves and current is compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 17 and fig 18 the comparison between experimental and the numerical simulation of the net deformation are depicted in figs 17 and 18 the sea conditions are v 2 0 2 m s h l 1 15 t 1 6 s and v 2 0 2 m s h l 1 15 t 1 0 s respectively the left column is the experimental simulation of net deformation the time interval of each photo is about t 5 seconds the right column is the numerical simulation of the net deformation the same time interval is applied to obtain a series of numerical simulation results from the comparison of the left column and the right column of figs 17 and 18 it can be concluded that under the same condition the net deformation of experimental tests and numerical simulations have a high degree of conformity the equivalent floating collar used in the numerical cage can simulate the movement of the actual cage well 5 conclusions in this paper the dynamic response characteristics of floating collar and cage are studied by numerical simulation the buoyancy distribution method is improved to make the time history curves of the floating collar heave motion under low wave steepness more reasonable reduce the difficulty of calculation and improve the stability and efficiency of calculation with the increase of wavelength and buoyancy heave motion of the cage gradually moves towards the horizontal plane under regular waves when the spacing between coupling beams is the same order of magnitude as that of the wave height the buoyancy of the floating collar is very sensitive to the change of wave height because of the change of the buoyancy the motion of the cage will have strong non linearity heave motion of the floating collar under irregular waves satisfies the gauss distribution by time frequency transformation the transfer function decays rapidly and fluctuates in a wave form with continuous decrease of peak values different wave spectrums have a great influence on the response spectrums of the floating collar heave motion the most probable maximum normalized bending stress amplitude under issc spectrum is closely related to the size of floating collar when the circular frequency is arbitrary the bending stress at the head sea of the floating collar is greater than that of the following sea and the bending stress curve is no longer symmetrical author contributions h q and p l supervised the project s y

flexible body to calculate and analyze in this paper morison s empirical formula is used as the basic calculation theory and the linear wave airy wave in deep water is used as the wave theory of numerical simulation the floating collar and net are equivalent the floating collar is simulated by buoyancy distribution method li and fu 2013 truss element is used to simulate the net by mesh clustering method however when the buoyancy distribution method is used the buoyancy of the overlapping area of the coupling beams cannot be calculated by the software the larger the number of coupling beams the greater the error is to reduce the overlapping area the method is improved to reduce the number of coupling beams from 11 to 7 furthermore the semi submerged floating collar is ensured to calculate buoyancy with enough coupling beams which reduces the computational difficulty and improves the computational stability and efficiency 2 1 wave conditions 2 1 1 regular wave in

and k are the generalized mass matrix damping matrix and stiffness matrix of the structure respectively the forces acting on the floater and cage are gravity g buoyancy f b wave excitation force f w and current force f c respectively 2 2 2 gauss distribution the probability distribution of heave motion of floating collar is closely associated with that of the instantaneous wave elevation faltinsen 1990 proposed that the narrowband wave spectrum satisfies rayleigh distribution with the prerequisite of the instantaneous wave elevation satisfying the gauss distribution if the random variables obey the probability distribution of position and scale parameter the probability density function is 7 f x 1 2 π σ exp x μ 2 2 σ 2 recorded as χ n μ σ 2 the mathematical expectation is μ and the variance is σ 2 the expected value μ of the distribution determines its position and its standard deviation σ determines its magnitude 2 2 3 transfer function the response spectrum of floating collar heave motion can be treated as the combination of wave spectrums and transfer function according to the transfer function between ship heave motion and wave näslund et al the transfer function between floating collar heave motion and wave is deduced that is 8 t 3 c ω θ e q u 3 ω 2 sin k ω cos θ π r k ω cos θ where 9 e q u 3 ω e k ω c ρ g b w ω 2 a 33 ω b 33 i ρ g b w π d ρ c b w π d a 33 π

section is on the waterline when it is semi immersed and the neutral axis of each coupling beam is in the horizontal direction 2 4 numerical model 2 4 1 floating collar floating collar model simulated by coupled beam is shown in fig 2 the coordinate origin of the geodetic coordinate system x y z is defined as the circle center of the floating collar the positive direction of the x axis is the direction of wave propagation and the z axis is positive upward in the vertical direction the mooring system is simulated by horizontal non linear springs since the mooring lines can only be tensioned but not pressed the spring tension in compression is defined as zero and the pre tension of spring needs to be defined before modeling it is necessary to calculate the gravity and buoyancy of the floating collar the parameters of the single floating collar are shown in table 1 and the cross sectional properties of 7 beams are shown in table 2 where d f and d s f is the diameter and section diameter of the floating collar t f is the thickness of the pipe e f is the elastic modulus ρ f is the density of the floating collar and s f m is the stiffness of the mooring lines the section properties of each distributed beams are calculated and listed in table 2 where h represents the relative distance from the center of each distributed beam section to the center of the whole floater section r and i respectively symbolize the radius and inertia moment of each distributed beam section the density and elastic modules of each beam are set as 512 kg m3 and 4901 4401 mpa respectively 2 4 2 cage the numerical model of cage is shown in fig 3 the mooring system of the cage is also simulated by the nonlinear spring with horizontal arrangement table 3 shows the parameters of cage 3 dynamic response of floating collar under regular and irregular waves 3 1 dynamic response of floating collar under regular waves the wave conditions used in the numerical simulation are shown in table 4 the wave period of the test model is 1 6 s and the ratio of the experimental model to the numerical simulation of the collar is 1 20 due to the dominant wave in the operating conditions only the froude similarity is considered in the calculation the wave period used in the numerical simulation by froude similarity criterion is 7 2s where h λ is wave steepness t m is experiment period t s is numerical period h is wave height according to formula 5 c m 2 0 c d 1 2 d 0 3 u 0 ρ 1024 u v p and a p can be calculated by table 4 the heave motion comparison between 7 and 11 distributed coupled beams under different wave conditions are depicted in fig 4 the abscissa is the ratio of the motion time t to the wave period t s and the ordinate is the ratio of the heave amplitude η 33 of the motion to the wave amplitude a when the wave steepness is large such as h λ 1 15 and h λ 1 30 the heave motion curves of the 7 and 11 coupled beams have non smoothness near the extreme points when the wave steepness is small such as h λ 1 60 the peak portion of 7 coupled beams is more reasonable than that of the 11 coupled beams compared with original buoyancy distribution method the improved buoyancy distribution method reduces the errors caused by the overlap of coupled beams lowers the difficulty of calculation and improves the stability and efficiency of calculation it can achieve the purpose of calculating the buoyancy of the floating collar immersed in the underwater part 3 2 dynamic responses of floating collar under irregular waves considering the accuracy and efficiency of calculation 71 regular waves are superposed to simulate the irregular waves the frequency range of regular wave is from 2 0 rad s to 12 5 rad s the frequency interval is 0 15 rad s the significant wave height is 0 16 m and the peak period is 1 6 s as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 in this paper γ 2 3 2 1 hydroelastic displacement responses the floating collar size used is shown in table 5 under irregular waves with significant wave height of 0 16 m and spectral peak period of 1 6s the displacements of point a b c and d on the single floating collar are shown in fig 7 there exist similarities between the motion response of a single floating collar in irregular waves and that in regular waves under the action of the nonlinear wave force the floating collar will also produce displacement in x direction furthermore due to the structural deformation the point b and d have obvious displacement in y direction and the absolute motion response displacements of the two points are equal compared with single floating collar there is no obvious displacement of point b and d in y direction on the cage because of the large net coat damping 3 2 2 probability distribution of heave motion the essence of fourier principle is that any continuous measured time domain signal can be expressed by infinite superposition of the sinusoidal signals with different frequencies the fourier transform algorithm based on this principle can accumulatively calculate the frequency amplitude and phase of different sinusoidal signals in the original signal therefore the frequency domain distribution of the heave motion response of floating collar under irregular waves is obtained by fft as shown in fig 8 the comparison between the response amplitude distribution of the floating collar heave motion based on fft and the gauss distribution is shown in fig 8 the blue solid line is the response amplitude of the floating collar heave motion in frequency domain the horizontal coordinate ω is the circular frequency the vertical coordinate s h e a v e is the response amplitude of the floating collar heave motion in frequency domain and ζ is dimensionless coefficient in this paper ζ 28 the black solid line is the gauss distribution satisfying χ n 3 927 0 5 faltinsen 1990 proposed that the narrowband wave spectrum satisfies rayleigh distribution on the premise that the instantaneous wave elevation satisfies the gauss distribution according to fig 8 the frequency domain distribution of the response amplitude of heave motion approximately satisfies the expected 3 927 gauss distribution with a variance of 0 5 but there are some errors the main sources of the errors are as follows 1 since the irregular wave is generated by random wave theory the heave motion of the floating collar will inevitably produce errors under this approximate simulation method 2 fft program of matlab may lead to some errors which are mainly related to sampling frequency and sampling time the characteristics of fft determine that higher sampling frequency and longer sampling time do not ensure more accurate calculation results hence the sampling frequency and sampling time need to be properly selected however fig 8 reflects the reliability of irregular wave spectrum generation in this paper to a certain extent and provides theoretical basis for numerical calculation and experiment of floating collar and cage 3 2 3 response spectrum of heave motion according to equation 8 transfer function between heave motion of floating collar and spectrum can be obtained here θ 0 c 0 015 m b w 0 03 m d 1 5 m a 33 and b 33 can be calculated by li and faltinsen 2018 fig 9 shows transfer function between heave motion of floating collar and the spectrum related to the circular frequency the abscissa ω is the circular frequency and the ordinate t 3 c is the absolute value of the transfer function it can be concluded from fig 9 that the value of the transfer function tends to 1 when ω goes to 0 namely the heave motion of the floating collar is approximating the motion of the wave with the increase of the circular frequency i e the wavelength increases the transfer function decays rapidly at first then changes like wave form and each peak value of the transfer function decreases continuously according to equations 2 and 4 fig 10 and fig 11 are jonswap wave spectrum and issc wave spectrum respectively where h s i 0 12 m and t s i 1 7 s are respectively based on froude similarity when the floating collar is under the action of irregular waves the response spectrum of its heave motion is 16 s i 3 ω θ t 3 c ω θ 2 s ω s ω is the selected wave spectrum fig 12 and fig 13 are response spectra of heave motion of the floating collar under jonswap and issc spectrum in frequency domain respectively the abscissa ω is the circular frequency and the ordinate s i j o n s w a p and si issc are the spectral density of heave motion response of the floating collar since the response spectrum of heave motion in frequency domain of the floating collar is the product of the square of transfer function and the spectrum it can be concluded from figs 9 13 that the wave spectrum has a great influence on response spectrum of the floating collar motion in frequency domain because circular frequencies corresponding to the peak energy points of jonswap spectrum and issc spectrum are different the peak value of the motion response amplitude is different from that of the multiplied transfer function it can be concluded that response amplitude of floating collar motion in issc spectrum has only one obvious peak value while in jonswap spectrum there are two obvious peaks and the peaks corresponding to the circular frequency is the same as the maximum energy peak value corresponding to the circle frequency therefore in actual sea conditions it is important to determine and select the spectrum when judging the response amplitude of collar heave motion under irregular waves 3 2 4 the most probable maximum normalized bending stress compared with nearshore area the application of deep water gravity cage in the offshore area faces several new problems such as construction difficulty mooring complexity cage overweight and wave dissipation equipment installation due to long term exposure to complex and harsh sea conditions the net cage will withstand various environmental loads such as wind wave and current and will also be affected by environmental corrosion and marine biological attachment besides structural safety problems are prone to cause damage to the entire cage structure in addition over extrusion of cage space results in insufficient water circulation and nutrition in the cage which leads to structural and functional failures therefore the analysis of the bending stress of floating collar structure under irregular waves is of great significance to the functional design and safety application of gravity cages in deep water in this section the most probable maximum normalized bending stress of different size collars is calculated when the circular frequency is 0 and the circular frequency is 0 10 rad s under different wave spectra the comparison of different sizes of collars is shown in table 6 because of symmetry of the structure the x axis is taken as the symmetrical axis and only half of the floating collar results are taken for analysis fig 14 shows the most probable maximum normalized bending stress of floating collars at different scales when the circular frequency is zero or in irregular waves χ σ is the most probable maximum normalized bending stress h 1 3 is significant wave height and the stress position on floating collars is determined by x r cos β it can be concluded from fig 14 that the trend of the most probable maximum normalized bending stress curve of floating collars is basically the same under different wave spectra but the amplitude is different by comparing fig 14 a b and fig 14 e f it can be concluded that the most probable maximum normalized bending stress amplitudes of floating collars with different sizes are different under issc wave spectrum compared with fig 14 c d and fig 14 g h under jonswap wave spectrum the most probable maximum normalized bending stress amplitudes of floating collars are basically the same thus the size of the collar has great influence on the most probable maximum normalized bending stress amplitudes under issc wave spectrum when the circular frequency is 0 rad s the bending stress figure is basically symmetrical since added mass tends to be infinite and damping coefficient tends to be 0 when the frequency is 0 while added mass is related to the mode when the circular frequency is 0 rad s to 10 rad s the bending stress of the floating collar at head sea is greater than that at following sea and the calculation results are more accurate as shown in fig 14 e f g h 4 dynamic response of cage under waves and current 4 1 motion comparison the wave conditions of cage are shown in table 7 where t c is wave period h λ is wave steepness h c is wave height v 1 and v 2 are different current velocities the heave motion of cage under different wave periods and current velocities are shown in fig 15 the abscissa t is the time of motion and the ordinate is response amplitude of the cage under waves and current h λ is wave steepness the blue solid line black dotted line and red solid line in the figure represent with wave steepness of 1 15 1 30 and 1 60 respectively fig 15 shows that heave motion of the cage under regular waves is not necessarily symmetrical with respect to the water surface with the increase of wavelength heave motion amplitude of the cage increases gradually and heave motion curves gradually moves towards the horizontal plane when the space between each coupled beam is the same as the magnitude of wave height the buoyancy of the floating collar is sensitive to the change of wave height due to the change of buoyancy heave motion of the cage presents strong non linearity 4 2 net comparison fig 16 a e is a comparison of the first 5 s of the cage the left column and the right column are the cages that define the twine property and the cages that do not define the twine property it can be concluded that when the twine property is not defined the twine of the net is loose and the motion of the net under waves is not in conformity with the actual situation when the twine property is defined the whole cage moves under regular waves which accords with the actual deformation of the net therefore the definition of the twine property has a great influence on the motion pattern of cage the deformation of the net under regular waves and current is compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 17 and fig 18 the comparison between experimental and the numerical simulation of the net deformation are depicted in figs 17 and 18 the sea conditions are v 2 0 2 m s h l 1 15 t 1 6 s and v 2 0 2 m s h l 1 15 t 1 0 s respectively the left column is the experimental simulation of net deformation the time interval of each photo is about t 5 seconds the right column is the numerical simulation of the net deformation the same time interval is applied to obtain a series of numerical simulation results from the comparison of the left column and the right column of figs 17 and 18 it can be concluded that under the same condition the net deformation of experimental tests and numerical simulations have a high degree of conformity the equivalent floating collar used in the numerical cage can simulate the movement of the actual cage well 5 conclusions in this paper the dynamic response characteristics of floating collar and cage are studied by numerical simulation the buoyancy distribution method is improved to make the time history curves of the floating collar heave motion under low wave steepness more reasonable reduce the difficulty of calculation and improve the stability and efficiency of calculation with the increase of wavelength and buoyancy heave motion of the cage gradually moves towards the horizontal plane under regular waves when the spacing between coupling beams is the same order of magnitude as that of the wave height the buoyancy of the floating collar is very sensitive to the change of wave height because of the change of the buoyancy the motion of the cage will have strong non linearity heave motion of the floating collar under irregular waves satisfies the gauss distribution by time frequency transformation the transfer function decays rapidly and fluctuates in a wave form with continuous decrease of peak values different wave spectrums have a great influence on the response spectrums of the floating collar heave motion the most probable maximum normalized bending stress amplitude under issc spectrum is closely related to the size of floating collar when the circular frequency is arbitrary the bending stress at the head sea of the floating collar is greater than that of the following sea and the bending stress curve is no longer symmetrical author contributions h q and p l supervised the project s y

21899,in the present study a new partially averaged navier stokes model based on a modified sst k ω model msst pans is proposed with particular emphasis on the capability to predict the cavitating flow by considering the surface curvature effect the unsteady cavitating flow around a naca0015 hydrofoil is investigated by numerical simulation using the msst pans model the sst k ω model and the sst k ω pans sst pans model results indicate that the msst pans model predicts the more accurate cavitation shedding dynamics including the cavitation inception development split and collapse than the sst k ω and the sst pans models the analysis using the vorticity transport equation depicts that the vortex dilatation and vortex baroclinic torque terms play the dominant role in producing the cavitating vortex during the inception and development of the cavitation further the cavitating vortex shedding downstream induces severe pressure fluctuations on the hydrofoil surface near the trailing edge of the hydrofoil the dominant frequency predicted by the msst pans model is in accordance with the frequency of the cavitating vortex evolution the study confirms that the msst pans model is a promising method to simulate the cavitating flow over a hydrofoil with consideration of surface curvature which performs more accurately with little increase of computational cost keywords msst pans turbulence model hydrofoil cavitation surface curvature 1 introduction cavitating flow occurs as the pressure drops below the local saturation vapor pressure the cavitation shedding with strong flow separation is a complex phenomenon inducing vibration noise surface erosion etc ji et al 2015 long et al 2018 in the past decades cavitation structures over hydrofoils have been investigated extensively by experiments astolfi et al 2000 reisman et al 1998 wang et al 2001 these studies depicted that there was a periodical cavity inception and collapse and partial sheet cavities broken up and rolled up into bubble clouds periodically due to various limitations of measurement techniques it is still difficult to visualize the transient cavitating flow patterns through traditional experiments thus lots of attempts and applications on the cfd simulations have been carried out based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method to capture the cavitation structures as well as flow separation coutier delgosha et al 2007 ducoin et al 2012 koukouvinis et al 2017 yaras and grosvenor 2003 although the main flow characteristics are predicted successfully in the simulations the turbulence model is crucial in cavitating flow simulations because cavitation is basically unsteady and is significant to reveal the cavitation vortex interaction during cavity development however the conventional rans method always shows the weakness in predicting unsteady cavitating flows especially with consideration of surface curvature on the other hand the direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les model cheng et al 2020 need huge computational cost for most engineering applications inspired by the hybrid turbulence model paradigm proposed by speziale 1998 with the combination of the rans and les method the partially averaged navier stokes model pans is recently proposed by girimaji 2006 which is regarded as a bridge between rans model and dns model in a pans model the resolution level is quantified by two parameters i e unresolved to total ratios of kinetic energy f k and dissipation f ε especially when f k 1 the pans model becomes the conventional rans model and it is shifted to dns model when f k 0 recently the pans model based on the k ε model has been utilized and validated in many benchmark cases such as flows past a cylinder jeong and girimaji 2010 ranjan and dewan 2015 cavitation flows over a hydrofoil ji et al 2012 and turbulent flows over a backward facing step frendi et al 2007 huang et al 2017 recently different turbulence models are treated as the parent models right after the standard k ε pans ske pans model such as the pans based on k ω model wilcox 1988 proposed by lakshmipathy and girimaji 2006 the sst pans based on the sst k ω model menter 1994 developed by luo luo 2019 luo et al 2014 2015 and the rng k ε pans based on rng k ε model presented by liu liu et al 2014 it is noted that the pressure distribution drag coefficient and velocity profiles predicted by the sst pans model agree well with the experimental data as well as the results by detached eddy simulation des however for most flow simulations the effects of surface curvature are not treated satisfactorily which is dependent on the turbulence models though the algebraic reynolds stress models hellsten and wallin 2009 show good capacity in some simulations owing to its nonlinear formulation of reynold stress the computation cost is relatively high the rans model coupled with nonlinear eddy viscosity turbulence models is preferable in many industry configurations where some non linear items are introduced for the reynolds stress while the computation cost changes little owing to the popularity of the menter sst k ω model several modifications have been treated on the model coefficients in the menter sst k ω model such as a 1 and β based on the comparison of large number of numerical simulations with the experimental results unfortunately those modifications are time consuming and the surface curvature is not taken into account yet some trials focusing on the rotation function are carried out to modify the production term of turbulent kinetic energy p k spalart and shur 1997 multiplied the production term in the s a model by a rotation function f r1 to include the curvature effect smirnov and menter 2008 then further modified the production term of the sst k ω model in a wide range of both wall bounded and free shear flows with rotation and streamline their results indicated that the modifications significantly improved the accuracy of the menter sst model when compared with dns predictions and experimental data besides hybrid rans models based on the sst k ω model are also presented because the standard k ε model shows poor performance in the simulation of strong swirling flows bredberg bredberg et al 2002 transfered the k ε model to k ω model to remove the freestream sensitivity in the ω equation based on this method shu 2011 proposed a modified sst k ω model msst model with combination the realizable k ε model and menter sst k ω model this model was tested in the case of a centrifugal pump and achieved a better accordance with the experiment based on the previous researches the present study proposes a new modified pans turbulence model named as msst pans which regards the msst model as the parent model the objective of this study is to validate the feasibility and capacities of the msst pans model for predicting transient cavitating turbulent flows with consideration of surface curvature the outline of the paper is as follows after the introduction in the section 1 the general governing equations are illustrated in the section 2 in section 3 the test case and simulation setups are introduced for the cavitating turbulent flow over a hydrofoil comparisons with different turbulence models and discussions are presented in section 4 to demonstrate the potential capability of the msst pans model finally some concluding remarks are drawn based on the results 2 governing equations the comprehensive derivation of the pans model was described in detail in the ref girimaji 2006 and ref lakshmipathy and girimaji 2006 in the flied of multiphase flow the vapor and liquid are regarded as single continuous fluid based on the homogeneous mixture

realizability the realizable k ε model with a set of unified model coefficients performs superior to the standard k ε model for several flows including rotating homogeneous shear flows boundary free shear flows and channel flow thus the msst model is quite suitable for the turbulent flows considering the larger reverse flow high shear stress and high pressure gradient flow when the streamlines

model the simulation results are compared with the available experimental data as well as the numerical results by two turbulence models i e sst k ω model and the sst k ω pans model named as sst pans the computation domain of the flow over naca0015 hydrofoil mounted at the attack angle of six degree is shown in fig 1 a the corresponding experimental measurement was carried out with the hydrofoil having span width of 70 0 mm yu et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 a the domain is 8c long and 3c wide where c represents the chord length of the hydrofoil i e 70 mm the inlet plane is 2c upstream the leading edge le of the hydrofoil and the outlet plane is 5c downstream the trailing edge te of the hydrofoil hexahedral mesh o h type mesh is generated around the naca0015 hydrofoil by the ansys icem 18 2 in the present study the mesh independence test was performed by comparing the variations of the drag coefficient c d and the lift coefficient c l defined as follows 31 c d d r a g 0 5 ρ v 2 c s p a n c l l i f t 0 5 ρ v 2 c s p a n where the v is the inlet flow velocity and span stands for the spanwise width of the hydrofoil the results shown in table 1 indicate that no difference is observed using the mesh 3 and mesh 4 therefore the mesh 3 consisting of around 154 thousand cells is selected as the final mesh resolution the detailed mesh around the hydrofoil is shown in fig 1 b in order to prove and compare two dimensional cavity structures with the three dimensional one the computation domains having the spanwise width of 0 5c ji et al 2015 and 1 mm are selected to study the spanwise width independence the mesh distribution on streamwise direction is the same and the only difference is the node number in the spanwise direction the cavities at three instants are shown in fig 2 t cycle represents the evolution period of the cavity results show that the larger span width could resolve three dimensional cavity structures in the spanwise direction but the cavitation behavior in the streamwise direction is very similar at each instant for two cases since our study aims to emphasize the streamwise evolution of cavitation and vortex the span width is set as 1 mm for simulation to reduce the computational cost thus the span width of the following simulation is set as 1 mm this kind of simplification is proved to be an effective method to capture the main cavitating flows characteristic which is also recommended by coutier delgosha et al 2003 yang et al 2018 in the study water at 25 c is chosen for the flow medium the inlet velocity v 7 2 m s is imposed at the inlet section with the corresponding reynolds number re ρv c μ 5 105 the static pressure is designated at the outlet section in accord with cavitation number σ p p v 0 5ρ l u 2 0 65 unsteady simulations of the cavitating flow are carried out through the commercial cfd code ansys cfx three different turbulence models i e sst k ω model sst pans model and msst pans model are utilized and compared high resolution is set for advection scheme and turbulence numerics while the second order backward euler is used for transient scheme the unsteady time step of 0 05t ref 4 86 10 4 is chosen in the following calculation where t ref c v to obtain accurate results the max residuals for numerical convergence of the unsteady calculation are set as 10 6 the result on the residuals distribution using msst pans model on the 2d hydrofoil is shown in fig 3 because there is usually intensive cavity oscillation in the cavitating turbulent flow yu et al 2018 the residual profiles fluctuate in the range of 10 4 and 10 6 which is regarded as small enough for the current numerical simulation to reach a good convergence 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation validation fig 4 shows the comparisons of the cavity evolution in one typical oscillation period the left column is the experimental image and the right is the numerical result simulated by msst pans model the cavity structure is shown by vapor air volume fraction of α v 0 1 for a more clear insight 3d hydrofoil with the spanwise width of 0 5c is adopted a black broken line is plotted to show the rear part of the cloud cavity position it can be noted that the simulation and experimental results show the same tendency of the cavity evolutions from the instant of t 0 to t 0 3 6t cycle the sheet cavity grows gradually and reaches the trailing edge of the hydrofoil at the instant of t 0 4 6t cycle the rear part of the sheet cavity begins to detach from the hydrofoil which is also predicted by the msst pans model at last from the instant of t 0 5 6t cycle to t 0 6 6t cycle the cavity attaching to the leading edge remains in a steady state and the cloud cavity near the rear part sheds gradually thus the comparison of cavity distribution as well as cavitation evolution confirms that the numerical simulation predicted by the msst pans model agrees fairly well with the experimental result 4 2 cavitation evolution fig 5 compares the cavitation evolution predicted by different turbulence models with the experimental results for convenience the period of cavitation evolution t cycle is divided into 7 instants marked from t 0 to t 0 6 6 t cycle corresponding to i vii respectively the experiment shows that at instant i cavity inception occurs and a small sheet cavity attaches at the le of the hydrofoil the sheet cavity then grows gradually till instant iii and the rear part of the sheet cavity begins to detach from the hydrofoil and be split at instant iii the cavity breaks down and the shed cavity moves downstream at instant v at the instant vi another cavity shedding occurs and the detached cavities become cloud cavity as observed in the experiment cavitation inception begins again for the subsequent cavitation evolution cycle at instant vii fig 5 b c and d show the cavity structures according to iso surface of the vapor volume fraction α v 0 1 predicted by sst k ω sst pans and msst pans model respectively it is noted that the sst k ω model predicts the cavity oscillation at the rear part but the sheet cavity doesn t shed from the hydrofoil on the contrary the simulation results using the sst pans model as well as msst pans model show good agreement with the experimental images however compared with the sst pans model the msst pans model shows better accuracy in predicting cavitation evolution depicted by the experiment for examples at instant iv the sst pans model fails to predict the small cavity collapse near the te of the hydrofoil while the msst pans model predicts the similar phenomenon as the experiment at instant vi the sst pans model underestimates the sheet cavity at the le of the hydrofoil while the msst pans model estimates the same visible sheet cavity as the experiment thus the msst pans model can capture more accurate cavitating flow structures with the same mesh resolution the corresponding evolutions of the streamline and vorticity predicted by three turbulent models are presented in fig 6 during cavitation evolution the flow separation is apparently taking place as the cavitating flow fluctuates ji et al 2015 the results indicate that the sst k ω model predicts a very simple separation oscillation near the te of the hydrofoil a flat vortex shedding over the separation zone and a slim vortex with negative vorticity downstream the te it is also interesting that both sst pans model and msst pans model predict more complicated separation flow as well as vortex shedding near the te however compared with the sst pans model the msst pans model shows a good capacity on predicting clear boundaries of separation and vortex at time instant vi three separated vortices are captured by the msst pans model whose prediction shows rapid response of cavity evolution and is sensitive to the streamline curvature change due to cavitation 4 3 cavitation vortex interaction it is well known that the transition from sheet cavity to cloud cavity results in an apparent vortex evolution in this subsection the vorticity transport equation is used to investigate the cavitation vortex interaction predicted by three turbulence models the formulation of the vorticity transport equation is shown in eq 32 32 d ω dt ω v ω v ρ m p ρ m 2 ν m ν t 2 ω in eq 32 the first term on the right hand side is the vortex stretching term by the velocity gradients representing the stretching and tilting effect of a vortex the second term is the vortex dilation owing to volumetric expansion or contraction representing the effect of fluid compressibility the third term is the baroclinic torque due to the misalign between density and pressure gradients the last term is the viscous dissipation due to viscous diffusion of the vorticity which can be neglected owing to its smallest effect on the vortex transport for the flow with high reynolds number ji et al 2015 fig 7 compares the time averaged contours of the vapor volume fraction and vortex stretching vortex dilatation and baroclinic torque terms using the three turbulence models results in fig 7 a show different vapor volume fraction by three turbulence models as the experimental images shown in fig 5 the sheet cavity occurs at the le of the hydrofoil develops through the surface of the hydrofoil and tends to collapse near the te of the hydrofoil the sheet cavity attaching to the leading edge remains in a steady state while the cloud cavity near the rear part sheds gradually which indicates that the vapor fluctuates more intensively at the te than that at the le of the hydrofoil thus the msst pans model gives the most reasonable result compared with its counterparts where the vapor volume fraction is underestimated at the te of the hydrofoil predicted by the sst k ω model while it is overestimated at the le of the hydrofoil predicted by the sst pans model fig 7 b d shows that the vortex stretching term vortex dilation term as well as vortex baroclinic torque respectively as shown in the fig 7 b the sst k ω model is not as sensitive as the sst pans model and msst pans model to predict the stretching and tilting effect of a vortex as observed in the experiment the sheet cavity grows gradually along the hydrofoil where the stretching and tilting effect is more significant however the sst pans model underestimates this kind of effect along the hydrofoil thus the msst pans model shows the most reasonable result among three turbulence models besides comparing these three terms shown in the fig 7 b fig 7 d the magnitudes of the averaged vortex dilatation term are larger than other terms indicating the fluid compressibility has great effect on the vorticity production in the cavitating turbulent flows fig 8 gives the transient results predicted by the msst pans model in one typical cavitation cycle t cycle shown in fig 6 at the time instant i the magnitude of the baroclinic torque term is highest near the te where the vortex fluctuates severely from time instant ii to iv the sheet cavity at the le develops to the te along the hydrofoil surface as explained earlier the local boundary layer becomes thicker and the vortex dilatation and baroclinic torque terms increase remarkably becoming the main mechanism producing the cavitating vortex during this period the baroclinic torque term is negligible near the attached cavity region le where no separation is observed after the sheet cavity split into two parts at instant v the cavity is rolled up and begins to shed off near the te of the hydrofoil and the flow along the hydrofoil surface is extremely turbulent the cloud cavity occurs at the suction side of the hydrofoil where the vorticity changes significantly it is also confirmed that the magnitudes of the vortex dilation term and the vortex baroclinic torque term are larger compared with that of the vortex stretching term the results clearly demonstrate the strong vortex cavitation interaction in the cloud cavitation as illustrated above a strong correlation between the sheet cavity and vorticity structures is proved and clarified by the msst pans model which gives more reasonable insight for cavitating turbulent flow compared to other turbulence models 4 4 pressure fluctuations around hydrofoil once the cavity vortex interaction occurs the pressure fluctuates intensively along the hydrofoil surface owing to the cavity and vortex evolution fig 9 shows the instantaneous cavity and vortex structures in one typical evolution period i e t cycle note that the numerical results in these figures are predicted by the msst pans model the instantaneous cavity structure is also shown using the iso surface of the vapor volume fraction α v 0 1 and the corresponding vortical structures around the hydrofoil is described through the iso surface of q criterion q 4600 s 1 as shown in figs 9 and 5 the evolution of the natural cavitation and the vortex can be divided into several stages i e inception instant i development instant ii iv spilt and shedding instant v vii the monitoring points are set along the hydrofoil surface corresponding to the place with distance of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9c shown in the fig 9 from the le at instant ii the rear part of the cavity detaches from the hydrofoil surface and there are two vortices attached on the hydrofoil near the monitoring point p3 from instant iii v the vortex upstream p3 shrinks but the vortex downstream p3 expands toward the le and inflates normal to the hydrofoil as cavitation develops as cavity sheds from the hydrofoil at instant vi the expanded vortex breaks down and propagates downstream over the monitoring points p4 and p5 to investigate the pressure fluctuations characteristics in the cavitation vortex interaction the pressure coefficient c p is defined in eq 33 33 c p p i p 0 5 ρ v 2 where p i is the instantaneous pressure at monitoring point and the overbar represents static pressure at the outlet section fig 10 gives the pressure fluctuations predicted by the msst pans model in one cavitation evolution period t cycle as the cavity inception occurs in the middle of the hydrofoil p3 the magnitude of the c p increases significantly as the cavity propagates downstream to the p4 and p5 iii the magnitude of the c p decreases dramatically at the instant of iv v the te of the hydrofoil is covered with the large scale of the cavity and vortex while the c p remains in a low value right after that vi as the cavity collapses the magnitude of the c p on each point increases rapidly again finally at the instant of vii the vortices shed downstream and the pressure fluctuates dramatically owing to the unstable flow flied even though the evolution process is completed within a quite short time 0 058s the vortex cavity shedding is very important to produce pressure fluctuations along the hydrofoil surface fig 11 further presents the pressure fluctuations in frequency domain on these five monitoring points by fast fourier transform fft with 20 cycles data owing to the same pace between the cavity and vortex evolution shown in the fig 9 it is easy to understand the dominant frequency f n is equal to the cavity vortex evolution frequency f cycle 1 t cycle along the flow direction i e from p1 to p5 the frequency spectrum distribution is similar but the amplitude of the dominant frequency f n increases gradually the amplitude on p1 is the smallest while it reaches to the maximum on the p5 thus it is proved from the perspective of frequency spectrum that the vortex cavity fluctuates more severely near the te of the hydrofoil and the cavity evolution speed is equal to the vortex evolution based on current cavitation model 4 5 time averaged fk distributions in these pans simulations the unresolved to total ratio of kinetic energy f k is calculated based on the physical grid and local flow fields which affects the accuracy of the results fig 12 displays the f k distributions together with vorticity contours using the sst pans and msst pans model it can be noted that the value of f k is lower as the flow is fully turbulent the f k is below the 0 5 near the te of the hydrofoil where cavity shedding occurs and it augments gradually downstream the hydrofoil near the upper wall bounded region the value of f k is bounded to unity indicating that the pans simulations switch back to rans in this region although the f k distribution shows similar using these two pans models the low magnitude region predicted by the msst pans near the te of the hydrofoil is relative larger than the sst pans model this indicates the more turbulent scales are resolved rather than modelled using the msst pans model which contributes to reaching a more accuracy result all calculations were conducted using intel xeon 5670 processors 2 93 ghz and 12 mb cache in tsinghua national laboratory for information science and technology if the calculation time t r of the sst k ω model is set as the reference time the calculation cost for the sst pans model is 1 15t r and for msst pans model is 1 16t r thus the computational costs for the sst pans model and msst pans model are very close and just little increases compared with the conventional sst k ω model in the future the msst pans model is promising for wide application in various industries 5 conclusions a modified partially averaged navier stokes pans msst pans model based on the modified sst k ω turbulence model has been performed to predict the transient cavitating flows around a two dimensional naca0015 hydrofoil detailed comparisons between the available experimental data and the numerical simulations using different turbulence models are conducted the results indicate that cavitation shedding dynamics behavior including the cavity inception development split and collapse predicted by the sst pans and msst pans model show a good accordance with the experimental observation taking the advantages of the realizable k ε model the flow structures near the wall bounded region are predicted more reasonably specially the transient evolution such as the attached cavity at leading edge le of the hydrofoil cavity split in the middle of the hydrofoil and cavity collapse at trailing edge te of the hydrofoil is simulated more accurately by the msst pans the sst k ω model however failed to predict the apparent cavity evolution the timely averaged vapor volume fraction is well predicted by the msst pans model while it is underestimated at the te of the hydrofoil by the sst k ω model and overestimated at the le of the hydrofoil by the sst pans model during the inception and development of cavitation the sheet cavity grows at le and propagates to the te of the hydrofoil it is noted that the vortex dilatation and vortex baroclinic torque term play a dominant role during cavitation inception and propagation since the compressibility of the vapor has great effect on producing the cavitating vortex the vortex cavity shedding downstream consequently induces severe pressure fluctuations large pressure fluctuations are observed near the te of the hydrofoil and the dominant frequency predicted in the frequency spectrum is equal to the cavity vortex evolution frequency the study confirms that compared with the sst k ω and sst pans model the msst pans model has the distinctive characteristics in simulating the turbulent flows with high shear rates with consideration of surface curvature due to better accuracy and equivalent calculation resource costs the msst pans model is promising in the industrial application to predict the cavitating flow over a hydrofoil with consideration of surface curvature further applications of the present model to the

21899,in the present study a new partially averaged navier stokes model based on a modified sst k ω model msst pans is proposed with particular emphasis on the capability to predict the cavitating flow by considering the surface curvature effect the unsteady cavitating flow around a naca0015 hydrofoil is investigated by numerical simulation using the msst pans model the sst k ω model and the sst k ω pans sst pans model results indicate that the msst pans model predicts the more accurate cavitation shedding dynamics including the cavitation inception development split and collapse than the sst k ω and the sst pans models the analysis using the vorticity transport equation depicts that the vortex dilatation and vortex baroclinic torque terms play the dominant role in producing the cavitating vortex during the inception and development of the cavitation further the cavitating vortex shedding downstream induces severe pressure fluctuations on the hydrofoil surface near the trailing edge of the hydrofoil the dominant frequency predicted by the msst pans model is in accordance with the frequency of the cavitating vortex evolution the study confirms that the msst pans model is a promising method to simulate the cavitating flow over a hydrofoil with consideration of surface curvature which performs more accurately with little increase of computational cost keywords msst pans turbulence model hydrofoil cavitation surface curvature 1 introduction cavitating flow occurs as the pressure drops below the local saturation vapor pressure the cavitation shedding with strong flow separation is a complex phenomenon inducing vibration noise surface erosion etc ji et al 2015 long et al 2018 in the past decades cavitation structures over hydrofoils have been investigated extensively by experiments astolfi et al 2000 reisman et al 1998 wang et al 2001 these studies depicted that there was a periodical cavity inception and collapse and partial sheet cavities broken up and rolled up into bubble clouds periodically due to various limitations of measurement techniques it is still difficult to visualize the transient cavitating flow patterns through traditional experiments thus lots of attempts and applications on the cfd simulations have been carried out based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method to capture the cavitation structures as well as flow separation coutier delgosha et al 2007 ducoin et al 2012 koukouvinis et al 2017 yaras and grosvenor 2003 although the main flow characteristics are predicted successfully in the simulations the turbulence model is crucial in cavitating flow simulations because cavitation is basically unsteady and is significant to reveal the cavitation vortex interaction during cavity development however the conventional rans method always shows the weakness in predicting unsteady cavitating flows especially with consideration of surface curvature on the other hand the direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les model cheng et al 2020 need huge computational cost for most engineering applications inspired by the hybrid turbulence model paradigm proposed by speziale 1998 with the combination of the rans and les method the partially averaged navier stokes model pans is recently proposed by girimaji 2006 which is regarded as a bridge between rans model and dns model in a pans model the resolution level is quantified by two parameters i e unresolved to total ratios of kinetic energy f k and dissipation f ε especially when f k 1 the pans model becomes the conventional rans model and it is shifted to dns model when f k 0 recently the pans model based on the k ε model has been utilized and validated in many benchmark cases such as flows past a cylinder jeong and girimaji 2010 ranjan and dewan 2015 cavitation flows over a hydrofoil ji et al 2012 and turbulent flows over a backward facing step frendi et al 2007 huang et al 2017 recently different turbulence models are treated as the parent models right after the standard k ε pans ske pans model such as the pans based on k ω model wilcox 1988 proposed by lakshmipathy and girimaji 2006 the sst pans based on the sst k ω model menter 1994 developed by luo luo 2019 luo et al 2014 2015 and the rng k ε pans based on rng k ε model presented by liu liu et al 2014 it is noted that the pressure distribution drag coefficient and velocity profiles predicted by the sst pans model agree well with the experimental data as well as the results by detached eddy simulation des however for most flow simulations the effects of surface curvature are not treated satisfactorily which is dependent on the turbulence models though the algebraic reynolds stress models hellsten and wallin 2009 show good capacity in some simulations owing to its nonlinear formulation of reynold stress the computation cost is relatively high the rans model coupled with nonlinear eddy viscosity turbulence models is preferable in many industry configurations where some non linear items are introduced for the reynolds stress while the computation cost changes little owing to the popularity of the menter sst k ω model several modifications have been treated on the model coefficients in the menter sst k ω model such as a 1 and β based on the comparison of large number of numerical simulations with the experimental results unfortunately those modifications are time consuming and the surface curvature is not taken into account yet some trials focusing on the rotation function are carried out to modify the production term of turbulent kinetic energy p k spalart and shur 1997 multiplied the production term in the s a model by a rotation function f r1 to include the curvature effect smirnov and menter 2008 then further modified the production term of the sst k ω model in a wide range of both wall bounded and free shear flows with rotation and streamline their results indicated that the modifications significantly improved the accuracy of the menter sst model when compared with dns predictions and experimental data besides hybrid rans models based on the sst k ω model are also presented because the standard k ε model shows poor performance in the simulation of strong swirling flows bredberg bredberg et al 2002 transfered the k ε model to k ω model to remove the freestream sensitivity in the ω equation based on this method shu 2011 proposed a modified sst k ω model msst model with combination the realizable k ε model and menter sst k ω model this model was tested in the case of a centrifugal pump and achieved a better accordance with the experiment based on the previous researches the present study proposes a new modified pans turbulence model named as msst pans which regards the msst model as the parent model the objective of this study is to validate the feasibility and capacities of the msst pans model for predicting transient cavitating turbulent flows with consideration of surface curvature the outline of the paper is as follows after the introduction in the section 1 the general governing equations are illustrated in the section 2 in section 3 the test case and simulation setups are introduced for the cavitating turbulent flow over a hydrofoil comparisons with different turbulence models and discussions are presented in section 4 to demonstrate the potential capability of the msst pans model finally some concluding remarks are drawn based on the results 2 governing equations the comprehensive derivation of the pans model was described in detail in the ref girimaji 2006 and ref lakshmipathy and girimaji 2006 in the flied of multiphase flow the vapor and liquid are regarded as single continuous fluid based on the homogeneous mixture

model the simulation results are compared with the available experimental data as well as the numerical results by two turbulence models i e sst k ω model and the sst k ω pans model named as sst pans the computation domain of the flow over naca0015 hydrofoil mounted at the attack angle of six degree is shown in fig 1 a the corresponding experimental measurement was carried out with the hydrofoil having span width of 70 0 mm yu et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 a the domain is 8c long and 3c wide where c represents the chord length of the hydrofoil i e 70 mm the inlet plane is 2c upstream the leading edge le of the hydrofoil and the outlet plane is 5c downstream the trailing edge te of the hydrofoil hexahedral mesh o h type mesh is generated around the naca0015 hydrofoil by the ansys icem 18 2 in the present study the mesh independence test was performed by comparing the variations of the drag coefficient c d and the lift coefficient c l defined as follows 31 c d d r a g 0 5 ρ v 2 c s p a n c l l i f t 0 5 ρ v 2 c s p a n where the v is the inlet flow velocity and span stands for the spanwise width of the hydrofoil the results shown in table 1 indicate that no difference is observed using the mesh 3 and mesh 4 therefore the mesh 3 consisting of around 154 thousand cells is selected as the final mesh resolution the detailed mesh around the hydrofoil is shown in fig 1 b in order to prove and compare two dimensional cavity structures with the three dimensional one the computation domains having the spanwise width of 0 5c ji et al 2015 and 1 mm are selected to study the spanwise width independence the mesh distribution on streamwise direction is the same and the only difference is the node number in the spanwise direction the cavities at three instants are shown in fig 2 t cycle represents the evolution period of the cavity results show that the larger span width could resolve three dimensional cavity structures in the spanwise direction but the cavitation behavior in the streamwise direction is very similar at each instant for two cases since our study aims to emphasize the streamwise evolution of cavitation and vortex the span width is set as 1 mm for simulation to reduce the computational cost thus the span width of the following simulation is set as 1 mm this kind of simplification is proved to be an effective method to capture the main cavitating flows characteristic which is also recommended by coutier delgosha et al 2003 yang et al 2018 in the study water at 25 c is chosen for the flow medium the inlet velocity v 7 2 m s is imposed at the inlet section with the corresponding reynolds number re ρv c μ 5 105 the static pressure is designated at the outlet section in accord with cavitation number σ p p v 0 5ρ l u 2 0 65 unsteady simulations of the cavitating flow are carried out through the commercial cfd code ansys cfx three different turbulence models i e sst k ω model sst pans model and msst pans model are utilized and compared high resolution is set for advection scheme and turbulence numerics while the second order backward euler is used for transient scheme the unsteady time step of 0 05t ref 4 86 10 4 is chosen in the following calculation where t ref c v to obtain accurate results the max residuals for numerical convergence of the unsteady calculation are set as 10 6 the result on the residuals distribution using msst pans model on the 2d hydrofoil is shown in fig 3 because there is usually intensive cavity oscillation in the cavitating turbulent flow yu et al 2018 the residual profiles fluctuate in the range of 10 4 and 10 6 which is regarded as small enough for the current numerical simulation to reach a good convergence 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation validation fig 4 shows the comparisons of the cavity evolution in one typical oscillation period the left column is the experimental image and the right is the numerical result simulated by msst pans model the cavity structure is shown by vapor air volume fraction of α v 0 1 for a more clear insight 3d hydrofoil with the spanwise width of 0 5c is adopted a black broken line is plotted to show the rear part of the cloud cavity position it can be noted that the simulation and experimental results show the same tendency of the cavity evolutions from the instant of t 0 to t 0 3 6t cycle the sheet cavity grows gradually and reaches the trailing edge of the hydrofoil at the instant of t 0 4 6t cycle the rear part of the sheet cavity begins to detach from the hydrofoil which is also predicted by the msst pans model at last from the instant of t 0 5 6t cycle to t 0 6 6t cycle the cavity attaching to the leading edge remains in a steady state and the cloud cavity near the rear part sheds gradually thus the comparison of cavity distribution as well as cavitation evolution confirms that the numerical simulation predicted by the msst pans model agrees fairly well with the experimental result 4 2 cavitation evolution fig 5 compares the cavitation evolution predicted by different turbulence models with the experimental results for convenience the period of cavitation evolution t cycle is divided into 7 instants marked from t 0 to t 0 6 6 t cycle corresponding to i vii respectively the experiment shows that at instant i cavity inception occurs and a small sheet cavity attaches at the le of the hydrofoil the sheet cavity then grows gradually till instant iii and the rear part of the sheet cavity begins to detach from the hydrofoil and be split at instant iii the cavity breaks down and the shed cavity moves downstream at instant v at the instant vi another cavity shedding occurs and the detached cavities become cloud cavity as observed in the experiment cavitation inception begins again for the subsequent cavitation evolution cycle at instant vii fig 5 b c and d show the cavity structures according to iso surface of the vapor volume fraction α v 0 1 predicted by sst k ω sst pans and msst pans model respectively it is noted that the sst k ω model predicts the cavity oscillation at the rear part but the sheet cavity doesn t shed from the hydrofoil on the contrary the simulation results using the sst pans model as well as msst pans model show good agreement with the experimental images however compared with the sst pans model the msst pans model shows better accuracy in predicting cavitation evolution depicted by the experiment for examples at instant iv the sst pans model fails to predict the small cavity collapse near the te of the hydrofoil while the msst pans model predicts the similar phenomenon as the experiment at instant vi the sst pans model underestimates the sheet cavity at the le of the hydrofoil while the msst pans model estimates the same visible sheet cavity as the experiment thus the msst pans model can capture more accurate cavitating flow structures with the same mesh resolution the corresponding evolutions of the streamline and vorticity predicted by three turbulent models are presented in fig 6 during cavitation evolution the flow separation is apparently taking place as the cavitating flow fluctuates ji et al 2015 the results indicate that the sst k ω model predicts a very simple separation oscillation near the te of the hydrofoil a flat vortex shedding over the separation zone and a slim vortex with negative vorticity downstream the te it is also interesting that both sst pans model and msst pans model predict more complicated separation flow as well as vortex shedding near the te however compared with the sst pans model the msst pans model shows a good capacity on predicting clear boundaries of separation and vortex at time instant vi three separated vortices are captured by the msst pans model whose prediction shows rapid response of cavity evolution and is sensitive to the streamline curvature change due to cavitation 4 3 cavitation vortex interaction it is well known that the transition from sheet cavity to cloud cavity results in an apparent vortex evolution in this subsection the vorticity transport equation is used to investigate the cavitation vortex interaction predicted by three turbulence models the formulation of the vorticity transport equation is shown in eq 32 32 d ω dt ω v ω v ρ m p ρ m 2 ν m ν t 2 ω in eq 32 the first term on the right hand side is the vortex stretching term by the velocity gradients representing the stretching and tilting effect of a vortex the second term is the vortex dilation owing to volumetric expansion or contraction representing the effect of fluid compressibility the third term is the baroclinic torque due to the misalign between density and pressure gradients the last term is the viscous dissipation due to viscous diffusion of the vorticity which can be neglected owing to its smallest effect on the vortex transport for the flow with high reynolds number ji et al 2015 fig 7 compares the time averaged contours of the vapor volume fraction and vortex stretching vortex dilatation and baroclinic torque terms using the three turbulence models results in fig 7 a show different vapor volume fraction by three turbulence models as the experimental images shown in fig 5 the sheet cavity occurs at the le of the hydrofoil develops through the surface of the hydrofoil and tends to collapse near the te of the hydrofoil the sheet cavity attaching to the leading edge remains in a steady state while the cloud cavity near the rear part sheds gradually which indicates that the vapor fluctuates more intensively at the te than that at the le of the hydrofoil thus the msst pans model gives the most reasonable result compared with its counterparts where the vapor volume fraction is underestimated at the te of the hydrofoil predicted by the sst k ω model while it is overestimated at the le of the hydrofoil predicted by the sst pans model fig 7 b d shows that the vortex stretching term vortex dilation term as well as vortex baroclinic torque respectively as shown in the fig 7 b the sst k ω model is not as sensitive as the sst pans model and msst pans model to predict the stretching and tilting effect of a vortex as observed in the experiment the sheet cavity grows gradually along the hydrofoil where the stretching and tilting effect is more significant however the sst pans model underestimates this kind of effect along the hydrofoil thus the msst pans model shows the most reasonable result among three turbulence models besides comparing these three terms shown in the fig 7 b fig 7 d the magnitudes of the averaged vortex dilatation term are larger than other terms indicating the fluid compressibility has great effect on the vorticity production in the cavitating turbulent flows fig 8 gives the transient results predicted by the msst pans model in one typical cavitation cycle t cycle shown in fig 6 at the time instant i the magnitude of the baroclinic torque term is highest near the te where the vortex fluctuates severely from time instant ii to iv the sheet cavity at the le develops to the te along the hydrofoil surface as explained earlier the local boundary layer becomes thicker and the vortex dilatation and baroclinic torque terms increase remarkably becoming the main mechanism producing the cavitating vortex during this period the baroclinic torque term is negligible near the attached cavity region le where no separation is observed after the sheet cavity split into two parts at instant v the cavity is rolled up and begins to shed off near the te of the hydrofoil and the flow along the hydrofoil surface is extremely turbulent the cloud cavity occurs at the suction side of the hydrofoil where the vorticity changes significantly it is also confirmed that the magnitudes of the vortex dilation term and the vortex baroclinic torque term are larger compared with that of the vortex stretching term the results clearly demonstrate the strong vortex cavitation interaction in the cloud cavitation as illustrated above a strong correlation between the sheet cavity and vorticity structures is proved and clarified by the msst pans model which gives more reasonable insight for cavitating turbulent flow compared to other turbulence models 4 4 pressure fluctuations around hydrofoil once the cavity vortex interaction occurs the pressure fluctuates intensively along the hydrofoil surface owing to the cavity and vortex evolution fig 9 shows the instantaneous cavity and vortex structures in one typical evolution period i e t cycle note that the numerical results in these figures are predicted by the msst pans model the instantaneous cavity structure is also shown using the iso surface of the vapor volume fraction α v 0 1 and the corresponding vortical structures around the hydrofoil is described through the iso surface of q criterion q 4600 s 1 as shown in figs 9 and 5 the evolution of the natural cavitation and the vortex can be divided into several stages i e inception instant i development instant ii iv spilt and shedding instant v vii the monitoring points are set along the hydrofoil surface corresponding to the place with distance of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9c shown in the fig 9 from the le at instant ii the rear part of the cavity detaches from the hydrofoil surface and there are two vortices attached on the hydrofoil near the monitoring point p3 from instant iii v the vortex upstream p3 shrinks but the vortex downstream p3 expands toward the le and inflates normal to the hydrofoil as cavitation develops as cavity sheds from the hydrofoil at instant vi the expanded vortex breaks down and propagates downstream over the monitoring points p4 and p5 to investigate the pressure fluctuations characteristics in the cavitation vortex interaction the pressure coefficient c p is defined in eq 33 33 c p p i p 0 5 ρ v 2 where p i is the instantaneous pressure at monitoring point and the overbar represents static pressure at the outlet section fig 10 gives the pressure fluctuations predicted by the msst pans model in one cavitation evolution period t cycle as the cavity inception occurs in the middle of the hydrofoil p3 the magnitude of the c p increases significantly as the cavity propagates downstream to the p4 and p5 iii the magnitude of the c p decreases dramatically at the instant of iv v the te of the hydrofoil is covered with the large scale of the cavity and vortex while the c p remains in a low value right after that vi as the cavity collapses the magnitude of the c p on each point increases rapidly again finally at the instant of vii the vortices shed downstream and the pressure fluctuates dramatically owing to the unstable flow flied even though the evolution process is completed within a quite short time 0 058s the vortex cavity shedding is very important to produce pressure fluctuations along the hydrofoil surface fig 11 further presents the pressure fluctuations in frequency domain on these five monitoring points by fast fourier transform fft with 20 cycles data owing to the same pace between the cavity and vortex evolution shown in the fig 9 it is easy to understand the dominant frequency f n is equal to the cavity vortex evolution frequency f cycle 1 t cycle along the flow direction i e from p1 to p5 the frequency spectrum distribution is similar but the amplitude of the dominant frequency f n increases gradually the amplitude on p1 is the smallest while it reaches to the maximum on the p5 thus it is proved from the perspective of frequency spectrum that the vortex cavity fluctuates more severely near the te of the hydrofoil and the cavity evolution speed is equal to the vortex evolution based on current cavitation model 4 5 time averaged fk distributions in these pans simulations the unresolved to total ratio of kinetic energy f k is calculated based on the physical grid and local flow fields which affects the accuracy of the results fig 12 displays the f k distributions together with vorticity contours using the sst pans and msst pans model it can be noted that the value of f k is lower as the flow is fully turbulent the f k is below the 0 5 near the te of the hydrofoil where cavity shedding occurs and it augments gradually downstream the hydrofoil near the upper wall bounded region the value of f k is bounded to unity indicating that the pans simulations switch back to rans in this region although the f k distribution shows similar using these two pans models the low magnitude region predicted by the msst pans near the te of the hydrofoil is relative larger than the sst pans model this indicates the more turbulent scales are resolved rather than modelled using the msst pans model which contributes to reaching a more accuracy result all calculations were conducted using intel xeon 5670 processors 2 93 ghz and 12 mb cache in tsinghua national laboratory for information science and technology if the calculation time t r of the sst k ω model is set as the reference time the calculation cost for the sst pans model is 1 15t r and for msst pans model is 1 16t r thus the computational costs for the sst pans model and msst pans model are very close and just little increases compared with the conventional sst k ω model in the future the msst pans model is promising for wide application in various industries 5 conclusions a modified partially averaged navier stokes pans msst pans model based on the modified sst k ω turbulence model has been performed to predict the transient cavitating flows around a two dimensional naca0015 hydrofoil detailed comparisons between the available experimental data and the numerical simulations using different turbulence models are conducted the results indicate that cavitation shedding dynamics behavior including the cavity inception development split and collapse predicted by the sst pans and msst pans model show a good accordance with the experimental observation taking the advantages of the realizable k ε model the flow structures near the wall bounded region are predicted more reasonably specially the transient evolution such as the attached cavity at leading edge le of the hydrofoil cavity split in the middle of the hydrofoil and cavity collapse at trailing edge te of the hydrofoil is simulated more accurately by the msst pans the sst k ω model however failed to predict the apparent cavity evolution the timely averaged vapor volume fraction is well predicted by the msst pans model while it is underestimated at the te of the hydrofoil by the sst k ω model and overestimated at the le of the hydrofoil by the sst pans model during the inception and development of cavitation the sheet cavity grows at le and propagates to the te of the hydrofoil it is noted that the vortex dilatation and vortex baroclinic torque term play a dominant role during cavitation inception and propagation since the compressibility of the vapor has great effect on producing the cavitating vortex the vortex cavity shedding downstream consequently induces severe pressure fluctuations large pressure fluctuations are observed near the te of the hydrofoil and the dominant frequency predicted in the frequency spectrum is equal to the cavity vortex evolution frequency the study confirms that compared with the sst k ω and sst pans model the msst pans model has the distinctive characteristics in simulating the turbulent flows with high shear rates with consideration of surface curvature due to better accuracy and equivalent calculation resource costs the msst pans model is promising in the industrial application to predict the cavitating flow over a hydrofoil with consideration of surface curvature further applications of the present model to the
