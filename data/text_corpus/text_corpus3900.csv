19500,the amoeba naegleria fowleri is the causative agent of the highly fatal disease primary amoebic meningoencephalitis and estimated to cause 16 deaths per year in the united states alone colonisation of drinking water distribution systems dwdss by the n fowleri is a significant public health issue understanding the factors which enable this pathogen to colonise and thrive in dwdss is critical for proper management the microbial ecology within dwdss may influence the ability of n fowleri to colonise dwdss by facilitating the availability of an appropriate food source using biofilm samples obtained from operational dwdss 16s rrna amplicon metabarcoding was combined with genus specific pcr and sanger sequencing of intracellular associated bacteria from isolated amoeba and their parental biofilms to identify meiothermus chliarophilus as a potential food source for n fowleri meiothermus was confirmed as a food source for n fowleri following successful serial culturing of axenic n fowleri with m chliarophilus or m ruber as the sole food source the ability to identify environmental and ecological conditions favourable to n fowleri colonisation including the detection of appropriate food sources such as meiothermus could provide water utilities with a predictive tool for managing n fowleri colonisation within the dwds graphical abstract image 1 keywords naegleria fowleri meiothermus intracellular bacteria naegleria amoeba ecogenomics 1 introduction the amoeba naegleria fowleri is the causative agent of the fatal disease 95 mortality primary amoebic meningoencephalitis pam or pame n fowleri is distributed globally de jonckheere 2011 and found in both natural and engineered warm water environments marciano cabral 1988 marciano cabral et al 2003 miller et al 2017 morgan et al 2016 puzon et al 2017 while pam generally occurs as a result of exposure to an environmental water source yoder et al 2010 and is estimated to cause 16 deaths annually in the usa alone matanock et al 2018 n fowleri can also be transmitted through drinking water distribution systems dwdss morgan et al 2016 puzon et al 2009 2017 n fowleri in dwdss has been linked to a number of pam cases in the usa cope et al 2015 yoder et al 2012 karachi pakistan kazi and riaz 2013 mahmood 2015 naqvi et al 2016 and australia nicholls et al 2016 in australia at least 19 pam cases were reported between 1961 and 1981 dorsch 1982 and more recently 4 pam cases have occurred in queensland active monitoring for n fowleri is conducted in western australia south australia and in the northern territory of australia current n fowleri surveillance methods focus on physical and chemical parameters of the water including high environmental temperature 25 c and low disinfectant residuals trolio et al 2008 however recent studies have shown that n fowleri colonisation of dwdss is not strictly defined by these parameters miller et al 2017 morgan et al 2016 puzon et al 2017 the effect of the composition of the pipe wall biofilm community on the colonisation and persistence of bacterivorous amoebae such as n fowleri has not been extensively studied pipe wall biofilms in dwds support the growth of amoebae by increasing resistance to disinfectants and providing a food source in the form of bacterial biomass berry et al 2006 biyela et al 2012 goudot et al 2012 miller et al 2015 2017 colonised biofilm is then a source for further dissemination of n fowleri within the dwds by releasing n fowleri into the bulk water biyela et al 2012 biofilm also facilitates microbial interactions including amoeba bacteria interactions these interactions include long term intracellular survival of bacteria within amoebal trophozoites cysts or dead cells allowing the bacteria to resist destruction as well as intracellular replication and shedding molmeret et al 2005 in such cases amoebae can serve as hosts or reservoirs for intracellular bacteria and potential pathogens protecting them from disinfection aiding in biofilm formation and even enhancing virulence cirillo et al 1997 these bacteria have been termed amoeba resistant bacteria arb greub and raoult 2004 and intracellular replication and survival of several bacteria has been observed within many amoebae such as acanthamoeba vermamoeba and naegleria spp including n fowleri denoncourt et al 2014 molmeret et al 2005 pagnier et al 2009 while many arbs have been well studied there is little knowledge about bacteria ingested by amoebae as food sources the general ecology of n fowleri is largely unknown including whether they graze at random on bacteria susceptible to phagocytosis or if they selectively graze specific types of bacteria under laboratory conditions amoebae including naegleria spp and acanthamoeba spp have been shown to ingest a narrow range of bacteria including escherichia coli k 12 klebsiella spp and enterobacter spp while other amoebae commonly isolated from dwdss including vermamoeba vermiformis graze on wider range of bacteria schuster 2002 weekers et al 1993 the aim of this work was to uncover preferential food sources for the pathogenic amoeba n fowleri in order to predict colonisation events and enable pre emptive management actions intracellular associated bacteria iab were identified from n fowleri sourced from operational dwdss and compared to the bacterial communities present in pipe wall biofilms the goals of the study were to a assess the relationship of bacteria and n fowleri colonisation in dwds b identify bacteria differentially observed inside amoebae that may represent preferred prey items for n fowleri and c test the ecological relationship hypothesis using feeding trials with a view to establishing specific bacteria as predictive biomarkers for n fowleri colonisation of pipe wall biofilms the use of iabs as potential biomarkers in conjunction with the currently used physical and chemical indicators could provide better surveillance of dwdss and enable a more targeted response to prevent current and future n fowleri colonisation of dwdss to our knowledge this is the first study to identify and confirm some of the bacterial food sources of viable n fowleri sourced from operational dwds biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 operational dwds site monitoring and samples biofilm samples were collected from two dwds

paired end reads were processed with trimmomatic v0 32 bolger et al 2014 trimming reads where a four base sliding window had an average quality score below 20 and excluding read pairs where one or both had fewer than 120 bp after trimming read pairs were merged using flash v1 2 9 magoc and salzberg 2011 primer sequences were removed from merged reads and reads lacking identifiable primer sequences were discarded further processing was performed in qiime v1 8 caporaso et al 2010 chimeric sequences were identified from the de multiplexed sequences using identify chimeric seqs py with usearch 6 1 edgar 2010 and the remaining non chimeric sequences subjected to open reference otu picking against the greengenes 13 8 reference database mcdonald et al 2012 clustered at 97 similarity using usearch61 and default parameters taxonomic assignment of denovo otu representative sequences was performed with the rdp naive bayes classifier wang et al 2007 against the same database otus were removed if assigned to enterobacteriales the nna culturing food source or organelle genomes were not assigned to a bacterial phylum or had more than 10 of their reads in control samples samples were normalised to 1064 reads per sample for diversity analyses 2 9 diversity analyses diversity analyses and visualisations were performed in r v3 3 1 r core team 2016 alpha diversity was measured as the number of otus in normalised samples differences in alpha diversity between biofilm and iab samples and between n fowleri positive and negative samples nf and nf respectively were tested using one way anova with a p value cut off of 0 05 levene s test was used to test homogeneity of variances among groups and tukey s honest significant difference test was used for post hoc comparisons community composition across samples was visualised as heat maps calculated by aggregating reads at the l5 level in the qiime formatted greengenes taxonomic hierarchy which generally corresponds to bacterial families low abundance families accounting for 2 of the reads in any sample were combined into a single category of other for visualisation beta diversity was calculated from the normalised dataset using the bray curtis dissimilarity measure community structure differences among samples were visualised using principal coordinates analysis pcoa using the cmdscale function in the vegan package oksanen et al 2015 the multivariate hypothesis of no significant differences in community structure between groups was tested by permanova using the adonis function in vegan with 999 permutations after testing for heterogeneity of dispersion using the betadisper function indicator species analysis at the family and otu level were performed with the indicspecies package de caceres and legendre 2009 assessing the indicator status of taxa or otus for all combinations of four groups iab nf iab nf biofilm nf biofilm nf only abundant otus accounting for 0 5 of the total reads were used for this analysis significance of associations were assessed using a permutation test with 999 permutations using a corrected p value of 0 05 after applying the benjamini hochberg false discovery rate correction benjamini and hochberg 1995 all results were visualised in r using the ggplot2 package wickham 2009 3 results 3 1 field biofilm conditions naegleria speciation and iab enumeration field samples were collected from three different sites between august and october 2015 table 1 all sites had negligible chlorine residual present water temperature ranged from 14 to 41 c turbidity ranged from 0 54 to 1 82 ntu and an average total cell concentrations in biofilm between 104 and 105 cells cm2 table 1 the percentage of intracellular to extracellular bacteria in the iab samples was 85 5 7 table 2 fig 1 shows an isolated amebae and the abundance of iab within as well as the low extracellular bacteria counts and the absence of cell wall attached bacteria no bacteria attached to the amoeba cell wall were observed in any of the samples four viable amoebae species were detected in the biofilm samples v vermiformis n fowleri n lovaniensis and an unidentified thermophilic amoeba ta which grew at 42 c i e thermophilic but was unidentified by qpcr using genus specific primers naegleria vermamoeba acanthamoeba or balmuthia booton et al 2003 puzon et al 2009 schroeder et al 2001 a single amoeba species was detected in seven biofilm samples whereas the remaining eight contained both v vermiformis and n fowleri 3 2 bacterial community structure and characterization of biofilm communities the normalised 16s amplicon dataset comprised 1257 otus across 29 samples three samples had low read counts after processing and were excluded including one nf biofilm sample one nf iab sample and one nf iab sample biofilm community structure was visualised using principal coordinates analysis pcoa fig 2 the first axis explained 36 3 of the variance in community structure and broadly split the samples by iab circles and biofilms squares the second axis explained 15 3 of the variance and split the samples by location overall samples clustered by type iab vs biofilm and location t vs sk but not by n fowleri presence or absence closed vs open with the exception of the bp iab sample which clustered with iab samples from site t permanova results were consistent with the ordination plot with both location pseudo f 2 26 3 56 p 0 001 and sample type pseudo f 1 27 13 67 p 0 001 having a significant effect on community structure while the presence of n fowleri did not pseudo f 1 27 1 55 p 0 145 sk and t sites which were different sites located on different branches of the same dwds showed high similarity on the pcoa fig 2 and were dominated by taxa including comamonadaceae chitinophagaceae xanthomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae fig 3 the bp biofilm sample community was highly distinct from the biofilm community samples from sites t and sk the bp parental biofilm also comprised fewer taxa than the other two sites four bacterial taxa dominated the biofilm community representing 10 of the overall detections in order of most abundant rhodocyclaceae erythrobacteraceae hydrogenophilaceae and comamonadaceae fig 3 erythrobacteraceae was only detected in the bp site s parental biofilm and was not seen at the other sites furthermore the parental biofilm taxa observed in the mixed amoebae samples were similar to those detected in the individually colonised samples fig 3 differences between sk and t sites included the detection of taxa which were more predominately associated with the sk sites parental biofilm including chlamydia and syntrophobacteraceae or the t site parental biofilm including sphingomonadaceae nitrospiraceae ellin6075 and pk29 unknown 3 3 parental biofilm versus intracellular associated bacteria iab comparison of parental biofilm and iab samples was performed on the normalised dataset levene s test for homogeneity of variances did not reject the null hypothesis of no difference among groups f 3 25 2 41 p 0 09 there was a statistically significant difference in the alpha diversity among groups as determined by one way anova f 3 25

comparisons and the number of otus in iab and biofilm samples was not affected by the presence of n fowleri nf iab vs nf iab p 0 99 nf biofilms vs nf biofilm p 0 10 of the 1257 otus assigned to 26 phyla and 196 families proteobacteria was the dominant phylum identified in both the parental biofilm and iab samples followed by bacteriodetes some iabs were abundant within the parental biofilm and the iab samples for example comamonadaceae 52 30 was one of the most abundant iab associated with vermamoeba sp and ta and was the most abundant taxa detected in the parental biofilm samples fig 3 higher taxonomic resolution provided by otu analysis shows that several comamonadaceae otus have statistically significant associations with nf iabs as displayed in fig 4 orange while other comamonadaceae otus were more abundant in the iabs compared to biofilms including hydrogenophaga reference otu 697 479 assigned to genus hydrogenophaga fig 4 green and further comamonadaceae otus were more abundant in the biofilms compared to iabs including hydrogenophaga reference otus 815 406 and 942 852 assigned to genera hydrogenophaga and methylibium respectively fig 4 blue a similar pattern can be seen for otus assigned to chitinophagaceae and partly explains the presence of these families across samples mixed amoebae samples revealed the same iabs found associated with the two individual amoebae involved after removal of otus assigned to the e coli food source the iab s of the combined n fowleri and vermamoeba sp included in order of abundance comamonadaceae chitinophagaceae thermaceae ellin6075 rhodobacteraceae alicyclobacillaceae xanthomonadaceae methylobacteriaceae and acetobacteraceae erythrobacteraceae was associated with bp1 an nf iab sample i e n lovaniensis fig 3 n lovaniensis was the only amoebae isolated from the bp site biofilm and was not detected at any other site tables 1 and 2 the bp iab sample clustered with iab samples from site t containing similar taxa including acinetobacter which was also associated with the other amoebae isolated phyla that were more abundant in the parental biofilms compared to iab samples si tables 1 3 include chlamydiae gemmatimonadetes nitrospirae planctomycetes and acidobacteria a set of 20 families were found to be associated with parental biofilm samples compared with iab samples including cytophagaceae hyphomondaceae saprospiraceae and nitrospiraceae these taxa were not associated with any of the nf or nf iabs 3 4 nf associated iabs in field samples indicator species analysis of biofilm and iab samples found that 22 otus were identified with statistically significant associations with one or more groups fig 4 and broadly supported the results of higher level analysis fig 3 si tables 1 3 four otus showed a significant positive association with nf iab samples fig 4 orange text including two comamondaceae otus one thermaceae and one chitinophagaceae otu the thermaceae otu was assigned to genus meiothermus and was the only otu found in all nf iab samples and absent from the nf iab samples meiothermus was also absent or present at very low percentages in the parental biofilm samples fig 4 otus assigned to other families were generally found to be associated with both nf and nf iab samples compared to the parental biofilm samples including methylobacteriaceae moraxellaceae and alicyclobacillaceae 3 5 meiothermus spp as food source the thermaceae sequences associated with nf iab samples were identified as belonging to the meiothermus genus by otu analysis blast analysis further identified the meiothermus otus as close matches to two meiothermus species meiothermus chliarophilus and meiothermus ruber further genus specific qpcr and sanger sequencing confirmed the nf iabs as meiothermus with 100 sequence identity to m chliarophilus pure cultures of m chliarophilus 9957t and m ruber 1279 t were obtained from dmz and cultured to investigate these bacteria as potential food sources for n fowleri cultured axenic n fowleri were able to grow on nna plates with either m chliarophilus or m ruber as the sole food source which further confirmed both meiothermus spp were n fowleri food sources 4 discussion the results of this study demonstrate that specific bacterial genera have an ecological relationship with the human pathogen n fowleri iab of n fowleri sourced from operational dwdss were identified and compared to the bacterial community composition of their biofilm environment first using 16s amplicon sequencing an otu assigned to the genus meiothermus family thermaceae most closely matching m chliarophilus was identified that was significantly more abundant in n fowleri samples than in parental biofilms second the identity of the otu was further confirmed using meiothermus genus specific qpcr primers followed by sanger sequencing revealing a 100 sequence identity match to m chliarophilus third and most importantly meiothermus was confirmed as a food source for n fowleri following serial culturing of axenic n fowleri with either m chliarophilus or m ruber as the sole food source our previous studies have found correlations between deinococcus thermus and meiothermus otus with n fowleri in dwdss biofilm community analyses miller et al 2017 morgan et al 2016 and may play a role in the competition between n fowleri and other free living amoebae fla in colonising dwds biofilms miller et al 2018 however the current study is the first to confirm that meiothermus is found intracellularly in n fowleri and can be a food source of n fowleri meiothermus spp are gram negative thermophilic bacteria known to form biofilms and stick to surfaces using specific adhesion organelles raulio et al 2008 given that both meiothermus spp and n fowleri are thermophilic and have affinity for biofilm it is likely that they could colonise similar engineered environments including dwdss with favourable environmental temperatures meiothermus spp have been isolated from natural and artificial aquatic environments with high temperatures typically exceeding 30 c including dwdss natural water bodies and hot springs mountain et al 2003 panda et al 2015 2016 as well as dwdss with temperatures as low as 16 c miller et al 2017 morgan et al 2016 interestingly bacteria belonging to the deinococcus thermus phyla were also isolated from groundwater aquifers in the us state of arizona which were also positive for viable n fowleri laseke et al 2010 it is possible that these bacteria belong to the meiothermus genus and were a food source for n fowleri the abundance and variety of iabs found in all amoebae and iabs associated with specific amoebae indicates the wide range of taxa amoebae are able to ingest these iabs are often not the most common otus identified in the parental biofilm suggesting preferential grazing by the amoebae furthermore many of these iabs tended to be gram negative rods including methylobacterium acinetobacter and moraxellaceae with the exception of alicyclobacillaceae gram positive this suggests that these families include preferred food sources and or are susceptible to phagocytosis by amoebae interestingly some families were found to be associated with nf iab including micrococcaceae gram positive cocci but not nf iab suggesting that this family might be susceptible to phagocytosis by amoeba other than n fowleri previous studies reporting bacterial communities associated with metropolitan ground water supporting n fowleri have also noted very diverse bacterial communities as well as an abundance of β and γ proteobacteria laseke et al 2010 and some laboratory studies have shown a lack of preferential bacterial grazing by amoebae including n lovaniensis declerck et al 2005 however abundant bacterial taxa consumed by multiple amoebae including comamonadaceae xanthomonadaceae and chitinophagaceae do not explain amoebae and n fowleri colonising patterns of dwdss in addition these taxa are not as useful as possible indicators of the drinking water network s ability to become colonised by pathogenic amoeba due to their ubiquity in aquatic environments lin et al 2013 2014 poitelon et al 2009 williams et al 2004 while our results demonstrate that some of the iabs identified in this study are potential food sources for n fowleri others may represent arbs such as endoparasites or endosymbionts there is an abundance of studies focusing of natural endosymbionts of free living amoebae including naegleria spp collingro et al 2004 corsaro and greub 2006 denet et al 2017 horn et al 2000 thom et al 1992 however many of the common endoparasites or endosymbionts reported in the literature were not detected in this study with the exception of chlamydiia a family containing potential endoparasites of vermamoeba sp which were present in the sk parental biofilm but absent from all nf and nf iab samples fig 3 in addition arbs of significant health issue legionella and nontuberculous mycobacterium ntm were not detected lu et al 2015 wang et al 2012 interestingly up to 20 highly abundant taxa were more associated with the parental biofilms than the nf and nf iabs fig 3 including cytophagaceae hyphomondaceae saprospiraceae nitrospiraceae chlamydiae gemmatimonadetes nitrospirae planctomycetes and acidobacteria many of which are commonly detected in dwdss white et al 1996 williams et al 2004 zanetti et al 2000 these taxa potentially represent organisms with a defence against ingestion or are unfavourable food sources for the isolated amoebae previous studies of dwdss have also indicated a negative association between some bacteria and amoebae particularly sphingomonadaceae and n fowleri which was also seen in this study further studies into the differences in the bacterial biofilm communities within other dwdss might shed light on additional key bacterial populations which might select for or support n fowleri colonisation of dwds biofilm or a mixed amoebae population including non pathogenic amoeba this knowledge would improve the understanding of amoebic colonisation patterns and help explain why different biofilms are colonised solely by pathogenic n fowleri or non pathogenic n lovaniensis or vermamoeba sp previous studies have shown that non naegleria fla population changes were not solely explained by environmental parameters including water temperature and disinfectant residuals and were attributed to ecological factors including food sources delafont et al 2016 nutrients levels and food sources are known to play an important role in amoebae growth competition and biofilm colonisation including by n fowleri goudot et al 2012 and high bacterial richness is often associated with n fowleri presence morgan et al 2016 therefore it is likely that the bacterial community which is also susceptible to temperature variations and disinfectant type and residual pernin et al 1998 williams et al 2004 plays a role in determining which amoebic species dominate a dwds or natural water system biofilm communities affecting amoebae colonisation may also explain why n fowleri is often detected at lower temperatures despite its thermophilic nature in both dwdss and fresh water sources miller et al 2017 morgan et al 2016 sifuentes et al 2014 the detection of appropriate food sources including meiothermus spp to determine site susceptibility to n fowleri colonisation could provide an important advance in our ability to predict pathogen colonization in dwdss and enable water utilities to pre emptively treat sites before colonization by n fowleri 5 conclusion this study investigated intracellular bacteria from n fowleri sampled from an operational drinking water distribution system dwds 1 ecogenomics approaches can be used to generate ecological association hypotheses between taxa and the nature of these associations may be best revealed and tested through multiple independent lines of evidence 2 uncovering trophic interactions between taxa furthers our understanding of ecological systems including the requirements for colonisation success by specific organisms 3 identifying these requirements such as preferred food sources will enable development of biological prediction tools for the management and control of n fowleri in dwdss conflicts of interest the authors declare no

19500,the amoeba naegleria fowleri is the causative agent of the highly fatal disease primary amoebic meningoencephalitis and estimated to cause 16 deaths per year in the united states alone colonisation of drinking water distribution systems dwdss by the n fowleri is a significant public health issue understanding the factors which enable this pathogen to colonise and thrive in dwdss is critical for proper management the microbial ecology within dwdss may influence the ability of n fowleri to colonise dwdss by facilitating the availability of an appropriate food source using biofilm samples obtained from operational dwdss 16s rrna amplicon metabarcoding was combined with genus specific pcr and sanger sequencing of intracellular associated bacteria from isolated amoeba and their parental biofilms to identify meiothermus chliarophilus as a potential food source for n fowleri meiothermus was confirmed as a food source for n fowleri following successful serial culturing of axenic n fowleri with m chliarophilus or m ruber as the sole food source the ability to identify environmental and ecological conditions favourable to n fowleri colonisation including the detection of appropriate food sources such as meiothermus could provide water utilities with a predictive tool for managing n fowleri colonisation within the dwds graphical abstract image 1 keywords naegleria

were reported between 1961 and 1981 dorsch 1982 and more recently 4 pam cases have occurred in queensland active monitoring for n fowleri is conducted in western australia south australia and in the northern territory of australia current n fowleri surveillance methods focus on physical and chemical parameters of the water including high environmental temperature 25 c and low disinfectant residuals trolio et al 2008 however recent studies have shown that n fowleri colonisation of dwdss is not strictly defined by these parameters miller et al 2017 morgan et al 2016 puzon et al 2017 the effect of the composition of the pipe wall biofilm community on the colonisation and persistence of bacterivorous amoebae such as n fowleri has not been extensively studied pipe wall biofilms in dwds support the growth of amoebae by increasing resistance to disinfectants and providing a food source in the form of bacterial biomass berry et al 2006 biyela et al 2012 goudot et al 2012 miller et al 2015 2017 colonised biofilm is then a source for further dissemination of n fowleri within the dwds by releasing n fowleri into the bulk water biyela et al 2012 biofilm also facilitates microbial interactions including amoeba bacteria interactions these interactions include long term intracellular survival of bacteria within amoebal trophozoites cysts or dead cells allowing the bacteria to resist destruction as well as intracellular replication and shedding molmeret et al 2005 in such cases amoebae can serve as hosts or reservoirs for intracellular bacteria and potential pathogens protecting them from disinfection aiding in biofilm formation and even enhancing virulence cirillo et al 1997 these bacteria have been termed amoeba resistant bacteria arb greub and raoult 2004 and intracellular replication and survival of several bacteria has been observed within many amoebae such as acanthamoeba vermamoeba and naegleria spp including n fowleri denoncourt et al 2014 molmeret et al 2005 pagnier et al 2009 while many arbs have been well studied there is little knowledge about bacteria ingested by amoebae as food sources the general ecology of n fowleri is largely unknown including whether they graze at random on bacteria susceptible to phagocytosis or if they selectively graze specific types of bacteria under laboratory conditions amoebae including naegleria spp and acanthamoeba spp have been shown to ingest a narrow range of bacteria including escherichia coli k 12 klebsiella spp and enterobacter spp while other amoebae commonly isolated from dwdss including vermamoeba vermiformis graze on wider range of bacteria schuster 2002 weekers et al 1993 the aim of this work was to uncover preferential food sources for the pathogenic amoeba n fowleri in order to predict colonisation events and enable pre emptive management actions intracellular associated bacteria iab were identified from n fowleri sourced from operational dwdss and compared to the bacterial communities present in pipe wall biofilms the goals of the study were to a assess the relationship of bacteria and n fowleri colonisation in dwds b identify bacteria differentially observed inside amoebae that may represent preferred prey items for n fowleri and c test the ecological relationship hypothesis using feeding trials with a view to establishing specific bacteria as predictive biomarkers for n fowleri colonisation of pipe wall biofilms the use of iabs as potential biomarkers in conjunction with the currently used physical and chemical indicators could provide better surveillance of dwdss and enable a more targeted response to prevent current and future n fowleri colonisation of dwdss to our knowledge this is the first study to identify and confirm some of the bacterial food sources of viable n fowleri sourced from operational dwds biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 operational dwds site monitoring and samples biofilm samples were collected from two dwds

paired end reads were processed with trimmomatic v0 32 bolger et al 2014 trimming reads where a four base sliding window had an average quality score below 20 and excluding read pairs where one or both had fewer than 120 bp after trimming read pairs were merged using flash v1 2 9 magoc and salzberg 2011 primer sequences were removed from merged reads and reads lacking identifiable primer sequences were discarded further processing was performed in qiime v1 8 caporaso et al 2010 chimeric sequences were identified from the de multiplexed sequences using identify chimeric seqs py with usearch 6 1 edgar 2010 and the remaining non chimeric sequences subjected to open reference otu picking against the greengenes 13 8 reference database mcdonald et al 2012 clustered at 97 similarity using usearch61 and default parameters taxonomic assignment of denovo otu representative sequences was performed with the rdp naive bayes classifier wang et al 2007 against the same database otus were removed if assigned to enterobacteriales the nna culturing food source or organelle genomes were not assigned to a bacterial phylum or had more than 10 of their reads in control samples samples were normalised to 1064 reads per sample for diversity analyses 2 9 diversity analyses diversity analyses and visualisations were performed in r v3 3 1 r core team 2016 alpha diversity was measured as the number of otus in normalised samples differences in alpha diversity between biofilm and iab samples and between n fowleri positive and negative samples nf and nf respectively were tested using one way anova with a p value cut off of 0 05 levene s test was used to test homogeneity of variances among groups and tukey s honest significant difference test was used for post hoc comparisons community composition across samples was visualised as heat maps calculated by aggregating reads at the l5 level in the qiime formatted greengenes taxonomic hierarchy which generally corresponds to bacterial families low abundance families accounting for 2 of the reads in any sample were combined into a single category of other for visualisation beta diversity was calculated from the normalised dataset using the bray curtis dissimilarity measure community structure differences among samples were visualised using principal coordinates analysis pcoa using the cmdscale function in the vegan package oksanen et al 2015 the multivariate hypothesis of no significant differences in community structure between groups was tested by permanova using the adonis function in vegan with 999 permutations after testing for heterogeneity of dispersion using the betadisper function indicator species analysis at the family and otu level were performed with the indicspecies package de caceres and legendre 2009 assessing the indicator status of taxa or otus for all combinations of four groups iab nf iab nf biofilm nf biofilm nf only abundant otus accounting for 0 5 of the total reads were used for this analysis significance of associations were assessed using a permutation test with 999 permutations using a corrected p value of 0 05 after applying the benjamini hochberg false discovery rate

table 2 fig 1 shows an isolated amebae and the abundance of iab within as well as the low extracellular bacteria counts and the absence of cell wall attached bacteria no bacteria attached to the amoeba cell wall were observed in any of the samples four viable amoebae species were detected in the biofilm samples v vermiformis n fowleri n lovaniensis and an unidentified thermophilic amoeba ta which grew at 42 c i e thermophilic but was unidentified by qpcr using genus specific primers naegleria vermamoeba acanthamoeba or balmuthia booton et al 2003 puzon et al 2009 schroeder et al 2001 a single amoeba species was detected in seven biofilm samples whereas the remaining eight contained both v vermiformis and n fowleri 3 2 bacterial community structure and characterization of biofilm communities the normalised 16s amplicon dataset comprised 1257 otus across 29 samples three samples had low read counts after processing and were excluded including one nf biofilm sample one nf iab sample and one nf iab sample biofilm community structure was visualised using principal coordinates analysis pcoa fig 2 the first axis explained 36 3 of the variance in community structure and broadly split the samples by iab circles and biofilms squares the second axis explained 15 3 of the variance and split the samples by location overall samples clustered by type iab vs biofilm and location t vs sk but not by n fowleri presence or absence closed vs open with the exception of the bp iab sample which clustered with iab samples from site t permanova results were consistent with the ordination plot with both location pseudo f 2 26 3 56 p 0 001 and sample type pseudo f 1 27 13 67 p 0 001 having a significant effect on community structure while the presence of n fowleri did not pseudo f 1 27 1 55 p 0 145 sk and t sites which were different sites located on different branches of the same dwds showed high similarity on the pcoa fig 2 and were dominated by taxa including comamonadaceae chitinophagaceae xanthomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae fig 3 the bp biofilm sample community was highly distinct from the biofilm community samples from sites t and sk the bp parental biofilm also comprised fewer taxa than the other two sites four bacterial taxa dominated the biofilm community representing 10 of the overall detections in order of most abundant rhodocyclaceae erythrobacteraceae hydrogenophilaceae and comamonadaceae fig 3 erythrobacteraceae was only detected in the bp site s parental biofilm and was not seen at the other sites furthermore the parental biofilm taxa observed in the mixed amoebae samples were similar to those detected in the individually colonised samples fig 3 differences between sk and t sites included the detection of taxa which were more predominately associated with the sk sites parental biofilm including chlamydia and syntrophobacteraceae or the t site parental biofilm including sphingomonadaceae nitrospiraceae ellin6075 and pk29 unknown 3 3 parental biofilm versus intracellular associated bacteria iab comparison of parental biofilm and iab samples was performed on the normalised dataset levene s test for homogeneity of variances did not reject the null hypothesis of no difference among groups f 3 25 2 41 p 0 09 there was a statistically significant difference in the alpha diversity among groups as determined by one way anova f 3 25

comparisons and the number of otus in iab and biofilm samples was not affected by the presence of n fowleri nf iab vs nf iab p 0 99 nf biofilms vs nf biofilm p 0 10 of the 1257 otus assigned to 26 phyla and 196 families proteobacteria was the dominant phylum identified in both the parental biofilm and iab samples followed by bacteriodetes some iabs were abundant within the parental biofilm and the iab samples for example comamonadaceae 52 30 was one of the most abundant iab associated with vermamoeba sp and ta and was the most abundant taxa detected in the parental biofilm samples fig 3 higher taxonomic resolution provided by otu analysis shows that several comamonadaceae otus have statistically significant associations with nf iabs as displayed in fig 4 orange while other comamonadaceae otus were more abundant in the iabs compared to biofilms including hydrogenophaga reference otu 697 479 assigned to genus hydrogenophaga fig 4 green and further comamonadaceae otus were more abundant in the biofilms compared to iabs including hydrogenophaga reference otus 815 406 and 942 852 assigned to genera hydrogenophaga and methylibium respectively fig 4 blue a similar pattern can be seen for otus assigned to chitinophagaceae and partly explains the presence of these families across samples mixed amoebae samples revealed the same iabs found associated with the two individual amoebae involved after removal of otus assigned to the e coli food source the iab s of the combined n fowleri and vermamoeba sp included in order of abundance comamonadaceae chitinophagaceae thermaceae ellin6075 rhodobacteraceae alicyclobacillaceae xanthomonadaceae methylobacteriaceae and acetobacteraceae erythrobacteraceae was associated with bp1 an nf iab sample i e n lovaniensis fig 3 n lovaniensis was the only amoebae isolated from the bp site biofilm and was not detected at any other site tables 1 and 2 the bp iab sample clustered with iab samples from site t containing similar taxa including acinetobacter which was also associated with the other amoebae isolated phyla that were more abundant in the parental biofilms compared to iab samples si tables 1 3 include chlamydiae gemmatimonadetes nitrospirae planctomycetes and acidobacteria a set of 20 families were found to be associated with parental biofilm samples compared with iab samples including cytophagaceae hyphomondaceae saprospiraceae and nitrospiraceae these taxa were not associated with any of the nf or nf iabs 3 4 nf associated iabs in field samples indicator species analysis of biofilm and iab samples found that 22 otus were identified with statistically significant associations with one or more groups fig 4 and broadly supported the results of higher level analysis fig 3 si tables 1 3 four otus showed a significant positive association with nf iab samples fig 4 orange text including two comamondaceae otus one thermaceae and one chitinophagaceae otu the thermaceae otu was assigned to genus meiothermus and was the only otu found in all nf iab samples and absent from the nf iab samples meiothermus was also absent or present at very low percentages in the parental biofilm samples fig 4 otus assigned to other families were generally found to be associated with both nf and nf iab samples compared to the parental biofilm samples including methylobacteriaceae moraxellaceae and alicyclobacillaceae 3 5 meiothermus spp as food source the thermaceae sequences associated with nf iab samples were identified as belonging to the meiothermus genus by otu analysis blast analysis further identified the meiothermus otus as close matches to two meiothermus species meiothermus chliarophilus and meiothermus ruber further genus specific qpcr and sanger sequencing confirmed the nf iabs as meiothermus with 100 sequence identity to m chliarophilus pure cultures of m chliarophilus 9957t and m ruber 1279 t were obtained from dmz and cultured to investigate these bacteria as potential food sources for n fowleri cultured axenic n fowleri were able to grow on nna plates with either m chliarophilus or m ruber as the sole food source which further confirmed both meiothermus spp were n fowleri food sources 4 discussion the results of this study demonstrate that specific bacterial genera have an ecological relationship with the human pathogen n fowleri iab of n fowleri sourced from operational dwdss were identified and compared to the bacterial community composition of their biofilm environment first using 16s amplicon sequencing an otu assigned to the genus meiothermus family thermaceae most closely matching m chliarophilus was identified that was significantly more abundant in n fowleri samples than in parental biofilms second the identity of the otu was further confirmed using meiothermus genus specific qpcr primers followed by sanger sequencing revealing a 100 sequence identity match to m chliarophilus third and most importantly meiothermus was confirmed as a food source for n fowleri following serial culturing of axenic n fowleri with either m chliarophilus or m ruber as the sole food source our previous studies have found correlations between deinococcus thermus and meiothermus otus with n fowleri in dwdss biofilm community analyses miller et al 2017 morgan et al 2016 and may play a role in the competition between n fowleri and other free living amoebae fla in colonising dwds biofilms miller et al 2018 however the current study is the first to confirm that meiothermus is found intracellularly in n fowleri and can be a food source of n fowleri meiothermus spp are gram negative thermophilic bacteria known to form biofilms and stick to surfaces using specific adhesion organelles raulio et al 2008 given that both meiothermus spp and n fowleri are thermophilic and have affinity for biofilm it is likely that they could colonise similar engineered environments including dwdss with favourable environmental temperatures meiothermus spp have been isolated from natural and artificial aquatic environments with high temperatures typically exceeding 30 c including dwdss natural water bodies and hot springs mountain et al 2003 panda et al 2015 2016 as well as dwdss with temperatures as low as 16 c miller et al 2017 morgan et al 2016 interestingly bacteria belonging to the deinococcus thermus phyla were also isolated from groundwater aquifers in the us state of arizona which were also positive for viable n fowleri laseke et al 2010 it is possible that these bacteria belong to the meiothermus genus and were a food source for n fowleri the abundance and variety of iabs found in all amoebae and iabs associated with specific amoebae indicates the wide range of taxa amoebae are able to ingest these iabs are often not the most common otus identified in the parental biofilm suggesting preferential grazing by the amoebae furthermore many of these iabs tended to be gram negative rods including methylobacterium acinetobacter and moraxellaceae with the exception of alicyclobacillaceae gram positive this suggests that these families include preferred food sources and or are susceptible to phagocytosis by amoebae interestingly some families were found to be associated with nf iab including micrococcaceae gram positive cocci but not nf iab suggesting that this family might be susceptible to phagocytosis by amoeba other than n fowleri previous studies reporting bacterial communities associated with metropolitan ground water supporting n fowleri have also noted very diverse bacterial communities as well as an abundance of β and γ proteobacteria laseke et al 2010 and some laboratory studies have shown a lack of preferential bacterial grazing by amoebae including n lovaniensis declerck et al 2005 however abundant bacterial taxa consumed by multiple amoebae including comamonadaceae xanthomonadaceae and chitinophagaceae do not explain amoebae and n fowleri colonising patterns of dwdss in addition these taxa are not as useful as possible indicators of the drinking water network s ability to become colonised by pathogenic amoeba due to their ubiquity in aquatic environments lin et al 2013 2014 poitelon et al 2009 williams et al 2004 while our results demonstrate that some of the iabs identified in this study are potential food sources for n fowleri others may represent arbs such as endoparasites or endosymbionts there is an abundance of studies focusing of natural endosymbionts of free living amoebae including naegleria spp collingro et al 2004 corsaro and greub 2006 denet et al 2017 horn et al 2000 thom et al 1992 however many of the common endoparasites or endosymbionts reported in the literature were not detected in this study with the exception of chlamydiia a family containing potential endoparasites of vermamoeba sp which were present in the sk parental biofilm but absent from all nf and nf iab samples fig 3 in addition arbs of significant health issue legionella and nontuberculous mycobacterium ntm were not detected lu et al 2015 wang et al 2012 interestingly up to 20 highly abundant taxa were more associated with the parental biofilms than the nf and nf iabs fig 3 including cytophagaceae hyphomondaceae saprospiraceae nitrospiraceae chlamydiae gemmatimonadetes nitrospirae planctomycetes and acidobacteria many of which are commonly detected in dwdss white et al 1996 williams et al 2004 zanetti et al 2000 these taxa potentially represent organisms with a defence against ingestion or are unfavourable food sources for the isolated amoebae previous studies of dwdss have also indicated a negative association between some bacteria and amoebae particularly sphingomonadaceae and n fowleri which was also seen in this study further studies into the differences in the bacterial biofilm communities within other dwdss might shed light on additional key bacterial populations which might select for or support n fowleri colonisation of dwds biofilm or a mixed amoebae population including non pathogenic amoeba this knowledge would improve the understanding of amoebic colonisation patterns and help explain why different biofilms are colonised solely by pathogenic n fowleri or non pathogenic n lovaniensis or vermamoeba sp previous studies have shown that non naegleria fla population changes were not solely explained by environmental parameters including water temperature and disinfectant residuals and were attributed to ecological factors including food sources delafont et al 2016 nutrients levels and food sources are known to play an important role in amoebae growth competition and biofilm colonisation including by n fowleri goudot et al 2012 and high bacterial richness is often associated with n fowleri presence morgan et al 2016 therefore it is likely that the bacterial community which is also susceptible to temperature variations and disinfectant type and residual pernin et al 1998 williams et al 2004 plays a role in determining which amoebic species dominate a dwds or natural water system biofilm communities affecting amoebae colonisation may also explain why n fowleri is often detected at lower temperatures despite its thermophilic nature in both dwdss and fresh water sources miller et al 2017 morgan et al 2016 sifuentes et al 2014 the detection of appropriate food sources including meiothermus spp to determine site susceptibility to n fowleri colonisation could provide an important advance in our ability to predict pathogen colonization in dwdss and enable water utilities to pre emptively treat sites before colonization by n fowleri 5 conclusion this study investigated intracellular bacteria from n fowleri sampled from an operational drinking water distribution system dwds 1 ecogenomics approaches can be used to generate ecological association hypotheses between taxa and the nature of these associations may be best revealed and tested through multiple independent lines of evidence 2 uncovering trophic interactions between taxa furthers our understanding of ecological systems including the requirements for colonisation success by specific organisms 3 identifying these requirements such as preferred food sources will enable development of biological prediction tools for the management and control of n fowleri in dwdss conflicts of interest the authors declare no

19501,the long term performance of an anoxic oxic hydrocyclone aoh process with an in situ hydrocyclone treatment unit in the mixed liquid return line for sludge reduction and carbon reuse has been observed in comparison with a conventional anoxic oxic ao process three parallel side stream systems including one aoh25 system with a 25 mm hydrocyclone one aoh35 system with a 35 mm hydrocyclone and one ao system were built and fed with real wastewater for a comparative study in a wastewater treatment plant the results demonstrate that the hydrocyclone in the aoh process was able to break macro flocs into smaller flocs and the desorption of the extracellular polymeric substance from return activated sludge as leaded to an average increase of 62 97 and 36 36 in scod in the aoh25 and aoh35

properties compared with the ao process the scod concentration in the effluent of the aoh processes presented a decrease of 12 0 mg l and the tn was reduced by 21 50 owing to the released carbon sources reuse moreover the sludge production was reduced by 36 81 and 35 92 in the aoh25 and aoh35 process respectively by contrast the aoh25 system was better than the aoh35 system graphical abstract

due to its high efficiency and low operation cost in the past decades van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 with the rapid development of urbanization construction and industrial activities in recent decades the unprecedented volumes of eutrophicated wastewater and hazardous sludge have become serious causes of water soil deterioration and human sub health status the conventional ao process has low denitrification efficiency when treating wastewater with a low c n ratio due to the lack of carbon sources for denitrifying bacteria wang et al 2015 in addition vast sludge byproducts stacking outside pose a threat to ecological systems campos et al 2009 ma et al 2012 considering the environmental protection and economic burden effective measures must be taken for sludge minimization and high bnr efficiency before things get worse with stringent legislative requirements and increasingly stringent discharge limits brennan et al 2017 many wwtps have no choice but to increase retention time or add extra carbon sources i e acetate glucose methanol and ethanol as carbon complements to improve bnr efficiency but the additional carbon sources could induce extra expense and produce more excess sludge es gao et al 2011 upon those problems much interest has been observed among scientific community in modification of the conventional ao process to simultaneously enhance organic nitrogen removal and reduce sludge production such as adding a sludge pretreatment unit to adjust c n ratio yan et al 2013 dai et al 2016 nowadays sludge pretreatment methods are involved in thermal treatment dhar et al 2012 chemical treatment ozone hydrogen peroxide or alkaline treatment shi et al 2015 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 mechanical breakage ultrasonic or microwave irradiation zielewicz 2016 biological hydrolysis approaches yu et al 2013 and a combination of the above methods gong et al 2015 commonly sludge production reduction by controlling microbial biomass in the operation process of wastewater treatment is industrially preferable than the end of pipe treatment of es however there are few feasible methods on in situ pretreatment of return activated sludge as in mixed liquid return mlr lines which can shorten the wastewater sludge disposal process and reduce operational costs this is because they are usually limited by the severe deterioration of microbial activity and sludge stability for biodegradation of organics in the wastewater stream during the pretreatment process such as the thermo chemical method disrupting cell walls of sludge microbes kavitha et al 2014 by comparison the mechanical breakage methods are environmental friendly and feasible typically the embedded extracellular polymeric substances eps and inner pore secretion can be desorpted by moderate mechanical methods such as the ultrasound breakage method because of its cavitation effects centrifugal forces and shear forces these methods could also enhance the microbial activity zubrowska sudol and walczak 2014 li et al 2009 have induced an increase of 20 40 in the specific oxygen utilization rate for the treated sludge by using low energy ultrasound with a disintegration degree of less than 20 romero pareja also observed the increase of dehydrogenase and protease activities in the oxic settling anaerobic process combined with ultrasound at a frequency of 20 khz and a power density of 0 375 w ml and the ultrasound contributed to sludge reduction romero pareja et al 2017 most literatures have confirmed the feasibility of the mechanical sludge breakage method to increase carbon sources release and microbial activity with batch tests rather than a continuous treatment process in view of full scale applications the in situ pretreatment method must be cost effective with simple design and management and without negative impacts on effluent quality secondary pollutants therefore cost effective mechanical approaches that can continuously break return as in the mil line are urgently needed as a conventional separation device the hydrocyclone has its advantages such as large processing capacity low cost easy operation ability and high reliability wang et al 2012 yang et al 2011 due to the complicated flow patterns the dispersed phase particles in the hydrocyclone may suffer from the combined effects of centrifugal forces shear forces and other random forces yang et al 2013 when the aqueous phase is continuous phase the sludge aggregates as the dispersed phase would be broken into smaller pieces owing to the variable centrifugal force and shear stress caused by the velocity gradients between concentric flow layers franks et al 2005 roldan villasana and williams 1999 xu et al 2016 actually a proper shear force plays an essential role in formation and performance enhancement of superior sludge for wastewater treatment liu and tay 2002 moreover unstable particles or polymers embedded in the sludge porous channels could be released by the centrifugal force of particle rotation huang et al 2017a b wu et al 2008 all the above demonstrate that the hydrocyclone has the potential to pretreat sludge flocs and release internal carbon substances up to now the soluble synthetic wastewater as a feed substrate was mostly used to study wastewater treatment systems at the lab scale rodriguez perez and fermoso 2016 the synthetic wastewater differs from real wastewater owing to the absence of inert organics and non volatile particles which have a great influence on sludge reduction in the industrial application velho et al 2016 there is a concern that the results based on laboratory studies but not real site specific data may result in failures to achieve high bnr efficiency therefore it is necessary to collect experimental data in real wwtps to guide industrial operation to our knowledge researches on the side stream experiments about the anoxic oxic hydrocyclone aoh process are rarely reported and the reutilization feasibility of released carbon sources remains to be analyzed the lack of information in real plants motivated this paper aiming to observe the long term performance of the aoh process in comparison with the conventional ao process for treating municipal wastewater for this three sets of parallel systems were placed in a wwtp for treating domestic wastewater where a 25 mm hydrocyclone h25 and a 35 mm hydrocyclone h35 were inserted into the mlr line in the aoh25 system and the aoh35 system respectively and the third system used a conventional ao process for a comparative study the performance was mainly evaluated through as characteristics internal carbon sources reuse and sludge growth rates after implementing the aoh and ao process for a long period in addition the effect mechanism of hydrocyclone pretreatment was also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of as and wastewater the original as flocs obtained from the oxic tank and anoxic tank in the minghang wwtp in shanghai were infused into the corresponding tanks of three side stream systems for cultivation this wwtp using the ao process treats municipal wastewater with a capacity of over 20 000 tons daily the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss in the tanks was 3500 4000 mg l and the sludge volume index svi was about 120 ml g real wastewater in the tests were from the primary sedimentation tank in the municipal wwtp and the wastewater characteristics are listed in table s1 supplementary data 2 2 technological methods 2 2 1 apparatus and operation conditions three parallel apparatuses are shown in fig 1 a where the ao system was operated as a blank group fig 1b and the remaining systems were modified into aoh systems as experimental groups fig 1c the aoh25 and aoh35 process could be also as a control group to each other the total handling capacity of the three systems was 4 32 m3 d the volume of the ao reactor was 756 l length of 2400 mm width of 450 mm height of 700 mm which was divided into one anoxic tank and three oxic tanks the volume of the secondary sedimentation tank sst with a half cone angle of 45 was 200 l the volumetric peristaltic pump v6 12 l yz35 china with weak shear properties was selected as the power device placed in the mlr line the two hydrocyclones h25 and h35 were the major pretreatment equipments fig 1c1 c2 the ao reactor sst and hydrocyclones were made up of transparent polymethyl methacrylate for better observation as shown in fig 2 a the conventional ao configuration was modified to introduce an in situ hydrocyclone pretreatment unit configured as the aoh configuration the outflow port of the hydrocyclone was connected to the front end of the anoxic tank and the overflow port was connected to the oxic tank during the 2 weeks cultivation period the municipal wastewater from the primary settling tank of the real wwtp continuously flowed into the ao reactor working volume of 648 l a portion of which was biodegraded by nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria compared with the ao process fig 2b the hydrocyclones in the aoh processes were expected to pretreat return as in the mlr line and release internal carbon sources the experiments continuously operated for 3 months 24 h per day after a two week acclimation the ambient temperature range was 13 25 c and the sludge age was around 20 days the operation parameters of the systems are listed in table s2 supplementary data 2 2 2 hydrocyclone the hydrocyclone with a smaller diameter was preferably suitable for low handling capacity a smaller cone angle was chosen to ensure longish retention time for as flocs in the hydrocyclone the underflow outlet with a larger diameter was benefit for the discharge of high density sludge avoiding the ports clogging based on the above demands the structure of hydrocyclones with a cylinder diameter of 25 mm and 35 mm was optimized supplementary data fig s1 and the detailed parameters are listed in table s3 supplementary data 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 conventional analysis after collecting mixed liquor samples the sludge supernatant was immediately separated from the sludge parent by filtering with 0 45 μm filters and then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to use the conventional tests for scod polysaccharides tn tp mlss no2 n and no3 n concentrations were in accordance with the apha standard methods apha 2005 chen et al 2015 the ph was measured using a ph meter kedida ct 6021a china sludge size distributions were characterized by the laser particle size analyzer beckman coulter ls 230 america 2 3 2 monosaccharide composition analysis deep insight into the change of polysaccharides components in the sludge supernatant is helpful for better understanding the migration process of exopolysaccharides and endopolysaccharides after hydrocyclone pretreatment up to now restricted by available analysis techniques it is very difficult to directly identify all component distributions of unknown mixed polysaccharides in the liquid thus the polysaccharides should be hydrolyzed into monosaccharides to indirectly analyze carbohydrate compositions using gas chromatography gc analysis shimadu gc2010 japan the mixed standard monosaccharides solution for a comparative study was composed of rhamnose rha fucose fuc arabinose ara xylose xyl mannose man glucose glc galactose gal glucuronic acid glca and galactose acid gala with the molarity of 5 mmol l prior to test the analyzed polysaccharide samples were extracted with a rotary evaporator re 52a beijing in 45 c the sample 2 mg was dissolved in 2 ml of 2 mol l trifluoroacetic acid in a screw capped vial filled with n2 and then hydrolyzed at 121 c for 2 h yang et al 2010 finally the monosaccharide samples were produced followed by evaporating the hydrolyzate within a rotary evaporator and repeatedly adding deionized water for 6 times the standard monosaccharide and the analyzed monosaccharide samples were simultaneously detected by gc lehrfeld 1985 gc was performed with a capillary column of rtx 5 ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 m the temperature program was 180 c for 2 min then to 210 c at 6 c min then to 215 c at 0 3 c min then to 240 c at 6 c min for 45 min peng et al 2012 the monosaccharide compositions were obtained through comparative analysis 2 3 3 sludge morphology analysis to determine the morphological changes of as after hydrocyclone pretreatment sludge samples in the inlet and outlet of hydrocyclone were observed by a scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem450 america the sludge samples for sem should be pretreated by the tert butyl alcohol drying method before test jin et al 2017 ning et al 2014 in detail after centrifugation at 5000 r min for 5 min the sludge sample was treated by fixation fresh 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c for 12 h and washing phosphatic buffer solution for 3 times then it was dried for 10 h in a vacuum dryer after dehydration a graded series of ethanol 30 50 70 85 90 100 and 100 for 15 min respectively and displacement a graded series of tert butyl alcohol 25 50 75 100 and 100 in ethanol and tert butyl alcohol mix solution at over 26 c for 20 min respectively the sem observation was performed after gilding treatment 2 4 calculation methods 2 4 1 denitrification rate in the continuous operation to evaluate microbial activity in the long term operation of aoh and ao systems the continuous denitrification rate ρ n o 3 n of denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic tank was calculated as we know the denitrification process mostly takes place in the anoxic tank where the nitrate comes from the oxic tank through the mlr line connecting the tail end of oxic tank with the front end of anoxic tank the organic matters coming from the influent wastewater and the mlr line provide the major carbon sources for denitrification in our work the ρ n o 3 n in the anoxic tank was defined and calculated as eq 1 1 ρ n o 3 n c 1 c 2 m l s s a r t a where c 1 c 2 are no3 n concentrations mg l in the front end and the tail end of the anoxic tank respectively mlss a is mixed liquor suspended solids concentration g l in the anoxic tank rt a is average retention time of no3 n in the anoxic tank which is expressed as follows 2 rt a v a e in e return where v a is sludge volume l in the anoxic tank e in is influent flow l h and e return is sludge mixed liquid return flow l h 2 4 2 calculation of the sludge growth rate the sludge growth rate y sgr was determined by using a regression method applied to the cumulative sludge production over time briefly the total sludge amount dried weight after n days operation q n was calculated by considering the existing sludge amount in the system and the es discharged within n days as described in eq 3 3 q n q a q o q s s t i 1 n q discharge i m l s s a v a m l s s o v o m l s s s s t v s s t i 1 n q discharge i where the terms mlss a mlss o and mlss sst are the sludge concentrations in the anoxic tank oxic tank and sst respectively mg l v a v o and v sst are the sludge volume in the anoxic tank oxic tank and sst respectively l the term q discharge i refers to the es discharged at the i th day and the q discharge 1 at the first day is zero according to the general expression the cumulative sludge production on the n day w n g was the difference of the total sludge amount after the first day s operation and n days operation as described in eq 4 4 w n q n q 1 the mean value of y sgr is calculated as the slope of the linear regression curve fitting the cumulative sludge production over time during the long term operation process 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of hydrocyclone treatment on as properties 3 1 1 sem analysis of as morphology the high magnification sem images before and after static hydrocyclone treatment for as are shown in fig 3 the results reveals that a large number of bacteria were stacked together and embedded under eps forming an intact and connected flocculation structure with many micro porous channels the micro porous channels were the transport corridors of nutrients and water used for microorganisms metabolism which have been largely filled with bacterial secretion products organic colloids and inorganic particles marked 1 in fig 3 and cocci and bacillus were the predominant bacteria with a diameter from 0 5 μm to 5 μm whose surfaces were coarse and ruffly due to the coverage of filamentous colloids or precipitates marked 2 4 in fig 3 after treated by the hydrocyclone the ruffly appearance of as was replaced by the smooth irregular morphology marked 7 in fig 3 the exfoliation of eps on sludge surfaces probably exposed the active sites of enzymes e g α amylase and α glucosidase into the water which improved the contact probability of enzymes with organic contaminants hence affecting the process treatment efficiency yu et al 2007 in addition some well formed bacteria were able to withstand a certain shear force and kept integrity marked 8 in fig 3 whereas some unsubstantial cells were disrupted marked 6 in fig 3 moreover colloidal obstacles in the micro pores were partially cleaned marked 5 in fig 3 thereby improving the mass transfer of nutrients considering that the eps on cell surfaces are always negatively charged and can bind with the positively charged organic pollutants through electrostatic interaction esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 the broken as after hydrocyclone treatment was able to reabsorb pollutants or some individual eps components to form new zoogloeas during the nitrification denitrification process sheng et al 2010 and the repetitive breakage and flocculation of as were more beneficial for the continuous update of sludge surfaces in microbial aggregates 3 1 2 floc size distribution the size distribution of as in the inlet and outlet of h25 and h35 on the first day s operation and 30 days operation of aoh systems are shown in fig 4 a b the four sets of curves indicate that the floc size distribution all moved leftwards for a certain distance after hydrocyclone treatment on the first day s operation the mean size of as decreased from 55 to 34 μm after h25 treatment and from 52 μm to 40 μm after h35 treatment marked 1 in fig 4 after incubated by the hydrocyclone for one month the mean size of the sludge in ao tanks was around 33 μm but even so while the sludge suffered from shear forces again the floc size still decreased by around 3 μm marked 2 in fig 4 based on the von smoluchowski kinetics equation in flocculation construction small floccules after breakage were able to collide and cohere with each other again to form a stable and large flocculation structure sposito 1997 therefore the breakup and aggregation of as flocs coexist simultaneously during the continuous operation of aoh process which is in accordance with variations of sludge morphology analyzed above 3 2 influence of hydrocyclone treatment on carbon sources release 3 2 1 scod and polysaccharides concentrations the scod and polysaccharides concentrations in the inlet and outlet of hydrocyclones during the continuous operation are depicted in fig 5 compared with the hydrocyclone inlet the average release rates of scod in the hydrocyclone outlet are 92 26 and 37 02 in the aoh25 and aoh35 system respectively fig 5a b this phenomenon was related to the release of organics originating from the exfoliation of the eps from cell surfaces and the destruction of as structures analogously the variation trends of soluble polysaccharides which are the primary organic matters of microorganism construction were similar with the scod fig 5c d the polysaccharides increased by 28 48 and 16 72 after h25 treatment and h35 treatment respectively obviously the h25 provided more organic substances than the h35 when pretreating as at the same inlet flow rate the results also indicate that the polysaccharides accounted for an abnormally low proportion of the scod this may be because that with the improvement of people living standards discharged wastewater contains a great number of grease macromolecule that leads to a higher scod concentration 3 2 2 monosaccharide composition analysis to get insight into the polysaccharides release monosaccharide components of polysaccharides in the sludge supernatant before and after h35 treatment were summarized in table 1 the gc analysis identified that the raw sludge sample consisted of rha fuc ara xyl man glc gal glea and gala in the molar ratio of 0 14 0 144 0 952 0 352 0 736 1 24 16 96 1 1 12 the corresponding molar ratio of the sludge sample treated by the hydrocyclone was 0 29 0 52 0 33 0 14 0 7 1 3 29 and clea and gala were not detected from this the type and proportion of monosaccharides changed and the molar content of rha fuc man and glc had a significant increase after hydrocyclone treatment as we know rha is usually located on cell surfaces in the form of polysaccharides or grease and fuc is found to be the constituent part of the glycan of glycoproteins in bacteria glc is the most important and readily usable energy substances and provides c skeleton for synthesizing other biomolecules such as amino acids and nucleotides therefore rha fuc and glc are the main compositions of intracellular and extracellular polymers all the above demonstrated that the polysaccharide compositions in the sludge supernatant have changed and partial polysaccharides were released from as which was agreement with the morphology observation 3 3 influence mechanism hypothesis based on the morphology observation and the relevant analysis above the influence mechanism of the hydrocyclone on as structure during the long term operation was hypothesized and illustrated in fig 6 commonly as flocs are regarded as complex aggregates that a great number of macromolecular chains such as cellulose protein and polysaccharides connect a single cell or zoogloea by dlvo forces electrostatic interaction and van der waals and non dlvo forces such as hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interaction ionic bonds and polymer entanglement to form a big and unstable flocculation structure lu et al 2016 yu et al 2008 and a single microbe is made up of cell tightly bound eps tb eps loosely bound eps lb eps and soluble eps s eps sheng et al 2010 when exposed to shear the breakage of flocs may be classified into three modes i e flocs breakup where a floc is broken into smaller pieces or a sing microbe he et al 2012 eps removal where multilevel eps are separated from the parent cell and cell disruption the breakage modes and main forces in the hydrocyclone are also shown in fig 6 at the first mode a large scale floc with a loose structure has broken into smaller zoogloea or a single microbe this is because that the combined action of shear force and drawing force such as fluid drag force centrifugal force centripetal buoyancy and other random forces destroyed weak intermolecular interactions xiao et al 2015 usually a shear rate of 800 s 1 was chosen as a standard or intermediate value to break sludge aggregates into smaller pieces mikkelsen and kelding 2002 sheng et al 2008 when a single microbe is exposed to the non uniform force field s eps will be firstly removed to the aqueous phase followed by lb eps and finally by tb eps depending on the shear forces and centrifugal forces applied to the microbe and all sides of the microbe are able to experience the tangential shear forces because of the high speed autorotation of a microbe huang et al 2017a b released eps can be quickly separated from the cells by the centrifugal force of rotation and revolution which prevents the gelatinoids residue from sticking to floc surfaces again at the last mode when experiencing the strong shear forces i e a shear rate of 5000 s 1 or shuttling between negative pressure or high pressure flow layers cell ruptures of microorganisms may take place yang et al 2017 importantly sludge may simultaneously undergo all breakage modes due to the non uniform shearing distribution with a shear rate range of 0 10000 s 1 or more in the hydrocyclone xu et al 2016 as we know sludge surfaces are not neutral and extracellular proteins contain groups such as nh2 cooh oh and conh the last diagram in fig 6 flemming and wingender 2010 thus in the following operation broken sludge would cohere with each other and adsorb organic pollutants in the ao reactor again by dlvo and non dlvo forces to create a suitable microenvironment of microorganisms metabolism sheng et al 2010 to our group s knowledge of multiphase flow in the hydrocyclone integrated effects of key factors such as shear forces centrifugal forces of revolution and autorotation may cause the evolution of sludge structures and release of organic compounds the hydrocyclone was expected to promote the migration of organic matters utilization of idle carbon sources in as and update of sludge interface 3 4 continuous treatment efficiency and sludge reduction 3 4 1 migration and transformation of pollutants along the flow path variations of scod tn tp nh4 n and no3 n in the three units anoxic tank oxic tank and hydrocyclone were analyzed to appraise variations of pollutants and reutilization of released carbon sources and the results are demonstrated in fig 7 in the anoxic tank 51 70 52 13 and 55 18 of scod respectively in the ao aoh25 and aoh35 systems were degraded by bacteria and the scod in the hydrocyclone unit averagely increased by 62 97 and 36 36 in comparison with the oxic tank owing to sludge hydrocyclone breakage the released organics were pumped to the anoxic as a supplement carbon source of denitrifying bacteria so that the average concentration of scod in the anoxic tank rarely got affected fig 7a the scod in the effluent of the three processes approximately met the second level cod 100 mg l in the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant of china gb18918 2002 this may be due to the lower ambient temperature of 13 25 c which lowered microbial degradation activity even so the scod averagely decreased by 9 86 mg l and 12 0 mg l in the effluent of aoh25 and aoh35 systems in comparison to the ao process respectively variations of tp and tn along the flow path are depicted in fig 7b c the tp concentrations averagely increased by 0 30 mg l and 0 29 mg l in the hydrocyclone unit of aoh25 and aoh35 systems respectively however compared with the ao system the tp concentration in the effluent of aoh systems was reduced by 13 42 1 78 similar with the tp the average tn concentrations were reduced by 17 37 and 21 50 in the effluent of aoh25 and aoh35 systems respectively which were both complied with the grade 1b permissible discharge standard of china tn 20mg l the results may demonstrate that the released carbon sources were effectively used to enhance the nitrogen removal and phosphorus accumulating process fig 7d depicts the nh4 n and no3 n removal by the ao and aoh processes nitrification of the three processes was efficient and the nh4 n removal rates could reach up to 97 the stable concentrations were compiled with grade 1a discharge standard of china 5mg l detailed analysis on the nitrate concentrations shows that no3 n transported from the anoxic tank was converted to nitrite and subsequently nitrogen gas by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the oxic tank the no3 n concentrations were reduced by 27 45 32 35 and 32 90 through biological denitrification in the ao aoh25 and aoh35 systems thus there was a slight increase in no3 n removal in the aoh processes compared to that in the conventional ao process indicating inserting hydrocyclone had no adverse effect on denitrification process 3 4 2 continuous denitrification performance in the anoxic tank to investigate the denitrification performance and carbon sources utilization ρ n o 3 n of denitrifying bacteria and no2 n concentrations in the anoxic tank were monitored during the continuous operation of aoh and ao systems as shown in fig 8 a ρ n o 3 n values fluctuated greatly over time due to the variable ambient conditions in the real wwtp compared with the ao process ρ n o 3 n averagely increased by 35 14 and 43 11 in the aoh25 and aoh35 processes respectively this may be because that released organics originated from as in the mlr line provided extra carbon sources for denitrifying bacteria to achieve advanced denitrification as shown in fig 8b the no2 n concentrations in the anoxic tank of ao aoh25 and aoh35 were 0 285mg l 0 446 mg l and 0 517 mg l respectively obviously no2 n concentrations in the aoh systems were higher than that in the ao system the no2 n accumulation in the aoh systems also demonstrated that the released carbon sources were used as supplementary carbon sources when no3 n was converted to no2 n 3 4 3 sludge reduction the cumulative sludge production w n and sludge growth rate y sgr are the most significant factors to evaluate sludge minimization generally with the increasing operation time the w n of the three systems increased linearly fig 9 after a month of monitoring the average sludge production in the ao system was 125 67 g dried weight daily which was 43 32 g more than that in the aoh25 system and 53 56 g more than that in the aoh35 system the y sgr calculated from the regression lines is shown in fig 9 the lowest y sgr of 81 49 g day was observed in aoh25 with a 36 81 reduction compared to the ao process in aoh35 y sgr is 82 64 g day leading to a mean sludge reduction of 35 92 compared to the ao process therefore the advanced aoh process had a lower sludge growth rate than the conventional ao process the sludge reduction of up to 35 92 observed in the aoh process was higher than the reduction of 20 from velho s research likewise using the real wastewater as a feed substrate velho et al 2016 but lower than that from romero pareja s research primarily using synthetic wastewater romero pareja et al 2017 this is because that the real wastewater is different form synthetic wastewater and the real wastewater is rich in inert particulate matter that limits sludge reduction efficiency which was confirmed by coma et al 2013 in short the aoh process can simultaneously achieve in situ sludge reduction and the reuse of idle carbon sources in as for great bnr efficiency with no secondary pollution and easy operability 4 conclusions the long term performance of the aoh process was evaluated by comparing three parallel systems fed with real wastewater including two aoh processes and one conventional ao process the conclusions were as follows 1 the in situ hydrocyclone treatment was effective to break macro flocs into smaller flocs accompanied by the desorption of internal carbon sources the shear forces centrifugal forces of revolution and flocs rotation in the hydrocyclone were proposed to be the important action mechanism 2 compared with the ao process the aoh process presented a decrease of 12 0 mg l in scod in the effluent and the tn was reduced by 21 50 owing to the released carbon sources reuse 3 compared with the ao process denitrification efficiency in the anoxic tank averagely improved by 35 14 and 43 11 in the aoh25 and aoh35 processes due to long term hydrocyclone acclimatization 4 the sludge production was reduced by 36 81 and 35 92 in aoh25 and aoh35 systems in comparison to the ao process respectively by contrast the aoh25 system is better than the aoh35 system acknowledgement this work was supported by the

19501,the long term performance of an anoxic oxic hydrocyclone aoh process with an in situ hydrocyclone treatment unit in the mixed liquid return line for sludge reduction and carbon reuse has been observed in comparison with a conventional anoxic oxic ao process three parallel side stream systems including one aoh25 system with a 25 mm hydrocyclone one aoh35 system with a 35 mm hydrocyclone and one ao system were built and fed with real wastewater for a comparative study in a wastewater treatment plant the results demonstrate that the hydrocyclone in the aoh process was able to break macro flocs into smaller flocs and the desorption of the extracellular polymeric substance from return activated sludge as leaded to an average increase of 62 97 and 36 36 in scod in the aoh25 and aoh35

due to its high efficiency and low operation cost in the past decades van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 with the rapid development of urbanization construction and industrial activities in recent decades the unprecedented volumes of eutrophicated wastewater and hazardous sludge have become serious causes of water soil deterioration and human sub health status the conventional ao process has low denitrification efficiency when treating wastewater with a low c n ratio due to the lack of carbon sources for denitrifying bacteria wang et al 2015 in addition vast sludge byproducts stacking outside pose a threat to ecological systems campos et al 2009 ma et al 2012 considering the environmental protection and economic burden effective measures must be taken for sludge minimization and high bnr efficiency before things get worse with stringent legislative requirements and increasingly stringent discharge limits brennan et al 2017 many wwtps have no choice but to increase retention time or add extra carbon sources i e acetate glucose methanol and ethanol as carbon complements to improve bnr efficiency but the additional carbon sources could induce extra expense and produce more excess sludge es gao et al 2011 upon those problems much interest has been observed among scientific community in modification of the conventional ao process to simultaneously enhance organic nitrogen removal and reduce sludge production such as adding a sludge pretreatment unit to adjust c n ratio yan et al 2013 dai et al 2016 nowadays sludge pretreatment methods are involved in thermal treatment dhar et al 2012 chemical treatment ozone hydrogen peroxide or alkaline treatment shi et al 2015 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 mechanical breakage ultrasonic or microwave irradiation zielewicz 2016 biological hydrolysis approaches yu et al 2013 and a combination of the above methods gong et al 2015 commonly sludge production reduction by controlling microbial biomass in the operation process of wastewater treatment is industrially preferable than the end of pipe treatment of es however there are few feasible methods on in situ pretreatment of return activated sludge as in mixed liquid return mlr lines which can shorten the wastewater sludge disposal process and reduce operational costs this is because they are usually limited by the severe deterioration of microbial activity and sludge stability for biodegradation of organics in the wastewater stream during the pretreatment process such as the thermo chemical method disrupting cell walls of sludge microbes kavitha et al 2014 by comparison the mechanical breakage methods are environmental friendly and feasible typically the embedded extracellular polymeric substances eps and inner pore secretion can be desorpted by moderate mechanical methods such as the ultrasound breakage method because of its cavitation effects centrifugal forces and shear forces these methods could also enhance the microbial activity zubrowska sudol and walczak 2014 li et al 2009 have induced an increase of 20 40 in the specific oxygen utilization rate for the treated sludge by using low energy ultrasound with a disintegration degree of less than 20 romero pareja also observed the increase of dehydrogenase and protease activities in the oxic settling anaerobic process combined with ultrasound at a frequency of 20 khz and a power density of 0 375 w ml and the ultrasound contributed to sludge reduction romero pareja et al 2017 most literatures have confirmed the feasibility of the mechanical sludge breakage method to increase carbon sources release and microbial activity with batch tests rather than a continuous treatment process in view of full scale applications the in situ pretreatment method must be cost effective with simple design and management and without negative impacts on effluent quality secondary pollutants therefore cost effective mechanical approaches that can continuously break return as in the mil line are urgently needed as a conventional separation device the hydrocyclone has its advantages such as large processing capacity low cost easy operation ability and high reliability wang et al 2012 yang et al 2011 due to the complicated flow patterns the dispersed phase particles in the hydrocyclone may suffer from the combined effects of centrifugal forces shear forces and other random forces yang et al 2013 when the aqueous phase is continuous phase the sludge aggregates as the dispersed phase would be broken into smaller pieces owing to the variable centrifugal force and shear stress caused by the velocity gradients between concentric flow layers franks et al 2005 roldan villasana and williams 1999 xu et al 2016 actually a proper shear force plays an essential role in formation and performance enhancement of superior sludge for wastewater treatment liu and tay 2002 moreover unstable particles or polymers embedded in the sludge porous channels could be released by the centrifugal force of particle rotation huang et al 2017a b wu et al 2008 all the above demonstrate that the hydrocyclone has the potential to pretreat sludge flocs and release internal carbon substances up to now the soluble synthetic wastewater as a feed substrate was mostly used to study wastewater treatment systems at the lab scale rodriguez perez and fermoso 2016 the synthetic wastewater differs from real wastewater owing to the absence of inert organics and non volatile particles which have a great influence on sludge reduction in the industrial application velho et al 2016 there is a concern that the results based on laboratory studies but not real site specific data may result in failures to achieve high bnr efficiency therefore it is necessary to collect experimental data in real wwtps to guide industrial operation to our knowledge researches on the side stream experiments about the anoxic oxic hydrocyclone aoh process are rarely reported and the reutilization feasibility of released carbon sources remains to be analyzed the lack of information in real plants motivated this paper aiming to observe the long term performance of the aoh process in comparison with the conventional ao process for treating municipal wastewater for this three sets of parallel systems were placed in a wwtp for treating domestic wastewater where a 25 mm hydrocyclone h25 and a 35 mm hydrocyclone h35 were inserted into the mlr line in the aoh25 system and the aoh35 system respectively and the third system used a conventional ao process for a comparative study the performance was mainly evaluated through as characteristics internal carbon sources reuse and sludge growth rates after implementing the aoh and ao process for a long period in addition the effect mechanism of hydrocyclone pretreatment was also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of as and wastewater the original as flocs obtained from the oxic tank and anoxic tank in the minghang wwtp in shanghai were infused into the corresponding tanks of three side stream systems for cultivation this wwtp using the ao process treats municipal wastewater with a capacity of over 20 000 tons daily the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss in the tanks was 3500 4000 mg l and the sludge volume index svi was about 120 ml g real wastewater in the tests were from the primary sedimentation tank in the municipal wwtp and the wastewater characteristics are listed in table s1 supplementary data 2 2 technological methods 2 2 1 apparatus and operation conditions three parallel apparatuses are shown in fig 1 a where the ao system was operated as a blank group fig 1b and the remaining systems were modified into aoh systems as experimental groups fig 1c the aoh25 and aoh35 process could be also as a control group to each other the total handling capacity of the three systems was 4 32 m3 d the volume of the ao reactor was 756 l length of 2400 mm width of 450 mm height of 700 mm which was divided into one anoxic tank and three oxic tanks the volume of the secondary sedimentation tank sst with a half cone angle of 45 was 200 l the volumetric peristaltic pump v6 12 l yz35 china with weak shear properties was selected as the power device placed in the mlr line the two hydrocyclones h25 and h35 were the major pretreatment equipments fig 1c1 c2 the ao reactor sst and hydrocyclones were made up of transparent polymethyl methacrylate for better observation as shown in fig 2 a the conventional ao configuration was modified to introduce an in situ hydrocyclone pretreatment unit configured as the aoh configuration the outflow port of the hydrocyclone was connected to the front end of the anoxic tank and the overflow port was connected to the oxic tank during the 2 weeks cultivation period the municipal wastewater from the primary settling tank of the real wwtp continuously flowed into the ao reactor working volume of 648 l a portion of which was biodegraded by nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria compared with the ao process fig 2b the hydrocyclones in the aoh processes were expected to pretreat return as in the mlr line and release internal carbon sources the experiments continuously operated for 3 months 24 h per day after a two week acclimation the ambient temperature range was 13 25 c and the sludge age was around 20 days the operation parameters of the systems are listed in table s2 supplementary data 2 2 2 hydrocyclone the hydrocyclone with a smaller diameter was preferably suitable for low handling capacity a smaller cone angle was chosen to ensure longish retention time for as flocs in the hydrocyclone the underflow outlet with a larger diameter was benefit for the discharge of high density sludge avoiding the ports clogging based on the above demands the structure of hydrocyclones with a cylinder diameter of 25 mm and 35 mm was optimized supplementary data fig s1 and the detailed parameters are listed in table s3 supplementary data 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 conventional analysis after collecting mixed liquor samples the sludge supernatant was immediately separated from the sludge parent by filtering with 0 45 μm filters and then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to use the conventional tests for scod polysaccharides tn tp mlss no2 n and no3 n concentrations were in accordance with the apha standard methods apha 2005 chen et al 2015 the ph was measured using a ph meter kedida ct 6021a china sludge size distributions were characterized by the laser particle size analyzer beckman coulter ls 230 america 2 3 2 monosaccharide composition analysis deep insight into the change of polysaccharides components in the sludge supernatant is helpful for better understanding the migration process of exopolysaccharides and endopolysaccharides after hydrocyclone pretreatment up to now restricted by available analysis techniques it is very difficult to directly identify all component distributions of unknown mixed polysaccharides in the liquid thus the polysaccharides should be hydrolyzed into monosaccharides to indirectly analyze carbohydrate compositions using gas chromatography gc analysis shimadu gc2010 japan the mixed standard monosaccharides solution for a comparative study was composed of rhamnose rha fucose fuc arabinose ara xylose xyl mannose man glucose glc galactose gal glucuronic acid glca and galactose acid gala with the molarity of 5 mmol l prior to test the analyzed polysaccharide samples were extracted with a rotary evaporator re 52a beijing in 45 c the sample 2 mg was dissolved in 2 ml of 2 mol l trifluoroacetic acid in a screw capped vial filled with n2 and then hydrolyzed at 121 c for 2 h yang et al 2010 finally the monosaccharide samples were produced followed by evaporating the hydrolyzate within a rotary evaporator and repeatedly adding deionized water for 6 times the standard monosaccharide and the analyzed monosaccharide samples were simultaneously detected by gc lehrfeld 1985 gc was performed with a capillary column of rtx 5 ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 m the temperature program was 180 c for 2 min then to 210 c at 6 c min then to 215 c at 0 3 c min then to 240 c at 6 c min for 45 min peng et al 2012 the monosaccharide compositions were obtained through comparative analysis 2 3 3 sludge morphology analysis to determine the morphological changes of as after hydrocyclone pretreatment sludge samples in the inlet and outlet of hydrocyclone were observed by a scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem450 america the sludge samples for sem should be pretreated by the tert butyl alcohol drying method before test jin et al 2017 ning et al 2014 in detail after centrifugation at 5000 r min for 5 min the sludge sample was treated by fixation fresh 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c for 12 h and washing phosphatic buffer solution for 3 times then it was dried for 10 h in a vacuum dryer after dehydration a graded series of ethanol 30 50 70 85 90 100 and 100 for 15 min respectively and displacement a graded series of tert butyl alcohol 25 50 75 100 and 100 in ethanol and tert butyl alcohol mix solution at over 26 c for 20 min respectively the sem observation was performed after gilding treatment 2 4 calculation methods 2 4 1 denitrification rate in the continuous operation to evaluate microbial activity in the long term operation of aoh and ao systems the continuous denitrification rate ρ n o 3 n of denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic tank was calculated as we know the denitrification process mostly takes place in the anoxic tank where the nitrate comes from the oxic tank through the mlr line connecting the tail end of oxic tank with the front end of anoxic tank the organic matters coming from the influent wastewater and the mlr line provide the major carbon sources for denitrification in our work the ρ n o 3 n in the anoxic tank was defined and calculated as eq 1 1 ρ n o 3 n c 1 c 2 m l s s a r t a where c 1 c 2 are no3 n concentrations mg l in the front end and the tail end of the anoxic tank respectively mlss a is mixed liquor suspended solids concentration g l in the anoxic tank rt a is average retention time of no3 n in the anoxic tank which is expressed as follows 2 rt a v a e in e return where v a is sludge volume l in the anoxic tank e in is influent flow l h and e return is sludge mixed liquid return flow l h 2 4 2 calculation of the sludge growth rate the sludge growth rate y sgr was determined by using a regression method applied to the cumulative sludge production over time briefly the total sludge amount dried weight after n days operation q n was calculated by considering the existing sludge amount in the system and the es discharged within n days as described in eq 3 3 q n q a q o q s s t i 1 n q discharge i m l s s a v a m l s s o v o m l s s s s t v s s t i 1 n q discharge i where the terms mlss a mlss o and mlss sst are the sludge concentrations in the anoxic tank oxic tank and sst respectively mg l v a v o and v sst are the sludge volume in the anoxic tank oxic tank and sst respectively l the term q discharge i refers to the es discharged at the i th day and the q discharge 1 at the first day is zero according to the general expression the cumulative sludge production on the n day w n g was the difference of the total sludge amount after the first day s operation and n days operation as described in eq 4 4 w n q n q 1 the mean value of y sgr is calculated as the slope of the linear regression curve fitting the cumulative sludge production over time during the long term operation process 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of hydrocyclone treatment on as properties 3 1 1 sem analysis of as morphology the high magnification sem images before and after static hydrocyclone treatment for as are shown in fig 3 the results reveals that a large number of bacteria were stacked together and embedded under eps forming an intact and connected flocculation structure with many micro porous channels the micro porous channels were the transport corridors of nutrients and water used for microorganisms metabolism which have been largely filled with bacterial secretion products organic colloids and inorganic particles marked 1 in fig 3 and cocci and bacillus were the predominant bacteria with a diameter from 0 5 μm to 5 μm whose surfaces were coarse and ruffly due to the coverage of filamentous colloids or precipitates marked 2 4 in fig 3 after treated by the hydrocyclone the ruffly appearance of as was replaced by the smooth irregular morphology marked 7 in fig 3 the exfoliation of eps on sludge surfaces probably exposed the active sites of enzymes e g α amylase and α glucosidase into the water which improved the contact probability of enzymes with organic contaminants hence affecting the process treatment efficiency yu et al 2007 in addition some well formed bacteria were able to withstand a certain shear force and kept integrity marked 8 in fig 3 whereas some unsubstantial cells were disrupted marked 6 in fig 3 moreover colloidal obstacles in the micro pores were partially cleaned marked 5 in fig 3 thereby improving the mass transfer of nutrients considering that the eps on cell surfaces are always negatively charged and can bind with the positively charged organic pollutants through electrostatic interaction esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 the broken as after hydrocyclone treatment was able to reabsorb pollutants or some individual eps components to form new zoogloeas during the nitrification denitrification process sheng et al 2010 and the repetitive breakage and flocculation of as were more beneficial for the continuous update of sludge surfaces in microbial aggregates 3 1 2 floc size distribution the size distribution of as in the inlet and outlet of h25 and h35 on the first day s operation and 30 days operation of aoh systems are shown in fig 4 a b the four sets of curves indicate that the floc size distribution all moved leftwards for a certain distance after hydrocyclone treatment on the first day s operation the mean size of as decreased from 55 to 34 μm after h25 treatment and from 52 μm to 40 μm after h35 treatment marked 1 in fig 4 after incubated by the hydrocyclone for one month the mean size of the sludge in ao tanks was around 33 μm but even so while the sludge suffered from shear forces again the floc size still decreased by around 3 μm marked 2 in fig 4 based on the von smoluchowski kinetics equation in flocculation construction small floccules after breakage were able to collide and cohere with each other again to form a stable and large flocculation structure sposito 1997 therefore the breakup and aggregation of as flocs coexist simultaneously during the continuous operation of aoh process which is in accordance with variations of sludge morphology analyzed above 3 2 influence of hydrocyclone treatment on carbon sources release 3 2 1 scod and polysaccharides concentrations the scod and polysaccharides concentrations in the inlet and outlet of hydrocyclones during the continuous operation are depicted in fig 5 compared with the hydrocyclone inlet the average release rates of scod in the hydrocyclone outlet are 92 26 and 37 02 in the aoh25 and aoh35 system respectively fig 5a b this phenomenon was related to the release of organics originating from the exfoliation of the eps from cell surfaces and the destruction of as structures analogously the variation trends of soluble polysaccharides which are the primary organic matters of microorganism construction were similar with the scod fig 5c d the polysaccharides increased by 28 48 and 16 72 after h25 treatment and h35 treatment respectively obviously the h25 provided more organic substances than the h35 when pretreating as at the same inlet flow rate the results also indicate that the polysaccharides accounted for an abnormally low proportion of the scod this may be because that with the improvement of people living standards discharged wastewater contains a great number of grease macromolecule that leads to a higher scod concentration 3 2 2 monosaccharide composition analysis to get insight into the polysaccharides release monosaccharide components of polysaccharides in the sludge supernatant before and after h35 treatment were summarized in table 1 the gc analysis identified that the raw sludge sample consisted of rha fuc ara xyl man glc gal glea and gala in the molar ratio of 0 14 0 144 0 952 0 352 0 736 1 24 16 96 1 1 12 the corresponding molar ratio of the sludge sample treated by the hydrocyclone was 0 29 0 52 0 33 0 14 0 7 1 3 29 and clea and gala were not detected from this the type and proportion of monosaccharides changed and the molar content of rha fuc man and glc had a significant increase after hydrocyclone treatment as we know rha is usually located on cell surfaces in the form of polysaccharides or grease and fuc is found to be the constituent part of the glycan of glycoproteins in bacteria glc is the most important and readily usable energy substances and provides c skeleton for synthesizing other biomolecules such as amino acids and nucleotides therefore rha fuc and glc are the main compositions of intracellular and extracellular polymers all the above demonstrated that the polysaccharide compositions in the sludge supernatant have changed and partial polysaccharides were released from as which was agreement with the morphology observation 3 3 influence mechanism hypothesis based on the morphology observation and the relevant analysis above the influence mechanism of the hydrocyclone on as structure during the long term operation was hypothesized and illustrated in fig 6 commonly as flocs are regarded as complex aggregates that a great number of macromolecular chains such as cellulose protein and polysaccharides connect a single cell or zoogloea by dlvo forces electrostatic interaction and van der waals and non dlvo forces such as hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interaction ionic bonds and polymer entanglement to form a big and unstable flocculation structure lu et al 2016 yu et al 2008 and a single microbe is made up of cell tightly bound eps tb eps loosely bound eps lb eps and soluble eps s eps sheng et al 2010 when exposed to shear the breakage of flocs may be classified into three modes i e flocs breakup where a floc is broken into smaller pieces or a sing microbe he et al 2012 eps removal where multilevel eps are separated from the parent cell and cell disruption the breakage modes and main forces in the hydrocyclone are also shown in fig 6 at the first mode a large scale floc with a loose structure has broken into smaller zoogloea or a single microbe this is because that the combined action of shear force and drawing force such as fluid drag force centrifugal force centripetal buoyancy and other random forces destroyed weak intermolecular interactions xiao et al 2015 usually a shear rate of 800 s 1 was chosen as a standard or intermediate value to break sludge aggregates into smaller pieces mikkelsen and kelding 2002 sheng et al 2008 when a single microbe is exposed to the non uniform force field s eps will be firstly removed to the aqueous phase followed by lb eps and finally by tb eps depending on the shear forces and centrifugal forces applied to the microbe and all sides of the microbe are able to experience the tangential shear forces because of the high speed autorotation of a microbe huang et al 2017a b released eps can be quickly separated from the cells by the centrifugal force of rotation and revolution which prevents the gelatinoids residue from sticking to floc surfaces again at the last mode when experiencing the strong shear forces i e a shear rate of 5000 s 1 or shuttling between negative pressure or high pressure flow layers cell ruptures of microorganisms may take place yang et al 2017 importantly sludge may simultaneously undergo all breakage modes due to the non uniform shearing distribution with a shear rate range of 0 10000 s 1 or more in the hydrocyclone xu et al 2016 as we know sludge surfaces are not neutral and extracellular proteins contain groups such as nh2 cooh oh and conh the last diagram in fig 6 flemming and wingender 2010 thus in the following operation broken sludge would cohere with each other and adsorb organic pollutants in the ao reactor again by dlvo and non dlvo forces to create a suitable microenvironment of microorganisms metabolism sheng et al 2010 to our group s knowledge of multiphase flow in the hydrocyclone integrated effects of key factors such as shear forces centrifugal forces of revolution and autorotation may cause the evolution of sludge structures and release of organic compounds the hydrocyclone was expected to promote the migration of organic matters utilization of idle carbon sources in as and update of sludge interface 3 4 continuous treatment efficiency and sludge reduction 3 4 1 migration and transformation of pollutants along the flow path variations of scod tn tp nh4 n and no3 n in the three units anoxic tank oxic tank and hydrocyclone were analyzed to appraise variations of pollutants and reutilization of released carbon sources and the results are demonstrated in fig 7 in the anoxic tank 51 70 52 13 and 55 18 of scod respectively in the ao aoh25 and aoh35 systems were degraded by bacteria and the scod in the hydrocyclone unit averagely increased by 62 97 and 36 36 in comparison with the oxic tank owing to sludge hydrocyclone breakage the released organics were pumped to the anoxic as a supplement carbon source of denitrifying bacteria so that the average concentration of scod in the anoxic tank rarely got affected fig 7a the scod in the effluent of the three processes approximately met the second level cod 100 mg l in the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant of china gb18918 2002 this may be due to the lower ambient temperature of 13 25 c which lowered microbial degradation activity even so the scod averagely decreased by 9 86 mg l and 12 0 mg l in the effluent of aoh25 and aoh35 systems in comparison to the ao process respectively variations of tp and tn along the flow path are depicted in fig 7b c the tp concentrations averagely increased by 0 30 mg l and 0 29 mg l in the hydrocyclone unit of aoh25 and aoh35 systems respectively however compared with the ao system the tp concentration in the effluent of aoh systems was reduced by 13 42 1 78 similar with the tp the average tn concentrations were reduced by 17 37 and 21 50 in the effluent of aoh25 and aoh35 systems respectively which were both complied with the grade 1b permissible discharge standard of china tn 20mg l the results may demonstrate that the released carbon sources were effectively used to enhance the nitrogen removal and phosphorus accumulating process fig 7d depicts the nh4 n and no3 n removal by the ao and aoh processes nitrification of the three processes was efficient and the nh4 n removal rates could reach up to 97 the stable concentrations were compiled with grade 1a discharge standard of china 5mg l detailed analysis on the nitrate concentrations shows that no3 n transported from the anoxic tank was converted to nitrite and subsequently nitrogen gas by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the oxic tank the no3 n concentrations were reduced by 27 45 32 35 and 32 90 through biological denitrification in the ao aoh25 and aoh35 systems thus there was a slight increase in no3 n removal in the aoh processes compared to that in the conventional ao process indicating inserting hydrocyclone had no adverse effect on denitrification process 3 4 2 continuous denitrification performance in the anoxic tank to investigate the denitrification performance and carbon sources utilization ρ n o 3 n of denitrifying bacteria and no2 n concentrations in the anoxic tank were monitored during the continuous operation of aoh and ao systems as shown in fig 8 a ρ n o 3 n values fluctuated greatly over time due to the variable ambient conditions in the real wwtp compared with the ao process ρ n o 3 n averagely increased by 35 14 and 43 11 in the aoh25 and aoh35 processes respectively this may be because that released organics originated from as in the mlr line provided extra carbon sources for denitrifying bacteria to achieve advanced denitrification as shown in fig 8b the no2 n concentrations in the anoxic tank of ao aoh25 and aoh35 were 0 285mg l 0 446 mg l and 0 517 mg l respectively obviously no2 n concentrations in the aoh systems were higher than that in the ao system the no2 n accumulation in the aoh systems also demonstrated that the released carbon sources were used as supplementary carbon sources when no3 n was converted to no2 n 3 4 3 sludge reduction the cumulative sludge production w n and sludge growth rate y sgr are the most significant factors to evaluate sludge minimization generally with the increasing operation time the w n of the three systems increased linearly fig 9 after a month of monitoring the average sludge production in the ao system was 125 67 g dried weight daily which was 43 32 g more than that in the aoh25 system and 53 56 g more than that in the aoh35 system the y sgr calculated from the regression lines is shown in fig 9 the lowest y sgr of 81 49 g day was observed in aoh25 with a 36 81 reduction compared to the ao process in aoh35 y sgr is 82 64 g day leading to a mean sludge reduction of 35 92 compared to the ao process therefore the advanced aoh process had a lower sludge growth rate than the conventional ao process the sludge reduction of up to 35 92 observed in the aoh process was higher than the reduction of 20 from velho s research likewise using the real wastewater as a feed substrate velho et al 2016 but lower than that from romero pareja s research primarily using synthetic wastewater romero pareja et al 2017 this is because that the real wastewater is different form synthetic wastewater and the real wastewater is rich in inert particulate matter that limits sludge reduction efficiency which was confirmed by coma et al 2013 in short the aoh process can simultaneously achieve in situ sludge reduction and the reuse of idle carbon sources in as for great bnr efficiency with no secondary pollution and easy operability 4 conclusions the long term performance of the aoh process was evaluated by comparing three parallel systems fed with real wastewater including two aoh processes and one conventional ao process the conclusions were as follows 1 the in situ hydrocyclone treatment was effective to break macro flocs into smaller flocs accompanied by the desorption of internal carbon sources the shear forces centrifugal forces of revolution and flocs rotation in the hydrocyclone were proposed to be the important action mechanism 2 compared with the ao process the aoh process presented a decrease of 12 0 mg l in scod in the effluent and the tn was reduced by 21 50 owing to the released carbon sources reuse 3 compared with the ao process denitrification efficiency in the anoxic tank averagely improved by 35 14 and 43 11 in the aoh25 and aoh35 processes due to long term hydrocyclone acclimatization 4 the sludge production was reduced by 36 81 and 35 92 in aoh25 and aoh35 systems in comparison to the ao process respectively by contrast the aoh25 system is better than the aoh35 system acknowledgement this work was supported by the

dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm the effects of time and initial concentration on the removal of e coli by zocz were investigated using plate counting and the kinetics and thermodynamics of the adhesion were studied in an attempt to elucidate the removal mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of zocz the detailed procedures for synthesizing zocz have been reported in a previous paper wang et al 2016 briefly 4a zeolite was first modified by hno3 and then a solution of zn no3 2 which would result in 30 wt loading of zno on the 4a zeolite was mixed with the hno3 treated zeolite and the mixture was dried and annealed at 300 c for 2 h to form zocz 2 2 quantifying e coli adhesion e coli including puc19 egfp plasmids was purchased from hangzhou hong sai biotechnology to serve as a model organism the e coli cells were grown in 200 ml of nutrient broth in 500 ml shaker flasks at 37 c with continuous shaking at 180 rpm for 20 h a cell concentration of 2 1 109 cfu ml 1 was thus achieved twenty milligrams of zocz were mixed with 300 μl of the e coli suspension in one well of a 12 well cell culture plate while another 300 μl of the e coli suspension was injected into a different well as a blank control the culture plate was then examined using a leica dmil led inverted contrast fluorescence microscope to observe to what extent e coli cells adhered to the zocz after 30 min of exposure 2 3 the interaction of e coli and zocz the zeta potentials of the e coli suspension before and after the cells had been mixed with the zocz were measured at different ph values ranging from 3 to 11 using a malvern zetasizer nano zs90 instrument a nicolet nexus 470 ftir spectrophotometer with a multi bounce hatr accessory was used to reveal any bond formation during the adhesion the spectra were received with 32 scans and 4 cm 1 resolution in the region of 1700 to 650 cm 1 2 4 cell apoptosis twenty milligrams of zocz were mixed with 1 ml of the e coli suspension in a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and left to stand for 60 min the suspension was then removed by pipette and the e coli adhering to the zocz particles was twice washed with 0 1 m phosphate buffered saline solution and centrifuged for 1min at 2000 rpm to remove any residual culture medium a field emission scanning electron microscope su8000 hitachi japan with an energy dispersive x ray spectroscope inca energy oxford uk was then used to observe the morphologies of the e coli cells adhering to the zocz as well as the distribution of chemical elements propidium iodide pi solution purchased from multi science was used for rapid accurate and quantitative differentiation between viable and dead e coli twenty milligrams of zocz were mixed with 1 ml of the e coli suspension in a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and left to stand for 60 min ten microliters of the pi solution were then injected into the suspension and incubated for 5 min at 37 c the suspension was then removed by pipette followed by twice washed with 0 1 m phosphate buffered saline solution and centrifuged for 1min at 2000 rpm the precipitate was then re suspended in phosphate buffered saline solution and the suspension was dripped onto a glass coverslip for observation using a confocal laser scanning microscope zeiss lsm 710 2 5 e coli removal from water e coli removal was quantified by plate counting a batch experiment performed under the same conditions in the absence of zocz was used as a control the e coli suspension was diluted to an initial concentration of 2 1 104 cfu ml 1 for the adhesion experiments fifty milligrams of zocz were added to 10 ml of the e coli suspension and shaken by hand to assure proper mixing the suspension was then allowed to stand for 15 30 60 90 or 120 min before 100 μl of the supernatant was extracted by pipette the 100 μl samples were separately plated onto agar and incubated at 37 c for 20 h the resulting plate counts were used to estimate the concentrations of e coli in the tube at each time point these experiments were carried out in triplicate the number of e coli cells adhering was estimated using the difference between the number of colonies in the suspension before and after the adhesion experiments the adhesion capacity of zocz for e coli was calculated as 1 q t c f u i c f u t m here q t represents the adhesion capacity for e coli cells after interval t cfu i and cfu t are the initial number of e coli cells and the residual number at time t m represents the mass of zocz 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization typical inverted contrast fluorescence micrographs of the original e coli suspension and the e coli cells adhering to zocz particles are shown in fig 1 the fluorescence intensity of the original e coli suspension was weak and well distributed fig 1 a fig 1 b shows the surface of the zocz particle fluorescing strongly while there was little weak fluorescence in the surrounding liquid and none in the bulk solution these images confirm that numerous e coli adhered to the surface of the zocz rapidly the zeta potential of the zocz suspension was measured at ph values ranging from 3 to 11 the results have been presented in detail in a previous publication wang et al 2016 to evaluate any possible relationship between the adhesion results and the surface charge of the e coli cells the suspensions zeta potentials before and after the adhesion were measured fig 2 indicates that the surface charge of the e coli remained negative at all ph values from 3 to 11 with no isoelectric point the zeta potentials of the e coli suspensions did become less negative after some of the e coli had adhered to the zocz from about 26 mv to about 17 mv as the ph ranged from 5 to 9 this implies that the surface charges of the e coli cells were partly neutralized by the zocz and that electrostatic repulsion was thereby reduced that presumably increased the frequency and effectiveness of collisions promoting removal of the bacteria yang et al 2016 so electrostatic interactions between zocz and e coli cells underlie the system s observed antibacterial properties brayner et al 2006 atr ftir spectroscopy was used to evaluate the adhesion solid zocz and e coli were prepared by drying the suspensions separately on a znse internal reflection element e coli adhering to zocz was also prepared in solid form by drying a mixed suspension of the two fig 3 shows atr ftir spectra for a solid zocz b solid e coli and c the mixture the infrared spectrum of the solid e coli shows absorption peaks at 1638 cm 1 and 1549 cm 1 corresponding to amide i and amide ii bonds respectively parikh and chorover 2006 the peaks at 1347 cm 1 1029 cm 1 and 812 cm 1 in the solid zocz spectrum can be attributed to hydroxyl group vibrations wu 2012 saghatforoush et al 2012 comparing curves b and c reveals red shifts of 2 and 5 cm 1 in the amide ⅰ band from 1638 to 1636 cm 1 and amide ⅱ band from 1549 to 1544 cm 1 respectively curve c exhibits a complex combination of curves a and b there are no new absorption bands on the spectra which suggests that there are electrostatic interactions between the positive charges on zocz and the negative charges on e coli cells moreover spectrum c shows absorption peak at 830 cm 1 which is a blue shift of the 18 cm 1 of γ oh from 812 to 830 cm 1 from curve a this provides further evidence for the e coli adhering to the surface of the zocz fesem was applied to observe the morphologies of the cells adhering to the zocz to facilitate the comparison of the surface of zocz before and after e coli cells adhesion and check the distribution of zinc oxide on unused zocz the edx analysis of unused zocz is shown in fig s1 and fig s2 fig 4 a shows that many cells adhered to the surface but some were buried in the gaps between zocz particles the cell membranes of most of the e coli cells had collapsed and the cell walls were wrinkled which indicates that their membrane integrity was damaged with a 15 kv field the e coli cells were transparent as fig 4 b shows panels c through h of fig 4 show the element mappings they reveal that zn is evenly distributed and its distribution is basically the same as that of c and p while the distributions of si o and al are rather different the eds spectrum in fig 4 i also implies that many e coli cells adhered to the zocz these results clearly show that zinc ions were released from the zocz and penetrated into e coli cells where they accumulated they also suggest that zinc ions play an important role in the material s antibacterial properties in order to further determine zocz s antibacterial properties and define how e coli cells adhere to the surface of zocz particles e coli cells adhering to zocz were stained with propidium iodide to generate green and red fluorescence signals indicating live and dead e coli cells under the confocal laser scanning microscope fig 5 a and b show the resulting images with live cells in green and dead ones in red the excitation wavelength was 488 nm using an argon laser and the emission wavelength were 507 nm and 617 nm since zocz does not fluoresce and there are three clumps of fluorescence in fig 5 we can conclude that most of the e coli cells have a strong tendency of adhering to the surface of zocz even if a few individual e coli cells remain in the suspension as fluorescent spots in fig 5 the red fluorescence is strong which indicates that the growth of the e coli cells on the surface of the zocz was inhibited significantly fig 5 c overlays fig 5 a and b to show that the locations of the live and dead e coli cells are almost identical that implies multiple layers of cells on the surface of the zocz particles an enlarged view of one of the clumps is shown in the lower panel 3 2 adhesion kinetics the adhesion kinetics were estimated through plate counts with samples taken from the top layer of the supernatant at various intervals fig 6 shows that the adhesion increased rapidly initially then more slowly after 20 min this shows that electrostatic interaction played a key role at least at first pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were tested for describing the adhesion pseudo first order kinetics could be expressed in the form of equation 2 while pseudo second order kinetics could be expressed as in equation 3 2 log surf s u r f t i m e log surf k 1 t 2 303 3 t s u r f t i m e 1 k 2 surf 2 t surf surf and surf time here in cfu g 1 represent the e coli adhesion at equilibrium and at different times respectively the rate constant k1 and k2 were evaluated by fitting the experimental adhesion data to the two equations in fig 7 log surf surf time and t surf time are plotted against time from the slopes and intercepts of the plots the rate constants k1 and k2 and the e coli adhesion capacity at equilibrium surf can be determined they are presented in table 1 the regression correlation coefficients for both the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were high 0 99 but only the surf value calculated using the pseudo second order model matched the experimental adhesion data very well a pseudo second order model is thus best suited for describing the equilibrium adhesion of e coli to zocz which predicts that the adhesion rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of e coli and the number of active sites on zocz was not the only factor affecting adhesion the effects of initial concentration on the equilibrium adhesion were thoroughly explored at 25 1 c fig 8 the diffusion of e coli cells from the suspension to the surface of the zocz was faster at higher e coli concentrations due to the higher concentration gradient the surf value therefore increased from 2 88 106 to 7 256 106 cfu g 1 as the initial e coli concentration bulk initial was increased from 1 5 104 to 4 5 104 cfu ml 1 langmuir and freundlich isotherms were tested for describing the adhesion behavior zhang et al 2010 a langmuir isotherm assumes no interaction among the e coli cells the equation is 4 1 s u r f 1 s u r f max 1 k l s u r f max 1 b u l k where surf max represents the monolayer adhesion capacity cfu g 1 and k l is the langmuir affinity constant for e coli s adhesion to a zocz surface cfu ml 1 surf is the e coli adhesion capacity at equilibrium for different initial e coli concentrations and bulk is the residual concentration of e coli in the suspension at equilibrium the values of surf max and k l were calculated from the intercept and slope of the linear plot of 1 surf versus 1 bulk fig 9 a the parameters obtained from fitting a langmuir model are presented in table 2 the freundlich isotherm assumes adhesion to a heterogeneous surface with the formation of a multilayer the relevant equation is 5 log s u r f log k f n log b u l k k f is the freundlich constant while n is a heterogeneity factor related to the strength of the e coli cells adhesion to the surface of the zocz the values of k f and n were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of log surf versus log bulk fig 9 b the parameters obtained from fitting a freundlich model are also presented in table 2 the r 2 values for the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were 0 9132 and 0 9945 respectively which indicates that the freundlich model is better suited for describing the equilibrium adhesion the adhesion may therefore be assumed to occur at heterogeneous binding sites on the surface of zocz with multilayer coverage hence electrostatic interaction is not the only factor that influences the e coli removal efficiency and the removal process may involve two steps the negative charges on the e coli cells may first be neutralized by cationic species in the zocz that would decrease the stability of the e coli cell suspension promoting the removal 4 conclusions in summary this study investigated the removal of e coli from water by zocz zeta potential analysis revealed that the surface charge on e coli cells is partly neutralized by zocz which not only decreases the stability of an e coli suspension and promotes surface deposition but also enhances zocz s toxicity for e coli atr ftir analysis provides additional evidence for e coli cells adhering to the surface of zocz fesem images show that many of the e coli cells adhering to the zocz surface shrink to some extent implying that zocz exhibits antibacterial properties towards e coli the clsm investigation confirmed that the opposite charges bring e coli to adhere to the zocz surface most of the inner layer cells are dead supporting the conclusions from the fesem images studies of contact time and initial e coli concentration suggest that zocz s maximum adhesion capacity for e coli cells at 25 c is about 4 34 106 cfu g 1 the adhesion is best described by pseudo second order kinetics and freundlich isotherms a multilayer of e coli cells forms on the surface of zocz overall these results indicate that the combination of electrostatic interaction and zinc ions penetrating into e coli cells enhances the destruction and removal of e coli cells from water by zocz acknowledgements

the positive charges on the zocz s surface wang et al 2016 this study was designed to investigate the removal of e coli by zocz exploiting the fact that the exterior surface of bacterial cell walls

were obtained at 16 gna l 1 18 gna l 1 and 20 gna l 1 respectively the anmbr s performance was not affected by short term step wise salinity fluctuations of 2 gna l 1 in the last phase of the experiment it was also demonstrated in batch tests that the cod removal and methane production rate were higher at a k na ratio of 0 05 indicating the importance of potassium to maintain the methanogenic activity the salinity increase adversely affected the transmembrane pressure likely due to a particle size decrease from 185 μm at 14 gna l 1 to 16 μm at 20 gna l 1 microbial community was dominated by bacteria belonging to the clostridium genus and archaea by methanobacterium and methanosaeta genus syntrophic phenol degraders such as pelotomaculum genus were found to be increased when the maximum phenol conversion rate was attained at 20 gna l 1 overall the observed robustness of the anmbr performance indicated an endured microbial community to salinity changes in the range of the sodium concentrations applied graphical abstract image 1 keywords anmbr salinity phenol microbial community sodium wastewater treatment 1 introduction chemical food processing textile and petroleum industries are considered as the primary producers of saline wastewater ng et al 2005 yang et al 2013 about 5 of these industrial effluents have saline or hypersaline characteristics lefebvre et al 2007 praveen et al 2015 the degradation of a large variety of aromatic contaminants such as phenols and polyphenols remains as a challenge for industrial wastewater treatment which often needs to be accomplished at high salinity previous research indicated the potentials of adaptation of halotolerant microorganisms in anaerobic treatment processes to saline conditions lefebvre et al 2007 margesin and schinner 2001 due to an osmotic pressure difference across the cell membrane salt concentrations higher than 1 induce disintegration of cells because of plasmolysis and dehydration wood 2015 as a result a decrease in biodegradation and effluent quality are recognized as the most important consequences abou elela et al 2010 yogalakshmi and joseph 2010 osmo adaptation by producing or adding compatible solutes or accumulation of intracellular potassium could mitigate the loss on biomass activity due to pressure differences across the cell membrane caused by high salinity le borgne et al 2008 vyrides and stuckey 2017 high salinity mainly resulting from sodium salts has an adverse impact on the performance of anaerobic wastewater treatment systems due to an inhibitory effect of sodium and the disintegration of flocs leading to a prominent biomass washout ismail et al 2008 pevere et al 2007 vyrides and stuckey 2009a in anaerobic high rate reactors retaining biomass such as by sludge granulation is essential for an efficient treatment van lier et al 2015 sludge granulation could be hampered at high salt concentrations as granule strength is considerably reduced when sodium replaces the calcium ions ismail et al 2010 jeison et al 2008a in contrast because of the membrane filtration in anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs suspended biomass under highly saline conditions can be retained and enriched this advantage of anmbrs provides an opportunity for microorganisms to adapt to a wide range of sodium concentrations however several harmful effects of high salinity on anaerobic biodegradation of waste streams have been reported by previous studies muñoz sierra et al 2017 song et al 2016 muñoz sierra et al 2017 found 50 inhibition of methanogenic activity at about 23 gna l 1 and complete inhibition at about 34 gna l 1 song et al 2016 showed that a salt concentration above 10 gnacl l 1 reduced biogas production and cod removal in an anmbr furthermore the adaptation of microbial communities to an extended range of salinity enhances the opportunities for anaerobic biological wastewater treatment applications luo et al 2016 demonstrated that acclimation to high salt concentration could lead to the succession of halotolerant or even halophilic microorganisms thereby gradually recovering the bioreactor performance sudmalis et al 2018 indicated that increase in salinity results in a shift in the bacterial and hydrogenotrophic methanogens populations archaea abundance and the genes involved in methanogenesis decrease significantly when salinity increases from low to high levels likewise the gene abundance in the hydrogenotrophic pathway is lower wu et al 2017 correspondingly acetoclastic methanogens show a higher resistance to high salinity than hydrogenotrophic methanogens wang et al 2017a however studies that have reported the performance of anmbrs during long term continuous operation at high salinity are few and limited especially there is none for the degradation of phenolic compounds the studies focused either on the treatment of saline acidified wastewater 6 24 gna l 1 jeison et al 2008b or protein containing saline wastewater 25 gna l 1 hemmelmann et al 2013 on the other hand other studies give attention to municipal wastewater vyrides and stuckey 2009b the removal of specific trace organic contaminants 0 15 gnacl l 1 song et al 2016 and the contribution to membrane fouling when operating an anmbr under saline conditions 35 gnacl l 1 vyrides and stuckey 2011 also the use of forward osmosis anmbrs with transient salinity build up has been explored chen et al 2014 the cod of chemical wastewater dissipates little energy during its breakdown leading to low biomass yield and thus long or even infinite sludge retention times the latter is a striking advantage for anmbrs since there is no sludge wash out giving the chance to enrich salt tolerant biomass or even halophilic species able to degrade a model aromatic compound as phenol previous research on microbial community structure and dynamics under high salinity conditions have focused specifically on digesters de vrieze et al 2017 and uasb reactors gagliano et al 2017 wang et al 2017b but there is no insight into the response of the retained biomass in an anmbr to long term high salinity exposure with phenolic wastewaters therefore further research is required that will advance the understanding to successful application of anmbrs for the treatment of chemical wastewaters under extreme conditions such as high salinity conditions in view of the above this study aims to evaluate the phenol bioconversion performance and microbial community dynamics in long term operation of an anmbr in response to a stepwise increase in sodium concentration six phases of operation were established to investigate whether the changes in sodium concentrations affected the membrane filtration behavior biomass particle size methanogenic activity microbial diversity and phenol degraders abundance the effect of k na concentration ratio on phenol and cod bioconversion at high salinity was assessed in batch tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operation the experiments were carried out using a laboratory scale anmbr reactor with an effective volume of 6

nicl2 6h2o 0 05 edta 1 na2wo4 0 08 muñoz sierra et al 2017 the influent concentration of phenol was gradually increased to 0 5 g l 1 as indicated in fig 2a moreover the sodium concentrations in the reactor were increased from 8 to 20 gna l 1 by long term and short term exposures in six phases in phase i the salinity rise in the anmbr occurred starting at 8 gna l 1 and then to 10 gna l 1 with exposures of about 20 days each long term phases ii iv exposure was carried out for 112 days at 14 gna l 1 24 days at 18 gna l 1 and 133 days at 16 gna l 1 short term salinity exposure cycles phases v and vi of 40 days were carried out at the end of the long term operation first by a step wise increase from 16 to 19 gna l 1 and second by a step wise increase decrease from 18 to 20 gna l 1 the anmbr was operated during 391 days under mesophilic condition 35 0 1 4 c the operational conditions during all phases are shown in table 1 in this study the term high salinity refers to the high concentration of sodium in the water 2 2 k na ratio effect on bioconversion through batch tests biomass samples from the anmbr were taken and two batch tests were conducted at the end of the phase iv and phase vi 500 ml anaerobic bottles at sodium concentrations of 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 were used to assess the k na concentration ratio effect on the bioconversion temperature and mixing were controlled in a shaker at 35 c and 120 rpm respectively the first test at the end of phase iv was carried out maintaining the k na ratio at 0 05 while keeping the above concentrations of sodium in the second test the k concentration was kept constant for all sodium concentrations see table 2 the k na ratios tested were 0 05 0 03 0 025 and 0 002 four consecutive feedings of the substrate acetate and phenol were applied initial cod and phenol concentrations were 3 5 g l 1 and 50 mgph l 1 respectively methane production rate was recorded by an ampts device bioprocess control sweden 2 3 microbial community and statistical analysis biomass samples were taken from the anmbr in all phases to evaluate the microbial community dynamics the dneasy ultraclean microbial kit qiagen hilden germany was used to extract dna from 0 5 g of biomass the quality and quantity of the dna obtained was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and qubit3 0 dna detection qubit dsdna hs assay kit life technologies

respectively and a liquid flow cell dcm 104a 10 10 mm 2 4 2 flow cytometry assay flow cytometry fcm assay was conducted to determine the quality of the biomass samples after sodium concentration changes between phase ii iii and iv and significant volatile suspended solids reduction bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd accuri cytometers belgium was used with a 50 mw laser emitting at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm bd accuri cflow software was used for data processing of cells with intact and compromised membranes biomass samples were diluted to obtain bacterial concentration less than 2 105 cells ml 1 stained live dead and evaluated following the protocol defined by prest et al 2013 2 4 3 specific methanogenic activity sma and biogas content sma tests were performed in triplicate using an automated methane potential test system ampts bioprocess control sweden and were carried out at 35 c the ratio k na was kept constant at 0 05 in the media the initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 20 0 4 c methane content of the biogas was analyzed using a gas chromatograph 7890a gc system agilent technologies us equipped with a flame ionization detector the temperatures of the oven front inlet and front detector were 45 c 200 c and 200 c respectively 2 4 4 other analytical methods hach lange kits were used to measure chemical oxygen demand cod the cod was measured using a vis spectrophotometer dr3900 hach lange germany phenol concentration was measured by merck spectroquant phenol cell kits using a spectrophotometer nova60 merck germany phenol concentrations were double checked using a high pressure liquid chromatography hplc lc 20at shimadzu japan equipped with a 4 6 mm reversed phase c18 column phenomenex the netherlands and a uv detector at a wavelength of 280 nm the solvent used was 25 v v acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0 95 ml min 1 the column oven was set at 30 c sodium concentrations in the reactor were measured by ion chromatography metrohm switzerland dilutions were applied to samples and were prepared in triplicates calibration curves were made using aas standard solution sigma aldrich in the range between 0 1 and 50 ppm the final concentrations were calculated by using the magic net 3 2 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 anmbr process performance phenol cod and sodium concentrations of the influent were controlled and monitored during the operation of the anmbr fig 2 a during phase i cod and phenol removal efficiency varied from 83 8 to 98 6 and 0 77 0 respectively fig 2 b c the performance of the reactor was unstable coinciding with the acclimation of biomass to the operational conditions when sodium concentration was increased from 8 gna l 1 to 14 gna l 1 and organic loading rate was increased from 0 2 gcod l 1 d 1 to 3 1 gcod l 1 d 1 the influent phenol concentration was increased from 10 to 100 mgph l 1 at the end of this phase the maximum conversion rates achieved under the aforementioned conditions were 2 9 mgph l 1 d 1 0 2 mgph gvss 1 d 1 and 3 0 gcod l 1 d 1 0 2 gcod gvss 1 d 1 biogas production rate gradually increased by raising the olr in accordance with the expected methane production fig s1 in phase ii when influent phenol concentration was increased from 100 to 500 mg l 1 a phenol removal efficiency of up to 99 9 was achieved fig 2 c better stability of the anmbr and higher phenol conversion rates than in phase i were observed in phase ii the sodium concentration was kept constant at 14 gna l 1 the phenol conversion rate increased with 88 to 30 8 mgph l 1 d 1 1 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 indicating that the applied constant salt concentration was beneficial for developing a stable microbial conversion process enhancing the phenol uptake similarly wang et al 2017b reported that a constant sodium concentration of 10 gna l 1 resulted in stable biomass activities of the phenolics degraders and methanogens at influent total phenols phenol catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone concentrations in the range of 100 500 mg l 1 moreover poirier et al 2016 inferred that the stability of the anaerobic digestion process is reduced by phenol concentrations above concentrations of 1 gph l 1 and therefore the impact on phenol biodegradation might be attributed mainly to the salinity changes in this case at the beginning of phase iii a one step salinity increase of 4 gna l 1 from 14 to 18 gna l 1 was applied phenol and cod removal efficiencies decreased at the end of this phase with cod values in the permeate of about 1 29 gcod l 1 the volatile suspended solids vss concentration remarkably decreased by 54 table 1 and higher biogas production was observed around day 170 an average phenol conversion rate of 38 4 mgph l 1 d 1 was achieved at 18 gna l 1 however the phenol conversion rate varied between 2 2 mgph gvss 1 d 1 and 4 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 interestingly flow cytometry fcm results indicated a 21 2 increase in the number of cells with compromised membranes when salinity increased from 14 to 18 gna l 1 table 3 fcm results inferred that the quality of the biomass was reduced after this one step increase of 4 gna l 1 the rise in number of cells with compromised membranes could be attributed to the fact that microbial cultures are sensitive and exhibit limited adaptation to changes in ionic strength woolard and irvine 1995 in phase iv the sodium concentration was reduced to 16 gna l 1 to alleviate the negative effect observed in phase iii an additional 5 3 of cells with compromised membranes was observed with this salinity reduction compared to the previous phase reaching a total of 48 5 and 51 5 of cells with compromised and intact membranes respectively table 3 because of the observed increased phenol concentration of about 67 mgph l 1 in the reactor permeate the olr was temporarily reduced to prevent phenol toxicity instability of the reactor was observed for about 85 days and cod permeate concentration increased up to 1 14 gcod l 1 fig 2 b phenol and cod conversion rates of 65 1 mgph l 1 d 1 5 1 mgph gvss 1 d 1 and 5 4 gcod l 1 d 1 0 4 gcod gvss 1 d 1 were observed respectively praveen et al 2015 showed that once a microbial community is acclimated to a certain salt concentration the adaptation can become quickly lost if salinity is changed however the anmbr cod conversion performance was not highly affected by a step wise increase to 19 gna l 1 in phase v neither by the salinity step wise increases and decreases in phase vi olr was increased to 6 2 gcod l 1 d 1 at the beginning of phase v in these periods the average phenol conversion rates were 113 0 mgph l 1 d 1 8 4 mgph gvss 1 d 1 during phase v and 113 3 mgph l 1 d 1 11 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 at vi the phenol and cod effluent concentration fluctuated to some extent by each sodium concentration change between 18 and 20 gna l 1 that is in contrast to what was observed by aslan and şekerdağ 2016 who indicated that the cod removal significantly decreased at about 20 gna l 1 when treating saline wastewater in a uasb reactor our results demonstrated that a short term continuous fluctuation between 18 and 20 gna l 1 eventually has no impact on the bioconversion anymore after a long term operation suggesting a successful gradual adaptation to higher sodium concentrations as carballa et al 2015 inferred a step wise adaptation of the microbial community to stressful environmental conditions results in a strengthened microbiome against upcoming disturbances in our current research the salinity changes resulted in an endured microbial community increasing the process performance robustness in the range of sodium concentrations applied the methane production rate was more prone to variations during these last two phases the specific methanogenic activities sma obtained along the long term operation of the anmbr at the different sodium concentrations see table 4 decreased with 24 when salinity was increased from 14 gna l 1 to 20 gna l 1 nevertheless the sma of 0 55 0 00 gcod ch4 gvss 1 d 1 at 14 gna l 1 and 0 42 0 22 gcod ch4 gvss 1 d 1 at 20 gna l 1 remained relatively high which confirmed the adaptation of the methanogenic population to the salinity levels applied after long term operation of the anmbr earlier studies reported smas of biomass treating phenolic wastewater in a range from 0 15 to 0 66 gcod ch4 gvss 1 d 1 hussain and dubey 2014 wang et al 2017d the obtained sma was higher than in other studies applying sodium concentrations in the range of 0 20 gna l 1 jeison et al 2008a muñoz sierra et al 2017 which might be attributed to the long term acclimation of the biomass 3 2 anmbr membrane filtration performance transmembrane pressure tmp was lower than 150 mbar during the phases i to iii at a flux of 2 0 l m 2 h 1 fig 3 this relatively low tmp is attributed to operation below the critical flux however the tmp was negatively affected by the salt concentration changes in phases iii and iv and increased to 350 mbar in phases v and vi at a flux of 4 0 l m 2 h 1 during these phases the membrane filtration resistance increased from about 6 0 1012 m 1 to 28 0 1012 m 1 the deterioration of membrane filtration performance was attributed to the observed decrease in biomass particle size when salinity was increased see fig 3 b likely the low particle size had a significant influence on the cake layer compaction that increased the operational values of the filtration resistance hemmelmann et al 2013 the median particle size decreased from 185 μm at 14 gna l 1 to 91 μm at 18 gna l 1 in phase iii and to 56 μm at 16 gna l 1 in phase iv the median biomass particle size was 35 μm at 19 gna l 1 and 16 μm at 20 gna l 1 meaning a ten fold decrease following the long term salinity exposure tmp and membrane filtration resistance fluctuated especially during the salinity changes in phases v and vi possibly in addition to the reduction in particle size there were more biomass properties affected by salinity that contributed to a fluctuating membrane filtration resistance for example yang et al 2014 concluded that high sodium concentrations promote a compact gel layer formation similarly yurtsever et al 2016 indicated that salinity induced large molecules to be detected as foulants in gel cake layer may originate from biomass loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances 3 3 k na ratio effect on bioconversion since the intracellular ionic concentration of anaerobic microorganisms needs to be balanced with the environment the k na concentration ratio in the medium was assessed to identify its effect on bioconversion at high salinity biomass was taken from the anmbr at the end of phase iv observed cod and phenol concentrations at 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 under a fixed ratio k na of 0 05 are depicted in fig 4 a b and c about 93 6 cod removal and 99 9 phenol removal was found at 16 gna l 1 the lowest total cod concentration was about 207 mgcod l 1 at the end of the 2nd feed at 20 gna l 1 and 24 gna l 1 about 91 6 and 89 6 cod removal was achieved within all feedings respectively whereas 39 and 25 of phenol removal were observed at 20 gna l 1 the lowest phenol concentration was about 9 mgph l 1 at the end of the 1st feed and the lowest cod concentration was 248 8 mgcod l 1 in the 4th feed at 24 gna l 1 the lowest cod and phenol concentrations were 319 mgcod l 1 and 21 mgph l 1 respectively after the 2nd feed a decrease in phenol degradation was detected for all tests most probably because of phenol accumulation in subsequent feeding meaning a higher initial concentration that possibly leads to inhibition the maximum methane production rates at 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 were 0 16 0 01 0 13 0 03 0 09 0 02 lch4 d 1 respectively inferring the negative impact of increasing sodium on methanogenic activity at the end of phase vi batch tests were carried out at k na ratios of 0 03 0 025 and 0 02 corresponding to 16 20 24 gna l 1 respectively the corresponding results are depicted in fig 4 d e and f at 16 gna l 1 cod and phenol removals were 96 6 and 96 8 respectively phenol was degraded completely at the end of the feed 1 to 3 at 20 and 24 gna l 1 but the degradation lasted longer than in the previous batch at 20 gna l 1 99 phenol removal was observed during the first feed and complete removal in the others at 24 gna l 1 an average of 82 7 cod removal and 94 4 phenol removal were found the lowest cod concentrations obtained were 56 mg l 1 118 mg l 1 and 179 mg l 1 at 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 respectively it is inferred that in bacteria k allows the adaptation to environmental and metabolic changes kuo et al 2005 thereby the improvement of phenol degradation might be attributed to the adaptation of biomass after it has been exposed to higher salinities of up to 20 gna l 1 in phases v and vi methane production rates average values of 0 13 0 01 0 11 0 01 and 0 07 0 02 lch4 d 1 were observed at 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 respectively although the biomass could degrade phenol successfully the cod removal and methane production rates for the 0 03 0 025 and 0 02 k na ratios were found to be lower than for the 0 05 k na ratio the latter seems to agree with the evidence that halophilic archaea use the salt in strategy accumulating high intracellular concentrations of k to balance and stabilize enzymes being apparently more favorable for archaea than for bacteria le borgne et al 2008 this fact highlights the importance of k for the archaea to preserve the methanogenic activity under saline conditions gagliano et al 2017 found that a potassium concentration of 0 7 gk l 1 alleviates the negative effect of 20 gna l 1 in a uasb in both batch tests the cod and phenol removal efficiency were lower at 24 gna l 1 compared to 16 and 20 gna l 1 our current results confirmed the adverse impact of high sodium concentration on biomass activity as demonstrated by muñoz sierra et al 2017 however due to the long term operation of the anmbr at high salinity and adaptation of the microbial community to high sodium concentrations this negative impact could be overcome further research should look at the effects of larger short term random salinity fluctuations on the anmbr phenol bioconversion and biomass properties analogous to treating actual industrial chemical wastewaters where such fluctuations can be expected 3 4 microbial community structure and dynamics based on the sequences from all biomass samples 930 otus were identified of which 835 belonged to the bacteria and 95 to the archaea domain in the start up phase i the reactor performance was unstable fig 2 alpha diversity increased with a median initially of 390 and finally of 485 for the chao1 alpha diversity metric of the samples respectively fig 5 a the metrics observed otus and faith s phylogenetic diversity showed a similar trend fig s2 dominant microorganisms included bacteria belonging to the clostridium genus and the families pseudomonadaceae thermovirgaceae and uncultured ml1228j 1 fig 6 clostridium species and members of the pseudomonadaceae have been found to anaerobically degrade phenol lack and fuchs 1994 zhang and wiegel 1994 bacteria belonging to thermovirgaceae may be related to the degradation of phenolic compounds dipippo et al 2009 the family of uncultured ml1228j 1 is associated with anoxic and saline conditions humayoun et al 2003 archaea present in the start up phase included the dominating hydrogenotrophic methanogens belonging to the methanobacterium genus and acetoclastic methanosaeta genus fig 6 in phase ii the phenol concentration was increased alpha diversity showed further adaptation of the microbial community to phenol with an initial decrease and subsequent increase of the diversity fig 5 a the relative abundance of clostridium species increased to 19 while the relative abundance of members of pseudomonadaceae slightly reduced and mogibacteriaceae became more dominant in phase ii mogibacteriaceae are anaerobic gram positive bacteria that have been found in anaerobic digestion processes and of which the function in the reactor is unclear da silva martins et al 2017 other microorganisms bacteria belonging to the order ba021 were dominating more prominently at the beginning of phase ii but were also present throughout the entire experiment in relative abundances from 21 to 2 the order ba021 is part of the op9 and js1 lineages fig s3 these lineages are also referred to as atribacteria and may be thriving using a syntrophic metabolism nobu et al 2015 archaeal species dominating in this phase belonged to the methanobacterium and methanosaeta genus fig 6 sodium concentration was increased in phase iii and the alpha diversity of the overall microbial community showed an increase from a chao1 median of 421 517 see fig 5 a which may indicate that the microbial community was likely influenced by the increased salinity members of the pseudomonadaceae increased in relative abundance from 1 to 20 while the ml1228j 1 and mogibacteriaceae families decreased to an abundance of 1 fig 6 a definite decrease in alpha diversity was observed in phase iv when the sodium was changed to 16 gna l 1 median of the chao1 metric was 261 fig 5 a in general gram positive bacteria and archaea can better tolerate salinity changes because of the strong cell wall yan et al 2015 salinity is known to enrich for salt tolerant and halophilic bacteria in membrane bioreactors and other anaerobic reactors luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017a decreases in relative abundances were observed for the gram negative pseudomonadaceae where salt tolerant thermovirgaceae and gram positive clostridium species were highly abundant 26 and 31 respectively among the archaea the hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium species became more dominant fig 6 the dominance of methanobacterium and methanosaeta was described in a uasb reactor operated under high salinity and although the methanosaeta species were dominant they do not have a very high salt tolerance onodera et al 2017 possibly the presence of methanosaeta is crucial for granule formation in uasb reactors but in the anmbr these species may be less essential and hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium are also dominant madigou et al 2016 also indicated the importance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at high phenol concentrations during the temporary lowering of the olr the community alpha diversity increased indicating a recovery of the microbial diversity chao1 median of 356 clostridium species highly dominated among bacteria 54 furthermore among archaea the relative abundance of methanosaeta increased from 1 to 10 and of methanobacterium decreased from 20 to 5 fig 6 alpha diversity did not reach similar high values as before phase iv with chao1 index medians of 438 and 386 for phase v and vi respectively however the alpha diversities were similar indicating that the microbial community was more tolerant to fluctuating salinity fig 5 a accordingly the community composition in phase v and vi was very similar with clostridium thermovirgaceae as well as ml1228j 1 as dominating bacteria and methanobacterium and methanosaeta as main archaea fig 6 beta diversity or between sample diversity was determined to illustrate the influence of the salinity on the microbial community diversity in the nmds plot samples from the start up phase i seemed to cluster separately from the phases ii to iv in which phenol or sodium concentration was changed fig 5 b however this could not be confirmed by the pcoa analysis fig 5 c together the beta diversity plots indicated a gradual change in the community diversity although this did not result in differences in the clustering samples from the final phases v and vi in which the reactors were operated with short term salinity changes were not clustering with any of the samples from phases i to iv fig 5 b c the microbial community could have responded in different ways to disturbances in phenol and sodium concentration from the ecological point of view shade et al 2012 although sodium concentration fluctuated in phase v and vi the community diversity remained more similar compared to previous phases given the similar microbial community diversity and profile as well as efficient bioreactor performance in phase v and vi a gradual adaptation to environmental conditions increased the resistance of the microbial community to sodium fluctuations which increased the robustness of the anmbr system 3 4 1 phenol degrading bacteria in the anmbr clostridium has been identified as dominating and was possibly related to phenol degradation in the anmbr clostridium hydroxybenzoicum can transform phenol to 4 hydroxybenzoate zhang and wiegel 1994 and clostridium strain 6 enhanced phenol degradation when growing in coculture letowski et al 2001 in a uasb reactor treating phenolic wastewater at high salinity increased phenolics concentrations increased the relative abundance of clostridia wang et al 2017b additionally anaerobic phenol degradation could occur via syntrophic conversions however the role of syntrophic microorganisms in anaerobic digestion is yet poorly understood and the relationship between the so called microbial dark matter with syntrophy remains unclear narihiro et al 2015 however in an attempt to shed some light on possible syntrophic microorganisms the low abundant taxa relative abundance below 1 were studied and among them syntrophic phenol degraders could be identified these included bacteria related to the genera desulfotomaculum syntrophus desulfovibrio syntrophorhabdus and pelotomaculum among others fig 7 desulfovibrio was identified in a phenol degrading and biogas producing reactor ju and zhang 2014 syntrophorhabdus was found in a phenolic degrading uasb reactor at high salinity wang et al 2017b syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans strain ui was the first isolated syntrophic phenol degrader qiu et al 2008 via benzoate as intermediate nobu et al 2014 pelotomaclum species were shown to syntrophically degrade aromatic compounds qiu et al 2006 desulfotomaculum syntrophus and pelotomaculum were identified in phenol containing wastewater chen et al 2008 moreover syntrophus syntrophorhabdus and pelotomaculum were identified in lab and full scale reactors treating aromatics containing wastewater nobu et al 2017 in this study the syntrophic phenol degraders were observed in the start up phase i decreased during the long term phases ii and iii and increased in phases iv to vi likely indicating the establishment of this functional group of phenol degraders fig 7 pelotomaculum showed an evident increase in relative abundance when the microbial community was adapted to sodium fluctuations and exhibited maximum phenol conversion rates 4 conclusions the conclusions drawn from the present work can be summarized as follows salinity was increased from 8 to 20 gna l 1 during long term operation of the anmbr reactor phenol removal efficiency of 99 9 was achieved at 14 gna l 1 phenol conversion rates increased from 5 1 mgph gvss 1 d 1 at 16 gna l 1 to a maximum conversion rate of 11 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 at 20 gna l 1 adaptation of the microbial community to salinity changes promoted a higher removal efficiency of phenol the specific methanogenic activity decreased by 24 when the na concentration increased from 14 to 20 gna l 1 a one step salinity increase from 14 to 18 gna l 1 compromised 21 2 of the cells membranes reducing the quality and biological stability of the biomass however the anmbr overall conversion performance was not affected by a short term step wise 2 gna l 1 salinity fluctuations inside the reactor the process exhibited robustness and strengthened microbial community to salinity changes in the range of concentrations applied membrane filtration was adversely affected by the salinity increase which was exhibited by an increasing transmembrane pressure to about 350 mbar and concomitantly the membrane filtration resistance increase was attributed to a ten fold reduction on biomass particle size from 185 μm at 14 gna l 1 to 16 μm at 20 gna l 1 batch tests demonstrated that cod removal and methane production rates for the 0 03 0 025 0 02 k na ratios were found to be lower than for the 0 05 k na ratio however phenol removal was lower at 24 gna l 1 compared to 16 and 20 gna l 1 bacteria belonging to the clostridium genus up to 54 relative abundance dominated the bacterial community and archaea were dominated by methanobacterium and methanosaeta genus syntrophic phenol degrading bacteria such as pelotomaculum showed an increased relative abundance after adaptation of the microbial community to salinity

19503,industrial wastewaters are becoming increasingly associated with extreme conditions such as the presence of refractory compounds and high salinity that adversely affect biomass retention or reduce biological activity hence this study evaluated the impact of long term salinity increase to 20 gna l 1 on the bioconversion performance and microbial community composition in anaerobic membrane bioreactors treating phenolic wastewater phenol removal efficiency of up to 99 9 was achieved at 14 gna l 1 phenol conversion rates of 5 1 mgph gvss 1 d 1 4 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 and 11 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 were obtained at 16 gna l 1 18 gna l 1 and 20 gna l 1 respectively the anmbr s performance was not affected by short term step wise salinity fluctuations of 2 gna l 1 in the last phase of the experiment it was also demonstrated in batch tests that the cod removal and methane production rate were higher at a k na ratio of 0 05 indicating the importance of potassium to maintain the methanogenic activity the salinity increase adversely affected the transmembrane pressure likely due to a particle size decrease from 185 μm at 14 gna l 1 to 16 μm at 20 gna l 1 microbial community was dominated by bacteria belonging to the clostridium genus and archaea by methanobacterium and methanosaeta genus syntrophic phenol degraders such as pelotomaculum genus were found to be increased when the maximum phenol conversion rate was attained at 20 gna l 1 overall the observed robustness of the anmbr performance indicated an endured microbial community to salinity changes in the range of the sodium concentrations applied graphical abstract image 1 keywords anmbr salinity phenol microbial community sodium wastewater treatment 1 introduction chemical food processing textile and

often needs to be accomplished at high salinity previous research indicated the potentials of adaptation of halotolerant microorganisms in anaerobic treatment processes to saline conditions lefebvre

by producing or adding compatible solutes or accumulation of intracellular potassium could mitigate the loss on biomass activity due to pressure differences across the cell membrane caused by high salinity le borgne et al 2008 vyrides and stuckey 2017 high salinity mainly resulting from sodium salts has an adverse impact on the performance of anaerobic wastewater treatment systems due to an inhibitory effect of sodium and the disintegration of flocs leading to a prominent biomass washout ismail et al 2008 pevere et al 2007 vyrides and stuckey 2009a in anaerobic high rate reactors retaining biomass such as by sludge granulation is essential for an efficient treatment van lier et al 2015 sludge granulation could be hampered at high salt concentrations as granule strength is considerably reduced when sodium replaces the calcium ions ismail et al 2010 jeison et al 2008a in contrast because of the membrane filtration in anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs suspended biomass under highly saline conditions can be retained and enriched this advantage of anmbrs provides an opportunity for microorganisms to adapt to a wide range of sodium concentrations however several harmful effects of high salinity on anaerobic biodegradation of waste streams have been reported by previous studies muñoz sierra et al 2017 song et al 2016 muñoz sierra et al 2017 found 50 inhibition of methanogenic activity at about 23 gna l 1 and complete inhibition at about 34 gna l 1 song et al 2016 showed that a salt concentration above 10 gnacl l 1 reduced biogas production and cod removal in an anmbr furthermore the adaptation of microbial communities to an extended range of salinity enhances the opportunities for anaerobic biological wastewater treatment applications luo et al 2016 demonstrated that acclimation to high salt concentration could lead to the succession of halotolerant or even halophilic microorganisms thereby gradually recovering the bioreactor performance sudmalis et al 2018 indicated that increase in salinity results in a shift in the bacterial and hydrogenotrophic methanogens populations archaea abundance and the genes involved in methanogenesis decrease significantly when salinity increases from low to high levels likewise the gene abundance in the hydrogenotrophic pathway is lower wu et al 2017 correspondingly acetoclastic methanogens show a higher resistance to high salinity than hydrogenotrophic methanogens wang et al 2017a however studies that have reported the performance of anmbrs during long term continuous operation at high salinity are few and limited especially there is none for the degradation of phenolic compounds the studies focused either on the treatment of saline acidified wastewater 6 24 gna l 1 jeison et al 2008b or protein containing saline wastewater 25 gna l 1 hemmelmann et al 2013 on the other hand other studies give attention to municipal wastewater vyrides and stuckey 2009b the removal of specific trace organic contaminants 0 15 gnacl l 1 song et al 2016 and the contribution to membrane fouling when operating an anmbr under saline conditions 35 gnacl l 1 vyrides and stuckey 2011 also the use of forward osmosis anmbrs with transient salinity build up has been explored chen et al 2014 the cod of chemical wastewater dissipates little energy during its breakdown leading to low biomass yield and thus long or even infinite sludge retention times the latter is a striking advantage for anmbrs since there is no sludge wash out giving the chance to enrich salt tolerant biomass or even halophilic species able to degrade a model aromatic compound as phenol previous research on microbial community structure and dynamics under high salinity conditions have focused specifically on digesters de vrieze et al 2017 and uasb reactors gagliano et al 2017 wang et al 2017b but there is no insight into the response of the retained biomass in an anmbr to long term high salinity exposure with phenolic wastewaters therefore further research is required that will advance the understanding to successful application of anmbrs for the treatment of chemical wastewaters under extreme conditions such as high salinity conditions in view of the above this study aims to evaluate the phenol bioconversion performance and microbial community dynamics in long term operation of an anmbr in response to a stepwise increase in sodium concentration six phases of operation were established to investigate whether the changes in sodium concentrations affected the membrane filtration behavior biomass particle size methanogenic activity microbial diversity and phenol degraders abundance the effect of k na concentration ratio on phenol and cod bioconversion at high salinity was assessed in batch tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operation the experiments were carried out using a laboratory scale anmbr reactor with an effective volume of 6

reactor were increased from 8 to 20 gna l 1 by long term and short term exposures in six phases in phase i the salinity rise in the anmbr occurred starting at 8 gna l 1 and then to 10 gna l 1 with exposures of about 20 days each long term phases ii iv exposure was carried out for 112 days at 14 gna l 1 24 days at 18 gna l 1 and 133 days at 16 gna l 1 short term salinity exposure cycles phases v and vi of 40 days were carried out at the end of the long term operation first by a step wise increase from 16 to 19 gna l 1 and second by a step wise increase decrease from 18 to 20 gna l 1 the anmbr was operated during 391 days under mesophilic condition 35 0 1 4 c the operational conditions during all phases are shown in table 1 in this study the term high salinity refers to the high concentration of sodium in the water 2 2 k na ratio effect on bioconversion through batch tests biomass samples from the anmbr were taken and two batch tests were conducted at the end of the phase iv and phase vi 500 ml anaerobic bottles at sodium concentrations of 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 were used to assess the k na concentration ratio effect on the bioconversion temperature and mixing were controlled in a shaker at 35 c and 120 rpm respectively the first test at the end of phase iv was carried out maintaining the k na ratio at 0 05 while keeping the above concentrations of sodium in the second test the k concentration was kept constant for all sodium concentrations see table 2 the k na ratios tested were 0 05 0 03 0 025 and 0 002 four consecutive feedings of the substrate acetate and phenol were applied initial cod and phenol concentrations were 3 5 g l 1 and 50 mgph l 1 respectively methane production rate was recorded by an ampts device bioprocess control sweden 2 3 microbial

cells ml 1 stained live dead and evaluated following the protocol defined by prest et al 2013 2 4 3 specific methanogenic activity sma and biogas content sma tests were performed in triplicate using

dr3900 hach lange germany phenol concentration was measured by merck spectroquant phenol cell kits using a spectrophotometer nova60 merck germany phenol concentrations were double checked using a high pressure liquid chromatography hplc lc 20at shimadzu japan equipped with a 4 6 mm reversed phase c18 column phenomenex the netherlands and a uv detector at a wavelength of 280 nm the solvent used was 25 v v acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0 95 ml min 1 the column oven was set at 30 c sodium concentrations in the reactor were measured by ion chromatography metrohm switzerland dilutions were applied to samples and were prepared in triplicates calibration curves were made using aas standard solution sigma aldrich in the range between 0 1 and 50 ppm the final concentrations were calculated by using the magic net 3 2 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 anmbr process performance phenol cod and sodium concentrations of the influent were controlled and monitored during the operation of the anmbr fig 2 a during phase i cod and phenol removal efficiency varied from 83 8 to 98 6 and 0 77 0 respectively fig 2 b c the performance of the reactor was unstable coinciding with the acclimation of biomass to the operational conditions when sodium concentration was increased from 8 gna l 1 to 14 gna l 1 and organic loading rate was increased from 0 2 gcod l 1 d 1 to 3 1 gcod l 1 d 1 the influent phenol concentration was increased from 10 to 100 mgph l 1 at the end of this phase the maximum conversion rates achieved under the aforementioned conditions were 2 9 mgph l 1 d 1 0 2 mgph gvss 1 d 1 and 3 0 gcod l 1 d 1 0 2 gcod gvss 1 d 1 biogas production rate gradually increased by raising the olr in accordance with the expected methane production fig s1 in phase ii when influent phenol concentration was increased from 100 to 500 mg l 1 a phenol removal efficiency of up to 99 9 was achieved fig 2 c better stability of the anmbr and higher phenol conversion rates than in phase i were observed in phase ii the sodium concentration was kept constant at 14 gna l 1 the phenol conversion rate increased with 88 to 30 8 mgph l 1 d 1 1 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 indicating that the applied constant salt concentration was beneficial for developing a stable microbial conversion process enhancing the phenol uptake similarly wang et al 2017b reported that a constant sodium concentration of 10 gna l 1 resulted in stable biomass activities of the phenolics degraders and methanogens at influent total phenols phenol catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone concentrations in the range of 100 500 mg l 1 moreover poirier et al 2016 inferred that the stability of the anaerobic digestion process is reduced by phenol concentrations above concentrations of 1 gph l 1 and therefore the impact on phenol biodegradation might be attributed mainly to the salinity changes in this case at the beginning of phase iii a one step salinity increase of 4 gna l 1 from 14 to 18 gna l 1 was applied phenol and cod removal efficiencies decreased at the end of this phase with cod values in the permeate of about 1 29 gcod l 1 the volatile suspended solids vss concentration remarkably decreased by 54 table 1 and higher biogas production was observed around day 170 an average phenol conversion rate of 38 4 mgph l 1 d 1 was achieved at 18 gna l 1 however the phenol conversion rate varied between 2 2 mgph gvss 1 d 1 and 4 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 interestingly flow cytometry fcm results indicated a 21 2 increase in the number of cells with compromised membranes when salinity increased from 14 to 18 gna l 1 table 3 fcm results inferred that the quality of the biomass was reduced after this one step increase of 4 gna l 1 the rise in number of cells with compromised membranes could be attributed to the fact that microbial cultures are sensitive and exhibit limited adaptation to changes in ionic strength woolard and irvine 1995 in phase iv the sodium concentration was reduced to 16 gna l 1 to alleviate the negative effect observed in phase iii an additional 5 3 of cells with compromised membranes was observed with this salinity reduction compared to the previous phase reaching a total of 48 5 and 51 5 of cells with compromised and intact membranes respectively table 3 because of the observed increased phenol concentration of about 67 mgph l 1 in the reactor permeate the olr was temporarily reduced to prevent phenol toxicity instability of the reactor was observed for about 85 days and cod permeate concentration increased up to 1 14 gcod l 1 fig 2 b phenol and cod conversion rates of 65 1 mgph l 1 d 1 5 1 mgph gvss 1 d 1 and 5 4 gcod l 1 d 1 0 4 gcod gvss 1 d 1 were observed respectively praveen et al 2015 showed that once a microbial community is acclimated to a certain salt concentration the adaptation can become quickly lost if salinity is changed however the anmbr cod conversion performance was not highly affected by a step wise increase to 19 gna l 1 in phase v neither by the salinity step wise increases and decreases in phase vi olr was increased to 6 2 gcod l 1 d 1 at the beginning of phase v in these periods the average phenol conversion rates were 113 0 mgph l 1 d 1 8 4 mgph gvss 1 d 1 during phase v and 113 3 mgph l 1 d 1 11 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 at vi the phenol and cod effluent concentration fluctuated to some extent by each sodium concentration change between 18 and 20 gna l 1 that is in contrast to what was observed by aslan and şekerdağ 2016 who indicated that the cod removal significantly decreased at about 20 gna l 1 when treating saline wastewater in a uasb reactor our results demonstrated that a short term continuous fluctuation between 18 and 20 gna l 1 eventually has no impact on the bioconversion anymore after a long term operation suggesting a successful gradual adaptation to higher sodium concentrations as carballa et al 2015 inferred a step wise adaptation of the microbial community to stressful environmental conditions results in a strengthened microbiome against upcoming disturbances in our current research the salinity changes resulted in an endured microbial community increasing the process performance robustness in the range of sodium concentrations applied the methane production rate was more prone to variations during these last two phases the specific methanogenic activities sma obtained along the long term operation of the anmbr at the different sodium concentrations see table 4 decreased with 24 when salinity was increased from 14 gna l 1 to 20 gna l 1 nevertheless the sma of 0 55 0 00 gcod ch4 gvss 1 d 1 at 14 gna l 1 and 0 42 0 22 gcod ch4 gvss 1 d 1 at 20 gna l 1 remained relatively high which confirmed the adaptation of the methanogenic population to the salinity levels applied after long term operation of the anmbr earlier studies reported smas of biomass treating phenolic wastewater in a range from 0 15 to 0 66 gcod ch4 gvss 1 d 1 hussain and dubey 2014 wang et al 2017d the obtained sma was higher than in other studies applying sodium concentrations in the range of 0 20 gna l 1 jeison et al 2008a muñoz sierra et al 2017 which might be attributed to the long term acclimation of the biomass 3 2 anmbr membrane filtration performance transmembrane pressure tmp was lower than 150 mbar during the phases i to iii at a flux of 2 0 l m 2 h 1 fig 3 this relatively low tmp is attributed to operation below the critical flux however the tmp was negatively affected by the salt concentration changes in phases iii and iv and increased to 350 mbar in phases v and vi at a flux of 4 0 l m 2 h 1 during these phases the membrane filtration resistance increased from about 6 0 1012 m 1 to 28 0 1012 m 1 the deterioration of membrane filtration performance was attributed to the observed decrease in biomass particle size when salinity was increased see fig 3 b likely the low particle size had a significant influence on the cake layer compaction that increased the operational values of the filtration resistance hemmelmann et al 2013 the median particle size decreased from 185 μm at 14 gna l 1 to 91 μm at 18 gna l 1 in phase iii and to 56 μm at 16 gna l 1 in phase iv the median biomass particle size was 35 μm at 19 gna l 1 and 16 μm at 20 gna l 1 meaning a ten fold decrease following the long term salinity exposure tmp and membrane filtration resistance fluctuated especially during the salinity changes in phases v and vi possibly in addition to the reduction in particle size there were more biomass properties affected by salinity that contributed to a fluctuating membrane filtration resistance for example yang et al 2014 concluded that high sodium concentrations promote a compact gel layer formation similarly yurtsever et al 2016 indicated that salinity induced large molecules to be detected as foulants in gel cake layer may originate from biomass loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances 3 3 k na ratio effect on bioconversion since the intracellular ionic concentration of anaerobic microorganisms needs to be balanced with the environment the k na concentration ratio in the medium was assessed to identify its effect on bioconversion at high salinity biomass was taken from the anmbr at the end of phase iv observed cod and phenol concentrations at 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 under a fixed ratio k na of 0 05 are depicted in fig 4 a b and c about 93 6 cod removal and 99 9 phenol removal was found at 16 gna l 1 the lowest total cod concentration was about 207 mgcod l 1 at the end of the 2nd feed at 20 gna l 1 and 24 gna l 1 about 91 6 and 89 6 cod removal was achieved within all feedings respectively whereas 39 and 25 of phenol removal were observed at 20 gna l 1 the lowest phenol concentration was about 9 mgph l 1 at the end of the 1st feed and the lowest cod concentration was 248 8 mgcod l 1 in the 4th feed at 24 gna l 1 the lowest cod and phenol concentrations were 319 mgcod l 1 and 21 mgph l 1 respectively after the 2nd feed a decrease in phenol degradation was detected for all tests most probably because of phenol accumulation in subsequent feeding meaning a higher initial concentration that possibly leads to inhibition the maximum methane production rates at 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 were 0 16 0 01 0 13 0 03 0 09 0 02 lch4 d 1 respectively inferring the negative impact of increasing sodium on methanogenic activity at the end of phase vi batch tests were carried out at k na ratios of 0 03 0 025 and 0 02 corresponding to 16 20 24 gna l 1 respectively the corresponding results are depicted in fig 4 d e and f at 16 gna l 1 cod and phenol removals were 96 6 and 96 8 respectively phenol was degraded completely at the end of the feed 1 to 3 at 20 and 24 gna l 1 but the degradation lasted longer than in the previous batch at 20 gna l 1 99 phenol removal was observed during the first feed and complete removal in the others at 24 gna l 1 an average of 82 7 cod removal and 94 4 phenol removal were found the lowest cod concentrations obtained were 56 mg l 1 118 mg l 1 and 179 mg l 1 at 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 respectively it is inferred that in bacteria k allows the adaptation to environmental and metabolic changes kuo et al 2005 thereby the improvement of phenol degradation might be attributed to the adaptation of biomass after it has been exposed to higher salinities of up to 20 gna l 1 in phases v and vi methane production rates average values of 0 13 0 01 0 11 0 01 and 0 07 0 02 lch4 d 1 were observed at 16 20 and 24 gna l 1 respectively although the biomass could degrade phenol successfully the cod removal and methane production rates for the 0 03 0 025 and 0 02 k na ratios were found to be lower than for the 0 05 k na ratio the latter seems to agree with the evidence that halophilic archaea use the salt in strategy accumulating high intracellular concentrations of k to balance and stabilize enzymes being apparently more favorable for archaea than for bacteria le borgne et al 2008 this fact highlights the importance of k for the archaea to preserve the methanogenic activity under saline conditions gagliano et al 2017 found that a potassium concentration of 0 7 gk l 1 alleviates the negative effect of 20 gna l 1 in a uasb in both batch tests the cod and phenol removal efficiency were lower at 24 gna l 1 compared to 16 and 20 gna l 1 our current results confirmed the adverse impact of high sodium concentration on biomass activity as demonstrated by muñoz sierra et al 2017 however due to the long term operation of the anmbr at high salinity and adaptation of the microbial community to high sodium concentrations this negative impact could be overcome further research should look at the effects of larger short term random salinity fluctuations on the anmbr phenol bioconversion and biomass properties analogous to treating actual industrial chemical wastewaters where such fluctuations can be expected 3 4 microbial community structure and dynamics based on the sequences from all biomass samples 930 otus were identified of which 835 belonged to the bacteria and 95 to the archaea domain in the start up phase i the reactor performance was unstable fig 2 alpha diversity increased with a median initially of 390 and finally of 485 for the chao1 alpha diversity metric of the samples respectively fig 5 a the metrics observed otus and faith s phylogenetic diversity showed a similar trend fig s2 dominant microorganisms included bacteria belonging to the clostridium genus and the families pseudomonadaceae thermovirgaceae and uncultured ml1228j 1 fig 6 clostridium species and members of the pseudomonadaceae have been found to anaerobically degrade phenol lack and fuchs 1994 zhang and wiegel 1994 bacteria belonging to thermovirgaceae may be related to the degradation of phenolic compounds dipippo et al 2009 the family of uncultured ml1228j 1 is associated with anoxic and saline conditions humayoun et al 2003 archaea present in the start up phase included the dominating hydrogenotrophic methanogens belonging to the methanobacterium genus and acetoclastic methanosaeta genus fig 6 in phase ii the phenol concentration was increased alpha diversity showed further adaptation of the microbial community to phenol with an initial decrease and subsequent increase of the diversity fig 5 a the relative abundance of clostridium species increased to 19 while the relative abundance of members of pseudomonadaceae slightly reduced and mogibacteriaceae became more dominant in phase ii mogibacteriaceae are anaerobic gram positive bacteria that have been found in anaerobic digestion processes and of which the function in the reactor is unclear da silva martins et al 2017 other microorganisms bacteria belonging to the order ba021 were dominating more prominently at the beginning of phase ii but were also present throughout the entire experiment in relative abundances from 21 to 2 the order ba021 is part of the op9 and js1 lineages fig s3 these lineages are also referred to as atribacteria and may be thriving using a syntrophic metabolism nobu et al 2015 archaeal species dominating in this phase belonged to the methanobacterium and methanosaeta genus fig 6 sodium concentration was increased in phase iii and the alpha diversity of the overall microbial community showed an increase from a chao1 median of 421 517 see fig 5 a which may indicate that the microbial community was likely influenced by the increased salinity members of the pseudomonadaceae increased in relative abundance from 1 to 20 while the ml1228j 1 and mogibacteriaceae families decreased to an abundance of 1 fig 6 a definite decrease in alpha diversity was observed in phase iv when the sodium was changed to 16 gna l 1 median of the chao1 metric was 261 fig 5 a in general gram positive bacteria and archaea can better tolerate salinity changes because of the strong cell wall yan et al 2015 salinity is known to enrich for salt tolerant and halophilic bacteria in membrane bioreactors and other anaerobic reactors luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017a decreases in relative abundances were observed for the gram negative pseudomonadaceae where salt tolerant thermovirgaceae and gram positive clostridium species were highly abundant 26 and 31 respectively among the archaea the hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium species became more dominant fig 6 the dominance of methanobacterium and methanosaeta was described in a uasb reactor operated under high salinity and although the methanosaeta species were dominant they do not have a very high salt tolerance onodera et al 2017 possibly the presence of methanosaeta is crucial for granule formation in uasb reactors but in the anmbr these species may be less essential and hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium are also dominant madigou et al 2016 also indicated the importance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at high phenol concentrations during the temporary lowering of the olr the community alpha diversity increased indicating a recovery of the microbial diversity chao1 median of 356 clostridium species highly dominated among bacteria 54 furthermore among archaea the relative abundance of methanosaeta increased from 1 to 10 and of methanobacterium decreased from 20 to 5 fig 6 alpha diversity did not reach similar high values as before phase iv with chao1 index medians of 438 and 386 for phase v and vi respectively however the alpha diversities were similar indicating that the microbial community was more tolerant to fluctuating salinity fig 5 a accordingly the community composition in phase v and vi was very similar with clostridium thermovirgaceae as well as ml1228j 1 as dominating bacteria and methanobacterium and methanosaeta as main archaea fig 6 beta diversity or between sample diversity was determined to illustrate the influence of the salinity on the microbial community diversity in the nmds plot samples from the start up phase i seemed to cluster separately from the phases ii to iv in which phenol or sodium concentration was changed fig 5 b however this could not be confirmed by the pcoa analysis fig 5 c together the beta diversity plots indicated a gradual change in the community diversity although this did not result in differences in the clustering samples from the final phases v and vi in which the reactors were operated with short term salinity changes were not clustering with any of the samples from phases i to iv fig 5 b c the microbial community could have responded in different ways to disturbances in phenol and sodium concentration from the ecological point of view shade et al 2012 although sodium concentration fluctuated in phase v and vi the community diversity remained more similar compared to previous phases given the similar microbial community diversity and profile as well as efficient bioreactor performance in phase v and vi a gradual adaptation to environmental conditions increased the resistance of the microbial community to sodium fluctuations which increased the robustness of the anmbr system 3 4 1 phenol degrading bacteria in the anmbr clostridium has been identified as dominating and was possibly related to phenol degradation in the anmbr clostridium hydroxybenzoicum can transform phenol to 4 hydroxybenzoate zhang and wiegel 1994 and clostridium strain 6 enhanced phenol degradation when growing in coculture letowski et al 2001 in a uasb reactor treating phenolic wastewater at high salinity increased phenolics concentrations increased the relative abundance of clostridia wang et al 2017b additionally anaerobic phenol degradation could occur via syntrophic conversions however the role of syntrophic microorganisms in anaerobic digestion is yet poorly understood and the relationship between the so called microbial dark matter with syntrophy remains unclear narihiro et al 2015 however in an attempt to shed some light on possible syntrophic microorganisms the low abundant taxa relative abundance below 1 were studied and among them syntrophic phenol degraders could be identified these included bacteria related to the genera desulfotomaculum syntrophus desulfovibrio syntrophorhabdus and pelotomaculum among others fig 7 desulfovibrio was identified in a phenol degrading and biogas producing reactor ju and zhang 2014 syntrophorhabdus was found in a phenolic degrading uasb reactor at high salinity wang et al 2017b syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans strain ui was the first isolated syntrophic phenol degrader qiu et al 2008 via benzoate as intermediate nobu et al 2014 pelotomaclum species were shown to syntrophically degrade aromatic compounds qiu et al 2006 desulfotomaculum syntrophus and pelotomaculum were identified in phenol containing wastewater chen et al 2008 moreover syntrophus syntrophorhabdus and pelotomaculum were identified in lab and full scale reactors treating aromatics containing wastewater nobu et al 2017 in this study the syntrophic phenol degraders were observed in the start up phase i decreased during the long term phases ii and iii and increased in phases iv to vi likely indicating the establishment of this functional group of phenol degraders fig 7 pelotomaculum showed an evident increase in relative abundance when the microbial community was adapted to sodium fluctuations and exhibited maximum phenol conversion rates 4 conclusions the conclusions drawn from the present work can be summarized as follows salinity was increased from 8 to 20 gna l 1 during long term operation of the anmbr reactor phenol removal efficiency of 99 9 was achieved at 14 gna l 1 phenol conversion rates increased from 5 1 mgph gvss 1 d 1 at 16 gna l 1 to a maximum conversion rate of 11 7 mgph gvss 1 d 1 at 20 gna l 1 adaptation of the microbial community to salinity changes promoted a higher removal efficiency of phenol the specific methanogenic activity decreased by 24 when the na concentration increased from 14 to 20 gna l 1 a one step salinity increase from 14 to 18 gna l 1 compromised 21 2 of the cells membranes reducing the quality and biological stability of the biomass however the anmbr overall conversion performance was not affected by a short term step wise 2 gna l 1 salinity fluctuations inside the reactor the process exhibited robustness and strengthened microbial community to salinity changes in the range of concentrations applied membrane filtration was adversely affected by the salinity increase which was exhibited by an increasing transmembrane pressure to about 350 mbar and concomitantly the membrane filtration resistance increase was attributed to a ten fold reduction on biomass particle size from 185 μm at 14 gna l 1 to 16 μm at 20 gna l 1 batch tests demonstrated that cod removal and methane production rates for the 0 03 0 025 0 02 k na ratios were found to be lower than for the 0 05 k na ratio however phenol removal was lower at 24 gna l 1 compared to 16 and 20 gna l 1 bacteria belonging to the clostridium genus up to 54 relative abundance dominated the bacterial community and archaea were dominated by methanobacterium and methanosaeta genus syntrophic phenol degrading bacteria such as pelotomaculum showed an increased relative abundance after adaptation of the microbial community to salinity

19504,california faces significant energy and water infrastructure planning challenges in response to a changing climate immediately following the most severe recorded drought the state experienced one of its wettest water years in recorded history despite the recent severe wet weather much of the state s critical groundwater systems have not recovered from the drought the recent sustainable groundwater management act sgma aims to eliminate future depletion risks but may force california basins to seek alternative water sources by limiting groundwater withdrawals during droughts these alternative water resources such as recycled water or desalination can have significantly higher energy demands in treatment and supply than local groundwater or surface water resources this research developed potential scenarios of water supply sources for five overdrafted groundwater basins and modeled the impacts of these scenarios on energy demands and greenhouse gas ghg emissions for water supply systems our results reveal that energy demands and ghg emissions in different water supply scenarios can vary substantially between basins but could increase statewide energy consumption as much as 2 and ghg emissions by 0 5 these results highlight the need to integrate these energy and ghg impacts into water resource management better understanding these considerations enables water supply planners to avoid potential unintended consequences i e increased energy demands and ghg emissions of enhancing drought resilience graphical abstract image 1 keywords drought water resources

ever recorded in state history in july 2014 noaa 2017 this drought exposed existing vulnerabilities such as surface water shortages that nearly doubled the groundwater withdrawals threatening resource availability for future droughts howitt et al 2014 in response governor jerry brown enacted the first mandatory water conservation requirements executive order b 29 15 2015 and the legislature passed the sustainable groundwater management act sgma creating the first statewide groundwater monitoring and limitations requirements this drought was followed by record high annual precipitation in the state further exposing water infrastructure vulnerabilities ca dwr 2017d flooding occurred throughout california and a spillway failure that evacuated several towns prompted an investigation into state dam resilience lund 2017 serna 2017 despite recent severe precipitation many of california s groundwater systems remain severely depleted miller 2017 california will continue to experience extreme fluctuations in water availability and precipitation climate change is projected to increase the severity duration and frequency of droughts in california and increase the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation diffenbaugh et al 2015 cook et al 2015 walsh et al 2014 california can address water infrastructure vulnerabilities by planning for weather extremes in particular expanding groundwater recharge efforts through natural and engineered systems can improve resilience to drought and extreme precipitation little state recharge infrastructure currently exists however expanding these systems to capture excessive flows during wet periods enables communities to offset surface water shortages during drought kocis and dahlke 2017 choy and mcghee 2014 planning for climate impacts on water resources is inextricably intertwined with energy resources the water energy nexus has been well documented as water is required to produce energy and energy is needed to supply water us doe 2014 kesicki and walton 2016 fluctuations in climate can drastically influence california s energy requirements for water supply groundwater pumping in the state consumes an estimated 6000 gigaw h annually moran et al 2014 droughts increase these energy demands due to overdraft and lowered water tables for areas susceptible to local water shortages procuring alternative water resources such as long range transmission desalination or recycled water can substantially increase energy intensity of water supply cohen et al 2004 stokes and horvath 2009 sgma requires planners to project water usage and resources while accounting for changes in climate population and behavior the intended result is a water balance that allows basins to reach sustainable groundwater levels by 2040 sustainable groundwater management act 2016 basins with overdraft may need to curb their groundwater use which depending on the success of water conservation measures may require expanding or beginning use of local alternative water resources i e desalination recycled water with potentially greater energy demands although sgma planning decisions will determine the energy intensity of water supply energy demands and any associated energy environmental impacts are not a required consideration in sgma recent research in climate change mitigation and adaptation has increased focus on energy demands and the associated ghg emissions of water supply systems tidwell et al 2014 mapped the electricity demands of water supply in western u s states and counties including agricultural irrigation long range conveyance and drinking water and wastewater electricity consumption the authors found that some states used over 30 of total electricity consumption for water and wastewater services a utility level assessment in california s bay area determined the energy intensity of drinking water in each pressure zone i e a utility defined area where water pressure is regulated and found that energy demands can vary significantly within a water utility depending on the topography i e pumping water over steep hills is energy intensive spang and loge 2015 a recent california assessment used 2010 urban water management plans uwmp to create a tool for estimating the energy intensity of water supply in urban areas projecting that energy intensities will rise for areas relying more on alternative water resources in the future stokes draut et al 2017 this finding is similar to a recent case study of saudi arabia s groundwater management planning researchers found that replacing groundwater use with alternative water resources could increase the country s total electricity demand by 40 in 2050 relative to 2010 parkinson et al 2016 mo et al 2014 compared the use of historical resources non potable reclaimed water and desalinated water in san diego ca and tampa bay fl finding that maximizing reclaimed water use offered energy ghg emission and financial advantages over maximizing historical and desalinated water resources multiple studies have analyzed the energy resource benefits of water conservation one study used cost abatement curve methods where products are analyzed to visually communicate both the economic costs and environmental impact mitigation potential to compare the relative costs of energy saved from water efficient products i e watersense labeled fixtures that use less water relative to more common fixtures and energy efficient products i e energy star labeled products the authors found that for an annual analysis water efficient products were more cost effective options for energy savings than energy efficient products but saved less energy overall for over 20 appliances chini et al 2016 another conservation study found that water conservation efforts in arizona could have significant electricity savings with no net cost bartos and chester 2014 a california study also used cost abatement curve methods through the application of existing methods to estimate costs and ghg emission reduction potential in different california regions finding that controlling pressure and water losses in water distribution systems in regions that rely on long range transmission of water are more cost effective ghg emission abatement options than regional investment in energy efficient lighting or fuel efficient vehicles stokes et al 2014 this research assesses the connections between sgma planning and the related energy consumption and ghg emission implications we used state and basin data to develop scenarios for future water supply resource mixes for five overdrafted california basins using these scenarios we projected the associated energy and ghg emission intensity of water supply 2 materials and methods projecting electricity or energy resource mixes is often performed to estimate associated ghg emissions or other environmental impacts u s eia 2017 iea 2016 we applied these same techniques to water supply systems to generate the associated energy demands and ghg emissions for projected estimates of water resource mixes for five california groundwater basins under different scenarios fig 1 outlines our methodology we detail and discuss any data gaps or limitations in section 4 1 2 1 selecting groundwater subbasins and accessing resource data water resource mixes can vary substantially by region within california to show these variations we selected groundwater subbasins in five different state hydrologic regions each of these subbasins have been identified by the california department of water resources dwr as medium niles cone or high priority modesto soquel valley bunker hill kaweah ca dwr 2017c through sgma each of these subbasins is required to develop a groundwater sustainability plan gsp for achieving sustainable groundwater elevations by 2040 dwr elected not to provide specific limitations on groundwater use in sgma regulations as a result gsps and any local groundwater withdrawal limits will be driven by subbasin representatives and based on local climates water resources and stakeholder dynamics ca dwr 2016b table 1 summarizes the subbasins included in this assessment figure a6 in appendix a provides more context for these subbasins including spatial location location and size of major population centers and agricultural land use historically california has not metered or controlled groundwater withdrawals on a statewide level implementation of sgma will eventually characterize water use in basins throughout the state but currently full withdrawal data does not exist for most basins to characterize water resource mixes for our selected subbasins we relied on data from 2015 uwmps dwr requires that drinking water utilities e g municipal water districts that provide over 3000 acre feet af 100 million gallons annually or have over 3000 urban connections generate uwmps every five years providing general information current and projected water supply resources water reliability during drought and per capita consumption goals ca dwr 2017a from the recent 2015 uwmps we used current data and projections for service population water demand per capita consumption conservation and water supply by resource type 10 types detailed in methodology and appendix a in this case we are assuming uwmp consumption data reflect water used and not returned directly as wastewater unlike water withdrawals in general uwmps do not give data for all consumption within a subbasin rather data are provided for individual water utilities we therefore selected subbasins where a small number of urban areas with uwmps make up a large portion of the subbasin area groundwater withdrawal data for basins is not available outside of uwmps and we used this approach to minimize those data gaps some areas with several water districts required to produce uwmps condense these reports into a single uwmp such as bunker hill 2 2 characterizing energy demands of basins energy demands for water supply vary considerably between regions within california primarily driven by the availability of local water supplies regions without substantial local supplies typically have to transport water long distances or utilize alternative water supply sources tidwell et al 2014 stokes and horvath 2009 to model these differences we determined the energy intensity kilowatt hours per acre foot or kwh af for eight different water resource types for each california hydrologic region based on embedded energy of water supply data from the california public utilities commission cpuc cpuc 2017 appendix a provides cpuc energy intensity details for each of these water resource types water resource types from the cpuc included desalinated seawater desalinated brackish groundwater recycled water local deliveries local imported deliveries colorado river aqueduct cra deliveries central valley project cvp and other federal deliveries and state water project swp deliveries we grouped uwmp data for each subbasin into these cpuc resource categories this allowed us to estimate the total energy demands from a particular water utility resource for a given year of supply we estimated groundwater energy demands based the most recent data available for subbasin water levels this data came from dwr s california statewide groundwater elevation monitoring casgem system which provides historical elevations from wells throughout each basin from 2000 to 2017 ca dwr 2017b from this the average depth to groundwater was determined for each subbasin over the last five years due to data inconsistencies and gaps outside of this time period we used these averaged depths to estimate energy requirements for groundwater pumping based on methods from hendrickson and horvath 2014 that determine total head and the associated pumping requirements given pipe type and length pressure velocity and groundwater elevation refer to appendix a for more information we incorporated pump efficiency effects 68 based on dwr data ca dwr 2017e the cpuc provides multiple treatment options for recycled water our analysis assumed potable recycled water used the membrane treatment option and non potable recycled water used tertiary wastewater treatment we based this treatment assumption on the required level of water quality for potable and non potable uses the next section details the allocation of potable and non potable by basin further details for groundwater and other water resource energy modeling can be found in appendix a we also modeled the current and projected ghg emissions associated with water and wastewater energy consumption to achieve this we applied ghg emission factors from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel to the state s average current and projected electricity generation sources based on data from the california energy commission cec nrel 2014 wei et al 2013 because california s renewables portfolio standard rps requires that renewable energy compose 50 of electricity sales in california by 2030 energy supply ghg intensity is projected to decrease substantially within the timeframe considered in this study it should be noted that the national level electricity generation source emission factors may vary from actual emission factors of energy generation sources that contribute to the electricity mix supplied within the subbasins full details for emission factors sources and electricity mix projections can be found in appendix a 2 3 developing projection scenarios for water resource mixes uwmps include the reporting utility projections for overall demand population and water resource use by type out to 2040 this data gave us a foundation for developing different water conservation and alternative water supply scenarios from 2015 to 2040 for water resource mixes and overall demand for the selected basins for this task we focused on scaling up alternative water resources i e recycled water and applying different conservation targets to reflect water supply scenarios that may arise as a result of water conservation efforts and sgma groundwater withdrawal limitations as a baseline we used the utility s projected data as a business as usual bau scenario the data reported in the uwmp suggest that this bau scenario may not be reflective of increased local conservation in response to drought and state policies and therefore the bau values may be higher than actual water consumption rates for example the city of modesto uwmp notes that the actual 2015 per capita consumption was almost 100 gal day 37 less than the utility s 2015 goal established to result in water savings per the water conservation act of 2009 city of modesto 2016 this per capita consumption reflects only urban connections but can have a variety of uses such as residential commercial industrial and agricultural ca dwr 2016a to reflect the potential effects of water conservation policies we developed three conservation scenarios high average and low beyond what is incorporated in the bau scenario in the high conservation scenario we took the average actual per capita consumption from the uwmps and assumed that by 2040 each subbasin could match the current per capita demand in sydney australia 295 l day 78 gal day a city which is a leader in water conservation sydney water 2017 the low conservation scenario uses the per capita consumption trend established in the uwmp 2020 conservation goal projections and extends this out to 2040 the average scenario assumes a per capita consumption of 100 gal day by 2040 two subbasins niles cone soquel valley had uwmps that reported actual per capita consumption that was already less than our theoretical conservation goals for 2040 in those cases we assumed a 20 high 10 medium and 5 low reduction from the actual 2015 per capita consumption please see appendix a for further details on uwmp subbasin per capita water consumption and data sources used for developing scenarios subbasins may choose to scale up alternative water resources to replace groundwater withdrawals capped at the gsp sustainable yield or the maximum amount of water that can be withdrawn from the basin without causing undesirable results to reflect this we developed two scenarios where recycled water consumption increases over time towards a 2040 goal and these increases displace groundwater the first scenario uses state water resource control board swrcb goals for statewide water recycling 2 5 million af by 2030 which represents about 10 of overall state water supply by 2040 ca swrcb 2012 ca dwr 2014a this 10 recycled scenario assumes each subbasin will scale up recycled water to compose 10 of overall demand by 2040 the second scenario assumes recycled water use will scale up much faster where 25 of subbasin water supply will come from recycled resources by 2040 in these basins groundwater would otherwise compose 24 niles cone to 76 soquel valley of the water supply both recycled water scenarios use the total water demand projections from the low conservation scenario but have significantly different water supply projections to determine the share of potable and non potable recycled water use we used the percentage of water dedicated to irrigation i e non potable recycled water equals the percentage of water used for irrigation some uwmps like in soquel valley provided this irrigation share for 2015 when it was unavailable we assumed the proportion of the uwmps current reported water demand to wastewater demand reflected the proportion of potable to non potable recycled water use there are instances in our scenarios where a subbasin s projected water resource mix can meet total demand without any groundwater use in those cases we assume there is no groundwater use and maximize the use of the least energy intensive available resources first for example available local surface water resources would be fully utilized first then state or federal deliveries and then alternative water resources i e desalination or recycled resources if available this hierarchy aligns with cost considerations as traditional sources i e surface waters state and federal deliveries are on average less expensive than alternative water sources including conservation desalination and recycled water cpuc 2016 2 4 modeling drought impacts uwmps also include a utility s projections for water supply sources and demands during drought years which are based on the lowest historical annual runoff or allocation these uwmp projections use historical data of surface water shortages from both single and multi year drought periods to estimate future water sources under drought conditions three of the subbasins we modeled use surface water resources modesto bunker hill and niles cone for these subbasins we combined the demand from the low conservation scenario except in the case of modesto as 2015 uwmp drought year demand projections substantially exceeded recent state and local conservation efforts with the supply projections from each utility s uwmp modesto was the only subbasin that projected greater reductions in demand during drought years than our low conservation scenario we applied the energy and ghg emission factors previously described to obtain estimated energy and ghg emission intensities for these drought projections 2 5 estimating uncertainty to estimate uncertainty we applied values identified by stokes draut et al 2017 stokes draut et al 2017 estimated water supply energy intensity for california s ten hydrologic regions for three time horizons 2010 2020 and 2030 and report low moderate and high energy intensity estimates we calculated the percent difference between the low and moderate energy intensity estimates and between the high and moderate energy intensity estimates we applied these percent differences to our estimates based on each subbasin s hydrologic region and based on the projection year 3 results 3 1 business as usual water supply mix as previously discussed we based the bau scenario on current and projected data from the most recent uwmps within each basin dwr requires uwmp development as a general guidance tool for urban water suppliers giving a broad perspective of water supply to managers and the public ca dwr 2017a urban utilities base supply needs and sources on local characteristics such as groundwater levels and volumes swp allocations water demands historical supply and local surface water availability current and projected water supply resources from uwmps reflect the considerable variation in these characteristics between basins and regions for example niles cone has limited groundwater availability but has access to the swp and local surface water resources whereas soquel valley is currently completely reliant on groundwater as the soquel creek water district has no access to surface water resources in all subbasins analyzed reliance on groundwater is expected to decrease and use of alternative sources is expected to increase by 2040 except in niles cone as shown in fig 2 while dependence on recycled water is expected to increase in kaweah and soquel valley use of imported water from local sources or the swp is projected to increase in bunker hill meanwhile a reliance on local deliveries is expected to increase slightly in modesto niles cone is the only basin that projects groundwater use to increase substantially 3 2 current and future energy demand by water supply system component current water supply energy demands and consequently ghg emissions in the subbasins of focus are largely driven by extraction and conveyance which accounts for the majority 70 of energy demands and ghg emissions in all subbasins but niles cone as seen in figure a3 of appendix a this is primarily because groundwater composes most if not all of these subbasins water mix see table 1 and fig 2 and groundwater extraction and conveyance but not necessarily overall energy intensity is more energy intensive 178 578 kwh af than the energy required for extraction and conveyance of the other uwmp water supply sources in these subbasins in the niles cone subbasin treatment makes up a much larger portion of energy demands and ghg emissions 40 as brackish desalinated water makes up 20 of the water mix and treating this water is highly energy intensive 2715 kwh af refer to figure a3 in appendix a similarly water treatment composes a large portion of kaweah s water supply energy intensity 20 because recycled water composes nearly one quarter of the water mix and recycled water treatment is energy intensive 1321 kwh af the niles cone subbasin has the most energy and ghg intensive 2015 water supply in part due to brackish desalinated water treatment but also because the san francisco bay hydrologic region has the most energy intensive distribution system 318 kwh af the extraction and conveyance of much of the niles cone water supply is also highly energy intensive swp 926 kwh af 22 of water mix groundwater 352 kwh af 33 of water mix and brackish desalination 342 kwh af 20 of water in subbasins where the water supply mix is projected to change only minimally between 2015 and 2040 the energy demands by water supply component are projected to remain relatively constant i e in modesto kaweah and soquel valley however in bunker hill swp water is projected to compose a greater proportion of the water mix resulting in an increase in extraction and conveyance energy demands conversely in niles cone swp and brackish desalinated water are projected to compose a small proportion of the water mix resulting in a decrease in extraction and conveyance energy demands 3 3 water supply energy intensity scenarios present and projected water supply energy intensity is dependent upon water mix water supply energy intensity is highest in basins that rely heavily on and plan to rely heavily on brackish desalination and the swp i e niles cone and bunker hill as seen in fig 3 water supply energy intensity is lowest in modesto which primarily relies on and plans to rely on groundwater and local deliveries see fig 3 subbasins with model scenarios that increase the proportion of energy intensive water supplies in their water mix are expected to see increases in water energy intensity across all scenarios i e bunker hill and soquel valley have considerable increases in the proportion of recycled water in the water mix see fig 3 meanwhile basins with scenarios that decrease the proportion of energy intensive water supplies are projected to see a decrease in water supply energy intensity across all scenarios i e niles cone is projected to decrease the proportion of brackish desalination and groundwater and increase the proportion of local imported deliveries see fig 3 subbasins that expect minimal changes in water mix between 2015 and 2040 are projected to experience mixed changes in water supply energy intensity across scenarios i e modesto and kaweah plan to continue to rely on the same proportions of groundwater and local deliveries typically the conservation scenarios have a lower water supply energy intensity than the bau scenarios as seen in figs 3 and 4 the exceptions are bunker hill and kaweah in bunker hill and kaweah groundwater is relatively less energy intensive than other subbasin sources the bau scenarios in these subbasins continue to project a heavy reliance on groundwater 58 74 in 2040 in uwmps whereas the conservation scenarios project a reduced reliance on groundwater and greater use of more energy intensive resources i e swp recycled water the recycled water scenarios are generally more energy intensive than the bau scenario as recycled water has a relatively high energy intensity as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 however in the niles cone basin the recycled water scenario is less energy intensive than the bau scenario because this water displaces brackish desalinated water which is more energy intensive between 2015 and 2040 the largest percentile changes in water supply energy intensity are mainly seen between 2015 and 2020 this is because uwmp are based on measured data in 2015 and projected data after 2015 and the projections assume that the majority of the changes occur prior to 2020 and that minimal change occurs between 2020 and 2040 modesto showed the most significant variations when we applied in our uncertainty analysis using stokes draut et al 2017 energy intensity ranges modesto s results varied across scenarios from 46 7 the lower bound for uncertainty in the san joaquin river hydrologic region for 2020 and applied to our modesto subbasin 2015 and 2020 estimates to 36 7 the upper bound for uncertainty in the san joaquin river hydrologic region for 2020 and 2030 and applied to our modesto subbasin 2020 through 2040 estimates the magnitude of uncertainty applied to the other four subbasins is smaller with lower bounds ranging from 17 2 to 10 1 for tulare lake hydrologic region in 2030 and for the san francisco hydrologic region in 2020 respectively and upper bounds ranging from 8 6 to 18 2 for the san francisco hydrologic region in 2030 and for the south coast hydrologic region in 2030 respectively a table of uncertainty estimates applied can be found in appendix a table a4 3 4 water supply ghg intensity scenarios for each water supply scenario the relative ranking of subbasin ghg intensities corresponds to the ranking of the subbasin energy intensities as seen in fig 5 between 2015 and 2040 water supply ghg intensity declines under all scenarios in all subbasins but bunker hill as shown in appendix a figure a4 this decrease is largely driven by california s rps renewable energy requirements because of california s rps requirements the change in water supply ghg intensity between 2015 and 2040 is much more negative than the change in water supply energy intensity between 2015 and 2040 in bunker hill the energy demand increases under the most energy intensive scenarios drive ghg intensity increases despite the decarbonization of california s energy supply stokes draut et al 2017 recently provided projected estimates for energy intensities of water supply in california hydrologic regions in 2010 2020 and 2030 the authors used a similar approach for obtaining and applying energy intensities but focused on a much broader network of uwmp data and water supply networks we compared the hydrologic region energy intensity results from stokes draut et al 2017 to our basin scenario results which can be found in full detail in appendix a figure a7 in three of the basins bunker hill kaweah soquel valley the relevant hydrologic region stokes draut et al 2017 energy intensities were significantly higher than any scenario we modeled for niles cone stokes draut et al 2017 energy intensities were significantly lower and in modesto the stokes draut et al 2017 results were similar to the 10 recycling scenario although the water supply e g surface groundwater energy intensities for our study and stokes draut et al came from similar sources these variations could be driven by different data for current and projected water supply portfolios stokes draut et al aggregated a broad network of uwmp data to hydrologic region levels whereas our approach focused on specific subbasin areas 3 5 drought projection assessment results in the appendix figure a5 we provide projections for drought supplies for the three subbasins that rely in part on surface water resources in 2015 and 2040 using uwmp data for supply and our low conservation scenario for demand we found that for the most part utilities projected a reduced reliance on groundwater in future droughts except in the case of niles cone which only saw a small 3 increase in groundwater use during droughts the uwmp projections for surface water availability may be high but increased groundwater recharge during non drought years due to sgma will better prepare these basins for increased groundwater use during drought years it should also be noted that these supply mixes will change based on a drought s length and severity fig 6 shows the results for the energy intensity and ghg emission intensity of the projected drought water supply energy intensities remain consistent in niles cone and modesto while increasing in bunker hill due to the increased share of swp and recycled water ghg emission intensities declined in all subbasins despite little decrease or increase in energy intensities this is due to the overall projected decarbonization of california s electricity mix 4 discussion to maximize the environmental benefits of water planning our results highlight the need for water planners to take an integrated approach and design strategies that not only meet sgma planning objectives but also reduce water supply energy demands and ghg emissions in almost all basins the high conservation scenarios represented the lowest energy and ghg emission intensities water conservation in these basins could come from a portfolio options and sectors including improving water supply efficiency e g pressure management increased pipe replacement stokes et al 2014 reducing residential and commercial consumption e g water efficient fixtures and appliances chini et al 2016 and reducing agricultural consumption e g using less water intensive crops improving irrigation efficiency cooley 2015 basins could target these conservation sources through a variety of policy approaches for example financial incentives water rate structuring or caps on water consumption however when implementing conservation it is important to consider which water supplies will be displaced from the water mix and how the change in water mix impacts energy demands and ghg emissions for instance in bunker hill increased water conservation increases the proportion of energy intensive swp water within the water mix escalating energy and ghg intensities beyond conservation water planners could implement or expand artificial groundwater recharge efforts as discussed in the introduction concentrated recharge during wet seasons and non drought periods can increase the availability of groundwater and avoid the use of more energy intensive resources for many california regions groundwater represents the lowest cost least resource intensive water supply option moran et al 2014 it should be noted that these results reflect impacts per unit of water supplied and will differ from total energy or ghg emissions for a water supply system these results also do not reflect energy use and ghg emissions for water supply per capita which could vary substantially for example the san francisco bay area has the highest distribution energy intensity 318 kwh af of any hydrologic region in this model but this region may have the lowest distribution energy demand per capita for context in 2010 california reported that its state average water supply was 39 groundwater 26 local surface water and 35 long range transmission projects ca dwr 2014b using this study s model we estimated the energy demands of conveyance distribution and treatment of that water supply to be about 18 000 gwh or 6 of california electricity demand in 2016 cec 2018 this energy consumption increases by 5500 gwh a 29 increase in the 25 recycling scenario and by 2000 gwh in the 10 recycling scenario an 11 increase this increase in energy consumption results in 7 5 million metric tons of additional ghg emissions in the 25 recycling scenario 1 7 of total california emissions in 2015 and an additional 6 4 million metric tons in the 10 recycling scenario 1 4 of total emissions carb 2017 these ghg emission estimates assume the additional energy comes from electricity and applies the 2015 electricity emission factor from our model if state policy continues to pursue implementation of alternative water resources state planners should account for increased energy production capacity requirements expanded energy production has implications for water consumption as water is needed in fuel production processing and electricity generation both for renewable and fossil fuel sources meldrum et al 2013 4 1 analysis limitations for basins that will need to expand or use new water resources such as recycled water promoting conservation first can help minimize these unintended consequences of groundwater sustainability efforts because of greater resource demands in treatment alternative water supply sources can often increase total costs of water supply as well and should be carefully assessed before implementation conservation can be achieved through a variety of options including fixtures infrastructure rehabilitation or system wide pressure reduction all of which can save both water and money chini et al 2016 stokes et al 2014 some basins have already achieved significant conservation levels soquel valley s per capita use was less than sydney aus s in 2015 however the uwmp data suggest that most utilities are not aggressively pursuing these levels of conservation this analysis has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting results currently uwmps are the only california water data source that provides both current and projected water use at a local level which is why they served as the basis for this study however uwmps have several data gaps and uncertainties groundwater withdrawals are currently not regulated in most of california and uwmp projections often do not include private well withdrawals which are most often associated with agricultural water use uwmps capture some but not all agricultural water use uwmps are also intended to capture water for energy production as process water however the uwmps used in this study did not report any process water use the subbasins studied may contain power plants that consume water which could impact the water consumption projections used in this study the lack of available data on water supply particularly groundwater and resulting challenges in characterizing the relationship between water and energy has been identified by a host of previous studies ca dwr 2014c chini and stillwell 2016 choy et al 2014 escriva bou et al 2016 sowby and burian 2017 stokes draut et al 2017 sgma implementation will help close these data gaps and reduce uncertainty as these water use sources will be monitored and measured within subbasins some of the inputs and assumptions e g emissions for electricity generation by energy source are based on national level values which may differ from california values electricity mixes also vary within the state depending on which power utility serves a given subbasin the current uwmp drought projections are based on historical data and do not reflect the expected increase in the frequency severity and duration of droughts in california the water supply mixes used in this study are based on annual averages and actual supply sources may change more frequently depending upon cost water availability and other operational decisions this analysis is also limited in its treatment of variation in elevation and resulting impacts on water pumping energy demands depth to groundwater varies spatially and is typically much larger for hills as a consequence the location of groundwater wells impacts groundwater pumping energy demands similarly the elevation of end users e g major population centers impact local water delivery distribution energy demands uncertainty about future changes in conditions is an additional limitation to our modeling should groundwater basins be managed in an unsustainable manner it is likely that groundwater levels will decline and that as a result groundwater pumping energy demands will increase additionally we based water resource projections on the most recent uwmps and it is unclear if these projections include recent research on climate change impacts current uwmps may not include projected increases to drought length severity and frequency which would further restrict surface water consumption diffenbaugh et al 2015 cook et al 2015 water agencies and utilities relying on coastal basins may need to curb groundwater consumption where sea level rise threatens groundwater quality these climate change impacts could significantly alter future water resource mixes 5 conclusions implementing sgma and managing water resources in intensifying drought conditions can have unintended consequences on other resource consumption and ghg emission reduction goals while sgma enhances climate resilience it ignores climate change mitigation as it currently does not require basins to consider water supply energy intensity and related environmental impacts california has aggressive ghg emission reduction objectives and a shift toward more energy intensive water resulting in potentially increasing statewide energy consumption by 2 and ghg emissions by 0 5 based on our 25 recycling scenario energy use and related ghg emissions should be carefully considered by state planners as basins move forward in gsp development and implementation other unintended consequences could include greater economic costs of water supply which are not included in this study but could create significant economic burdens for water users if not considered in planning sgma s current regulations and this research represent an example of how climate change adaptation efforts can impact climate change mitigation goals when planned in isolation of one another the reverse is also true in that mitigation efforts must consider adaptation needs in planning major policy changes like sgma should engage a broad array of experts and stakeholders to consider impacts and vulnerabilities outside of a single resource sector sgma planners should be collaborating closely with energy utilities non water state agencies e g ca air resources board and others to create a holistic approach

19504,california faces significant energy and water infrastructure planning challenges in response to a changing climate immediately following the most severe recorded drought the state experienced one of its wettest water years in recorded history despite the recent severe wet weather much of the state s critical groundwater systems have not recovered from the drought the recent sustainable groundwater management act sgma aims to eliminate future depletion risks but may force california basins to seek alternative water sources by limiting groundwater withdrawals during droughts these alternative water resources such as recycled water or desalination can have significantly higher energy demands in treatment and supply than local groundwater or surface water resources this research developed potential scenarios of water supply sources for five overdrafted groundwater basins and modeled the impacts of these scenarios on energy demands and greenhouse gas ghg emissions for water supply systems our results reveal that energy demands and ghg emissions in different water supply scenarios can vary substantially between basins but could increase statewide energy consumption as much as 2 and ghg emissions by 0 5 these results highlight the need to integrate these energy and ghg impacts into water resource management better understanding these considerations enables water

ever recorded in state history in july 2014 noaa 2017 this drought exposed existing vulnerabilities such as surface water shortages that nearly doubled the groundwater withdrawals threatening resource availability for future droughts howitt et al 2014 in response governor jerry brown enacted the first mandatory water conservation requirements executive order b 29 15 2015 and the legislature passed the sustainable groundwater management act sgma creating the first statewide groundwater monitoring and limitations requirements this drought was followed by record high annual precipitation in the state further exposing water infrastructure vulnerabilities ca dwr 2017d flooding occurred throughout california and a spillway failure that evacuated several towns prompted an investigation into state dam resilience lund 2017 serna 2017 despite recent severe precipitation many of california s groundwater systems remain severely depleted miller 2017 california will continue to experience extreme fluctuations in water availability and precipitation climate change is projected to increase the severity duration and frequency of droughts in california and increase the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation diffenbaugh et al 2015 cook et al 2015 walsh et al 2014 california can address water infrastructure vulnerabilities by planning for weather extremes in particular expanding groundwater recharge efforts through natural and engineered systems can improve resilience to drought and extreme precipitation little state recharge infrastructure currently exists however expanding these systems to capture excessive flows during wet periods enables communities to offset surface water shortages during drought kocis and dahlke 2017 choy and mcghee 2014 planning for climate impacts on water resources is inextricably intertwined with energy resources the water energy nexus has been well documented as water is required to produce energy and energy is needed to supply water us doe 2014 kesicki and walton 2016 fluctuations in climate can drastically influence california s energy requirements for water supply groundwater pumping in the state consumes an estimated 6000 gigaw h annually moran et al 2014 droughts increase these energy demands due to overdraft and lowered water tables for areas susceptible to local water shortages procuring alternative water resources such as long range transmission desalination or recycled water can substantially increase energy intensity of water supply cohen et al 2004 stokes and horvath 2009 sgma requires planners to project water usage and resources while accounting for changes in climate population and behavior the intended result is a water balance that allows basins to reach sustainable groundwater levels by 2040 sustainable groundwater management act 2016 basins with overdraft may need to curb their groundwater use which depending on the success of water conservation measures may require expanding or beginning use of local alternative water resources i e desalination recycled water with potentially greater energy demands although sgma planning decisions will determine the energy intensity of water supply energy demands and any associated energy environmental impacts are not a required consideration in sgma recent research in climate change mitigation and adaptation has increased focus on energy demands and the associated ghg emissions of water supply systems tidwell et al 2014 mapped the electricity demands of water supply in western u s states and counties including agricultural irrigation long range conveyance and drinking water and wastewater electricity consumption the authors found that some states used over 30 of total electricity consumption for water and wastewater services a utility level assessment in california s bay area determined the energy intensity of drinking water in each pressure zone i e a utility defined area where water pressure is regulated and found that energy demands can vary significantly within a water utility depending on the topography i e pumping water over steep hills is energy intensive spang and loge 2015 a recent california assessment used 2010 urban water management plans uwmp to create a tool for estimating the energy intensity of water supply in urban areas projecting that energy intensities will rise for areas relying more on alternative water resources in the future stokes draut et al 2017 this finding is similar to a recent case study of saudi arabia s groundwater management planning researchers found that replacing groundwater use with alternative water resources could increase the country s total electricity demand by 40 in 2050 relative to 2010 parkinson et al 2016 mo et al 2014 compared the use of historical resources non potable reclaimed water and desalinated water in san diego ca and tampa bay fl finding that maximizing reclaimed water use offered energy ghg emission and financial advantages over maximizing historical and desalinated water resources multiple studies have analyzed the energy resource benefits of water conservation one study used cost abatement curve methods where products are analyzed to visually communicate both the economic costs and environmental impact mitigation potential to compare the relative costs of energy saved from water efficient products i e watersense labeled fixtures that use less water relative to more common fixtures and energy efficient products i e energy star labeled products the authors found that for an annual analysis water efficient products were more cost effective options for energy savings than energy efficient products but saved less energy overall for over 20 appliances chini et al 2016 another conservation study found that water conservation efforts in arizona could have significant electricity savings with no net cost bartos and chester 2014 a california study also used cost abatement curve methods through the application of existing methods to estimate costs and ghg emission reduction potential in different california regions finding that controlling pressure and water losses in water distribution systems in regions that rely on long range transmission of water are more cost effective ghg emission abatement options than regional investment in energy efficient lighting or fuel efficient vehicles stokes et al 2014 this research assesses the connections between sgma planning and the related energy consumption and ghg emission implications we used state and basin data to develop scenarios for future water supply resource mixes for five overdrafted california basins using these scenarios we projected the associated energy and ghg emission intensity of water supply 2 materials and methods projecting electricity or energy resource mixes is often performed to estimate associated ghg emissions or other environmental impacts u s eia 2017 iea 2016 we applied these same techniques to water supply systems to generate the associated energy demands and ghg emissions for projected estimates of water resource mixes for five california groundwater basins under different scenarios fig 1 outlines our methodology we detail and discuss any data gaps or limitations in section 4 1 2 1 selecting groundwater subbasins and accessing resource data water resource mixes can vary substantially by region within california to show these variations we selected groundwater subbasins in five different state hydrologic regions each of these subbasins have been identified by the california department of water resources dwr as medium niles cone or high priority modesto soquel valley bunker hill kaweah ca dwr 2017c through sgma each of these subbasins is required to develop a groundwater sustainability plan gsp for achieving sustainable groundwater elevations by 2040 dwr elected not to provide specific limitations on groundwater use in sgma regulations as a result gsps and any local groundwater withdrawal limits will be driven by subbasin representatives and based on local climates water resources and stakeholder dynamics ca dwr 2016b table 1 summarizes the subbasins included in this assessment figure a6 in appendix a provides more context for these subbasins including spatial location location and size of major population centers and agricultural land use historically california has not metered or controlled groundwater withdrawals on a statewide level implementation of sgma will eventually characterize water use in basins throughout the state but currently full withdrawal data does not exist for most basins to characterize water resource mixes for our selected subbasins we relied on data from 2015 uwmps dwr requires that drinking water utilities e g municipal water districts that provide over 3000 acre feet af 100 million gallons annually or have over 3000 urban connections generate uwmps every five years providing general information current and projected water supply resources water reliability during drought and per capita consumption goals ca dwr 2017a from the recent 2015 uwmps we used current data and projections for service population water demand per capita consumption conservation and water supply by resource type 10 types detailed in methodology and appendix a in this case we are assuming uwmp consumption data reflect water used and not returned directly as wastewater unlike water withdrawals in general uwmps do not give data for all consumption within a subbasin rather data are provided for individual water utilities we therefore selected subbasins where a small number of urban areas with uwmps make up a large portion of the subbasin area groundwater withdrawal data for basins is not available outside of uwmps and we used this approach to minimize those data gaps some areas with several water districts required to produce uwmps condense these reports into a single uwmp such as bunker hill 2 2 characterizing energy demands of basins energy demands for water supply vary considerably between regions within california primarily driven by the availability of local water supplies regions without substantial local supplies typically have to transport water long distances or utilize alternative water supply sources tidwell et al 2014 stokes and horvath 2009 to model these differences we determined the energy intensity kilowatt hours per acre foot or kwh af for eight different water resource types for each california hydrologic region based on embedded energy of water supply data from the california public utilities commission cpuc cpuc 2017 appendix a provides cpuc energy intensity details for each of these water resource types water resource types from the cpuc included desalinated seawater desalinated brackish groundwater recycled water local deliveries local imported deliveries colorado river aqueduct cra deliveries central valley project cvp and other federal deliveries and state water project swp deliveries we grouped uwmp data for each subbasin into these cpuc resource categories this allowed us to estimate the total energy demands from a particular water utility resource for a given year of supply we estimated groundwater energy demands based the most recent data available for subbasin water levels this data came from dwr s california statewide groundwater elevation monitoring casgem system which provides historical elevations from wells throughout each basin from 2000 to 2017 ca dwr 2017b from this the average depth to groundwater was determined for each subbasin over the last five years due to data inconsistencies and gaps outside of this time period we used these averaged depths to estimate energy requirements for groundwater pumping based on methods from hendrickson and horvath 2014 that determine total head and the associated pumping requirements given pipe type and length pressure velocity and groundwater elevation refer to appendix a for more information we incorporated pump efficiency effects 68 based on dwr data ca dwr 2017e the cpuc provides multiple treatment options for recycled water our analysis assumed potable recycled water used the membrane treatment option and non potable recycled water used tertiary wastewater treatment we based this treatment assumption on the required level of water quality for potable and non potable uses the next section details the allocation of potable and non potable by basin further details for groundwater and other water resource energy modeling can be found in appendix a we also modeled the current and projected ghg emissions associated with water and wastewater energy consumption to achieve this we applied ghg emission factors from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel to the state s average current and projected electricity generation sources based on data from the california energy commission cec nrel 2014 wei et al 2013 because california s renewables portfolio standard rps requires that renewable energy compose 50 of electricity sales in california by 2030 energy supply ghg intensity is projected to decrease substantially within the timeframe considered in this study it should be noted that the national level electricity generation source emission factors may vary from actual emission factors of energy generation sources that contribute to the electricity mix supplied within the subbasins full details for emission factors sources and electricity mix projections can be found in appendix a 2 3 developing projection scenarios for water resource mixes uwmps include the reporting utility projections for overall demand population and water resource use by type out to 2040 this data gave us a foundation for developing different water conservation and alternative water supply scenarios from 2015 to 2040 for water resource mixes and overall demand for the selected basins for this task we focused on scaling up alternative water resources i e recycled water and applying different conservation targets to reflect water supply scenarios that may arise as a result of water conservation efforts and sgma groundwater withdrawal limitations as a baseline we used the utility s projected data as a business as usual bau scenario the data reported in the uwmp suggest that this bau scenario may not be reflective of increased local conservation in response to drought and state policies and therefore the bau values may be higher than actual water consumption rates for example the city of modesto uwmp notes that the actual 2015 per capita consumption was almost 100 gal day 37 less than the utility s 2015 goal established to result in water savings per the water conservation act of 2009 city of modesto 2016 this per capita consumption reflects only urban connections but can have a variety of uses such as residential commercial industrial and agricultural ca dwr 2016a to reflect the potential effects of water conservation policies we developed three conservation scenarios high average and low beyond what is incorporated in the bau scenario in the high conservation scenario we took the average actual per capita consumption from the uwmps and assumed that by 2040 each subbasin could match the current per capita demand in sydney australia 295 l day 78 gal day a city which is a leader in water conservation sydney water 2017 the low conservation scenario uses the per capita consumption trend established in the uwmp 2020 conservation goal projections and extends this out to 2040 the average scenario assumes a per capita consumption of 100 gal day by 2040 two subbasins niles cone soquel valley had uwmps that reported actual per capita consumption that was already less than our theoretical conservation goals for 2040 in those cases we assumed a 20 high 10 medium and 5 low reduction from the actual 2015 per capita consumption please see appendix a for further details on uwmp subbasin per capita water consumption and data sources used for developing scenarios subbasins may choose to scale up alternative water resources to replace groundwater withdrawals capped at the gsp sustainable yield or the maximum amount of water that can be withdrawn from the basin without causing undesirable results to reflect this we developed two scenarios where recycled water consumption increases over time towards a 2040 goal and these increases displace groundwater the first scenario uses state water resource control board swrcb goals for statewide water recycling 2 5 million af by 2030 which represents about 10 of overall state water supply by 2040 ca swrcb 2012 ca dwr 2014a this 10 recycled scenario assumes each subbasin will scale up recycled water to compose 10 of overall demand by 2040 the second scenario assumes recycled water use will scale up much faster where 25 of subbasin water supply will come from recycled resources by 2040 in these basins groundwater would otherwise compose 24 niles cone to 76 soquel valley of the water supply both recycled water scenarios use the total water demand projections from the low conservation scenario but have significantly different water supply projections to determine the share of potable and non potable recycled water use we used the percentage of water dedicated to irrigation i e non potable recycled water equals the percentage of water used for irrigation some uwmps like in soquel valley provided this irrigation share for 2015 when it was unavailable we assumed the proportion of the uwmps current reported water demand to wastewater demand reflected the proportion of potable to non potable recycled water use there are instances in our scenarios where a subbasin s projected water resource mix can meet total demand without any groundwater use in those cases we assume there is no groundwater use and maximize the use of the least energy intensive available resources first for example available local surface water resources would be fully utilized first then state or federal deliveries and then alternative water resources i e desalination or recycled resources if available this hierarchy aligns with cost considerations as traditional sources i e surface waters state and federal deliveries are on average less expensive than alternative water sources including conservation desalination and recycled water cpuc 2016 2 4 modeling drought impacts uwmps also include a utility s projections for water supply sources and demands during drought years which are based on the lowest historical annual runoff or allocation these uwmp projections use historical data of surface water shortages from both single and multi year drought periods to estimate future water sources under drought conditions three of the subbasins we modeled use surface water resources modesto bunker hill and niles cone for these subbasins we combined the demand from the low conservation scenario except in the case of modesto as 2015 uwmp drought year demand projections substantially exceeded recent state and local conservation efforts with the supply projections from each utility s uwmp modesto was the only subbasin that projected greater reductions in demand during drought years than our low conservation scenario we applied the energy and ghg emission factors previously described to obtain estimated energy and ghg emission intensities for these drought projections 2 5 estimating uncertainty to estimate uncertainty we applied values identified by stokes draut et al 2017 stokes draut et al 2017 estimated water supply energy intensity for california s ten hydrologic regions for three time horizons 2010 2020 and 2030 and report low moderate and high energy intensity estimates we calculated the percent difference between the low and moderate energy intensity estimates and between the high and moderate energy intensity estimates we applied these percent differences to our estimates based on each subbasin s hydrologic region and based on the projection year 3 results 3 1 business as usual water supply mix as previously discussed we based the bau scenario on current and projected data from the most recent uwmps within each basin dwr requires uwmp development as a general guidance tool for urban water suppliers giving a broad perspective of water supply to managers and the public ca dwr 2017a urban utilities base supply needs and sources on local characteristics such as groundwater levels and volumes swp allocations water demands historical supply and local surface water availability current and projected water supply resources from uwmps reflect the considerable variation in these characteristics between basins and regions for example niles cone has limited groundwater availability but has access to the swp and local surface water resources whereas soquel valley is currently completely reliant on groundwater as the soquel creek water district has no access to surface water resources in all subbasins analyzed reliance on groundwater is expected to decrease and use of alternative sources is expected to increase by 2040 except in niles cone as shown in fig 2 while dependence on recycled water is expected to increase in kaweah and soquel valley use of imported water from local sources or the swp is projected to increase in bunker hill meanwhile a reliance on local deliveries is expected to increase slightly in modesto niles cone is the only basin that projects groundwater use to increase substantially 3 2 current and future energy demand by water supply system component current water supply energy demands and consequently ghg emissions in the subbasins of focus are largely driven by extraction and conveyance which accounts for the majority 70 of energy demands and ghg emissions in all subbasins but niles cone as seen in figure a3 of appendix a this is primarily because groundwater composes most if not all of these subbasins water mix see table 1 and fig 2 and groundwater extraction and conveyance but not necessarily overall energy intensity is more energy intensive 178 578 kwh af than the energy required for extraction and conveyance of the other uwmp water supply sources in these subbasins in the niles cone subbasin treatment makes up a much larger portion of energy demands and ghg emissions 40 as brackish desalinated water makes up 20 of the water mix and treating this water is highly energy intensive 2715 kwh af refer to figure a3 in appendix a similarly water treatment composes a large portion of kaweah s water supply energy intensity 20 because recycled water composes nearly one quarter of the water mix and recycled water treatment is energy intensive 1321 kwh af the niles cone subbasin has the most energy and ghg intensive 2015 water supply in part due to brackish desalinated water treatment but also because the san francisco bay hydrologic region has the most energy intensive distribution system 318 kwh af the extraction and conveyance of much of the niles cone water supply is also highly energy intensive swp 926 kwh af 22 of water mix groundwater 352 kwh af 33 of water mix and brackish desalination 342 kwh af 20 of water in subbasins where the water supply mix is projected to change only minimally between 2015 and 2040 the energy demands by water supply component are projected to remain relatively constant i e in modesto kaweah and soquel valley however in bunker hill swp water is projected to compose a greater proportion of the water mix resulting in an increase in extraction and conveyance energy demands conversely in niles cone swp and brackish desalinated water are projected to compose a small proportion of the water mix resulting in a decrease in extraction and conveyance energy demands 3 3 water supply energy intensity scenarios present and projected water supply energy intensity is dependent upon water mix water supply energy intensity is highest in basins that rely heavily on and plan to rely heavily on brackish desalination and the swp i e niles cone and bunker hill as seen in fig 3 water supply energy intensity is lowest in modesto which primarily relies on and plans to rely on groundwater and local deliveries see fig 3 subbasins with model scenarios that increase the proportion of energy intensive water supplies in their water mix are expected to see increases in water energy intensity across all scenarios i e bunker hill and soquel valley have considerable increases in the proportion of recycled water in the water mix see fig 3 meanwhile basins with scenarios that decrease the proportion of energy intensive water supplies are projected to see a decrease in water supply energy intensity across all scenarios i e niles cone is projected to decrease the proportion of brackish desalination and groundwater and increase the proportion of local imported deliveries see fig 3 subbasins that expect minimal changes in water mix between 2015 and 2040 are projected to experience mixed changes in water supply energy intensity across scenarios i e modesto and kaweah plan to continue to rely on the same proportions of groundwater and local deliveries typically the conservation scenarios have a lower water supply energy intensity than the bau scenarios as seen in figs 3 and 4 the exceptions are bunker hill and kaweah in bunker hill and kaweah groundwater is relatively less energy intensive than other subbasin sources the bau scenarios in these subbasins continue to project a heavy reliance on groundwater 58 74 in 2040 in uwmps whereas the conservation scenarios project a reduced reliance on groundwater and greater use of more energy intensive resources i e swp recycled water the recycled water scenarios are generally more energy intensive than the bau scenario as recycled water has a relatively high energy intensity as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 however in the niles cone basin the recycled water scenario is less energy intensive than the bau scenario because this water displaces brackish desalinated water which is more energy intensive between 2015 and 2040 the largest percentile changes in water supply energy intensity are mainly seen between 2015 and 2020 this is because uwmp are based on measured data in 2015 and projected data after 2015 and the projections assume that the majority of the changes occur prior to 2020 and that minimal change occurs between 2020 and 2040 modesto showed the most significant variations when we applied in our uncertainty analysis using stokes draut et al 2017 energy intensity ranges modesto s results varied across scenarios from 46 7 the lower bound for uncertainty in the san joaquin river hydrologic region for 2020 and applied to our modesto subbasin 2015 and 2020 estimates to 36 7 the upper bound for uncertainty in the san joaquin river hydrologic region for 2020 and 2030 and applied to our modesto subbasin 2020 through 2040 estimates the magnitude of uncertainty applied to the other four subbasins is smaller with lower bounds ranging from 17 2 to 10 1 for tulare lake hydrologic region in 2030 and for the san francisco hydrologic region in 2020 respectively and upper bounds ranging from 8 6 to 18 2 for the san francisco hydrologic region in 2030 and for the south coast hydrologic region in 2030 respectively a table of uncertainty estimates applied can be found in appendix a table a4 3 4 water supply ghg intensity scenarios for each water supply scenario the relative ranking of subbasin ghg intensities corresponds to the ranking of the subbasin energy intensities as seen in fig 5 between 2015 and 2040 water supply ghg intensity declines under all scenarios in all subbasins but bunker hill as shown in appendix a figure a4 this decrease is largely driven by california s rps renewable energy requirements because of california s rps requirements the change in water supply ghg intensity between 2015 and 2040 is much more negative than the change in water supply energy intensity between 2015 and 2040 in bunker hill the energy demand increases under the most energy intensive scenarios drive ghg intensity increases despite the decarbonization of california s energy supply stokes draut et al 2017 recently provided projected estimates for energy intensities of water supply in california hydrologic regions in 2010 2020 and 2030 the authors used a similar approach for obtaining and applying energy intensities but focused on a much broader network of uwmp data and water supply networks we compared the hydrologic region energy intensity results from stokes draut et al 2017 to our basin scenario results which can be found in full detail in appendix a figure a7 in three of the basins bunker hill kaweah soquel valley the relevant hydrologic region stokes draut et al 2017 energy intensities were significantly higher than any scenario we modeled for niles cone stokes draut et al 2017 energy intensities were significantly lower and in modesto the stokes draut et al 2017 results were similar to the 10 recycling scenario although the water supply e g surface groundwater energy intensities for our study and stokes draut et al came from similar sources these variations could be driven by different data for current and projected water supply portfolios stokes draut et al aggregated a broad network of uwmp data to hydrologic region levels whereas our approach focused on specific subbasin areas 3 5 drought projection assessment results in the appendix figure a5 we provide projections for drought supplies for the three subbasins that rely in part on surface water resources in 2015 and 2040 using uwmp data for supply and our low conservation scenario for demand we found that for the most part utilities projected a reduced reliance on groundwater in future droughts except in the case of niles cone which only saw a small 3 increase in groundwater use during droughts the uwmp projections for surface water availability may be high but increased groundwater recharge during non drought years due to sgma will better prepare these basins for increased groundwater use during drought years it should also be noted that these supply mixes will change based on a drought s length and severity fig 6 shows the results for the energy intensity and ghg emission intensity of the projected drought water supply energy intensities remain consistent in niles cone and modesto while increasing in bunker hill due to the increased share of swp and recycled water ghg emission intensities declined in all subbasins despite little decrease or increase in energy intensities this is due to the overall projected decarbonization of california s electricity mix 4 discussion to maximize the environmental benefits of water planning our results highlight the need for water planners to take an integrated approach and design strategies that not only meet sgma planning objectives but also reduce water supply energy demands and ghg emissions in almost all basins the high conservation scenarios represented the lowest energy and ghg emission intensities water conservation in these basins could come from a portfolio options and sectors including improving water supply efficiency e g pressure management increased pipe replacement stokes et al 2014 reducing residential and commercial consumption e g water efficient fixtures and appliances chini et al 2016 and reducing agricultural consumption e g using less water intensive crops improving irrigation efficiency cooley 2015 basins could target these conservation sources through a variety of policy approaches for example financial incentives water rate structuring or caps on water consumption however when implementing conservation it is important to consider which water supplies will be displaced from the water mix and how the change in water mix impacts energy demands and ghg emissions for instance in bunker hill increased water conservation increases the proportion of energy intensive swp water within the water mix escalating energy and ghg intensities beyond conservation water planners could implement or expand artificial groundwater recharge efforts as discussed in the introduction concentrated recharge during wet seasons and non drought periods can increase the availability of groundwater and avoid the use of more energy intensive resources for many california regions groundwater represents the lowest cost least resource intensive water supply option moran et al 2014 it should be noted that these results reflect impacts per unit of water supplied and will differ from total energy or ghg emissions for a water supply system these results also do not reflect energy use and ghg emissions for water supply per capita which could vary substantially for example the san francisco bay area has the highest distribution energy intensity 318 kwh af of any hydrologic region in this model but this region may have the lowest distribution energy demand per capita for context in 2010 california reported that its state average water supply was 39 groundwater 26 local surface water and 35 long range transmission projects ca dwr 2014b using this study s model we estimated the energy demands of conveyance distribution and treatment of that water supply to be about 18 000 gwh or 6 of california electricity demand in 2016 cec 2018 this energy consumption increases by 5500 gwh a 29 increase in the 25 recycling scenario and by 2000 gwh in the 10 recycling scenario an 11 increase this increase in energy consumption results in 7 5 million metric tons of additional ghg emissions in the 25 recycling scenario 1 7 of total california emissions in 2015 and an additional 6 4 million metric tons in the 10 recycling scenario 1 4 of total emissions carb 2017 these ghg emission estimates assume the additional energy comes from electricity and applies the 2015 electricity emission factor from our model if state policy continues to pursue implementation of alternative water resources state planners should account for increased energy production capacity requirements expanded energy production has implications for water consumption as water is needed in fuel production processing and electricity generation both for renewable and fossil fuel sources meldrum et al 2013 4 1 analysis limitations for basins that will need to expand or use new water resources such as recycled water promoting conservation first can help minimize these unintended consequences of groundwater sustainability efforts because of greater resource demands in treatment alternative water supply sources can often increase total costs of water supply as well and should be carefully assessed before implementation conservation can be achieved through a variety of options including fixtures infrastructure rehabilitation or system wide pressure reduction all of which can save both water and money chini et al 2016 stokes et al 2014 some basins have already achieved significant conservation levels soquel valley s per capita use was less than sydney aus s in 2015 however the uwmp data suggest that most utilities are not aggressively pursuing these levels of conservation this analysis has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting results currently uwmps are the only california water data source that provides both current and projected water use at a local level which is why they served as the basis for this study however uwmps have several data gaps and uncertainties groundwater withdrawals are currently not regulated in most of california and uwmp projections often do not include private well withdrawals which are most often associated with agricultural water use uwmps capture some but not all agricultural water use uwmps are also intended to capture water for energy production as process water however the uwmps used in this study did not report any process water use the subbasins studied may contain power plants that consume water which could impact the water consumption projections used in this study the lack of available data on water supply particularly groundwater and resulting challenges in characterizing the relationship between water and energy has been identified by a host of previous studies ca dwr 2014c chini and stillwell 2016 choy et al 2014 escriva bou et al 2016 sowby and burian 2017 stokes draut et al 2017 sgma implementation will help close these data gaps and reduce uncertainty as these water use sources will be monitored and measured within subbasins some of the inputs and assumptions e g emissions for electricity generation by energy source are based on national level values which may differ from california values electricity mixes also vary within the state depending on which power utility serves a given subbasin the current uwmp drought projections are based on historical data and do not reflect the expected increase in the frequency severity and duration of droughts in california the water supply mixes used in this study are based on annual averages and actual supply sources may change more frequently depending upon cost water availability and other operational decisions this analysis is also limited in its treatment of variation in elevation and resulting impacts on water pumping energy demands depth to groundwater varies spatially and is typically much larger for hills as a consequence the location of groundwater wells impacts groundwater pumping energy demands similarly the elevation of end users e g major population centers impact local water delivery distribution energy demands uncertainty about future changes in conditions is an additional limitation to our modeling should groundwater basins be managed in an unsustainable manner it is likely that groundwater levels will decline and that as a result groundwater pumping energy demands will increase additionally we based water resource projections on the most recent uwmps and it is unclear if these projections include recent research on climate change impacts current uwmps may not include projected increases to drought length severity and frequency which would further restrict surface water consumption diffenbaugh et al 2015 cook et al 2015 water agencies and utilities relying on coastal basins may need to curb groundwater consumption where sea level rise threatens groundwater quality these climate change impacts could significantly alter future water resource mixes 5 conclusions implementing sgma and managing water resources in intensifying drought conditions can have unintended consequences on other resource consumption and ghg emission reduction goals while sgma enhances climate resilience it ignores climate change mitigation as it currently does not require basins to consider water supply energy intensity and related environmental impacts california has aggressive ghg emission reduction objectives and a shift toward more energy intensive water resulting in potentially increasing statewide energy consumption by 2 and ghg emissions by 0 5 based on our 25 recycling scenario energy use and related ghg emissions should be carefully considered by state planners as basins move forward in gsp development and implementation other unintended consequences could include greater economic costs of water supply which are not included in this study but could create significant economic burdens for water users if not considered in planning sgma s current regulations and this research represent an example of how climate change adaptation efforts can impact climate change mitigation goals when planned in isolation of one another the reverse is also true in that mitigation efforts must consider adaptation needs in planning major policy changes like sgma should engage a broad array of experts and stakeholders to consider impacts and vulnerabilities outside of a single resource sector sgma planners should be collaborating closely with energy utilities non water state agencies e g ca air resources board and others to create a holistic approach
