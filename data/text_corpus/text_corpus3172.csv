15860,salinity is an important water quality parameter that affects ecosystem health and the use of freshwaters for industrial agricultural and other beneficial purposes although a number of studies have investigated the variability and trends of salinity in rivers and streams the effects of floods on salinity across a wide range of watersheds have not been determined here we examine this question by utilizing long term observational records of daily streamflow and specific conductance sc a proxy for salinity in addition to catchment characteristics for 259 united states geological survey usgs monitoring sites in the contiguous united states spanning a wide range of climatic geologic and hydrologic conditions we used a combination of statistical methods random forest machine learning models and information theoretic causal inference algorithms to determine the response of sc to floods and the factors that impact salinity changes within sites intra site variability and across sites inter site variability our results show that changes to sc during flood events exhibited substantial variability ranging from a 100 decrease to 34 increase relative to the long term mean we found that dilution is the prevailing mechanism that decreases sc levels during floods for most sites but other mechanisms caused an increase of sc for 6 1 n 5521 of flood events our analysis revealed that antecedent conditions of sc in the few days preceding the flood are the most important factor in explaining intra site variability the response of salinity to floods also varied considerably across sites with different characteristics with a notable effect of urbanization in temperate climates resulting in increased dilution of sc and mining in arid climates which adversely increases sc levels overall we find that the combined effect of aridity and anthropogenic factors is of primary importance in determining how salinity responds to floods and it bears strongly on water quality conditions in a future world one in which floods are expected to increase in frequency and intensity concurrent with shifting aridity patterns and increasing urbanization graphical abstract

regions around the world e g kaushal et al 2018 bird et al 2018 estévez et al 2019 these trends were primarily attributed to anthropogenic factors such as extensive mining usage of deicing road salts application of fertilizers and human accelerated weathering of materials both natural and artificial e g concrete an important issue that has received little attention to date is the effect of extreme events and in particular floods on river salinity this subject is of particular importance for anticipating climate change impacts on river water quality because of the increased probability of more frequent and intense floods and droughts as well as rapid shifts between the two in a warmer climate swain et al 2018 robust signals of flood regime changes have already been detected in observational records for instance a number of studies reported a shift in the timing of flood peaks in many rivers around the world e g blöschl et al 2017 wilson et al 2010 arheimer and lindström 2015 stewart et al 2005 additionally socio economic development is projected to be a significant driver of alterations in flood characteristics in the future winsemius et al 2016 such changes in flood regimes may result in severe consequences for water availability both in terms of quantity and quality previous studies of flooding impacts on salinity individual ion concentrations or suspended solids have primarily focused on investigating the nonlinear variability of solute concentrations during the flood hydrograph also known as hysteresis e g house and warwick 1998 hamshaw et al 2018 it has been shown that at hourly time scales concentrations of most solutes are higher during the rising limb of the hydrograph compared to the falling limb i e clock wise hysteresis house and warwick 1998 this has been attributed mainly to the flushing effect of floods whereby solutes deposited in the catchment and streambed prior to floods are mobilized and flushed during the rising limb of the hydrograph a phenomenon also known as first flush in the stormwater community additionally earlier results from a few catchments in southwestern england showed that the variability of chemical concentrations during floods is complex with concentrations either increasing decreasing or a mixture of both walling and foster 1975 furthermore several studies reported a time lag effect whereby the flood hydrograph precedes variations in chemical concentrations chemograph by several hours glover and johnson 1974 walling and foster 1975 the aforementioned studies provided important insights on the effects of floods on solute concentrations at sub daily time scales and often relied on short records of high frequency observations e g hourly 2 hrs from a limited number of sites however the impact of floods on salinity and potential influences of climatic geologic topographic and anthropogenic factors across large spatial domains remain unexplored the focus of this present paper is to examine the impact of floods on salinity measured as specific conductance sc across 259 sites in the contiguous united states conus using long term observations with a sample size of at least 3650 records i e 10 years of daily data at each site here we hypothesize that antecedent salinity levels memory combined with the interaction of climatic geologic hydrologic and anthropogenic factors such as mining agriculture and urbanization leads to variability in the response of salinity to floods we test this hypothesis by quantifying the variations in salinity during floods and examining their relationships to natural and anthropogenic properties of drainage basins more specifically our research objectives include 1 quantifying the spatial and temporal variability in sc during high flow conditions 2 identifying catchment characteristics that demonstrate a strong relationship with the response of specific conductance to floods and 3 exploring factors that mediate the variability of specific conductance within individual sites during flood events 2 materials and methods 2 1 site selection for the present study we selected usgs stations with readily available and sufficient information on their associated catchment properties therefore we used the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii dataset falcone et al 2010 as a reference for our site selection gages ii dataset provides 355 metadata features e g climatic geologic land use soil hydrologic properties for 9 322 usgs sites of these 9 322 sites we selected sites that had at least 10 years of daily measurements n 3650 of concurrent streamflow q and specific conductance sc in the usgs national water information system nwis this resulted in a set of 259 sites across the contiguous united states fig 1 a across all sites sc was measured in field from an unfiltered water subsample and adjusted to a standard temperature of 25 c detailed information on equipment calibration and measurement methods of sc are summarized in u s geological survey 2019 streamflow was measured using either one of two methods velocity area method or midsection method further details on equipment measurement practices and quality assurance of q measurements is summarized in turnipseed and sauer 2010 all sc and q measurements used in this study are designated with data quality code a which indicates that the data has been approved for publication and the review is completed fig 1a shows the location of the 259 sites used in our analysis which are distributed within 36 us states long term average sc values range from 20 to 17 600 μ s c m whereas average streamflow ranges from 0 03 to 916 m 3 s at a few stations measurements were recorded starting from 1940 fig 1b however most of the data was recorded after 1990 75 of total and after 2003 50 of total for all sites in our case study we used 123 catchment characteristics table s1 from the original 355 metadata features provided by gages ii dataset these characteristics represent 7 broad categories climatic hydrologic hydrologic modification e g dams topographic land use land cover nutrient and pesticide application and soil properties the remaining catchment characteristics excluded from analysis were either categorical values or monthly climatic statistics e g monthly average temperature the 259 sites used in this study span a wide range of climate elevation size of drainage basin extent of urbanization and soil properties table 1 and table s1 2 2 pre processing time series of sc and q daily sc measurements obtained from usgs nwis were reported either as mean median maximum minimum at noon or instantaneous values in units of μ s c m we opted to make use of all these measurements whenever needed in order to increase the sample size in our analysis we used a hierarchical data imputation scheme to estimate daily sc measurements more specifically sc is estimated using the following order mean median a linearly interpolated value between min and max at noon and instantaneous measurement for instance at any given station and day daily sc is estimated as an interpolated value between min and max only if the mean and median values were not reported if in addition to mean and median the values of max and min were not reported daily sc is taken to be equal to at noon sc measurement since deviations of sc and q are defined relative to the long term time averaged mean it is a prerequisite that any long term trends in sc or q are accounted for and removed to ensure consistency and uniform sampling throughout the record details of detrending timeseries are reported in text s1 2 3 identification of floods high flow events we define floods as daily streamflow q values higher than the 95th percentile more specifically the set of daily streamflow values considered as floods at any given site hereafter referred to as q f is defined as follows 1 q f q q q 95 where q 95 is the 95th percentile of all daily streamflow values at a given station 2 4 a normalized measure of specific conductance nsc sc varies significantly across the 259 sites used in this study see fig 1a and table 1 therefore we use a normalized measure of sc to facilitate analysis and comparison across all sites the normalized measure denoted as nsc is defined as follows 2 n s c s c t s c s c where s c t is the value of specific conductance at day t and s c is the long term average value of specific conductance at a given station more specifically s c is computed for each site as the mean of all daily de trended sc values during the period of record theoretically n s c has a lower bound of 1 when s c t 0 i e no salts in water whereas the upper bound is infinite an nsc value of 0 4 indicates that specific conductance is 40 percent higher than the long term mean 2 5 dryness index as a measure of aridity the water balance in hydrologic basins can be represented as follows 3 δ s p e t r δ g where p e t r δ g and δ s denote precipitation evapotranspiration runoff groundwater input and changes in water storage respectively at long climatological time scales fluctuations in δ s and δ g balance out leading to eq 4 4 p e t r the upper limit of e t is controlled by potential evapotranspiration pet therefore the ratio of pet to p defined as the dryness index di expresses the deficit availability of water in hydrologic basins as shown in the following equation budyko 1961 5 d i p e t p fig 2 a shows the relationship between di and the ratio of et p for all 259 sites as well as the budyko curve gray line which expresses the theoretical relationship between the two the ratio of et p was calculated from eq 4 as 1 runoff ratio where runoff ratio is equal to r p we classify all sites in our study into three climate zones based on the value of di as follows wet di 0 7 temperate 0 7 di 1 2 and arid di 1 2 the number of sites in these three zones is 133 80 and 46 respectively fig 2b shows the values of runoff ratio at each climate zone whereas figure s1 in the supplementary information shows a map of all sites according to their climate zone 2 6 random forest models in the present study we used random forest rf models to predict sc levels during days of floods and their feature importance to determine the dominant variables affecting the response of sc to floods the set of predictor variables used in the rf models consists of 16 variables shown in table 2 the rationale behind the selection of these predictors is to represent hydrologic conditions in the catchment and stream during floods and the memory of the catchment at different time scales of 5 days short 30 days medium and 120 days long we tested the sensitivity of selecting these specific time lags e g 5 as opposed to 7 days and found that there are very negligible differences between their values with 2 days because sc is highly autocorrelated two modeling approaches were carried out in this study first we set up a different rf model for each individual site with feature importance analysis carried out then the results were averaged across each climatic zone second we developed a regional rf model that is trained on normalized data compiled from all sites within each climatic zone arid temperate and wet the total sample size was 17 089 for arid 24 831 for temperate and 37 339 for wet climates each model was trained on 75 of the data and tested on the remaining 25 all rf models were implemented using scikit learn package in python pedregosa et al 2011 hyperparameter tuning of the models is explained in text s2 2 7 causal analysis using transfer entropy we used causal analysis to validate the results obtained from rf models and their feature importance the advantage of using causal inference is that it allows to condition on potential confounders variables that might be a common cause for an apparent statistical relationship between two variables the method we use here is transfer entropy te schreiber 2000 which quantifies the conditional mutual information i x y z the shared information between variables x and y given a set of conditioning variables z the implementation of transfer entropy we use here is based on an algorithm of k nearest neighbors kraskov et al 2004 which has been shown to provide reasonable performance in detecting causal relations in hydrological systems ombadi et al 2020 the interested reader should refer to ombadi et al 2020 for further details on the implementation of the algorithm for instance in order to investigate whether s c τ 5 is an important factor affecting the variability of salinity response to floods at individual sites te enables us to test the relationship between s c τ 5 and specific conductance at days of floods s c t while conditioning on potential confounding variables specifically we test the following conditional independence 6 t e s c τ 5 s c t i s c τ 5 s c t q τ 5 q t eq 6 quantifies the information flow from s c τ 5 to s c t after conditioning on the short term memory of flow q τ 5 and flow at days of floods q t this conditional independence test accounts for any effects induced by autocorrelation in streamflow similarly the transfer entropy from q t to s c t can be expressed as follows 7 t e q t s c t i q t s c t q τ 5 s c τ 5 we used data compiled for each climate zone to compute te in eqs 6 and 7 whereas the statistical significance was assessed using 50 randomly shuffled surrogates of the time series in this paper surrogates are only used to assess statistical significance in computation of te because it is a nonparametric test 3 results 3 1 variability of specific conductance during floods we start our analysis by examining the variability in nsc during days of floods across the 259 sites fig 3 a shows the distribution of nsc for flood events across all sites with a total number of n 91 257 overall nsc varies from 0 9 90 decrease relative to long term mean to 0 14 14 increase relative to long term mean which indicates a large range of variation across sites 2 5th 97 5th percentiles the bulk of the distribution shown in fig 3a is located below zero i e the long term mean which indicates that dilution the process of decreasing the concentration of a solute by addition of water is the dominant mechanism that determines salinity response to floods however we also note that in 6 1 n 5521 of all flood events nsc is higher than zero which means that there are alternative mechanisms that lead to enrichment an increase in the concentration of salts during floods furthermore fig 3b demonstrates the significant variability of nsc at different sites the distributions summarize the variability of nsc at three example sites mcdonalds branch in lebanon state forest in new jersey spring ck nr tomball in texas and silver creek near silver creek junction in utah with mean nsc values of 0 17 0 73 and 0 17 respectively the difference in the mean value of the distributions pinpoints spatial differences in the response of salinity to floods for instance it is clear that the site in new jersey 01466500 is often associated with elevated salinity during floods whereas the two other sites exhibit varying degrees of decrease in salinity we hereafter refer to this spatial difference in the response of salinity to floods as inter site variability it is also important to note that there is a wide variability in nsc at the individual site level as evident by the width of the distributions in fig 3b more specifically the standard deviations of nsc are 0 28 0 13 and 0 18 for mcdonalds branch in new jersey spring ck nr tomball in texas and silver creek in utah respectively we hereafter refer to this type of within site variability as intra site variability 3 2 inter site variability catchment characteristics affecting the spatial differences in the response of specific conductance to floods fig 4 shows the spearman correlation coefficient between catchment characteristics and the median value of nsc during floods at each site denoted as n s c it also shows the relationship between catchment characteristics and long term mean of specific conductance at each site s c note that only relationships with a statistically significant correlation α 0 05 are shown in fig 4 statistical significance was assessed traditionally using the analytical form of null hypothesis of the distribution interestingly catchment characteristics that affect s c are distinct from those that mediate the response of salinity to floods n s c notably hydrologic modification factors such as the density of dams ddens maj ddens and density of national pollutant discharge elimination systems npdes in addition to hydrologic disturbance index disturb index appear to be the characteristics that have a significant relationship with s c both in arid and temperate climates on the other hand the response of salinity to floods n s c appears to be influenced by land use land cover characteristics especially in temperate climates factors such roads density impervious surface percentage of urbanized watershed open water developed low developed med and developed high are anticorrelated with n s c this indicates that increased urbanization and percentage of impervious cover are associated with lower values of specific conductance during floods i e stronger dilution contrary to temperate climates the response of salinity to floods in wet and arid climates is not significantly influenced by urbanization more specifically n s c in arid climates is positively correlated with the percentage of pit mines in the watershed mining and anticorrelated with the bulk density of soil in wet climates n s c is anticorrelated with the percentage of high order streams 6th streams and the percentage of canals in the watershed this indicates that stronger dilution is expected in catchments with high order streams that aggregate water from headwater streams similarly an increased percentage of canals leads to stronger dilution due to its impact in enhancing runoff 3 3 intra site variability factors impacting temporal differences in the response of specific conductance to floods 3 3 1 random forest models and feature importance analysis the rf models trained separately for each site provide a reasonable performance in predicting s c table 3 summarizes the performance of the models in terms of different metrics including nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nse values at the 259 sites range from 0 29 5th percentile to 0 97 95th percentile with a median value of 0 73 only five sites have nse values lower than zero indicating that the rf model had a lower skill than a model that uses s c as an estimate for all events the relatively reasonable performance of the models underscores that they indeed provide an insight into the key factors affecting intra site variability in the response of salinity to floods fig 5 shows the relative importance of predictors obtained from the first modeling approach one model for each site averaged across each climate zone across all zones the top three features in order of importance are s c τ 5 q t and s c τ 30 results from the second modeling approach regional models are shown in figure s2 of the supplementary information were indistinguishable from those obtained using the first modeling approach with the most important predictors being s c τ 5 q t and s c τ 30 3 3 2 causal analysis using transfer entropy fig 6 shows the values of log transformed t e s c τ 5 s c t and t e q t s c t eqs 6 and 7 for each climate zone as well as the distribution of the surrogates box plots all values of te are statistically significant p v a l u e 0 these results indicate that s c τ 5 is indeed the most important factor affecting specific conductance during days of floods amongst the chosen input variables since the values of t e s c τ 5 s c t exceed those of t e q t s c t across all climate zones blue markers compared orange ones 4 discussion 4 1 response of salinity to floods dilution and enrichment this study is the first continental scale analysis that clearly shows that flood events lead to a decrease of solute concentration due to dilution at a majority of sites although we also found that approximately 6 of flood events across 259 sites n 5521 lead to enrichment of salinity possible mechanisms leading to enrichment include flushing of concentrated salts from agricultural lands and mining sites significant contributions from saline groundwater or seawater intrusion and salt fronts in coastal sites moreover the extent of dilution varies significantly across streams and rivers in conus with median values of specific conductance ranging from a 75 5th percentile to 8 95th percentile decrease relative to the long term mean the wide range of values covered by the distribution in fig 3a indicates that floods have significant and distinct impacts on salinity at different sites 4 2 catchment characteristics affecting the response of salinity to floods are distinct from those controlling mean salinity levels fig 4 shows that catchment characteristics regulating the response of salinity to floods n s c are different from those that control s c most notable is that urbanization in temperate climates leads to lower values of salinity during floods i e stronger dilution while it has no discernable impact on s c this result might seem to be contradictory to previous regional studies that linked urbanization to increased levels of s c e g moore et al 2019 prowse 1987 conway 2007 due to higher usage of deicing road salts moore et al 2019 or as a result of denudation and weathering of materials prowse 1987 our analysis in this study however did not reveal any significant links between urbanization and elevated levels of average specific conductance in fact natural characteristics such as percentage of organic matter in soils and percentage of shrublands in watershed are more important factors controlling s c in arid climates fig 4 similarly the average depth to water table is the only factor exhibiting a significant relationship with s c in wet climates these results are more consistent with findings in a large scale analysis reported by lintern et al 2018 in which they highlighted the dominant role of natural rather than anthropogenic catchment characteristics in controlling s c although urbanization had no discernable impact on s c other anthropogenic factors such as the density of salinization point sources e g npdes national pollutant discharge elimination systems and hydrologic disturbance index were found to be important factors in mediating s c in temperate climates moreover the density of dams was also found to be an important factor affecting s c in arid climates we also note that the significant variability in factors regulating s c as well as n s c across different climate zones indicates that results obtained from regional studies e g timpano et al 2018 moore et al 2019 bird et al 2018 must be interpreted in a cautious manner this is because as shown in this study processes and mechanisms that affect salinity vary considerably based on aridity it is noteworthy that the majority of recent studies on trends and variability of salinity are focused on eastern usa 4 3 the interplay between aridity and anthropogenic attributes of catchments two main findings that stand out in section 4 2 are 1 the adverse impact of mining in arid climates and 2 the role of land use in strengthening dilution in temperate climates regarding the former the positive correlation of mining and elevated salinity during floods can be attributed to the high concentration of salts from mines in arid and semi arid climates induced by high evapotranspiration rates li et al 2014 kent 1982 jordan et al 2004 floods will typically mobilize and flush these concentrated salts leading to an increase in the mass of salts being transported and hence an increase in specific conductance as for the second finding at first glance it might appear to be perplexing that land use has a first order control on the response of salinity to floods only in temperate climates while it has no discernable impact in arid and wet climates this is because one would intuitively assume that an increased percentage of impervious cover will result in an increase of runoff ratio regardless of climatic conditions however fig 7 shows that changes in impervious cover have a significant impact in increasing the runoff ratio only in temperate climates slope 0 0032 p value 0 04 this is because the runoff ratio in wet climates is considerably high and conversely in arid climates is low fig 2b such that changes in impervious cover will not fundamentally alter processes by which precipitation is partitioned into runoff on the other hand sites with a temperate climate are characterized by runoff ratios that are sensitive to changes in impervious cover in order to lend credence to this finding we tested the relationship between impervious cover and runoff ratio in all sites provided by gages ii dataset n 9322 sites figure s3 the results show an increase in runoff ratio with higher percentage of impervious cover in both temperate and arid climates however the rate of increase in temperate climate is more robust than that in arid ones which corroborates the relationships shown in fig 7 4 4 the importance of system memory in determining the response of salinity to floods as shown in fig 3b there is a wide range of variability in the value of nsc during floods at each individual site section 4 3 highlights the significant role of antecedent sc levels in the 5 days preceding the flood as a primary factor amongst those examined in this study in controlling temporal differences in the response of sc to floods within individual sites the implications of this finding are perhaps most relevant to traditional concentration discharge c q relationships e g godsey et al 2009 chanat et al 2002 evans and davies 1998 in which the main assumption is that concentration of solutes can be expressed as a function of discharge in an exponential form i e c q b in contrast our results show that streamflow discharge at day of flood q t is less important of a factor compared to the short term memory of stream catchment in terms of average specific conductance despite the usefulness of c q relationships as tools for analysis and management of water quality they inherently neglect the dynamical nature of stream water chemistry our results suggest that the dynamical nature of the system as represented by short term antecedent sc conditions is far more important than information on the magnitude of discharge this is consistent with recent results that pointed out the variability of c q relationships for different hydrologic events minaudo et al 2019 knapp et al 2020 4 5 limitations of the study and implications of findings for water quality in a future climate in this study we defined deviations of sc during floods relative to long term mean rather than pre event sc levels thus dilution and enrichment are labeled relative to mean baseline conditions this is an important caveat to consider while interpreting the values of nsc presented in this study text s3 and figure s4 discuss the rationale behind this definition and potential implications on the results another limitation of this study is that land cover characteristics in gages ii dataset were originally obtained from the 2006 national land cover dataset nlcd which may not be ideally representative of catchment conditions if a significant change in land cover has taken place we speculate that this might only have a minimal impact on results since the period of record for most sites used in this study is between 1990 and 2021 fig 1b furthermore it is important to recognize that the analysis presented in section 3 2 relates the properties of hydrologic catchments to s c and n s c at a continental scale therefore the existence of strong relationships with other properties of catchments at regional scales can t be ruled out for instance although not apparent at a continental scale it is well established that urbanization and increases in impervious surface are linked to elevated salinity levels s c at a regional scale in cold climates due to the use of deicing salt corsi et al 2010 kaushal et al 2005 trowbridge et al 2010 perera et al 2013 snodgrass et al 2017 burgis et al 2020 the implications of our findings for water quality in a future climate are primarily centered on the result that aridity has a first order control on the response of salinity to floods more specifically we showed that the relationships between catchment properties and inter site variability in salinity response to flooding are distinct across different climate aridity zones wet temperate and arid the implications of this finding are clearly demonstrated when viewed against a backdrop of anticipated aridity changes in future climate in particular several studies highlighted that a warmer climate will increase aridity in most regions of the world due to an increase in evapotranspiration that outweigh potential increases in precipitation sherwood and fu 2014 fu and feng 2014 lin et al 2018 therefore streams and rivers that drain catchments with considerable mining activity in temperate climates are most likely to experience elevated salinity levels during floods in the future due to a shift toward higher aridity moreover our results suggest that socio economic development increased urbanization in the future is expected to shift runoff ratios i e change the way through which precipitation is partitioned into runoff and evapotranspiration particularly in temperate climates although our results indicate that this will lead to stronger dilution during floods at a continental scale it might also lead to elevated mean salinity levels at regional scales especially those of cold climate with significant use of deicing salt this raises several research questions on potential tradeoffs related to increased urbanization in a future climate in particular whether the positive impact of higher runoff ratios more water available for dilution will outweigh the negative impact of higher usage of deicing salt and higher rates of weathering larger mass of salt 5 conclusions in this study we found that the response of salinity to floods across 259 sites within the conus exhibits a wide spectrum of behaviors including both dilution and enrichment more specifically in a total of 91 257 flood events salinity deviated from a 100 decrease to 34 increase relative to long term mean with considerable inter site and intra site variability inter site variability was primarily explained by the interaction of climate aridity and anthropogenic factors most notable urbanization and increases in impervious cover were found to be associated with stronger dilution during floods only in temperate climates due to the sensitivity of runoff ratio to changes in the percentage of impervious cover in contrast mining has a noticeable impact on driving elevated salinity levels during floods in arid climate these findings suggest that future changes in aridity combined with socio economic development increased urbanization will have significant water quality implications with regard to salinity we also found that short term memory and antecedent conditions of salinity in the few days preceding the flood is more important in regulating the response of salinity to flood events within individual sites than the magnitude of flood discharge or long term salinity this finding implies that greater consideration needs to be given to the role of system memory in determining solute concentrations than is typically inferred from concentration discharge

15860,salinity is an important water quality parameter that affects ecosystem health and the use of freshwaters for industrial agricultural and other beneficial purposes although a number of studies have investigated the variability and trends of salinity in rivers and streams the effects of floods on salinity across a wide range of watersheds have not been determined here we examine this question by utilizing long term observational records of daily streamflow and specific conductance sc a proxy for salinity in addition to catchment characteristics for 259 united states geological survey usgs monitoring sites in the contiguous united states spanning a wide range of climatic geologic and hydrologic conditions we used a combination of statistical methods random forest machine learning models and information theoretic causal inference algorithms to determine the response of sc to floods and the factors that impact salinity changes within sites intra site variability and across sites inter site variability our results show that changes to sc during flood events exhibited substantial variability ranging from a 100 decrease to 34 increase relative to the long term mean we found that dilution is the prevailing mechanism that decreases sc levels during floods for most sites but other mechanisms caused an increase of sc for 6 1 n 5521 of flood events our analysis revealed that antecedent conditions of sc in the few days preceding the flood are the most important factor in explaining intra site variability the response of salinity to floods also varied considerably across sites with different characteristics with a notable effect of urbanization in temperate climates resulting in increased dilution of sc and mining in arid climates which adversely increases sc levels overall we find that the combined effect of aridity and anthropogenic factors is of primary importance in determining how salinity responds to floods and it bears strongly on water

records for instance a number of studies reported a shift in the timing of flood peaks in many rivers around the world e g blöschl et al 2017 wilson et al 2010 arheimer and lindström 2015 stewart et al 2005 additionally socio economic development is projected to be a significant driver of alterations in flood characteristics in the future winsemius et al 2016 such changes in flood regimes may result in severe consequences for water availability both in terms of quantity and quality previous studies of flooding impacts on salinity individual ion concentrations or suspended solids have primarily focused on investigating the nonlinear variability of solute concentrations during the flood hydrograph also known as hysteresis e g house and warwick 1998 hamshaw et al 2018 it has been shown that at hourly time scales concentrations of most solutes are higher during the rising limb of the hydrograph compared to the falling limb i e clock wise hysteresis house and warwick 1998 this has been attributed mainly to the flushing effect of floods whereby solutes deposited in the catchment and streambed prior to floods are mobilized and flushed during the rising limb of the hydrograph a phenomenon also known as first flush in the stormwater community additionally earlier results from a few catchments in southwestern england showed that the variability of chemical concentrations during floods is complex with concentrations either increasing decreasing or a mixture of both walling and foster 1975 furthermore several studies reported a time lag effect whereby the flood hydrograph precedes variations in chemical concentrations chemograph by several hours glover and johnson 1974 walling and foster 1975 the aforementioned studies provided important insights on the effects of floods on solute concentrations at sub daily time scales and often relied on short records of high frequency observations e g hourly 2 hrs from a limited number of sites however the impact of floods on salinity and potential influences of climatic geologic topographic and anthropogenic factors across large spatial domains remain unexplored the focus of this present paper is to examine the impact of floods on salinity measured as specific conductance sc across 259 sites in the contiguous united states conus using long term observations with a sample size of at least 3650 records i e 10 years of daily data at each site here we hypothesize that antecedent salinity levels memory combined with the interaction of climatic geologic hydrologic and anthropogenic factors such as mining agriculture and urbanization leads to variability in the response of salinity to floods we test this hypothesis by quantifying the variations in salinity during floods and examining their relationships to natural and anthropogenic properties of drainage basins more specifically our research objectives include 1 quantifying the spatial and temporal variability in sc during high flow conditions 2 identifying catchment characteristics that demonstrate a strong relationship with the response of specific conductance to floods and 3 exploring factors that mediate the variability of specific conductance within individual sites during flood events 2 materials and methods 2 1 site selection for the present study we selected usgs stations with readily available and sufficient information on their associated catchment properties therefore we used the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii dataset falcone et al 2010 as a reference for our site selection gages ii dataset provides 355 metadata features e g climatic geologic land use soil hydrologic properties for 9 322 usgs sites of these 9 322 sites we selected sites that had at least 10 years of daily measurements n 3650 of concurrent streamflow q and specific conductance sc in the usgs national water information system nwis this resulted in a set of 259 sites across the contiguous united states fig 1 a across all sites sc was measured in field from an unfiltered water subsample and adjusted to a standard temperature of 25 c detailed information on equipment calibration and measurement methods of sc are summarized in u s geological survey 2019 streamflow was measured using either one of two methods velocity area method or midsection method further details on equipment measurement practices and quality assurance of q measurements is summarized in turnipseed and sauer 2010 all sc and q measurements used in this study are designated with data quality code a which indicates that the data has been approved for publication and the review is completed fig 1a shows the location of the 259 sites used in our analysis which are distributed within 36 us states long term average sc values range from 20 to 17 600 μ s c m whereas average streamflow ranges from 0 03 to 916 m 3 s at a few stations measurements were recorded starting from 1940 fig 1b however most of the data was recorded after 1990 75 of total and after 2003 50 of total for all sites in our case study we used 123 catchment characteristics table s1 from the original 355 metadata features provided by gages ii dataset these characteristics represent 7 broad categories climatic hydrologic hydrologic modification e g dams topographic land use land cover nutrient and pesticide application and soil properties the remaining catchment characteristics excluded from analysis were either categorical values or monthly climatic statistics e g monthly average temperature the 259 sites used in this study span a wide range of climate elevation size of drainage basin extent of urbanization and soil properties table 1 and table s1 2 2 pre processing time series of sc and q daily sc measurements obtained from usgs nwis were reported either as mean median maximum minimum at noon or instantaneous values in units of μ s c m we opted to make use of all these measurements whenever needed in order to increase the sample size in our analysis we used a hierarchical data imputation scheme to estimate daily sc measurements more specifically sc is estimated using the following order mean median a linearly interpolated value between min and max at noon and instantaneous measurement for instance at any given station and day daily sc is estimated as an interpolated value between min and max only if the mean and median values were not reported if in addition to mean and median the values of max and min were not reported daily sc is taken to be equal to at noon sc measurement since deviations of sc and q are defined relative to the long term time averaged mean it is a prerequisite that any long term trends in sc or q are accounted for and removed to ensure consistency and uniform sampling throughout the record details of detrending timeseries are reported in text s1 2 3 identification of floods high flow events we define floods as daily streamflow q values higher than the 95th percentile more specifically the set of daily streamflow values considered as floods at any given site hereafter referred to as q f is defined as follows 1 q f q q q 95 where q 95 is the 95th percentile of all daily streamflow values at a given station 2 4 a normalized measure of specific conductance nsc sc varies significantly across the 259 sites used in this study see fig 1a and table 1 therefore we use a normalized measure of sc to facilitate analysis and comparison across all sites the normalized measure denoted as nsc is defined as follows 2 n s c s c t s c s c where s c t is the value of specific conductance at day t and s c is the long term average value of specific conductance at a given station more specifically s c is computed for each site as the mean of all daily de trended sc values during the period of record theoretically n s c has a lower bound of 1 when s c t 0 i e no salts in water whereas the upper bound is infinite an nsc value of 0 4 indicates that specific conductance is 40 percent higher than the long term mean 2 5 dryness index as a measure of aridity the water balance in hydrologic basins can be represented as follows 3 δ s p e t r δ g where p e t r δ g and δ s denote precipitation evapotranspiration runoff groundwater input and changes in water storage respectively at long climatological time scales fluctuations in δ s and δ g balance out leading to eq 4 4 p e t r the upper limit of e t is controlled by potential evapotranspiration pet therefore the ratio of pet to p defined as the dryness index di expresses the deficit availability of water in hydrologic basins as shown in the following equation budyko 1961 5 d i p e t p fig 2 a shows the relationship between di and the ratio of et p for all 259 sites as well as the budyko curve gray line which expresses the theoretical relationship between the two the ratio of et p was calculated from eq 4 as 1 runoff ratio where runoff ratio is equal to r p we classify all sites in our study into three climate zones based on the value of di as follows wet di 0 7 temperate 0 7 di 1 2 and arid di 1 2 the number of sites in these three zones is 133 80 and 46 respectively fig 2b shows the values of runoff ratio at each climate zone whereas figure s1 in the supplementary information shows a map of all sites according to their climate zone 2 6 random forest models in the present study we used random forest rf models to predict sc levels during days of floods and their feature importance to determine the dominant variables affecting the response of sc to floods the set of predictor variables used in the rf models consists of 16 variables shown in table 2 the rationale behind the selection of these predictors is to represent hydrologic conditions in the catchment and stream during floods and the memory of the catchment at different time scales of 5 days short 30 days medium and 120 days long we tested the sensitivity of selecting these specific time lags e g 5 as opposed to 7 days and found that there are very negligible differences between their values with 2 days because sc is highly autocorrelated two modeling approaches were carried out in this study first we set up a different rf model for each individual site with feature importance analysis carried out then the results were averaged across each climatic zone second we developed a regional rf model that is trained on normalized data compiled from all sites within each climatic zone arid temperate and wet the total sample size was 17 089 for arid 24 831 for temperate and 37 339 for wet climates each model was trained on 75 of the data and tested on the remaining 25 all rf models were implemented using scikit learn package in python pedregosa et al 2011 hyperparameter tuning of the models is explained in text s2 2 7 causal analysis using transfer entropy we used causal analysis to validate the results obtained from rf models and their feature importance the advantage of using causal inference is that it allows to condition on potential confounders variables that might be a common cause for an apparent statistical relationship between two variables the method we use here is transfer entropy te schreiber 2000 which quantifies the conditional mutual information i x y z the shared information between variables x and y given a set of conditioning variables z the implementation of transfer entropy we use here is based on an algorithm of k nearest neighbors kraskov et al 2004 which has been shown to provide reasonable performance in detecting causal relations in hydrological systems ombadi et al 2020 the interested reader should refer to ombadi et al 2020 for further details on the implementation of the algorithm for instance in order to investigate whether s c τ 5 is an important factor affecting the variability of salinity response to floods at individual sites te enables us to test the relationship between s c τ 5 and specific conductance at days of floods s c t while conditioning on potential confounding variables specifically we test the following conditional independence 6 t e s c τ 5 s c t i s c τ 5 s c t q τ 5 q t eq 6 quantifies the information flow from s c τ 5 to s c t after conditioning on the short term memory of flow q τ 5 and flow at days of floods q t this conditional independence test accounts for any effects induced by autocorrelation in streamflow similarly the transfer entropy from q t to s c t can be expressed as follows 7 t e q t s c t i q t s c t q τ 5 s c τ 5 we used data compiled for each climate zone to compute te in eqs 6 and 7 whereas the statistical significance was assessed using 50 randomly shuffled surrogates of the time series in this paper surrogates are only used to assess statistical significance in computation of te because it is a nonparametric test 3 results 3 1 variability of specific conductance during floods we start our analysis by examining the variability in nsc during days of floods across the 259 sites fig 3 a shows the distribution of nsc for flood events across all sites with a total number of n 91 257 overall nsc varies from 0 9 90 decrease relative to long term mean to 0 14 14 increase relative to long term mean which indicates a large range of variation across sites 2 5th 97 5th percentiles the bulk of the distribution shown in fig 3a is located below zero i e the long term mean which indicates that dilution the process of decreasing the concentration of a solute by addition of water is the dominant mechanism that determines salinity response to floods however we also note that in 6 1 n 5521 of all flood events nsc is higher than zero which means that there are alternative mechanisms that lead to enrichment an increase in the concentration of salts during floods furthermore fig 3b demonstrates the significant variability of nsc at different sites the distributions summarize the variability of nsc at three example sites mcdonalds branch in lebanon state forest in new jersey spring ck nr tomball in texas and silver creek near silver creek junction in utah with mean nsc values of 0 17 0 73 and 0 17 respectively the difference in the mean value of the distributions pinpoints spatial differences in the response of salinity to floods for instance it is clear that the site in new jersey 01466500 is often associated with elevated salinity during floods whereas the two other sites exhibit varying degrees of decrease in salinity we hereafter refer to this spatial difference in the response of salinity to floods as inter site variability it is also important to note that there is a wide variability in nsc at the individual site level as evident by the width of the distributions in fig 3b more specifically the standard deviations of nsc are 0 28 0 13 and 0 18 for mcdonalds branch in new jersey spring ck nr tomball in texas and silver creek in utah respectively we hereafter refer to this type of within site variability as intra site variability 3 2 inter site variability catchment characteristics affecting the spatial differences in the response of specific conductance to floods fig 4 shows the spearman correlation coefficient between catchment characteristics and the median value of nsc during floods at each site denoted as n s c it also shows the relationship between catchment characteristics and long term mean of specific conductance at each site s c note that only relationships with a statistically significant correlation α 0 05 are shown in fig 4 statistical significance was assessed traditionally using the analytical form of null hypothesis of the distribution interestingly catchment characteristics that affect s c are distinct from those that mediate the response of salinity to floods n s c notably hydrologic modification factors such as the density of dams ddens maj ddens and density of national pollutant discharge elimination systems npdes in addition to hydrologic disturbance index disturb index appear to be the characteristics that have a significant relationship with s c both in arid and temperate climates on the other hand the response of salinity to floods n s c appears to be influenced by land use land cover characteristics especially in temperate climates factors such roads density impervious surface percentage of urbanized watershed open water developed low developed med and developed high are anticorrelated with n s c this indicates that increased urbanization and percentage of impervious cover are associated with lower values of specific conductance during floods i e stronger dilution contrary to temperate climates the response of salinity to floods in wet and arid climates is not significantly influenced by urbanization more specifically n s c in arid climates is positively correlated with the percentage of pit mines in the watershed mining and anticorrelated with the bulk density of soil in wet climates n s c is anticorrelated with the percentage of high order streams 6th streams and the percentage of canals in the watershed this indicates that stronger dilution is expected in catchments with high order streams that aggregate water from headwater streams similarly an increased percentage of canals leads to stronger dilution due to its impact in enhancing runoff 3 3 intra site variability factors impacting temporal differences in the response of specific conductance to floods 3 3 1 random forest models and feature importance analysis the rf models trained separately for each site provide a reasonable performance in predicting s c table 3 summarizes the performance of the models in terms of different metrics including nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nse values at the 259 sites range from 0 29 5th percentile to 0 97 95th percentile with a median value of 0 73 only five sites have nse values lower than zero indicating that the rf model had a lower skill than a model that uses s c as an estimate for all events the relatively reasonable performance of the models underscores that they indeed provide an insight into the key factors affecting intra site variability in the response of salinity to floods fig 5 shows the relative importance of predictors obtained from the first modeling approach one model for each site averaged across each climate zone across all zones the top three features in order of importance are s c τ 5 q t and s c τ 30 results from the second modeling approach regional models are shown in figure s2 of the supplementary information were indistinguishable from those obtained using the first modeling approach with the most important predictors being s c τ 5 q t and s c τ 30 3 3 2 causal analysis using transfer entropy fig 6 shows the values of log transformed t e s c τ 5 s c t and t e q t s c t eqs 6 and 7 for each climate zone as well as the distribution of the surrogates box plots all values of te are statistically significant p v a l u e 0 these results indicate that s c τ 5 is indeed the most important factor affecting specific conductance during days of floods amongst the chosen input variables since the values of t e s c τ 5 s c t exceed those of t e q t s c t across all climate zones blue markers compared orange ones 4 discussion 4 1 response of salinity to floods dilution and enrichment this study is the first continental scale analysis that clearly shows that flood events lead to a decrease of solute concentration due to dilution at a majority of sites although we also found that approximately 6 of flood events across 259 sites n 5521 lead to enrichment of salinity possible mechanisms leading to enrichment include flushing of concentrated salts from agricultural lands and mining sites significant contributions from saline groundwater or seawater intrusion and salt fronts in coastal sites moreover the extent of dilution varies significantly across streams and rivers in conus with median values of specific conductance ranging from a 75 5th percentile to 8 95th percentile decrease relative to the long term mean the wide range of values covered by the distribution in fig 3a indicates that floods have significant and distinct impacts on salinity at different sites 4 2 catchment characteristics affecting the response of salinity to floods are distinct from those controlling mean salinity levels fig 4 shows that catchment characteristics regulating the response of salinity to floods n s c are different from those that control s c most notable is that urbanization in temperate climates leads to lower values of salinity during floods i e stronger dilution while it has no discernable impact on s c this result might seem to be contradictory to previous regional studies that linked urbanization to increased levels of s c e g moore et al 2019 prowse 1987 conway 2007 due to higher usage of deicing road salts moore et al 2019 or as a result of denudation and weathering of materials prowse 1987 our analysis in this study however did not reveal any significant links between urbanization and elevated levels of average specific conductance in fact natural characteristics such as percentage of organic matter in soils and percentage of shrublands in watershed are more important factors controlling s c in arid climates fig 4 similarly the average depth to water table is the only factor exhibiting a significant relationship with s c in wet climates these results are more consistent with findings in a large scale analysis reported by lintern et al 2018 in which they highlighted the dominant role of natural rather than anthropogenic catchment characteristics in controlling s c although urbanization had no discernable impact on s c other anthropogenic factors such as the density of salinization point sources e g npdes national pollutant discharge elimination systems and hydrologic disturbance index were found to be important factors in mediating s c in temperate climates moreover the density of dams was also found to be an important factor affecting s c in arid climates we also note that the significant variability in factors regulating s c as well as n s c across different climate zones indicates that results obtained from regional studies e g timpano et al 2018 moore et al 2019 bird et al 2018 must be interpreted in a cautious manner this is because as shown in this study processes and mechanisms that affect salinity vary considerably based on aridity it is noteworthy that the majority of recent studies on trends and variability of salinity are focused on eastern usa 4 3 the interplay between aridity and anthropogenic attributes of catchments two main findings that stand out in section 4 2 are 1 the adverse impact of mining in arid climates and 2 the role of land use in strengthening dilution in temperate climates regarding the former the positive correlation of mining and elevated salinity during floods can be attributed to the high concentration of salts from mines in arid and semi arid climates induced by high evapotranspiration rates li et al 2014 kent 1982 jordan et al 2004 floods will typically mobilize and flush these concentrated salts leading to an increase in the mass of salts being transported and hence an increase in specific conductance as for the second finding at first glance it might appear to be perplexing that land use has a first order control on the response of salinity to floods only in temperate climates while it has no discernable impact in arid and wet climates this is because one would intuitively assume that an increased percentage of impervious cover will result in an increase of runoff ratio regardless of climatic conditions however fig 7 shows that changes in impervious cover have a significant impact in increasing the runoff ratio only in temperate climates slope 0 0032 p value 0 04 this is because the runoff ratio in wet climates is considerably high and conversely in arid climates is low fig 2b such that changes in impervious cover will not fundamentally alter processes by which precipitation is partitioned into runoff on the other hand sites with a temperate climate are characterized by runoff ratios that are sensitive to changes in impervious cover in order to lend credence to this finding we tested the relationship between impervious cover and runoff ratio in all sites provided by gages ii dataset n 9322 sites figure s3 the results show an increase in runoff ratio with higher percentage of impervious cover in both temperate and arid climates however the rate of increase in temperate climate is more robust than that in arid ones which corroborates the relationships shown in fig 7 4 4 the importance of system memory in determining the response of salinity to floods as shown in fig 3b there is a wide range of variability in the value of nsc during floods at each individual site section 4 3 highlights the significant role of antecedent sc levels in the 5 days preceding the flood as a primary factor amongst those examined in this study in controlling temporal differences in the response of sc to floods within individual sites the implications of this finding are perhaps most relevant to traditional concentration discharge c q relationships e g godsey et al 2009 chanat et al 2002 evans and davies 1998 in which the main assumption is that concentration of solutes can be expressed as a function of discharge in an exponential form i e c q b in contrast our results show that streamflow discharge at day of flood q t is less important of a factor compared to the short term memory of stream catchment in terms of average specific conductance despite the usefulness of c q relationships as tools for analysis and management of water quality they inherently neglect the dynamical nature of stream water chemistry our results suggest that the dynamical nature of the system as represented by short term antecedent sc conditions is far more important than information on the magnitude of discharge this is consistent with recent results that pointed out the variability of c q relationships for different hydrologic events minaudo et al 2019 knapp et al 2020 4 5 limitations of the study and implications of findings for water quality in a future climate in this study we defined deviations of sc during floods relative to long term mean rather than pre event sc levels thus dilution and enrichment are labeled relative to mean baseline conditions this is an important caveat to consider while interpreting the values of nsc presented in this study text s3 and figure s4 discuss the rationale behind this definition and potential implications on the results another limitation of this study is that land cover characteristics in gages ii dataset were originally obtained from the 2006 national land cover dataset nlcd which may not be ideally representative of catchment conditions if a significant change in land cover has taken place we speculate that this might only have a minimal impact on results since the period of record for most sites used in this study is between 1990 and 2021 fig 1b furthermore it is important to recognize that the analysis presented in section 3 2 relates the properties of hydrologic catchments to s c and n s c at a continental scale therefore the existence of strong relationships with other properties of catchments at regional scales can t be ruled out for instance although not apparent at a continental scale it is well established that urbanization and increases in impervious surface are linked to elevated salinity levels s c at a regional scale in cold climates due to the use of deicing salt corsi et al 2010 kaushal et al 2005 trowbridge et al 2010 perera et al 2013 snodgrass et al 2017 burgis et al 2020 the implications of our findings for water quality in a future climate are primarily centered on the result that aridity has a first order control on the response of salinity to floods more specifically we showed that the relationships between catchment properties and inter site variability in salinity response to flooding are distinct across different climate aridity zones wet temperate and arid the implications of this finding are clearly demonstrated when viewed against a backdrop of anticipated aridity changes in future climate in particular several studies highlighted that a warmer climate will increase aridity in most regions of the world due to an increase in evapotranspiration that outweigh potential increases in precipitation sherwood and fu 2014 fu and feng 2014 lin et al 2018 therefore streams and rivers that drain catchments with considerable mining activity in temperate climates are most likely to experience elevated salinity levels during floods in the future due to a shift toward higher aridity moreover our results suggest that socio economic development increased urbanization in the future is expected to shift runoff ratios i e change the way through which precipitation is partitioned into runoff and evapotranspiration particularly in temperate climates although our results indicate that this will lead to stronger dilution during floods at a continental scale it might also lead to elevated mean salinity levels at regional scales especially those of cold climate with significant use of deicing salt this raises several research questions on potential tradeoffs related to increased urbanization in a future climate in particular whether the positive impact of higher runoff ratios more water available for dilution will outweigh the negative impact of higher usage of deicing salt and higher rates of weathering larger mass of salt 5 conclusions in this study we found that the response of salinity to floods across 259 sites within the conus exhibits a wide spectrum of behaviors including both dilution and enrichment more specifically in a total of 91 257 flood events salinity deviated from a 100 decrease to 34 increase relative to long term mean with considerable inter site and intra site variability inter site variability was primarily explained by the interaction of climate aridity and anthropogenic factors most notable urbanization and increases in impervious cover were found to be associated with stronger dilution during floods only in temperate climates due to the sensitivity of runoff ratio to changes in the percentage of impervious cover in contrast mining has a noticeable impact on driving elevated salinity levels during floods in arid climate these findings suggest that future changes in aridity combined with socio economic development increased urbanization will have significant water quality implications with regard to salinity we also found that short term memory and antecedent conditions of salinity in the few days preceding the flood is more important in regulating the response of salinity to flood events within individual sites than the magnitude of flood discharge or long term salinity this finding implies that greater consideration needs to be given to the role of system memory in determining solute concentrations than is typically inferred from concentration discharge

significant compared to horizontal riverine transport the annual riverine outputs of pbdes and opfrs from the downstream sites were 250 330 g and 12 000 16 500 g respectively indicating the significance of riverine transport of organic contaminants from e waste recycling zones to surrounding areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sediment water interface organic

technologies sepúlveda et al 2010 causing recycling zones to become high polluted regions several typical recycling zones i e qingyuan guiyu and taizhou in china and some regions in india south africa and pakistan have been deemed analogues to superfund sites du et al 2020 ge et al 2020 iqbal et al 2017 labunska et al 2014 tue et al 2019 previous studies have found abundant flame retardants in sediment in qingyuan and guiyu although local governments already banned informal dismantling e waste activities several years ago huang et al 2019 li et al 2019 riverine and short range atmospheric transports are the main pathways for hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs to migrate from contaminated sites to surrounding areas if illegal primitive dismantling activities are banned the relative contribution of short range atmospheric transport to total mass transfer of hocs may decrease due to a sharp decline of atmospheric concentrations by comparison riverine outputs of hocs could also be reduced initially and then become relatively stable as reduced inputs due to the cease of e waste recycling are offset by new discharge from contaminated sediment in this context contaminated sediment initially serving as a sink may become a secondary source of contamination for example a mass balance analysis showed that 10 700 kg of pcbs from tri to deca chlorinated biphenyls were transported from the upper reach to lower reach of hudson river from 1978 to 1998 after direct discharge ended in 1977 another 4400 kg of dissolved pcbs escaped from contaminated sediment to overlying water greatly contributing to the total amount of pcbs by riverine transport connolly et al 2000 this led to increased accumulation of pcbs in water and biota at the downstream areas madden and skinner 2016 rodenburg et al 2011 hence riverine transport dynamics of hocs may play a significant role in the sink source interconversion of contaminated sediment conventional protocols for assessing the mobility of hocs in aquatic environments often employed active grab sampling methods to measure concentrations and then estimate fluxes with models achman et al 1996 di toro 2001 howell and rifai 2015 in recent years passive sampling techniques have been gradually developed to measure sediment water diffusion fluxes of hocs fernandez et al 2014 khairy and lohmann 2017 liu et al 2013 which could minimize the uncertainty in estimating dissolved concentrations of hocs by theoretical or empirical partition coefficients an integrated passive sampling device petition no for patent cooperation

surrogate standards for pbdes bde 51 and bde 115 and opfrs tnbp d 27 and tphp d 15 were bought from toronto research chemicals toronto on canada internal standards of bde 69 f bde 201 fluoranthene d 10 pyrene d 10 and dibenzo a h anthracene d 14 were acquired from accustandard and dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany standards of anthracene d 10 benzo a anthracene d 12 benzo a pyrene d 12 tdcpp d 15 tcp d 7 bde 50 bde 88 pcb 61 and pcb 155 from cambridge isotope laboratories andover ma usa were used as performance reference compounds prcs in addition polydimethylsiloxane pdms membranes 100 μm thickness were purchased from bald advanced materials hangzhou china 2 2 preparation of passive samplers the integrated passive sampler fig s1 used in the present study was modified on the basis of that used previously liu et al 2013 thus a brief description is presented here the passive sampler is composed of two upper and lower sections in the upper section the distances between each sampling cell and sediment water interface are 0 00 0 17 0 34 0 51 0 68 0 85 1 02 1 19 1 36 1 53 1 79 2 04 2 28 2 64 2 89 3 13 3 66 4 25 4 66 4 96 5 49 6 08 6 79 7 83 8 91 10 64 12 17 13 87 15 15 and 17 43 cm from bottom to top in the lower section the distance between each sampling cell and interface are 0 25 0 95 1 65 2 35 3 05 3 75 4 45 5 15 5 85 6 55 7 25 7 95 8 65 and 9 35 cm from top to bottom in addition four pieces of stainless steel support blades were installed between the upper and lower sections to prevent the sampler from sinking into sediment and keep the connection of the sampler at the sediment water interface before use each pdms membrane was cut into 10 8 cm size and cleaned by soaking in ethyl acetate for one week as the solvent was renew once per day twenty precleaned pdms membranes were placed in a glass bottle which contained a mixture of methanol and water 20 80 in volume spiked prcs with 0 8 µg l 1 for bde 50 bde 88 pcb 61 and pcb 155 and 8 µg l 1 for anthracene d 10 benzo a anthracene d 12 benzo a pyrene d 12 tdcpp d 15 and tcp d 7 respectively all the bottles were sealed shield from light and shaken at 170 rpm for 14 d before and after loading prcs two pdms membranes were randomly taken from each container to determine whether they contained target compounds and were loaded by prcs respectively to minimize the uncertainty in estimating the retained fractions of prcs each preloaded pdms membrane was subsampled 2 8 cm for the upper sampling cell or 1 8 cm size for the lower sampling cell to determine the initial prcs concentrations in addition each pdms membrane 9 8 cm size for the lower section of sampler was further cut into 9 0 5 cm strips for assembly into the sampler 2 3 field sampling the sampling sites are located in longtang sites a1 and a2 and shijiao towns sites b1 and b2 in qingyuan fig s2 where e waste recycling activities were mainly conducted between 1980 and 2010 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 passive samplers were deployed at both upstream sites a1 and b1 and downstream sites a2 and b2 stretches of two rivers from september 1 to november 24 2020 84 d the stream in longtang flows through a village where a large number of households illegally operated e waste dismantling business before 2010 zhang et al 2017 and some scattered illegal recycling activities occasionally happen now and ends up in farmland the river in shijiao receives domestic and industrial wastewater from the town and flows down into beijiang river one tributary of the pearl river it should be noted that there is a hardware and plastic recycling plant at the upper reach of river near site b1 in shijiao the distances between the upstream and downstream sampling sites in longtang and shijiao are approximately 1 4 and 2 3 km respectively the hydrological parameters at each sampling site are shown in table s1 when the samplers were recovered pdms membranes were immediately disassembled put in ice chests and transported to the laboratory surface sediment and overlying water samples were collected when samplers were deployed surface sediment samples at 0 10 cm were taken with a grab bucket and stirred evenly in a stainless steel basin with a stainless steel spoon they were wrapped with aluminum foil and finally sealed in polyethylene bags the sediment samples were transported in the same way with pdms samples five liters of water sample was collected at each sampling site with a stainless steel bucket suspended particulate matters in water were loaded in glass fiber filters 0 7 μm pore size 150 mm diameter whatman international ltd maidstone england by a peristaltic system wang et al 2007 2 4 sample extraction and instrumental analysis each pdms membrane was washed with deionized water and dried with filter papers then extracted twice by soaking in 20 ml acetone in a brown glass bottle each one for 24 h prior to extraction each sample was spiked with 5 ng of bde 51 and bde 115 and 250 ng of tnbp d 27 and tphp d 15 activated copper slices were added to the sample for eliminating sulfur two extracts were combined and concentrated to 10 ml with a zymark turbo vap ii hopkinton ma usa then added with hexane solvent for replacement and further concentrated to 0 5 ml this final sample was firstly analyzed for opfrs afterwards each residual sample was further purified with a glass column 0 23 cm i d packed with 5 cm acidic silica and eluted with 1 ml of hexane the eluent was concentrated to 100 μl for pbdes analysis sediment 1 g dry weight and spm samples were both freeze dried and homogenized then ultrasonically extracted three times each with 25 ml of hexane dichloromethane and acetone mixture 2 2 1 in volume for 30 min three extracts were combined and concentrated to approximately 1 ml for solvent exchange then purified with a glass column 0 8 cm i d packed with 1 cm anhydrous sodium sulfate 6 cm neutral silica column and 2 cm anhydrous sodium sulfate from up to down the column was consecutively eluted with 25 ml of hexane for pbdes fraction and 25 ml of a solvent mixture of dichloromethane and acetone 1 1 in volume for opfrs fraction the pbdes fraction was further concentrated and purified using the same procedure as for pdms samples all samples were spiked with internal standards before instrumental analysis concentrations of pbdes and opfrs were determined with a shimadzu gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer gcms qp 2010 plus japan operating in the negative chemical ionization and electron ionization modes respectively detailed information on instrumental analysis are presented in text s1 in addition the contents of total organic carbon toc in sediment and spm were measured with vario toc analyzer elementar germany whereas the levels of dissolved organic carbon doc in filtered water were determined by toc l analyzer shimadzu japan 2 5 quality assurance and quality control the recoveries of the surrogate standards bde 51 bde 115 tnbp d 27 and tphp d 15 were 121 20 111 11 116 22 and 125 22 in pdms blank samples n 156 98 5 100 2 99 10 and 94 15 in sediment and spm blank samples n 6 128 22 67 12 127 20 and 122 19 in pdms samples n 204 and 80 16 91 20 103 9 and 115 12 in sediment and spm samples n 16 respectively the reporting detection limits for di to penta bdes hexa to octa bdes mona to deca bdes and opfrs in sediment were 1 2 5 and 2 ng g 1 respectively while those in spm samples were 4 8 20 and 20 ng g 1 respectively those reporting detection limits in overlying water and porewater are presented in table s2 none of target compounds was detected in pdms blank samples the concentrations of target compounds in all samples were deducted those in blanks samples but not corrected by the surrogate standard recoveries 2 6 data analysis calculations of freely dissolved concentrations of target compounds have been described in our previous study yao et al 2017 according to the fick s first law of diffusion the diffusion flux f s w of a target compound across the sediment water interface can be estimated by liu et al 2013 1 f s w d w c w 0 a 0 where d w is the diffusion coefficient of the target compound in water c w 0 is the dissolved concentration of the target compound at the sediment water interface z w 0 derived from the concentration profile in overlying water text s2 and ɑ 0 is the fitting parameter the pdms water equilibrium partition coefficients of prcs and target compounds and other parameters including molecular volume viscosity and diffusion coefficients are presented in table s3 the effects of water flow and temperature on quantifying target compounds in water were corrected by the desorption kinetics of prcs from pdms membranes the flux f x of a target compound via horizontal riverine transport can be calculated by 2 f x c t q where c t is the sum of the apparent dissolved concentration and spm bound concentration of a target compound and q is the water flow at the sampling site table s1 due to the experimental errors in the pretreatment of filtered water the apparent dissolved concentrations of target compounds were estimated by the freely dissolved concentration and doc water partition coefficients text s3 instead of direct determination khairy and lohmann 2017 have found that the freely dissolved concentrations of bde congeners derived from passive sampler were consistent with those from the apparent dissolved concentrations corrected for doc uncertainties in the freely dissolved concentrations and flux were estimated by the error propagation analysis with all parameters text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of pbdes and opfrs in sediment and suspended particulate matter the total concentrations of pbdes and opfrs at all sampling sites were 5600 12 000 and 940 82 000 ng g 1 in sediment and 1500 16 000 and 800 8900 ng g 1 in spm respectively table 1 the concentrations of pbdes and opfrs in sediment at the upstream and downstream sites of longtang were comparable but higher concentrations were found at the downstream site in shijiao compared to the upstream site table 1 the contents of toc in sediment at sites a1 a2 b1 and b2 were 3 8 3 9 1 9 and 2 3 respectively table s4 the organic carbon oc normalized concentrations of pbdes in sediment were comparable among all sites 295 000 316 000 ng goc 1 except for site b2 391 000 ng goc 1 this may indicate another input of pbdes in sediment at site b2 except for e waste recycling activities on the other hand the concentrations of all target compounds in spm samples were higher at the upstream sites than those at the downstream sites in both longtang and shijiao except those of opfrs in shijiao fig s3 this could be explained with the surrounding information that the reach of the river between sites b1 and b2 in shijiao receives domestic and industrial wastewater from automobile repair shops fig s2 which could contain a relatively great amount of opfrs in addition the contribution of rainwater which could carry road dust or e waste debris at the around areas into the river to target compounds in sediment and spm at site b2 should be also considered a compositional analysis showed bde 209 was the most abundant congener fig 1 a accounting for 83 97 and 85 90 of total pbdes respectively in sediment and spm the compositions of opfrs in sediment and spm were similar at both upstream sites with tphp as the most abundant component fig 1 b however the relative abundance of tcpp in spm increased up to 39 and 72 at the downstream sites fig 1 b previous studies found that tcpp was the most abundant compound of opfrs in indoor dust from e waste recycling workshops du et al 2020 zheng et al 2015b this finding indicated a new input of opfrs from e waste recycling activities between the upstream and downstream sites especially in shijiao site b2 a comparison of the data from the present study with those previously acquired in rivers near longtang and shijiao showed that the sediment concentrations of pbdes in 2020 5600 12 000 ng g 1 were significantly higher than those in beijiang river in 2006 310 570 ng g 1 fig s2 chen et al 2009 in dayanhe river in 2009 2010 14 160 ng g 1 fig s2 chen et al 2013 and one river in longtang in 2012 480 5300 ng g 1 wang et al 2015 apparently large amounts of pbdes remained in river sediment of qingyuan due to the emission from plastic recycling plants and occasional illegal e waste dismantling activities the sediment concentrations of opfrs 940 82 000 ng g 1 in 2020 were also significantly higher than those in 2010 470 ng g 1 tan et al 2016 and 2014 135 74 ng g 1 liu et al 2019 however the concentrations of 21 bde congeners in the atmosphere around an industrial park in qingyuan in 2016 189 3516 pg m 3 wang 2019 were one order of magnitude lower than those measured in 2008 120 19 000 pg m 3 tian et al 2011 this difference highlights the importance of riverine transport in mobilizing sediment sequestered contaminants concerted efforts are needed to evaluate the potential ecological risk of organic contaminants in aquatic environments of e waste recycling zones 3 2 dissolved concentrations of pbdes and opfrs in overlying water and sediment porewater only three bde congeners bde 17 47 and 99 and seven opfr compounds tipp tcpp tibp tnbp tphp tcp and ehdpp were detected in both overlying water and sediment porewater the dissolved concentrations of sum pbdes and opfrs at all sampling sites were 0 03 0 33 and 220 2700 ng l 1 in overlying water and 0 06 0 37 and 360 2800 ng l 1 in sediment porewater table 1 respectively at each sampling site the dissolved concentrations of opfrs in sediment porewater were four orders of magnitude higher than those of pbdes although their levels in sediment were within one order of magnitude table 1 this is due to the relatively higher hydrophobicity of three detected bde congeners compared to opfr compounds large uncertainties in dissolved concentrations were found for bde 17 tcp and ehdpp figs 2 and s6 due to the large error of their equilibrium pdms water partition coefficients table s3 expectedly the dissolved concentrations of pbdes in overlying water in small rivers of longtang and shijiao were higher than those in lake erie and lake ontario canada 0 0006 0 018 ng l 1 for 12 bde congeners mcdonough et al 2016 narragansett bay of atlantic coast of rhode island 0 003 0 22 ng l 1 for 12 bde congeners in 2014 0 002 ng l 1 in 2009 sacks and lohmann 2012 zhao et al 2018 and a remote marine system 0 002 ng l 1 mcdonough et al 2018 but comparable with those in lake ontario 0 014 0 96 ng l 1 for 19 bde congeners zhang et al 2020 which were all determined by passive samplers similar pattern was also observed for opfrs between the present study area and other regions ma et al 2021 mcdonough et al 2018 it is worthwhile to note that bde 209 was not detected in pdms membranes 0 13 0 16 g deployed in sediment for 84 d although its concentration in sediment was up to 12 000 ng g 1 nevertheless bde 209 was observed in ldpe membranes 0 07 g deployed in sediment for 125 d at similar sediment concentrations in a river of dongguan a typical electronics manufacturing region in china wu et al 2020 the contents of toc 1 9 3 9 table s4 in 0 10 cm sediments from qingyuan were lower than those 9 0 19 from dongguan the dissipation rates of bde 88 one prc log k ow 7 39 from pdms membranes in porewater 0 005 0 0095 d 1 table s5 were also greater than those from ldpe membranes 0 0008 0 002 d 1 wu et al 2020 rusina et al 2010 have found that the diffusion coefficients of pcbs and pahs in pdms which is called silicone rubber were higher than those in ldpe valderrama et al 2016 also observed higher diffusion coefficients of pbdes including bde 209 in silicone rubber than in ldpe in addition allen et al 2013 reported that the mass ratios of bde 209 in silicone strips and ldpe membranes both deployed in river alna norway for 49 d ranged from 2 4 to 4 6 but the mass of silicone strip 8 5 g was seven times greater than that of ldpe membrane 1 1 g all these suggested that different efficacies of pdms and ldpe membranes in passive field sampling of hocs such as bde 209 need to be further verified although almost no accumulation of bde 209 in pdms membrane 15 suspected brominated compounds with characteristic ions m z 79 and 81 which are labeled from br x 1 to br x 15 were observed in the pdms extracts fig s5 in particular br x 8 br x 9 br x 12 and br x 14 were detected in all overlying water and sediment porewater samples from all sampling sites table s6 due to the lack of standards individual suspected compounds were quantified with the calibration curves of other closely co eluting bde congeners the concentrations of these suspected compounds were in the ranges of below detection limits 3 1 ng l 1 in overlying water and below detection limits 0 85 ng l 1 in porewater table s6 slightly higher and comparable to the levels of individual bde 17 47 and 99 3 3 sediment water diffusion fluxes the vertical concentration profiles of freely dissolved pbdes and opfrs in overlying water and sediment porewater varied similarly at the upstream and downstream sites except for tibp in longtang figs 2 and s6 for example the individual concentrations of three bde congeners in different depths varied over a small range figs 2 a c and s6 a c except for bde 17 at site a2 suggesting that these compounds may have reached equilibrium between overlying water and sediment porewater the concentrations of tipp and tnbp at all sites exhibited increasing trends from overlying water to sediment porewater figs 2 d and g and s6 d and g i e sediment seemed to act as an emission source on the other hand the concentrations of tibp in overlying water increased with increasing water depth at site a1 but decreased at site a2 fig 2 f indicating different transport directions between overlying water and sediment porewater at the upstream and downstream sites similar phenomenon was not observed at sites b1 and b2 fig s6 f the difference may have resulted from the relatively higher sediment concentration of tibp at site a1 than at site a2 fig s3 b in addition it was difficult to clearly identify the diffusion directions of other compounds e g tphp tcp and ehdpp at sites a1 and a2 fig 2 between overlying water and sediment from their concentration profiles large uncertainty may have been involved in determining the diffusion directions by a two point concentration gradient between overlying water and sediment porewater time weighted sediment water diffusion fluxes were obtained by fitting the concentration profiles of target compounds in overlying water and at the sediment water interface with eqs1 and s2 to minimize uncertainties the regression coefficient r 2 and significant level p of fitting curves were set to r 2 0 25 and p 0 05 as a result some concentration data points for several opfr compounds were excluded from curve fitting it should be noted that all relative standard deviations in estimated fluxes of bde 17 and individual opfr compounds before and after excluding these data points were less than 12 except for tipp 66 at site a1 and tphp 43 at site a2 table s7 moreover the flux directions for all target compounds remained unchanged table s7 the concentration profiles of bde 17 47 and 99 were fitted to eq s2 with r 2 ranging from 0 30 0 74 except for bde 17 at site b1 and bde 47 and bde 99 at sites a2 b1 and b2 fig s7 and table s8 the fitting regression coefficients for individual opfr compounds ranged from 0 25 to 0 91 at all four sites figs 3 and s8 table s8 the time weighted diffusion fluxes of individual bde congeners and opfr compounds across the sediment water interface ranged from 170 to 130 ng m 2 d 1 at four sites table s9 specifically the diffusion fluxes of bde congeners 0 0075 0 04 ng m 2 d 1 were 3 6 orders of magnitude less than those of opfr compounds 170 130 ng m 2 d 1 table s9 this should be attributed to the stronger hydrophobicity of bde congeners log k ow 5 63 7 38 table s3 than opfrs log k ow 2 12 5 73 table s3 resulting in lower dissolved concentrations and smaller concentration gradients between overlying water and porewater this also suggested that sediment suspension or sedimentation is a more significant exchange pathway than dissolved diffusion for pbdes between overlying water and sediment khairy and lohmann 2017 the diffusion fluxes of tipp were positive at all sampling sites while those of tcpp were negative except for site b2 fig 4 i e tipp tended to escape from sediment to overlying water whereas tcpp inclined to deposit from overlying water to sediment except for site b2 the negative fluxes of tphp tcp and ehdpp at site a1 changed to positive values at site a2 fig 4 suggesting that sediment received continuous inputs for tphp tcp and ehdpp at the upstream site but became a source to overlying water at the downstream site it is worthwhile to note that all opfr compounds at the downstream site b2 tended to escape from sediment to overlying water fig 4 this change of flux directions for opfrs can be explained as follows using tcpp log k ow 2 59 and tphp log k ow 4 59 as the model compounds the total contents of sediment organic carbon and water velocities at four sampling sites varied in small ranges of 1 9 3 9 and 0 05 0 40 0 17 m s 1 respectively table s1 suggesting that the divergence in the effects of these two parameters on the desorption of opfrs from sediment could be neglected among the sampling sites tcpp tended to escape from sediment to overlying water at site b2 only its concentration in sediment at site b2 was comparable with those at sites a1 and a2 while its concentration in spm at site b2 was higher than those at other sites fig s3 b by comparison tphp was inclined to deposit from overlying water to sediment at site a1 only its concentrations in sediment and spm were both higher than those at other sites fig s3 b the concentration in spm seemed to be an important parameter controlling the change of flux direction for tphp but not for tcpp it should be noted that care must be exercised in using this conclusion as spm samples were collected once only in the present study individual sediment water diffusion fluxes of br x 1 br x 3 br x 7 br x 8 br x 9 br x 13 and br x 14 at sites a1 a2 and b2 were in the range of 0 2 0 052 ng m 2 d 1 table s10 br x 1 br x 3 and br x 8 preferred to settle from overlying water to sediment at site a1 whereas br x 3 br x 7 and br x 9 tended to escape from sediment to overlying water at sites a2 and b2 these suspected brominated compounds may have been partially derived from the degradation from high brominated bde congeners or other compounds in water or direct emissions from e waste recycling activities and additional efforts are needed to better identify their sources and assess their potential impacts on aquatic environments 3 4 horizontal and vertical migration horizontal riverine transport sediment water exchange and air water exchange are three main pathways for organic contaminants to migrate in a river system in the present study the air water exchange fluxes of the target compounds were not determined similarly the sediment water fluxes of doc bound target compounds were not calculated as the total contents of doc in overlying water were measured only the amounts of opfrs via horizontal riverine transport were 11 45 g d 1 at all sampling sites 1 2 orders of magnitude greater than those of pbdes 0 68 2 g d 1 table s11 the amounts of pbdes sorbed in spm contributed more than 95 of the total via horizontal riverine transport compared to that in the dissolved phase while the amounts of freely dissolved opfrs accounted for 94 97 of the total table s11 the amounts of opfrs via horizontal riverine transport were similar between sites a1 and a2 but significantly greater at site b2 than at site b1 table s11 decreasing trends in the amounts of pbdes were observed from the upstream sites to the downstream sites in both towns the annual amounts of pbdes and opfrs via horizontal river transport from the downstream sites a2 and b2 were in the ranges of 250 330 g and 12 000 16 500 g respectively fig 5 for vertical diffusive migration 0 01 0 05 mg of pbdes and 1470 mg of opfrs were transported from sediment to overlying water at both sites and in shijiao respectively fig 5 apparently the vertical migration of dissolved pbdes and opfrs was not significant compared to horizontal riverine transport in addition the surface sediment inventories of pbdes and opfrs calculated by sediment concentrations and density were similar at sites a1 0 64 and 4 5 kg and a2 0 67 and 3 6 kg but increased from sites b1 7 4 and 1 2 kg to b2 20 and 17 kg fig 5 all these results indicated that there were continuous inputs of pbdes and opfrs into the river in shijiao although illegal primitive e waste recycling activities have been banned pbdes and opfrs were still released into rivers and transported to the surrounding areas to our knowledge 29 villages with 2358 households embracing 21 rivers similar to the ones investigated in the present study were involved in illegal e waste dismantling activities in longtang and shijiao moreover contaminated sediment was hardly remediated in qingyuan this would pose potentially high risk to wildlife and residents in e waste recycling zones and surrounding areas 4 conclusion higher freely dissolved concentrations of pbdes and opfrs were found in porewater and overlying water in qingyuan compared to other regions suggesting the potential ecological risk of organic contaminants in aquatic environments of e waste recycling zones sediment is interchanged between a sink and a source during riverine transport of pbdes and opfrs sediment water diffusion was an insignificant pathway to pbdes and opfrs in overlying water in longtang and shijiao this implies the continuous input of pbdes and opfrs into the river supplementary materials supplementary

15861,despite ample evidence on spreading of e waste derived hazardous materials riverine transport of organic contaminants from e waste recycling zones to surrounding areas has not been evaluated to address this issue passive and grab sampling methods were used to assess sediment water diffusion and horizontal transport of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes and organophosphorus flame retardant opfrs at upstream and downstream sites of two rivers in a typical e waste recycling zone sediment acted as a source of bde 17 with fluxes of 0 007 0 04 ng m 2 d 1 at all sampling sites bde 47 and bde 99 reached equilibrium between overlying water and sediment porewater sediment interconverted from a sink at the upstream site to a source of opfrs at the downstream site with a flux varying between 7 3 and 234 ng m 2 d 1 the amounts of opfrs 11 45 g d 1 via horizontal riverine transport were greater than those of pbdes 0 68 2 g d 1 the vertical sediment water diffusion of pbdes and opfrs was not significant compared to horizontal riverine transport the annual riverine outputs of pbdes and opfrs from the downstream sites were 250 330 g and 12 000 16 500 g respectively indicating the significance of riverine transport of organic contaminants from e waste recycling zones to surrounding areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sediment water interface organic contaminants passive sampler mass transfer diffusion flux 1 introduction the amount of discarded electronic and electrical appliances e waste has increased exponentially in recent decades and was estimated to reach 52 2 million tons globally in 2021 baldé et al 2017 contaminant emissions into local environments are inevitable during e waste recycling processes especially with primitive technologies sepúlveda et al 2010 causing recycling zones to become high polluted regions several typical recycling zones i e qingyuan guiyu and taizhou in china and some regions in india south africa and pakistan have been deemed analogues to superfund sites du et al 2020 ge et al 2020 iqbal et al 2017 labunska et al 2014 tue et al 2019 previous studies have found abundant flame retardants in sediment in qingyuan and guiyu although local governments already banned informal dismantling e waste activities several years ago huang et al 2019 li et al 2019 riverine and short range atmospheric transports are the main pathways for hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs to migrate from contaminated sites to surrounding areas if illegal primitive dismantling activities are banned the relative contribution of short range atmospheric transport to total mass transfer of hocs may decrease due to a sharp decline of atmospheric concentrations by comparison riverine outputs of hocs could also be reduced initially and then become relatively stable as reduced inputs due to the cease of e waste recycling are offset by new discharge from contaminated sediment in this context contaminated sediment initially serving as a sink may become a secondary source of contamination for example a mass balance analysis showed that 10 700 kg of pcbs from tri to deca chlorinated biphenyls were transported from the upper reach to lower reach of hudson river from 1978 to 1998 after direct discharge ended in 1977 another 4400 kg of dissolved pcbs escaped from contaminated sediment to overlying water greatly contributing to the total amount of pcbs by riverine transport connolly et al 2000 this led to increased accumulation of pcbs in water and biota at the downstream areas madden and skinner 2016 rodenburg et al 2011 hence riverine transport dynamics of hocs may play a significant role in the sink source interconversion of contaminated sediment conventional protocols for assessing the mobility of hocs in aquatic environments often employed active grab sampling methods to measure concentrations and then estimate fluxes with models achman et al 1996 di toro 2001 howell and rifai 2015 in recent years passive sampling techniques have been gradually developed to measure sediment water diffusion fluxes of hocs fernandez et al 2014 khairy and lohmann 2017 liu et al 2013 which could minimize the uncertainty in estimating dissolved concentrations of hocs by theoretical or empirical partition coefficients an integrated passive sampling device petition no for patent cooperation treaty pct cn2013 070 256 developed by our group has been field tested to obtain the concentration profiles of hocs near the sediment water interface which are used to calculate sediment water diffusion fluxes feng et al 2016 liu et al 2013 this device could mitigate several deficits with previous samplers and related flux models e g fluxes are measured in one direction only from sediment to overlying water and linear diffusion of hocs is assumed between sediment and overlying water bao and zeng 2015 cornelissen et al 2016 polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes have been widely used as flame retardants in textile products and electronic electrical products which could be finally dumped as e waste abbasi et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 with the restriction and phase out of pbdes during

building materials as plasticizer and in hydraulic fluids etc van der veen and de boer 2012 wang et al 2017 these two typical hocs have been found in air soil sediment dust and biota in the e waste recycling zones ding et al 2022 wang et al 2018a 2018b wu et al 2019 zheng et al 2015a in the present study we used the integrated passive sampling device to determine diffusion fluxes of pbdes and opfrs across the sediment water interface and combined with an active grab sampling method to estimate the riverine transport fluxes at upstream and downstream sites of two rivers within qingyuan of guangdong province china the concentrations of pbdes and opfrs in sediment and suspended particulate matter spm were also determined to explore their temporal trends over the last decades in addition the annual amounts of the target compounds migrated by riverine runoff from e waste dismantling zones to downstream regions were estimated to examine the impacts of e waste dismantling activities on the surrounding areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials standards of 26 bde congeners and 13 opfr compounds text s1 in supplementary materials were purchased from accustandard new haven ct usa surrogate standards for pbdes bde 51 and bde 115 and opfrs tnbp d 27 and tphp d 15 were bought from toronto research chemicals toronto on canada internal standards of bde 69 f bde 201 fluoranthene d 10 pyrene d 10 and dibenzo a h anthracene d 14 were acquired from accustandard and dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany standards of anthracene d 10 benzo a anthracene d 12 benzo a pyrene d 12 tdcpp d 15 tcp d 7 bde 50 bde 88 pcb 61 and pcb 155 from cambridge isotope laboratories andover ma usa were used as performance reference compounds prcs in addition polydimethylsiloxane pdms membranes 100 μm thickness were purchased from bald advanced materials hangzhou china 2 2 preparation of passive samplers the integrated passive sampler fig s1 used in the present study was modified on the basis of that used previously liu et al 2013 thus a brief description is presented here the passive sampler is composed of two upper and lower sections in the upper section the distances between each sampling cell and sediment water interface are 0 00 0 17 0 34 0 51 0 68 0 85 1 02 1 19 1 36 1 53 1 79 2 04 2 28 2 64 2 89 3 13 3 66 4 25 4 66 4 96 5 49 6 08 6 79 7 83 8 91 10 64 12 17 13 87 15 15 and 17 43 cm from bottom to top in the lower section the distance between each sampling cell and interface are 0 25 0 95 1 65 2 35 3 05 3 75 4 45 5 15 5 85 6 55 7 25 7 95 8 65 and 9 35 cm from top to bottom in addition four pieces of stainless steel support blades were installed between the upper and lower sections to prevent the sampler from sinking into sediment and keep the connection of the sampler at the sediment water interface before use each pdms membrane was cut into 10 8 cm size and cleaned by soaking in ethyl acetate for one week as the solvent was renew once per day twenty precleaned pdms membranes were placed in a glass bottle which contained a mixture of methanol and water 20 80 in volume spiked prcs with 0 8 µg l 1 for bde 50 bde 88 pcb 61 and pcb 155 and 8 µg l 1 for anthracene d 10 benzo a anthracene d 12 benzo a pyrene d 12 tdcpp d 15 and tcp d 7 respectively all the bottles were sealed shield from light and shaken at 170 rpm for 14 d before and after loading prcs two pdms membranes were randomly taken from each container to determine whether they contained target compounds and were loaded by prcs respectively to minimize the uncertainty in estimating the retained fractions of prcs each preloaded pdms membrane was subsampled 2 8 cm for the upper sampling cell or 1 8 cm size for the lower sampling cell to determine the initial prcs concentrations in addition each pdms membrane 9 8 cm size for the lower section of sampler was further cut into 9 0 5 cm strips for assembly into the sampler 2 3 field sampling the sampling sites are located in longtang sites a1 and a2 and shijiao towns sites b1 and b2 in qingyuan fig s2 where e waste recycling activities were mainly conducted between 1980 and 2010 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 passive samplers were deployed at both upstream sites a1 and b1 and downstream sites a2 and b2 stretches of two rivers from september 1 to november 24 2020 84 d the stream in longtang flows through a village where a large number of households illegally operated e waste dismantling business before 2010 zhang et al 2017 and some scattered illegal recycling activities occasionally happen now and ends up in farmland the river in shijiao receives domestic and industrial wastewater from the town and flows down into beijiang river one tributary of the pearl river it should be noted that there is a hardware and plastic recycling plant at the upper reach of river near site b1 in shijiao the distances between the upstream and downstream sampling sites in longtang and shijiao are approximately 1 4 and 2 3 km respectively the hydrological parameters at each sampling site are shown in table s1 when the samplers were recovered pdms membranes were immediately disassembled put in ice chests and transported to the laboratory surface sediment and overlying water samples were collected when samplers were deployed surface sediment samples at 0 10 cm were taken with a grab bucket and stirred evenly in a stainless steel basin with a stainless steel spoon they were wrapped with aluminum foil and finally sealed in polyethylene bags the sediment samples were transported in the same way with pdms samples five liters of water sample was collected at each sampling site with a stainless steel bucket suspended particulate matters in water were loaded in glass fiber filters 0 7 μm pore size 150 mm diameter whatman international ltd maidstone england by a peristaltic system wang et al 2007 2 4 sample extraction and instrumental analysis each pdms membrane was washed with deionized water and dried with filter papers then extracted twice by soaking in 20 ml acetone in a brown glass bottle each one for 24 h prior to extraction each sample was spiked with 5 ng of bde 51 and bde 115 and 250 ng of tnbp d 27 and tphp d 15 activated copper slices were added to the sample for eliminating sulfur two extracts were combined and concentrated to 10 ml with a zymark turbo vap ii hopkinton ma usa then added with hexane solvent for replacement and further concentrated to 0 5 ml this final sample was firstly analyzed for opfrs afterwards each residual sample was further purified with a glass column 0 23 cm i d packed with 5 cm acidic silica and eluted with 1 ml of hexane the eluent was concentrated to 100 μl for pbdes analysis sediment 1 g dry weight and spm samples were both freeze dried and homogenized then ultrasonically extracted three times each with 25 ml of hexane dichloromethane and acetone mixture 2 2 1 in volume for 30 min three extracts were combined and concentrated to approximately 1 ml for solvent exchange then purified with a glass column 0 8 cm i d packed with 1 cm anhydrous sodium sulfate 6 cm neutral silica column and 2 cm anhydrous sodium sulfate from up to down the column was consecutively eluted with 25 ml of hexane for pbdes fraction and 25 ml of a solvent mixture of dichloromethane and acetone 1 1 in volume for opfrs fraction the pbdes fraction was further concentrated and purified using the same procedure as for pdms samples all samples were spiked with internal standards before instrumental analysis concentrations of pbdes and opfrs were determined with a shimadzu gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer gcms qp 2010 plus japan operating in the negative chemical ionization and electron ionization modes respectively detailed information on instrumental analysis are presented in text s1 in addition the contents of total organic carbon toc in sediment and spm were measured with vario toc analyzer elementar germany whereas the levels of dissolved organic carbon doc in filtered water were determined by toc l analyzer shimadzu japan 2 5 quality assurance and quality control the recoveries of the surrogate standards bde 51 bde 115 tnbp d 27 and tphp d 15 were 121 20 111 11 116 22 and 125 22 in pdms blank samples n 156 98 5 100 2 99 10 and 94 15 in sediment and spm blank samples n 6 128 22 67 12 127 20 and 122 19 in pdms samples n 204 and 80 16 91 20 103 9 and 115 12 in sediment and spm samples n 16 respectively the reporting detection limits for di to penta bdes hexa to octa bdes mona to deca bdes and opfrs in sediment were 1 2 5 and 2 ng g 1 respectively while those in spm samples were 4 8 20 and 20 ng g 1 respectively those reporting detection limits in overlying water and porewater are presented in table s2 none of target compounds was detected in pdms blank samples the concentrations of target compounds in all samples were deducted those in blanks samples but not corrected by the surrogate standard recoveries 2 6 data analysis calculations of freely dissolved concentrations of target compounds have been described in our previous study yao et al 2017 according to the fick s first law of diffusion the diffusion flux f s w of a target compound across the sediment water interface can be estimated by liu et al 2013 1 f s w d w c w 0 a 0 where d w is the diffusion coefficient of the target compound in water c w 0 is the dissolved concentration of the target compound at the sediment water interface z w 0 derived from the concentration profile in overlying water text s2 and ɑ 0 is the fitting parameter the pdms water equilibrium partition coefficients of prcs and target compounds and other parameters including molecular volume viscosity and diffusion coefficients are presented in table s3 the effects of water flow and temperature on quantifying target compounds in water were corrected by the desorption kinetics of prcs from pdms membranes the flux f x of a target compound via horizontal riverine transport can be calculated by 2 f x c t q where c t is the sum of the apparent dissolved concentration and spm bound concentration of a target compound and q is the water flow at the sampling site table s1 due to the experimental errors in the pretreatment of filtered water the apparent dissolved concentrations of target compounds were estimated by the freely dissolved concentration and doc water partition coefficients text s3 instead of direct determination khairy and lohmann 2017 have found that the freely dissolved concentrations of bde congeners derived from passive sampler were consistent with those from the apparent dissolved concentrations corrected for doc uncertainties in the freely dissolved concentrations and flux were estimated by the error propagation analysis with all parameters text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of pbdes and opfrs in sediment and suspended particulate matter the total concentrations of pbdes and opfrs at all sampling sites were 5600 12 000 and 940 82 000 ng g 1 in sediment and 1500 16 000 and 800 8900 ng g 1 in spm respectively table 1 the concentrations of pbdes and opfrs in sediment at the upstream and downstream sites of longtang were comparable but higher concentrations were found at the downstream site in shijiao compared to the upstream site table 1 the contents of toc in sediment at sites a1 a2 b1 and b2 were 3 8 3 9 1 9 and 2 3 respectively table s4 the organic carbon oc normalized concentrations of pbdes in sediment were comparable among all sites 295 000 316 000 ng goc 1 except for site b2 391 000 ng goc 1 this may indicate another input of pbdes in sediment at site b2 except for e waste recycling activities on the other hand the concentrations of all target compounds in spm samples were higher at the upstream sites than those at the downstream sites in both longtang and shijiao except those of opfrs in shijiao fig s3 this could be explained with the surrounding information that the reach of the river between sites b1 and b2 in shijiao receives domestic and industrial wastewater from automobile repair shops fig s2 which could contain a relatively great amount of opfrs in addition the contribution of rainwater which could carry road dust or e waste debris at the around areas into the river to target compounds in sediment and spm at site b2 should be also considered a compositional analysis showed bde 209 was the most abundant congener fig 1 a accounting for 83 97 and 85 90 of total pbdes respectively in sediment and spm the compositions of opfrs in sediment and spm were similar at both upstream sites with tphp as the most abundant component fig 1 b however the relative abundance of tcpp in spm increased up to 39 and 72 at the downstream sites fig 1 b previous studies found that tcpp was the most abundant compound of opfrs in indoor dust from e waste recycling workshops du et al 2020 zheng et al 2015b this finding indicated a new input of opfrs from e waste recycling activities between the upstream and downstream sites especially in shijiao site b2 a comparison of the data from the present study with those previously acquired in rivers near longtang and shijiao showed that the sediment concentrations of pbdes in 2020 5600 12 000 ng g 1 were significantly higher than those in beijiang river in 2006 310 570 ng g 1 fig s2 chen et al 2009 in dayanhe river in 2009 2010 14 160 ng g 1 fig s2 chen et al 2013 and one river in longtang in 2012 480 5300 ng g 1 wang et al 2015 apparently large amounts of pbdes remained in river sediment of qingyuan due to the emission from plastic recycling plants and occasional illegal e waste dismantling activities the sediment concentrations of opfrs 940 82 000 ng g 1 in 2020 were also significantly higher than those in 2010 470 ng g 1 tan et al 2016 and 2014 135 74 ng g 1 liu et al 2019 however the concentrations of 21 bde congeners in the atmosphere around an industrial park in qingyuan in 2016 189 3516 pg m 3 wang 2019 were one order of magnitude lower than those measured in 2008 120 19 000 pg m 3 tian et al 2011 this difference highlights the importance of riverine transport in mobilizing sediment sequestered contaminants concerted efforts are needed to evaluate the potential ecological risk of organic contaminants in aquatic environments of e waste recycling zones 3 2 dissolved concentrations of pbdes and opfrs in overlying water and sediment porewater only three bde congeners bde 17 47 and 99 and seven opfr compounds tipp tcpp tibp tnbp tphp tcp and ehdpp were detected in both overlying water and sediment porewater the dissolved concentrations of sum pbdes and opfrs at all sampling sites were 0 03 0 33 and 220 2700 ng l 1 in overlying water and 0 06 0 37 and 360 2800 ng l 1 in sediment porewater table 1 respectively at each sampling site the dissolved concentrations of opfrs in sediment porewater were four orders of magnitude higher than those of pbdes although their levels in sediment were within one order of magnitude table 1 this is due to the relatively higher hydrophobicity of three detected bde congeners compared to opfr compounds large uncertainties in dissolved concentrations were found for bde 17 tcp and ehdpp figs 2 and s6 due to the large error of their equilibrium pdms water partition coefficients table s3 expectedly the dissolved concentrations of pbdes in overlying water in small rivers of longtang and shijiao were higher than those in lake erie and lake ontario canada 0 0006 0 018 ng l 1 for 12 bde congeners mcdonough et al 2016 narragansett bay of atlantic coast of rhode island 0 003 0 22 ng l 1 for 12 bde congeners in 2014 0 002 ng l 1 in 2009 sacks and lohmann 2012 zhao et al 2018 and a remote marine system 0 002 ng l 1 mcdonough et al 2018 but comparable with those in lake ontario 0 014 0 96 ng l 1 for 19 bde congeners zhang et al 2020 which were all determined by passive samplers similar pattern was also observed for opfrs between the present study area and other regions ma et al 2021 mcdonough et al 2018 it is worthwhile to note that bde 209 was not detected in pdms membranes 0 13 0 16 g deployed in sediment for 84 d although its concentration in sediment was up to 12 000 ng g 1 nevertheless bde 209 was observed in ldpe membranes 0 07 g deployed in sediment for 125 d at similar sediment concentrations in a river of dongguan a typical electronics manufacturing region in china wu et al 2020 the contents of toc 1 9 3 9 table s4 in 0 10 cm sediments from qingyuan were lower than those 9 0 19 from dongguan the dissipation rates of bde 88 one prc log k ow 7 39 from pdms membranes in porewater 0 005 0 0095 d 1 table s5 were also greater than those from ldpe membranes 0 0008 0 002 d 1 wu et al 2020 rusina et al 2010 have found that the diffusion coefficients of pcbs and pahs in pdms which is called silicone rubber were higher than those in ldpe valderrama et al 2016 also observed higher diffusion coefficients of pbdes including bde 209 in silicone rubber than in ldpe in addition allen et al 2013 reported that the mass ratios of bde 209 in silicone strips and ldpe membranes both deployed in river alna norway for 49 d ranged from 2 4 to 4 6 but the mass of silicone strip 8 5 g was seven times greater than that of ldpe membrane 1 1 g all these suggested that different efficacies of pdms and ldpe membranes in passive field sampling of hocs such as bde 209 need to be further verified although almost no accumulation of bde 209 in pdms membrane 15 suspected brominated compounds with characteristic ions m z 79 and 81 which are labeled from br x 1 to br x 15 were observed in the pdms extracts fig s5 in particular br x 8 br x 9 br x 12 and br x 14 were detected in all overlying water and sediment porewater samples from all sampling sites table s6 due to the lack of standards individual suspected compounds were quantified with the calibration curves of other closely co eluting bde congeners the concentrations of these suspected compounds were in the ranges of below detection limits 3 1 ng l 1 in overlying water and below detection limits 0 85 ng l 1 in porewater table s6 slightly higher and comparable to the levels of individual bde 17 47 and 99 3 3 sediment water diffusion fluxes the vertical concentration profiles of freely dissolved pbdes and opfrs in overlying water and sediment porewater varied similarly at the upstream and downstream sites except for tibp in longtang figs 2 and s6 for example the individual concentrations of three bde congeners in different depths varied over a small range figs 2 a c and s6 a c except for bde 17 at site a2 suggesting that these compounds may have reached equilibrium between overlying water and sediment porewater the concentrations of tipp and tnbp at all sites exhibited increasing trends from overlying water to sediment porewater figs 2 d and g and s6 d and g i e sediment seemed to act as an emission source on the other hand the concentrations of tibp in overlying water increased with increasing water depth at site a1 but decreased at site a2 fig 2 f indicating different transport directions between overlying water and sediment porewater at the upstream and downstream sites similar phenomenon was not observed at sites b1 and b2 fig s6 f the difference may have resulted from the relatively higher sediment concentration of tibp at site a1 than at site a2 fig s3 b in addition it was difficult to clearly identify the diffusion directions of other compounds e g tphp tcp and ehdpp at sites a1 and a2 fig 2 between overlying water and sediment from their concentration profiles large uncertainty may have been involved in determining the diffusion directions by a two point concentration gradient between overlying water and sediment porewater time weighted sediment water diffusion fluxes were obtained by fitting the concentration profiles of target compounds in overlying water and at the sediment water interface with eqs1 and s2 to minimize uncertainties the regression coefficient r 2 and significant level p of fitting curves were set to r 2 0 25 and p 0 05 as a result some concentration data points for several opfr compounds were excluded from curve fitting it should be noted that all relative standard deviations in estimated fluxes of bde 17 and individual opfr compounds before and after excluding these data points were less than 12 except for tipp 66 at site a1 and tphp 43 at site a2 table s7 moreover the flux directions for all target compounds remained unchanged table s7 the concentration profiles of bde 17 47 and 99 were fitted to eq s2 with r 2 ranging from 0 30 0 74 except for bde 17 at site b1 and bde 47 and bde 99 at sites a2 b1 and b2 fig s7 and table s8 the fitting regression coefficients for individual opfr compounds ranged from 0 25 to 0 91 at all four sites figs 3 and s8 table s8 the time weighted diffusion fluxes of individual bde congeners and opfr compounds across the sediment water interface ranged from 170 to 130 ng m 2 d 1 at four sites table s9 specifically the diffusion fluxes of bde congeners 0 0075 0 04 ng m 2 d 1 were 3 6 orders of magnitude less than those of opfr compounds 170 130 ng m 2 d 1 table s9 this should be attributed to the stronger hydrophobicity of bde congeners log k ow 5 63 7 38 table s3 than opfrs log k ow 2 12 5 73 table s3 resulting in lower dissolved concentrations and smaller concentration gradients between overlying water and porewater this also suggested that sediment suspension or sedimentation is a more significant exchange pathway than dissolved diffusion for pbdes between overlying water and sediment khairy and lohmann 2017 the diffusion fluxes of tipp were positive at all sampling sites while those of tcpp were negative except for site b2 fig 4 i e tipp tended to escape from sediment to overlying water whereas tcpp inclined to deposit from overlying water to sediment except for site b2 the negative fluxes of tphp tcp and ehdpp at site a1 changed to positive values at site a2 fig 4 suggesting that sediment received continuous inputs for tphp tcp and ehdpp at the upstream site but became a source to overlying water at the downstream site it is worthwhile to note that all opfr compounds at the downstream site b2 tended to escape from sediment to overlying water fig 4 this change of flux directions for opfrs can be explained as follows using tcpp log k ow 2 59 and tphp log k ow 4 59 as the model compounds the total contents of sediment organic carbon and water velocities at four sampling sites varied in small ranges of 1 9 3 9 and 0 05 0 40 0 17 m s 1 respectively table s1 suggesting that the divergence in the effects of these two parameters on the desorption of opfrs from sediment could be neglected among the sampling sites tcpp tended to escape from sediment to overlying water at site b2 only its concentration in sediment at site b2 was comparable with those at sites a1 and a2 while its concentration in spm at site b2 was higher than those at other sites fig s3 b by comparison tphp was inclined to deposit from overlying water to sediment at site a1 only its concentrations in sediment and spm were both higher than those at other sites fig s3 b the concentration in spm seemed to be an important parameter controlling the change of flux direction for tphp but not for tcpp it should be noted that care must be exercised in using this conclusion as spm samples were collected once only in the present study individual sediment water diffusion fluxes of br x 1 br x 3 br x 7 br x 8 br x 9 br x 13 and br x 14 at sites a1 a2 and b2 were in the range of 0 2 0 052 ng m 2 d 1 table s10 br x 1 br x 3 and br x 8 preferred to settle from overlying water to sediment at site a1 whereas br x 3 br x 7 and br x 9 tended to escape from sediment to overlying water at sites a2 and b2 these suspected brominated compounds may have been partially derived from the degradation from high brominated bde congeners or other compounds in water or direct emissions from e waste recycling activities and additional efforts are needed to better identify their sources and assess their potential impacts on aquatic environments 3 4 horizontal and vertical migration horizontal riverine transport sediment water exchange and air water exchange are three main pathways for organic contaminants to migrate in a river system in the present study the air water exchange fluxes of the target compounds were not determined similarly the sediment water fluxes of doc bound target compounds were not calculated as the total contents of doc in overlying water were measured only the amounts of opfrs via horizontal riverine transport were 11 45 g d 1 at all sampling sites 1 2 orders of magnitude greater than those of pbdes 0 68 2 g d 1 table s11 the amounts of pbdes sorbed in spm contributed more than 95 of the total via horizontal riverine transport compared to that in the dissolved phase while the amounts of freely dissolved opfrs accounted for 94 97 of the total table s11 the amounts of opfrs via horizontal riverine transport were similar between sites a1 and a2 but significantly greater at site b2 than at site b1 table s11 decreasing trends in the amounts of pbdes were observed from the upstream sites to the downstream sites in both towns the annual amounts of pbdes and opfrs via horizontal river transport from the downstream sites a2 and b2 were in the ranges of 250 330 g and 12 000 16 500 g respectively fig 5 for vertical diffusive migration 0 01 0 05 mg of pbdes and 1470 mg of opfrs were transported from sediment to overlying water at both sites and in shijiao respectively fig 5 apparently the vertical migration of dissolved pbdes and opfrs was not significant compared to horizontal riverine transport in addition the surface sediment inventories of pbdes and opfrs calculated by sediment concentrations and density were similar at sites a1 0 64 and 4 5 kg and a2 0 67 and 3 6 kg but increased from sites b1 7 4 and 1 2 kg to b2 20 and 17 kg fig 5 all these results indicated that there were continuous inputs of pbdes and opfrs into the river in shijiao although illegal primitive e waste recycling activities have been banned pbdes and opfrs were still released into rivers and transported to the surrounding areas to our knowledge 29 villages with 2358 households embracing 21 rivers similar to the ones investigated in the present study were involved in illegal e waste dismantling activities in longtang and shijiao moreover contaminated sediment was hardly remediated in qingyuan this would pose potentially high risk to wildlife and residents in e waste recycling zones and surrounding areas 4 conclusion higher freely dissolved concentrations of pbdes and opfrs were found in porewater and overlying water in qingyuan compared to other regions suggesting the potential ecological risk of organic contaminants in aquatic environments of e waste recycling zones sediment is interchanged between a sink and a source during riverine transport of pbdes and opfrs sediment water diffusion was an insignificant pathway to pbdes and opfrs in overlying water in longtang and shijiao this implies the continuous input of pbdes and opfrs into the river supplementary materials supplementary

15862,sludge dewatering is an essential process for reduction of sludge volume to decrease cost of ultimate disposal in this study a novel method using activated carbon ac strengthening electrochemical ec treatment ec ac was adopted to improve greatly sludge dewaterability it was shown that capillary suction time cst and water content of dewatered sludge cake wc were reduced to 55 9 1 24 s and 64 3 1 23 respectively under the optimal conditions of ec voltage 20 v ec time 30 min and 0 2 g g dry solid ds ac ac with rich functional groups as the third electrode intensified electrooxidation by forming multiple microelectrodes and electron transfer capacity and conductivity of sludge were strengthened by ac in ec system which were illustrated by electrochemical analysis it could be found that zeta potential and particle size were increased and surface roughness was reduced after ec ac treatment intensifying sludge hydrophobicity form the results of rheological behaviors of sludge flowability was strengthened and viscosity was weakened under the conditioning of ec ac besides colloidal force and gel like network strength were lessened which was also verified by organic matters and percentage of inviable cells at the same time intracellular matters were released and degraded and bound water was released converting into free water in addition sludge compressibility and structural strength were increased and porous structure was formed facilitating water outflow via addition of mesoporous ac as skeleton builder which eventually led to an improved separation efficiency of solid water and sludge dewaterability the results of heavy metals suggested that sludge cake after ec ac treatment was favorable for land application graphical abstract image

to statistics issued by national bureau of statistics of china annual quantity of wastewater discharged in china was increased from 32 billion m3 to 57 billion m3 and treatment rate of wastewater was elevated sharply from 36 43 to 97 53 since 2001 to 2020 national bureau of statistics 2021 as the main by products of sewage treatment waste activated sludge production increased dramatically and it was evaluated that annual sludge production would be up to 60 million tons of 80 wt water content by the year of 2020 ge et al 2020 usually produced sludge during the process of sewage treatment contains large quantities of water but sludge with high water content create a huge challenge in terms of great bulk difficulty and expensive cost in storage transport and ultimate disposal dong et al 2021a xie et al 2019 therefore sludge dewatering to reduce sludge volume is essential for improvement of disposal safety and reduction of disposal cost li et al 2020a wei et al 2018 conventional coagulants and flocculants such as ferric salts and organic flocculants have been applied to promote sludge dewatering by aggregating fine particles into large aggregates and reducing specific surface area of sludge and adsorption of water molecules wu et al 2019a liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b flocculation is easy to operate but water content of dewatered sludge after traditional flocculation is still up to 75 85 due to limited effect of single flocculants dong et al 2021a reportedly it was the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps with huge amounts of hydrophilic groups and complex retiform structure in sludge which could bind tremendous water molecules and make sludge colloids in a steady state that limited water removal in sludge wu et al 2017 cao et al 2021 hence it is necessary to disrupt sludge cells destroy stability of sludge eps colloids and collapse sludge fractal retiform structure to release bound water for promotion of sludge dewatering substantial endeavors have been done and multiple approaches have been developed single methods such as ultrasonication thermal and electrolysis had insufficient oxidizing capacity enhancement of sludge dewaterability was limited and dewatering performance would be deteriorated with overtreatment bian et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 thereby these approaches have been not applied in large scale industrial chemical treatment included acid and alkali and oxidation treatment ruiz hernando et al 2014 ge et al 2020 among these methods advanced oxidation processes aops attracted more and more attention which mainly included fenton based and persulfate based oxidation characterized by hydroxyl and sulfate radicals zhen et al 2018 yu et al 2021 he et al 2015 different from physical and biological methods aops could acquire desired sludge dewatering performance by strongly oxidative free radicals and re flocculation nevertheless low ph of 2 3 was required in fenton reactions and secondary pollution might be created by iron mud and sulfide in fe persulfate systems lu et al 2003 in addition it was demonstrated that chemical treatment was of inevitably some disadvantages such as expensive cost increment of colourity of filtrate and decrement of sludge calorific value zhang et al 2019 sun et al 2018 electrochemical treatment ec sparked more and more interests to treat sludge because of no chemical addition and small footprint silva et al 2019 olvera vargas et al 2019 it was verified that ec played positive roles in improving sludge dewaterability yuan et al 2011a gharibi et al 2013 zeng et al 2019 however there was a problem that ec treatment possessed mild effectiveness in enhancing sludge dewatering properties due to low conductivity of sludge therefore it was proposed that combination of ec and other methods was a promising alternative li et al 2016 integrated electrolysis with fe 0 activated persulfate to improve sludge dewaterability and obtained optimum conditions of 4 15 g l na2s2o8 and voltage 40 v hu et al 2021 proposed a hybrid electrochemical process with ca clo 2 and specific resistance to filtration srf and cst were declined by 92 and 88 with the optimal conditions under the combined action of electrocoagulation electrooxidation and active chlorine however equipment corrosion and filter cloth clogging might be induced by addition of fe and potential production of halogen might be caused by additive ca clo 2 in actual application therefore it is imperative to exploit an effective method with no secondary pollution to enhance ec treatment activated carbon ac could serve as skeleton builder to increase sludge compressibility and hardness of sludge cake various physical conditioners such as rice husk xiong et al 2018 walnut shell liang et al 2019 lime and fly ash liang et al 2015 have been applied as skeleton builders to form permeable porous structure beneficial for drainage of water ac was widely used as adsorbent for heavy metals and organic pollutants sultana et al 2022 but there was little utilization of ac to sludge treatment yu et al 2022 applied sludge carbon to enhance sludge dewaterability herein we propose that activated carbon ac with abundant functional groups as the third electrode is exploited to strengthen capacity of electrooxidation in particular there is still a lack of available information on strengthening mechanism of ac to ec treatment and the effects of combination of ec treatment with ac ec ac on sludge dewaterability and other properties is barely known in addition given the low electrolysis efficiency caused by large electrode spacing two pairs of electrode meshes connected in parallel are proposed to increase electrolysis efficiency and reduce energy consumption the purposes of current study are to investigate effects of ec ac treatment on sludge dewaterability and optimize experimental conditions to uncover the relevant mechanism of how ec ac treatment facilitated sludge dewatering in terms of moisture distribution morphological structure rheological properties eps behaviors organic matters in sludge electrochemical analysis and cell membrane damage and to evaluate and validate the possible sludge disposal approaches through determination calorific value and heavy metals of dewatered sludge cake 2 materials and methods 2 1 municipal activated

al 2019 an icp oes agient 5110 usa was employed to detect concentrations of heavy metals in dewatered sludge the chemical speciation of heavy metals was stratified following bcr four stage sequential process yuan et al 2011b 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of sludge dewaterability during ec ac conditioning sludge filterability and dewaterability could be characterized by cst which was the time required for water in sludge to penetrate a certain distance on the filter paper while wc could more intuitively indicate sludge dewaterability dong et al 2021b the variations of sludge cst and wc under the treatment of ec and or ac were assessed in fig 1 as presented in fig 1a sludge cst showed an upward trend with the time increased under the sole electrolysis treatment specifically cst was elevated from 38 9 0 78 s to 70 4 1 41 s after electrolysis of 60 min however from fig 1b the changes of wc presented a different tendency from cst without ac addition which was decreased from 83 46 0 67 to 81 03 1 33 firstly and then was increased to 85 61 0 71 when the ec time was 60 min this manifested that electrolysis treatment improved sludge dewatering performance initially while deteriorated sludge dewaterability when ec time beyond 30 min which was ascribed to that excessive intracellular organic matters were released but not oxidized due to limited oxidation capacity of single ec treatment sludge cst was increased from 46 3 0 93 s to 67 8 1 36 s with the conditioning of ec and ac of 0 05 g g ds while wc decreased continuously from 79 87 1 60 to 72 23 1 48 this demonstrated that cst and wc did not necessarily have identical results which was because that cst represented sludge filterability while wc reflected directly sludge dewaterability in addition sludge dewatering was affected by many factors such as moisture distribution rheological behaviors eps morphological structure and etc when ac dosage was more than 0 05 g g ds an increment of cst was observed under treatment of 20 min while cst was reduced with the time over 30 min which was because intracellular organics and fine colloidal particles were released due to collapse of sludge eps structure unfavorable for sludge filterability increasing sludge cst however with the extension of time released intracellular organic matters were oxidized under the enhanced oxidation of ec ac strengthening sludge filtering and dewatering on the other hand ac as skeleton builder could provide channels for water outflow under the process of sludge dewatering in addition wc had significant difference under various ac dosage p 0 05 indicating that ac dosage exerted great significance on sludge dewaterability considering economic cost and sludge dewatering performance 30 min and 0 2 g g ds were chosen as optimal ec time and ac dosage in the presence of optimum conditions sludge cst and wc were 55 9 1 24 s and 64 3 1 23 respectively the effects of ec voltage on sludge dewatering properties in ec ac system were exhibited in fig 1c and d from fig 1c sludge cst was increased from 52 0 9 s to 73 6 3 19 s firstly at the ec voltage varied from 0 to 15 v and subsequently was reduced instead to 53 6 1 27 s when ec voltage increased to 25 v which was not agreement with the results obtained by yuan s study yuan et al 2011a the inconsistent results might be caused by the action of ac in electrolysis system in addition wc was successively reduced from 74 89 0 8 to 64 17 1 02 when ec voltage elevated from 0 to 20 v moreover a slight decrement was obtained when ec voltage further increased to 25 v this was result from the fact that more intracellular substances were released and oxidized under the higher ec voltage facilitating sludge dewatering in view of operating cost 20 v was considered as the optimal ec voltage which was far less than results of 40 v obtained in wang s study wang et al 2021 this illustrated that adding of ac strengthened ability of electrolysis to enhance sludge dewaterability and weakened energy input reducing operating expense the detailed mechanism of how ec ac treatment promote sludge dewatering properties was uncovered in the following parts 3 2 variations of sludge moisture distribution during ec ac conditioning it was generally acknowledged that bound water in sludge was difficult to remove compared with free water which was due to that bound water was bound tightly with sludge particles and eps through intermolecular forces and chemical bonds existing inside sludge flocs cai et al 2018 hence content of bound water in sludge was an important factor controlling sludge dewaterability the variations of bound water content in sludge were shown in fig 2 a and corresponding dsc endothermic curves were depicted in fig s5 after ec treatment bound water content was dropped from 2 15 0 072 g g ds in unconditioned sludge to 1 62 0 057 g g ds demonstrating that sludge flocs and eps gel like structure was destroyed when exposed to ec which led to release of partial bound water content of bound water was trifle decreased to 2 00 0 067 g g ds in sludge subjected to ac conditioning it was reported that bound water content could be lowered by addition of skeleton builders xiong et al 2018 which was agreement with our study the lowest content of bound water 0 99 0 043 g g ds in sludge was accomplished by ec ac conditioning which illustrated that ac successfully strengthened oxidation ability of ec producing more active species more sludge cells and network structure were attacked and cracked which led to release of more intracellular water promoting sludge dewatering these results indicated that amelioration of sludge dewaterability was accompanied by decrease of bound water in sludge the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution spectra of unconditioned sludge and conditioned sludge were displayed in fig 2b which could reflect water mobility in sludge it was documented that the shorter t2 the strong affinity between moisture molecules and nearby solids particles rao et al 2019 wu et al 2019b three peaks appearing in t2 distribution spectra represented three states of water occurrence corresponding to bound water mechanical bound water and free water with t2 from low to high mao et al 2016 relative percentage of three states water calculated by peak area in t2 distribution spectra were exhibited in fig s6 a decrement from 1 13 to 0 75 of bound water content was observed after ec treatment suggesting that part of sludge cells was disintegrated which induced that partial bound water was converted into mechanical bound water this could be evidenced by the fact that mechanical bound water was increased from 95 32 to 96 02 there was no remarkable variety of water mobility in sludge conditioned by ac and only a small conversion of bound water into mechanical bound water and free water was obtained after ec ac treatment there was an obvious conversion from bound water into mechanical bound water which was explained by that ac strengthened ec treatment ruptured more thoroughly sludge cells and gel like structure in conclusion mobility of water in sludge was strengthened and the amount of drainable water was elevated favorable for water solid separation and water elimination which were identical with results of dsc determination 3 3 variations of sludge morphological structure during ec ac conditioning zeta potential of sludge was a predominate factor controlling colloidal stability which exerted significant roles in sludge flocs morphology and dewatering performance liu et al 2020 it was reported that the higher absolute zeta potential the poorer sludge dewatering performance because sludge particles were more easily to agglomerate each other and be compressed under the lower absolute zeta potential in this scenario electrostatic repulsion was lower than attractive force contributing to that sludge colloids was in an unstable state which was favorable for sludge aggregating and dewatering dong et al 2021b li et al 2020b the changes of zeta potential were illustrated in fig 3 a after ec treatment zeta potential of sludge was declined from 24 29 0 49 mv to 25 73 0 61 mv which was because of release of myriads of intracellular organic matters with negative charge caused by breakage of sludge cells and colloidal structure on the other side collapse of sludge flocs exposing more surface strengthened electronegativity of sludge subjected to ec conditioning this result was similar to wang s study wang et al 2021 there was negligible change of zeta potential from 24 29 0 49 mv to 24 13 0 58 mv under the addition of ac which suggests that ac had no effect on charge in sludge it was found that zeta potential was lifted to 17 69 0 35 mv after ec ac conditioning this phenomenon was owing to that large quantity of negatively charged biopolymers were oxidized under the strengthened oxidation of ec by ac while there was no enough oxidation capacity under the single ec treatment leading to decrease of zeta potential consequently ec ac treatment facilitated sludge settleability and dewatering by reducing negative charge in sludge sludge particle size was greatly instrumental in sludge dewatering characteristics and distribution of particle size of raw and treated sludge were shown in fig 3b it was found that mean particle size d50 was slightly reduced from 44 9 0 9 μm to 43 6 1 1 μm after ec treatment and to 43 7 1 2 μm under the conditioning of ec ac it was noted that a peak appeared in particle size around 1 μm suggesting that part of small fragments was generated resulting from rupture of dense sludge flocs with the strengthened oxidation which demonstrated that ac successfully reinforced oxidative capacity of individual ec the reason why particle size did not further decrease was that ac as skeleton builder increased particle size on the other hand more organic matters were oxidized leading to the reduction of electrostatic repulsion between particles which brought about tendency of aggregation of sludge particles overall hydrophilicity of sludge was weakened via ec ac treatment by decreasing surface area exposure which facilitated the passage of water in sludge sludge surface roughness made a considerable influence on diffusivity of water in sludge during the process of mechanical dewatering which was investigated as a primary factor ma et al 2021 the detailed images of surface roughness of sludge before and after treatment were observed in fig 3c and fig s7 exhibited the specific values of sludge roughness after ec treatment the roughness was markedly elevated from 54 91 1 37 μm to 73 52 1 84 μm compared with raw sludge which was trigged by increase of specific surface area through disintegration of large sludge aggregates into small particles a decrement from 54 91 1 37 μm to 42 33 1 06 μm was observed under the action of ac which was attributed to that ac as skeleton builder could be combined with particles decreasing specific surface area roughness was further decreased to 30 92 0 77 μm under the combination of ec and ac this observation could be caused by the joint effect of stronger oxidation and skeleton construction of ac it was found that low sludge roughness corresponded to high particle size thereby promoting sludge dewatering which was in accordance with our study these results illustrated that small sludge particles and fragments were regrouped developing a network structure after ec ac treatment which increased particle size and pore size and reduced surface roughness providing large openings and channels for water outflow during mechanical compression 3 4 variations of sludge rheological behaviors during ec ac conditioning rheological properties of sludge as another key factor determining sludge dewatering were monitored to reflect sludge flowability viscosity and deformation of sludge gel like network structure wang et al 2016 flow curves obtained in steady shear tests and strain sweep curves achieved in dynamic tests of sludge before and after treatment were depicted in fig 4 table s1 presented flow behavior index n representing flowability and consistency index k characterizing viscosity calculated according to herschel bulkley equation from flow curves it was ulteriorly observed that n was trifle elevated from 0 4956 to 0 5051 and k was lowered from 0 3689 to 0 3078 after ec treatment compared with unconditioned sludge which was conflict with the results obtained in wang s study wang et al 2021 the inconsistency of results might be caused by discrepancy of sludge properties and experimental conditions with the combined conditioning of ec and ac n was further lifted to 0 5371 at the same time k was dropped to 0 2012 it has been reported that sludge with smaller k value and higher n value possessed lower viscosity and firmness and stronger newtonian fluids behaviors which facilitated sludge dewatering liang et al 2019 so ec ac treatment substantially strengthened sludge flowability and lessened sludge viscosity which made sludge was easier to dewater it was documented that the increase of flowability and decrease of viscosity could be caused by lysis of sludge cells and internal flocs and degradation of eps components wang et al 2017 therefore ec ac conditioning disrupted sludge eps gel like structure and oxidized released biopolymers which could be proved by subsequent results of eps characterization in addition adding of ac also optimized sludge rheological behaviors and ameliorated sludge dewaterability to obtain more information storage modulus g referred to energy stockpiled in sludge reflecting sludge elasticity including colloidal strength and retiform structure and loss modulus g corresponded to energy of viscous dissipation representing sludge viscosity and structure relaxation farno et al 2016 were displayed in fig 4b g and g were maintained constant when strain was less than 1 which called linear viscoelastic system lve and then g and g decreased with the increase of strain the results indicated that g and g of sludge were significantly lowered after ec ac conditioning implying that gel like structure and colloidal stability were lessened and sludge turned less viscous it was reported that the decrease of g and g was induced by solubilization of intracellular substances into outer eps layer farno et al 2016 which was supported by the results of flow curves these observations proved that ec ac treatment destroyed sludge inner colloidal structure and eps matrix and oxidized organic matters altering sludge flowability and viscosity which promoted drainage of water molecules 3 5 variations of sludge organic matters during ec ac conditioning 3 5 1 eps characterization eps were biopolymers with large molecular weight such as proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids which originated from adsorption of organic substances from wastewater and lysis and metabolism of micro organisms sheng et al 2010 these biopolymers consist of massive oxygen containing functional groups which developed a hydrated biofilm with water on sludge surface due to their high affinity with water causing sludge particles in a steady state in addition retiform structure was formed through glue between gel like eps matrix and microbial cells via complicated interactions which prevented sludge from aggregation and dewatering wei et al 2019 previous research found that eps contents and spatial distribution was closely associated with sludge rheological behaviors and physicochemical properties and thus exerted vital significance on sludge dewatering yang et al 2019 basuvaraj et al 2015 hence the contents and distribution of protein and polysaccharide in eps was investigated the profiles of protein and polysaccharide in different eps fractions were displayed in fig 5 a and b it could be observed that protein concentration in three eps layers were elevated after individual ec treatment which was because sludge microbial cells and tb eps were broken down leading to release of intracellular organics under the conditioning of ec with the presence of ac the results showed that contents of protein were lowered from 19 323 0 97 mg l to 8 072 0 45 mg l in s eps when ac dosage was increased from 0 to 0 2 g g ds while in this situation that in tb eps was similarly eliminated from 37 687 0 88 to 28 291 0 81 mg l which demonstrated that released intracellular materials were oxidized and degraded an analogous phenomenon was observed in evolutions of polysaccharide contents and distribution from fig 5b the evolutions of protein and polysaccharide in lb eps were not found to have a specific regular which was not consistent with some studies reporting that lb eps was the most important layer in determining sludge properties yu et al 2017 it was found that the total of protein and polysaccharide in three stratifications were dropped after ec ac treatment moreover it was reported that excess large molecular weight biopolymers existing in eps was positively related to poor sludge flocculation and water solids separation in sludge hu et al 2018 moreover it was proven that release of intracellular substances and eps was favorable for sludge dewatering he et al 2015 therefore ec ac treatment destroyed sludge cells solubilizing substances inside sludge floc into liquid phase and releasing intracellular and eps bound water which facilitated sludge precipitation and sludge water separation these results were agreement with above sludge physicochemical properties and dewatering performance in addition changes of organic matters in sludge cells from fig s8 supported above conclusions 3 5 2 ftir spectra ftir spectra was used to explore the disparity of organic functional group between untreated sludge and treated sludge and further understand hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of sludge various adsorption peaks corresponded to different functional groups based on past study wang et al 2009 a broad characteristic bond appearing at around 3407 cm 1 was ascribed to oh vibrations in hydroxyl functional groups two characteristic bonds at 2921 cm 1 and 2852 cm 1 were observed which ascribed to asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibration of ch in methylene group ch2 respectively two appeared peaks closed to 1654 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 were unique to protein secondary structure involving amide i and ii region in this scenario stretching vibrations and deformation of nn and nh bond were accompanied by co and cn bonds in protein the typical peak at 1234 cm 1 was derived from deformation vibration of c o in carboxylate in addition the peak observed at 1037 cm 1 was described as ring vibrations of co c and stretching vibrations of coh verifying the presence of nucleic acids and polysaccharide it could be found from fig 5c that the intensities of characteristic peaks which were related to highly hydrophilic functional groups were substantially lessened after ec ac treatment especially the peaks associated with hydroxyl protein and polysaccharide were weakened which was consistent with eps results these observations suggested that large hydrophilic organics in sludge were removed by ec ac treatment and hydrophobicity was strengthened which further demonstrated that ec ac treatment had priority in oxidation capacity than individual ec treatment 3 5 3 13c nmr spectra solid state 13c nmr spectra was utilized to obtain more information about alternations of functional groups in raw and conditioned sludge and the strength of nmr spectral signals at different chemical shifts was used to reflect levels of organic matters li et al 2021 the carbon functional groups in sludge could be split into six categories namely aromatic and olefinic c 200 160 ppm amides and carboxyl groups 160 110 ppm anomeric c 110 90 ppm o alkyl c 90 65 ppm αc of amino acids 65 45 ppm and aliphatic c 45 0 ppm maqbool et al 2020 among these carbon functional groups anomeric c and o alkyl were considered as polysaccharide while amides aromatic αc of amino acids and aliphatic c were deemed to be associated with proteins metzger et al 2009 as interpreted in fig 5d the intensities of peak signals characterizing protein and polysaccharide were weakened after ec ac treatment which was identical with results of eps and ftir these results verified again that ec ac treatment eliminated hydrophilic protein and polysaccharide and strengthened sludge hydrophobicity thereby boost water removal from sludge 3 6 overall understanding of mechanism of ec ac conditioning promoting sludge dewatering the damage of various treatment to sludge microbial cell was identified by clsm and the extent of cell cytoplasmic membrane damage could be evaluated through proportion of dead cells accounting for sum of live and inviable cells zeng et al 2019 the clsm images of sludge before and after treatment were displayed in fig 6 and percentage of inviable cells calculated in fig s10 proportion of inviable cells was elevated from 0 99 of raw sludge to 26 78 of sludge subjected to ec treatment which was further substantially climbed to 89 67 in sludge after ec ac conditioning these results demonstrated that oxidizing capacity was intensified leading to severe destruction of integrity of cytoplasmic membrane in sludge after ec ac treatment it could be implied that ec ac treatment decomposed encapsulating structure of cells in sludge matrix contributing to release of intracellular substance and water which could explain above results shown in fig 2 and fig 5 to better understand mechanism of ac to enhance ec electrochemical properties of raw and conditioned sludge were characterized and presented in fig 7 from fig 7a the peak current of cv loops of sludge was strengthened after ac addition in addition charge transfer resistance rct levels of sludge were calculated through impedance curves in fig 7b and the lower rct indicated higher conductivity xu et al 2021 the results cleared that the rct was dropped greatly from 1 88 104 ω of raw sludge to 3376 ω after adding ac revealing that ac improved conductivity of sludge which could be supported by fig 7c in fig 7c conductivity was distinctly elevated from 911 μs cm to 1105 μs cm under the addition of ac as compared with raw sludge moreover electron transport capacity of sludge samples was investigated which was the sum of eac and edc the results manifested that the eac and edc of raw sludge were 0 036 and 0 170 meq e 1 g 1 which was increased to 0 052 and 0 319 meq e 1 g 1 after ac addition hence eec was lifted from 0 206 to 0 371 meq e 1 g 1 which proved that ac intensified electron transfer capacity of sludge it was reported that the redox active of functional groups in ac contributed to the increase of electron transfer of sludge xu et al 2021 in order to deeply unveil mechanism epr was conducted and identified the presence of oxygen vacancies in ec ac system fig 8 a it was found that oxygen vacancies existing in system could enhance the ability of electron transfer of sludge choong et al 2021 furthermore it was observed that h2o2 concentration in ec ac system was enhanced compared with ec system from fig 8b above observations verified that the large quantities of oxygen containing functional groups existing in ac strengthened electron transfer capacity and conductivity of sludge and thereby addition of ac caused the appearance of oxygen vacancies promoting the production of reactive oxygen species such as h2o2 which accordingly enhanced oxidizing capacity in electrochemical system in other hand addition of ac as skeleton builder developed rigid networked structure facilitating water removal consequently sludge dewatering was ameliorated under the double action of oxidation and skeleton construction according to above discussion a joint action mechanism including strengthened oxidation and skeleton construction was proposed to clarify how ec ac treatment promoted sludge dewatering in the oxidation process ac with abundant functional groups enhanced electron transfer capacity and conductivity of sludge by forming many microelectrodes strengthening oxidizing capacity in ec system enhanced oxidation made it to destroy sludge cell membranes and collapsed eps gel like structure which led to the increases of release of intracellular organic substances and bound water in addition rheological behaviors of sludge were changed and flowability was strengthened and viscosity was weakened simultaneously released hydrophilic organic substance such as protein and polysaccharide were oxidized which strengthened sludge hydrophobicity in the skeleton construction process small flocs and fragments were regrouped and a rigid networked structure was formed by interleaving along the external surfaces of sludge which providing dehydration channels for water outflow and further release of bound water driving sludge dewatering consequently sludge dewaterability was enhanced significantly with the treatment of ec ac 3 7 environmental implications the ultimate disposal of sludge after dewatering must be taken into account to assess environmental implications and incineration and land application were two mainstream and effective approach in china first of all no potentially harmful by products were introduced into the environment by ec ac treatment in addition there was no doubt that calorific value of dewatered sludge cake treated by ec ac could be raised compared with untreated sludge because of the addition of ac with high calorific value which made sludge cake present excellent mixed fuel combustion so incineration may be an appropriate disposal way for sludge cake conditioned by ec ac land application was regarded as another effective disposal route for sludge cake in which contents of heavy metals must be considered owing to their low biodegradability and strong bioaccumulation the contents of heavy metals in dewatered sludge cake before and after treatment were shown in table 2 after ec ac treatment 10 30 removal of heavy metals as cd cr cu ni pb and zn were achieved and the concentrations of heavy metals could meet agricultural requirement agricultural a level gb4282 2018 which indicated that the sludge cake treated by ec ac may be considered in agricultural utilization in addition the harm of heavy metals to environment was closely related to chemical speciation besides total concentrations thus the alternations of chemical speciation of heavy metals before and after ec ac treatment were analyzed from fig 9 it was reported that chemical speciation of heavy metals could be classified into residual state oxidizable state reducible state and acid soluble exchangeable state yuan et al 2011b in general residual state and oxidizable state possessed strong stability while the total of reducible state with highly potential mobility and acid soluble exchangeable state with extremely strong mobility could be utilized to reflect bioavailability and toxicity of sludge cake zhang et al 2016 it was intuitively observed that the percentage of residual state fraction of pb surpassed 95 both in raw sludge cake and sludge cake treated by ec ac suggesting that pb was stable in sludge cake which would not pose threat to environment in addition the mobility of heavy metals except cu was increased under the action of ec ac which was coincidence with previous study reporting that the stability of heavy metals was weakened by oxidation treatment ge et al 2019 dong et al 2021b therefore pretreatments such as solidification and passivation might be required to reduce environmental implications as for practical application sludge dewatering performance and economic cost were taken into consideration firstly the dewatering performance of sludge after ec ac treatment is comparable to or better than that of sludge treated by other methods such as fe ii sodium percarbonate peroxide fe 0 peroxone fe iii electro fenton and etc specifically the optimal wc is 64 3 in this study while that is 68 1 after treatment of fe ii sodium percarbonate li et al 2020a 68 6 after treatment of peroxide fe 0 li et al 2020b 84 88 after treatment of peroxone fe iii gao et al 2021 65 8 after treatment of electro fenton cai et al 2019 with regard to economic cost specific energy consumption is 0 0034 kwh l and the price of electricity is 0 0933 kwh so the electricity cost of 10 57 t ds in addition the cost of ac was 60 48 t ds given the price of 302 4 per ton ac therefore the total cost is 71 05 t ds of ec ac method the total cost is 99 1 t ds of fe ii electrooxidation hu et al 2018 50 t ds of electrolysis fe 0 persulfate li 2016 and 80 2 t ds of fenton lime dai et al 2017 compared with other hybrid methods there are certain advantages of ec ac treatment in dewatering performance and economic cost moreover ac can be made of straw sludge and etc by ourselves and more energy could be produced by incineration of high calorific value biosolids favorable for resource utilization to further reduce economic cost besides ec ac treatment not only avoids addition of chemicals which will not cause secondary pollution but also reduces the possibility of equipment corrosion filter cloth clogging and increase of filtrate colourity therefore ec ac treatment is an effective environmentally friendly and promising approach for practical application 4 conclusion in this study we exploited ec ac conditioning to promote sludge dewatering and unravel relevant dewatering and strengthening mechanism firstly sludge cst and wc achieved the lowest value of 55 9 s and 64 3 after conditioned by ec voltage of 20 v and 0 2 g g ds ac for 30 min which were considered as the optimal conditions an investigation of mechanism promoting sludge dewatering implied that enhanced oxidizing capacity and skeleton construction were responsible for amelioration of sludge dewaterability ac as the third electrode enhanced electron transfer capacity and conductivity strengthening ability of oxidation of electrochemical treatment strengthened oxidation dispersed sludge flocs and disrupted eps gel like structure causing release of intracellular organic substances and water and then released organics were oxidized skeleton construction of ac developed rigid networked structure providing channels for the drainage of water removal overall ec ac treatment strengthened sludge hydrophobicity flowability drain capacity and flocculability and weakened sludge hydrophilicity viscosity colloidal forces and strength compact gel like structure which eventually promoted the improvement of sludge dewatering properties in addition ec ac treatment presented potential advantages of incineration and agricultural land utilization via analysis of calorific value and heavy

15862,sludge dewatering is an essential process for reduction of sludge volume to decrease cost of ultimate disposal in this study a novel method using activated carbon ac strengthening electrochemical ec treatment ec ac was adopted to improve greatly sludge dewaterability it was shown that capillary suction time cst and water content of dewatered sludge cake wc were reduced to 55 9 1 24 s and 64 3 1 23 respectively under the optimal conditions of ec voltage 20 v ec time 30 min and 0 2 g g dry solid ds ac ac with rich functional groups as the third electrode intensified electrooxidation by forming multiple microelectrodes and electron transfer capacity and conductivity of sludge were strengthened by ac in ec system which were illustrated by electrochemical analysis it could be found that zeta potential and particle size were increased and surface roughness was reduced after ec ac treatment intensifying sludge hydrophobicity form the results of rheological behaviors of sludge flowability was strengthened and viscosity was weakened under the conditioning of ec ac besides colloidal force and gel like network strength were lessened which was also verified by organic matters and percentage of inviable cells at the same time intracellular matters were released and degraded and bound water was released converting into free water in addition sludge compressibility and structural strength were increased and porous structure was formed facilitating water outflow via addition of mesoporous ac as skeleton builder which eventually led to an improved separation efficiency of solid water and sludge dewaterability the results of heavy metals suggested that sludge cake after ec ac treatment was favorable for land application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge dewaterability ac strengthening ec treatment electron transfer moisture distribution physicochemical properties biological characteristics 1 introduction according to statistics issued by national bureau of statistics of china annual quantity of wastewater discharged in china was increased from 32 billion m3 to 57 billion m3 and treatment rate of wastewater was elevated sharply from 36 43 to 97 53 since 2001 to 2020 national bureau of statistics 2021 as the main by products of sewage treatment waste activated sludge production increased dramatically and it was evaluated that annual sludge production would be up to 60 million tons of 80 wt water content by the year of 2020 ge et al 2020 usually produced sludge during the process of sewage treatment contains large quantities of water but sludge with high water content create a huge challenge in terms of great bulk difficulty and expensive cost in storage transport and ultimate disposal dong et al 2021a xie et al 2019 therefore sludge dewatering to reduce sludge volume is essential for improvement of disposal safety and reduction of disposal cost li et al 2020a wei et al 2018 conventional coagulants and flocculants such as ferric salts and organic flocculants have been applied to promote sludge dewatering by aggregating fine particles into large aggregates and reducing specific surface area of sludge and adsorption of water molecules wu et al 2019a liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b flocculation is easy to operate but water content of dewatered sludge after traditional flocculation is still up to 75 85 due to limited effect of single flocculants dong et al 2021a reportedly it was the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps with huge amounts of hydrophilic groups and complex retiform structure in sludge which could bind tremendous water molecules and make sludge colloids in a steady state that limited water removal in sludge wu et al 2017 cao et al 2021 hence it is necessary to disrupt sludge cells destroy stability of sludge eps colloids and collapse sludge fractal retiform structure to release bound water for promotion of sludge dewatering substantial endeavors have been done and multiple approaches have been developed single methods such as ultrasonication thermal and electrolysis had insufficient oxidizing capacity enhancement of sludge dewaterability was limited and dewatering performance would be deteriorated with overtreatment bian et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 thereby these approaches have been not applied in large scale industrial chemical treatment included acid and alkali and oxidation treatment ruiz hernando et al 2014 ge et al 2020 among these methods advanced oxidation processes aops attracted more and more attention which mainly included fenton based and persulfate based oxidation characterized by hydroxyl and sulfate radicals zhen et al 2018 yu et al 2021 he et al 2015 different from physical and biological methods aops could acquire desired sludge dewatering performance by strongly oxidative free radicals and re flocculation nevertheless low ph of 2 3 was required in fenton reactions and secondary pollution might be created by iron mud and sulfide in fe persulfate systems lu et al 2003 in addition it was demonstrated that chemical treatment was of inevitably some disadvantages such as expensive cost increment of colourity of filtrate and decrement of sludge calorific value zhang et al 2019 sun et al 2018 electrochemical treatment ec sparked more and more interests to treat sludge because of no chemical addition and small footprint silva et al 2019 olvera vargas et al 2019 it was verified that ec played positive roles in improving sludge dewaterability yuan et al 2011a gharibi et al 2013 zeng et al 2019 however there was a problem that ec treatment possessed mild effectiveness in enhancing sludge dewatering properties due to low conductivity of sludge therefore it was proposed that combination of ec and other methods was a promising alternative li et al 2016 integrated electrolysis with fe 0 activated persulfate to improve sludge dewaterability and obtained optimum conditions of 4 15 g l na2s2o8 and voltage 40 v hu et al 2021 proposed a hybrid electrochemical process with ca clo 2 and specific resistance to filtration srf and cst were declined by 92 and 88 with the optimal conditions under the combined action of electrocoagulation electrooxidation and active chlorine however equipment corrosion and filter cloth clogging might be induced by addition of fe and potential production of halogen might be caused by additive ca clo 2 in actual application therefore it is imperative to exploit an effective method with no secondary pollution to enhance ec treatment activated carbon ac could serve as skeleton builder to increase sludge compressibility and hardness of sludge cake various physical conditioners such as rice husk xiong et al 2018 walnut shell liang et al 2019 lime and fly ash liang et al 2015 have been applied as skeleton builders to form permeable porous structure beneficial for drainage of water ac was widely used as adsorbent for heavy metals and organic pollutants sultana et al 2022 but there was little utilization of ac to sludge treatment yu et al 2022 applied sludge carbon to enhance sludge dewaterability herein we propose that activated carbon ac with abundant functional groups as the third electrode is exploited to strengthen capacity of electrooxidation in particular there is still a lack of available information on strengthening mechanism of ac to ec treatment and the effects of combination of ec treatment with ac ec ac on sludge dewaterability and other properties is barely known in addition given the low electrolysis efficiency caused by large electrode spacing two pairs of electrode meshes connected in parallel are proposed to increase electrolysis efficiency and reduce energy consumption the purposes of current study are to investigate effects of ec ac treatment on sludge dewaterability and optimize experimental conditions to uncover the relevant mechanism of how ec ac treatment facilitated sludge dewatering in terms of moisture distribution morphological structure rheological properties eps behaviors organic matters in sludge electrochemical analysis and cell membrane damage and to evaluate and validate the possible sludge disposal approaches through determination calorific value and heavy metals of dewatered sludge cake 2 materials and methods 2 1 municipal activated

al 2019 an icp oes agient 5110 usa was employed to detect concentrations of heavy metals in dewatered sludge the chemical speciation of heavy metals was stratified following bcr four stage sequential process yuan et al 2011b 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of sludge dewaterability during ec ac conditioning sludge filterability and dewaterability could be characterized by cst which was the time required for water in sludge to penetrate a certain distance on the filter paper while wc could more intuitively indicate sludge dewaterability dong et al 2021b the variations of sludge cst and wc under the treatment of ec and or ac were assessed in fig 1 as presented in fig 1a sludge cst showed an upward trend with the time increased under the sole electrolysis treatment specifically cst was elevated from 38 9 0 78 s to 70 4 1 41 s after electrolysis of 60 min however from fig 1b the changes of wc presented a different tendency from cst without ac addition which was decreased from 83 46 0 67 to 81 03 1 33 firstly and then was increased to 85 61 0 71 when the ec time was 60 min this manifested that electrolysis treatment improved sludge dewatering performance initially while deteriorated sludge dewaterability when ec time beyond 30 min which was ascribed to that excessive intracellular organic matters were released but not oxidized due to limited oxidation capacity of single ec treatment sludge cst was increased from 46 3 0 93 s to 67 8 1 36 s with the conditioning of ec and ac of 0 05 g g ds while wc decreased continuously from 79 87 1 60 to 72 23 1 48 this demonstrated that cst and wc did not necessarily have identical results which was because that cst represented sludge filterability while wc reflected directly sludge dewaterability in addition sludge dewatering was affected by many factors such as moisture distribution rheological behaviors eps morphological structure and etc when ac dosage was more than 0 05 g g ds an increment of cst was observed under treatment of 20 min while cst was reduced with the time over 30 min which was because intracellular organics and fine colloidal particles were released due to collapse of sludge eps structure unfavorable for sludge filterability increasing sludge cst however with the extension of time released intracellular organic matters were oxidized under the enhanced oxidation of ec ac strengthening sludge filtering and dewatering on the other hand ac as skeleton builder could provide channels for water outflow under the process of sludge dewatering in addition wc had significant difference under various ac dosage p 0 05 indicating that ac dosage exerted great significance on sludge dewaterability considering economic cost and sludge dewatering performance 30 min and 0 2 g g ds were chosen as optimal ec time and ac dosage in the presence of optimum conditions sludge cst and wc were 55 9 1 24 s and 64 3 1 23 respectively the effects of ec voltage on sludge dewatering properties in ec ac system were exhibited in fig 1c and d from fig 1c sludge cst was increased from 52 0 9 s to 73 6 3 19 s firstly at the ec voltage varied from 0 to 15 v and subsequently was reduced instead to 53 6 1 27 s when ec voltage increased to 25 v which was not agreement with the results obtained by yuan s study yuan et al 2011a the inconsistent results might be caused by the action of ac in electrolysis system in addition wc was successively reduced from 74 89 0 8 to 64 17 1 02 when ec voltage elevated from 0 to 20 v moreover a slight decrement was obtained when ec voltage further increased to 25 v this was result from the fact that more intracellular substances were released and oxidized under the higher ec voltage facilitating sludge dewatering in view of operating cost 20 v was considered as the optimal ec voltage which was far less than results of 40 v obtained in wang s study wang et al 2021 this illustrated that adding of ac strengthened ability of electrolysis to enhance sludge dewaterability and weakened energy input reducing operating expense the detailed mechanism of how ec ac treatment promote sludge dewatering properties was uncovered in the following parts 3 2 variations of sludge moisture distribution during ec ac conditioning it was generally acknowledged that bound water in sludge was difficult to remove compared with free water which was due to that bound water was bound tightly with sludge particles and eps through intermolecular forces and chemical bonds existing inside sludge flocs cai et al 2018 hence content of bound water in sludge was an important factor controlling sludge dewaterability the variations of bound water content in sludge were shown in fig 2 a and corresponding dsc endothermic curves were depicted in fig s5 after ec treatment bound water content was dropped from 2 15 0 072 g g ds in unconditioned sludge to 1 62 0 057 g g ds demonstrating that sludge flocs and eps gel like structure was destroyed when exposed to ec which led to release of partial bound water content of bound water was trifle decreased to 2 00 0 067 g g ds in sludge subjected to ac conditioning it was reported that bound water content could be lowered by addition of skeleton builders xiong et al 2018 which was agreement with our study the lowest content of bound water 0 99 0 043 g g ds in sludge was accomplished by ec ac conditioning which illustrated that ac successfully strengthened oxidation ability of ec producing more active species more sludge cells and network structure were attacked and cracked which led to release of more intracellular water promoting sludge dewatering these results indicated that amelioration of sludge dewaterability was accompanied by decrease of bound water in sludge the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution spectra of unconditioned sludge and conditioned sludge were displayed in fig 2b which could reflect water mobility in sludge it was documented that the shorter t2 the strong affinity between moisture molecules and nearby solids particles rao et al 2019 wu et al 2019b three peaks appearing in t2 distribution spectra represented three states of water occurrence corresponding to bound water mechanical bound water and free water with t2 from low to high mao et al 2016 relative percentage of three states water calculated by peak area in t2 distribution spectra were exhibited in fig s6 a decrement from 1 13 to 0 75 of bound water content was observed after ec treatment suggesting that part of sludge cells was disintegrated which induced that partial bound water was converted into mechanical bound water this could be evidenced by the fact that mechanical bound water was increased from 95 32 to 96 02 there was no remarkable variety of water mobility in sludge conditioned by ac and only a small conversion of bound water into mechanical bound water and free water was obtained after ec ac treatment there was an obvious conversion from bound water into mechanical bound water which was explained by that ac strengthened ec treatment ruptured more thoroughly sludge cells and gel like structure in conclusion mobility of water in sludge was strengthened and the amount of drainable water was elevated favorable for water solid separation and water elimination which were identical with results of dsc determination 3 3 variations of sludge morphological structure during ec ac conditioning zeta potential of sludge was a predominate factor controlling colloidal stability which exerted significant roles in sludge flocs morphology and dewatering performance liu et al 2020 it was reported that the higher absolute zeta potential the poorer sludge dewatering performance because sludge particles were more easily to agglomerate each other and be compressed under the lower absolute zeta potential in this scenario electrostatic repulsion was lower than attractive force contributing to that sludge colloids was in an unstable state which was favorable for sludge aggregating and dewatering dong et al 2021b li et al 2020b the changes of zeta potential were illustrated in fig 3 a after ec treatment zeta potential of sludge was declined from 24 29 0 49 mv to 25 73 0 61 mv which was because of release of myriads of intracellular organic matters with negative charge caused by breakage of sludge cells and colloidal structure on the other side collapse of sludge flocs exposing more surface strengthened electronegativity of sludge subjected to ec conditioning this result was similar to wang s study wang et al 2021 there was negligible change of zeta potential from 24 29 0 49 mv to 24 13 0 58 mv under the addition of ac which suggests that ac had no effect on charge in sludge it was found that zeta potential was lifted to 17 69 0 35 mv after ec ac conditioning this phenomenon was owing to that large quantity of negatively charged biopolymers were oxidized under the strengthened oxidation of ec by ac while there was no enough oxidation capacity under the single ec treatment leading to decrease of zeta potential consequently ec ac treatment facilitated sludge settleability and dewatering by reducing negative charge in sludge sludge particle size was greatly instrumental in sludge dewatering characteristics and distribution of particle size of raw and treated sludge were shown in fig 3b it was found that mean particle size d50 was slightly reduced from 44 9 0 9 μm to 43 6 1 1 μm after ec treatment and to 43 7 1 2 μm under the conditioning of ec ac it was noted that a peak appeared in particle size around 1 μm suggesting that part of small fragments was generated resulting from rupture of dense sludge flocs with the strengthened oxidation which demonstrated that ac successfully reinforced oxidative capacity of individual ec the reason why particle size did not further decrease was that ac as skeleton builder increased particle size on the other hand more organic matters were oxidized leading to the reduction of electrostatic repulsion between particles which brought about tendency of aggregation of sludge particles overall hydrophilicity of sludge was weakened via ec ac treatment by decreasing surface area exposure which facilitated the passage of water in sludge sludge surface roughness made a considerable influence on diffusivity of water in sludge during the process of mechanical dewatering which was investigated as a primary factor ma et al 2021 the detailed images of surface roughness of sludge before and after treatment were observed in fig 3c and fig s7 exhibited the specific values of sludge roughness after ec treatment the roughness was markedly elevated from 54 91 1 37 μm to 73 52 1 84 μm compared with raw sludge which was trigged by increase of specific surface area through disintegration of large sludge aggregates into small particles a decrement from 54 91 1 37 μm to 42 33 1 06 μm was observed under the action of ac which was attributed to that ac as skeleton builder could be combined with particles decreasing specific surface area roughness was further decreased to 30 92 0 77 μm under the combination of ec and ac this observation could be caused by the joint effect of stronger oxidation and skeleton construction of ac it was found that low sludge roughness corresponded to high particle size thereby promoting sludge dewatering which was in accordance with our study these results illustrated that small sludge particles and fragments were regrouped developing a network structure after ec ac treatment which increased particle size and pore size and reduced surface roughness providing large openings and channels for water outflow during mechanical compression 3 4 variations of sludge rheological behaviors during ec ac conditioning rheological properties of sludge as another key factor determining sludge dewatering were monitored to reflect sludge flowability viscosity and deformation of sludge gel like network structure wang et al 2016 flow curves obtained in steady shear tests and strain sweep curves achieved in dynamic tests of sludge before and after treatment were depicted in fig 4 table s1 presented flow behavior index n representing flowability and consistency index k characterizing viscosity calculated according to herschel bulkley equation from flow curves it was ulteriorly observed that n was trifle elevated from 0 4956 to 0 5051 and k was lowered from 0 3689 to 0 3078 after ec treatment compared with unconditioned sludge which was conflict with the results obtained in wang s study wang et al 2021 the inconsistency of results might be caused by discrepancy of sludge properties and experimental conditions with the combined conditioning of ec and ac n was further lifted to 0 5371 at the same time k was dropped to 0 2012 it has been reported that sludge with smaller k value and higher n value possessed lower viscosity and firmness and stronger newtonian fluids behaviors which facilitated sludge dewatering liang et al 2019 so ec ac treatment substantially strengthened sludge flowability and lessened sludge viscosity which made sludge was easier to dewater it was documented that the increase of flowability and decrease of viscosity could be caused by lysis of sludge cells and internal flocs and degradation of eps components wang et al 2017 therefore ec ac conditioning disrupted sludge eps gel like structure and oxidized released biopolymers which could be proved by subsequent results of eps characterization in addition adding of ac also optimized sludge rheological behaviors and ameliorated sludge dewaterability to obtain more information storage modulus g referred to energy stockpiled in sludge reflecting sludge elasticity including colloidal strength and retiform structure and loss modulus g corresponded to energy of viscous dissipation representing sludge viscosity and structure relaxation farno et al 2016 were displayed in fig 4b g and g were maintained constant when strain was less than 1 which called linear viscoelastic system lve and then g and g decreased with the increase of strain the results indicated that g and g of sludge were significantly lowered after ec ac conditioning implying that gel like structure and colloidal stability were lessened and sludge turned less viscous it was reported that the decrease of g and g was induced by solubilization of intracellular substances into outer eps layer farno et al 2016 which was supported by the results of flow curves these observations proved that ec ac treatment destroyed sludge inner colloidal structure and eps matrix and oxidized organic matters altering sludge flowability and viscosity which promoted drainage of water molecules 3 5 variations of sludge organic matters during ec ac conditioning 3 5 1 eps characterization eps were biopolymers with large molecular weight such as proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids which originated from adsorption of organic substances from wastewater and lysis and metabolism of micro organisms sheng et al 2010 these biopolymers consist of massive oxygen containing functional groups which developed a hydrated biofilm with water on sludge surface due to their high affinity with water causing sludge particles in a steady state in addition retiform structure was formed through glue between gel like eps matrix and microbial cells via complicated interactions which prevented sludge from aggregation and dewatering wei et al 2019 previous research found that eps contents and spatial distribution was closely associated with sludge rheological behaviors and physicochemical properties and thus exerted vital significance on sludge dewatering yang et al 2019 basuvaraj et al 2015 hence the contents and distribution of protein and polysaccharide in eps was investigated the profiles of protein and polysaccharide in different eps fractions were displayed in fig 5 a and b it could be observed that protein concentration in three eps layers were elevated after individual ec treatment which was because sludge microbial cells and tb eps were broken down leading to release of intracellular organics under the conditioning of ec with the presence of ac the results showed that contents of protein were lowered from 19 323 0 97 mg l to 8 072 0 45 mg l in s eps when ac dosage was increased from 0 to 0 2 g g ds while in this situation that in tb eps was similarly eliminated from 37 687 0 88 to 28 291 0 81 mg l which demonstrated that released intracellular materials were oxidized and degraded an analogous phenomenon was observed in evolutions of polysaccharide contents and distribution from fig 5b the evolutions of protein and polysaccharide in lb eps were not found to have a specific regular which was not consistent with some studies reporting that lb eps was the most important layer in determining sludge properties yu et al 2017 it was found that the total of protein and polysaccharide in three stratifications were dropped after ec ac treatment moreover it was reported that excess large molecular weight biopolymers existing in eps was positively related to poor sludge flocculation and water solids separation in sludge hu et al 2018 moreover it was proven that release of intracellular substances and eps was favorable for sludge dewatering he et al 2015 therefore ec ac treatment destroyed sludge cells solubilizing substances inside sludge floc into liquid phase and releasing intracellular and eps bound water which facilitated sludge precipitation and sludge water separation these results were agreement with above sludge physicochemical properties and dewatering performance in addition changes of organic matters in sludge cells from fig s8 supported above conclusions 3 5 2 ftir spectra ftir spectra was used to explore the disparity of organic functional group between untreated sludge and treated sludge and further understand hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of sludge various adsorption peaks corresponded to different functional groups based on past study wang et al 2009 a broad characteristic bond appearing at around 3407 cm 1 was ascribed to oh vibrations in hydroxyl functional groups two characteristic bonds at 2921 cm 1 and 2852 cm 1 were observed which ascribed to asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibration of ch in methylene group ch2 respectively two appeared peaks closed to 1654 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 were unique to protein secondary structure involving amide i and ii region in this scenario stretching vibrations and deformation of nn and nh bond were accompanied by co and cn bonds in protein the typical peak at 1234 cm 1 was derived from deformation vibration of c o in carboxylate in addition the peak observed at 1037 cm 1 was described as ring vibrations of co c and stretching vibrations of coh verifying the presence of nucleic acids and polysaccharide it could be found from fig 5c that the intensities of characteristic peaks which were related to highly hydrophilic functional groups were substantially lessened after ec ac treatment especially the peaks associated with hydroxyl protein and polysaccharide were weakened which was consistent with eps results these observations suggested that large hydrophilic organics in sludge were removed by ec ac treatment and hydrophobicity was strengthened which further demonstrated that ec ac treatment had priority in oxidation capacity than individual ec treatment 3 5 3 13c nmr spectra solid state 13c nmr spectra was utilized to obtain more information about alternations of functional groups in raw and conditioned sludge and the strength of nmr spectral signals at different chemical shifts was used to reflect levels of organic matters li et al 2021 the carbon functional groups in sludge could be split into six categories namely aromatic and olefinic c 200 160 ppm amides and carboxyl groups 160 110 ppm anomeric c 110 90 ppm o alkyl c 90 65 ppm αc of amino acids 65 45 ppm and aliphatic c 45 0 ppm maqbool et al 2020 among these carbon functional groups anomeric c and o alkyl were considered as polysaccharide while amides aromatic αc of amino acids and aliphatic c were deemed to be associated with proteins metzger et al 2009 as interpreted in fig 5d the intensities of peak signals characterizing protein and polysaccharide were weakened after ec ac treatment which was identical with results of eps and ftir these results verified again that ec ac treatment eliminated hydrophilic protein and polysaccharide and strengthened sludge hydrophobicity thereby boost water removal from sludge 3 6 overall understanding of mechanism of ec ac conditioning promoting sludge dewatering the damage of various treatment to sludge microbial cell was identified by clsm and the extent of cell cytoplasmic membrane damage could be evaluated through proportion of dead cells accounting for sum of live and inviable cells zeng et al 2019 the clsm images of sludge before and after treatment were displayed in fig 6 and percentage of inviable cells calculated in fig s10 proportion of inviable cells was elevated from 0 99 of raw sludge to 26 78 of sludge subjected to ec treatment which was further substantially climbed to 89 67 in sludge after ec ac conditioning these results demonstrated that oxidizing capacity was intensified leading to severe destruction of integrity of cytoplasmic membrane in sludge after ec ac treatment it could be implied that ec ac treatment decomposed encapsulating structure of cells in sludge matrix contributing to release of intracellular substance and water which could explain above results shown in fig 2 and fig 5 to better understand mechanism of ac to enhance ec electrochemical properties of raw and conditioned sludge were characterized and presented in fig 7 from fig 7a the peak current of cv loops of sludge was strengthened after ac addition in addition charge transfer resistance rct levels of sludge were calculated through impedance curves in fig 7b and the lower rct indicated higher conductivity xu et al 2021 the results cleared that the rct was dropped greatly from 1 88 104 ω of raw sludge to 3376 ω after adding ac revealing that ac improved conductivity of sludge which could be supported by fig 7c in fig 7c conductivity was distinctly elevated from 911 μs cm to 1105 μs cm under the addition of ac as compared with raw sludge moreover electron transport capacity of sludge samples was investigated which was the sum of eac and edc the results manifested that the eac and edc of raw sludge were 0 036 and 0 170 meq e 1 g 1 which was increased to 0 052 and 0 319 meq e 1 g 1 after ac addition hence eec was lifted from 0 206 to 0 371 meq e 1 g 1 which proved that ac intensified electron transfer capacity of sludge it was reported that the redox active of functional groups in ac contributed to the increase of electron transfer of sludge xu et al 2021 in order to deeply unveil mechanism epr was conducted and identified the presence of oxygen vacancies in ec ac system fig 8 a it was found that oxygen vacancies existing in system could enhance the ability of electron transfer of sludge choong et al 2021 furthermore it was observed that h2o2 concentration in ec ac system was enhanced compared with ec system from fig 8b above observations verified that the large quantities of oxygen containing functional groups existing in ac strengthened electron transfer capacity and conductivity of sludge and thereby addition of ac caused the appearance of oxygen vacancies promoting the production of reactive oxygen species such as h2o2 which accordingly enhanced oxidizing capacity in electrochemical system in other hand addition of ac as skeleton builder developed rigid networked structure facilitating water removal consequently sludge dewatering was ameliorated under the double action of oxidation and skeleton construction according to above discussion a joint action mechanism including strengthened oxidation and skeleton construction was proposed to clarify how ec ac treatment promoted sludge dewatering in the oxidation process ac with abundant functional groups enhanced electron transfer capacity and conductivity of sludge by forming many microelectrodes strengthening oxidizing capacity in ec system enhanced oxidation made it to destroy sludge cell membranes and collapsed eps gel like structure which led to the increases of release of intracellular organic substances and bound water in addition rheological behaviors of sludge were changed and flowability was strengthened and viscosity was weakened simultaneously released hydrophilic organic substance such as protein and polysaccharide were oxidized which strengthened sludge hydrophobicity in the skeleton construction process small flocs and fragments were regrouped and a rigid networked structure was formed by interleaving along the external surfaces of sludge which providing dehydration channels for water outflow and further release of bound water driving sludge dewatering consequently sludge dewaterability was enhanced significantly with the treatment of ec ac 3 7 environmental implications the ultimate disposal of sludge after dewatering must be taken into account to assess environmental implications and incineration and land application were two mainstream and effective approach in china first of all no potentially harmful by products were introduced into the environment by ec ac treatment in addition there was no doubt that calorific value of dewatered sludge cake treated by ec ac could be raised compared with untreated sludge because of the addition of ac with high calorific value which made sludge cake present excellent mixed fuel combustion so incineration may be an appropriate disposal way for sludge cake conditioned by ec ac land application was regarded as another effective disposal route for sludge cake in which contents of heavy metals must be considered owing to their low biodegradability and strong bioaccumulation the contents of heavy metals in dewatered sludge cake before and after treatment were shown in table 2 after ec ac treatment 10 30 removal of heavy metals as cd cr cu ni pb and zn were achieved and the concentrations of heavy metals could meet agricultural requirement agricultural a level gb4282 2018 which indicated that the sludge cake treated by ec ac may be considered in agricultural utilization in addition the harm of heavy metals to environment was closely related to chemical speciation besides total concentrations thus the alternations of chemical speciation of heavy metals before and after ec ac treatment were analyzed from fig 9 it was reported that chemical speciation of heavy metals could be classified into residual state oxidizable state reducible state and acid soluble exchangeable state yuan et al 2011b in general residual state and oxidizable state possessed strong stability while the total of reducible state with highly potential mobility and acid soluble exchangeable state with extremely strong mobility could be utilized to reflect bioavailability and toxicity of sludge cake zhang et al 2016 it was intuitively observed that the percentage of residual state fraction of pb surpassed 95 both in raw sludge cake and sludge cake treated by ec ac suggesting that pb was stable in sludge cake which would not pose threat to environment in addition the mobility of heavy metals except cu was increased under the action of ec ac which was coincidence with previous study reporting that the stability of heavy metals was weakened by oxidation treatment ge et al 2019 dong et al 2021b therefore pretreatments such as solidification and passivation might be required to reduce environmental implications as for practical application sludge dewatering performance and economic cost were taken into consideration firstly the dewatering performance of sludge after ec ac treatment is comparable to or better than that of sludge treated by other methods such as fe ii sodium percarbonate peroxide fe 0 peroxone fe iii electro fenton and etc specifically the optimal wc is 64 3 in this study while that is 68 1 after treatment of fe ii sodium percarbonate li et al 2020a 68 6 after treatment of peroxide fe 0 li et al 2020b 84 88 after treatment of peroxone fe iii gao et al 2021 65 8 after treatment of electro fenton cai et al 2019 with regard to economic cost specific energy consumption is 0 0034 kwh l and the price of electricity is 0 0933 kwh so the electricity cost of 10 57 t ds in addition the cost of ac was 60 48 t ds given the price of 302 4 per ton ac therefore the total cost is 71 05 t ds of ec ac method the total cost is 99 1 t ds of fe ii electrooxidation hu et al 2018 50 t ds of electrolysis fe 0 persulfate li 2016 and 80 2 t ds of fenton lime dai et al 2017 compared with other hybrid methods there are certain advantages of ec ac treatment in dewatering performance and economic cost moreover ac can be made of straw sludge and etc by ourselves and more energy could be produced by incineration of high calorific value biosolids favorable for resource utilization to further reduce economic cost besides ec ac treatment not only avoids addition of chemicals which will not cause secondary pollution but also reduces the possibility of equipment corrosion filter cloth clogging and increase of filtrate colourity therefore ec ac treatment is an effective environmentally friendly and promising approach for practical application 4 conclusion in this study we exploited ec ac conditioning to promote sludge dewatering and unravel relevant dewatering and strengthening mechanism firstly sludge cst and wc achieved the lowest value of 55 9 s and 64 3 after conditioned by ec voltage of 20 v and 0 2 g g ds ac for 30 min which were considered as the optimal conditions an investigation of mechanism promoting sludge dewatering implied that enhanced oxidizing capacity and skeleton construction were responsible for amelioration of sludge dewaterability ac as the third electrode enhanced electron transfer capacity and conductivity strengthening ability of oxidation of electrochemical treatment strengthened oxidation dispersed sludge flocs and disrupted eps gel like structure causing release of intracellular organic substances and water and then released organics were oxidized skeleton construction of ac developed rigid networked structure providing channels for the drainage of water removal overall ec ac treatment strengthened sludge hydrophobicity flowability drain capacity and flocculability and weakened sludge hydrophilicity viscosity colloidal forces and strength compact gel like structure which eventually promoted the improvement of sludge dewatering properties in addition ec ac treatment presented potential advantages of incineration and agricultural land utilization via analysis of calorific value and heavy

15863,shale gas wastewater sgw has great potential for the recovery of valuable elements but it also poses risks in terms of environmental pollution with heavy metals and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm being of major concerns however many of these species have not been fully determined for the first time we identify the elements present in sgw from the sichuan basin and consequently draw a comprehensive periodic table including 71 elements in 15 iupac groups based on it we analyze the elements possessing recycling opportunities or with risk potentials most of the metal elements in sgw exist at very low concentrations 0 2 mg l including rare earth elements revealing poor economic feasibility for recovery however salts strontium sr lithium li and gallium ga are in higher concentrations and have impressive market demands hence great potential to be recovered as for environmental burdens related to raw sgw management salinity f cl br no3 ba b and fe cu as mn v and mo pose relatively higher threats in view of the concentrations and toxicity the radioactivity is also much higher than the safety range with the gross α activity and gross β activity in sgw ranging from 3 71 83 4 bq l and 1 62 18 7 bq l respectively and radium 226 as the main component the advanced combined process pretreatment disk tube reverse osmosis dtro with pilot scale is evaluated for the safe reuse of sgw this process has high efficiency in the removal of metals and total radioactivity however the gross α activity of the effluent 1 3 bq l is slightly higher than the standard for discharge 1 bq l which is thus associated with potential long term environmental hazards graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords shale gas wastewater sgw heavy metal elements naturally occurring radioactive material norm safe disposal resources recovery 1 introduction abundant reserves of unconventional shale oil and gas have profoundly affected the energy landscape in china mayfield et al 2019 although the extraction of shale gas in china started 10 years later than that in the united states china is witnessing a shale gas boom and has become the third largest shale gas producer in the world the sichuan basin is the most active and commercially mature shale gas region in china fuling weiyuan changning and zhaotong are the four major shale gas blocks in the sichuan basin wei et al 2021 horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques for shale gas extraction rely heavily on water consumption as 20 000 to 50 000 m3 water is needed for the exploitation of each well in the sichuan basin liu et al 2022 a fraction of 15 50 of injected water returns to the surface and generates a large amount of shale gas wastewater sgw the composition of sgw is very complex due to the long term interaction with the formation brine containing high levels of total dissolved solids tds diverse metal elements a variety of organic compounds and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm chang et al 2019a huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 sun et al 2021 tang et al 2020 xie et al 2022 zhong et al 2021 the new developments to rational sgw management comprise not only the removal of these contaminants but also the recycling of valuable metals potentially contributing to economic benefits and meeting strategic needs however up to now the types and concentrations of valuable metal elements in sgw have not been comprehensively analyzed studies only reported that sodium chloride lithium li uranium u or rare earth elements might have resource recovery potential chang et al 2019b emmons et al 2022 kumar et al 2019 tian et al 2020 however the economic feasibility of the recovery of valuable metals from sgw has not been studied this feasibility is determined by the concentration market price extraction cost and market demand of each element shahmansouri et al 2015 reports on the adverse effects of shale gas extraction on infant health currie et al 2017 and the contamination of sgw to local ecosystems from poor management have raised public concerns kondash et al 2018 it is necessary to comprehensively detect harmful substances in sgw especially heavy metals and norm heavy metals are among the pollutants that disrupt the ecological balance of water soil and air cr as cd hg pb are typically hazardous heavy metals with high ecotoxicity which have been detected in sgw of the marcellus shale chang et al 2019a zhong et al 2021 bakken shale lauer et al 2016 xiao 2021 and denver julesburg dj basin rosenblum et al 2017 in the u s their concentrations vary greatly bdl to greater than 1 mg l in different shale gas regions due to the different geochemical characteristics of shale formations and brine however the analysis of heavy metals in sgw from the sichuan basin is very limited and their environmental impacts and health risks have not been assessed the same conclusion can be drawn for norm sgw often contains radionuclides from shale formations including α particles β particles potassium 40k radium 226ra and 228ra cesium 137cs lead 212pb polonium 210po thorium 228th 230th and 232th and uranium 234u 235u and 238u sun et al 2019 however only one work ni et al 2018 has reported the radioactivity of 226ra and 228ra in sgw from weiyuan in the sichuan basin in the u s norm and their environmental risk assessment in shale gas regions have been determined in the marcellus shale blondes et al 2018 geeza et al 2018 gusa and vidic 2019 mehta and kocar 2019 bakken shale lauer et al 2016 xiao 2021 and dj basin rosenblum et al 2017 it was found that each radionuclide in the dj basin was much lower than that in the marcellus shale or bakken shale long term exposure to radioactivity can cause major environmental and health problems geeza et al 2018 gusa and vidic 2019 mcmahon et al 2019 sun et al 2019 therefore comprehensive detection of the radioactivity of sgw is necessary in the sichuan basin together with assessment of potential associated risks given the high risks associated to sgw management the wide consensus is that it needs to be treated before discharge however despite increasingly stringent standards treated effluents may still contain salinity or halides heavy metals or radionuclides that are then released into surface waters research reports have proven that the salinity of the receiving streams and the radioactivity of its sediments can increase resulting to metals and radium bioenrichment or even contaminating urban drinking water in pennsylvania geeza et al 2018 warner et al 2013 therefore the detection of water quality including heavy metals and norm in the effluents from treatment facilities is also of vital importance before reuse or discharge an effort that however has been vastly neglected so far in this work we analyze sgw from five wells in different locations of weiyuan and changning blocks in the sichuan basin china general water quality metals and radionuclides are comprehensively reported to systematically evaluate the resource potential and safety of sgw moreover a combined pretreatment disk tube reverse osmosis dtro treatment process is constructed with the goal of sgw treatment in weiyuan shale gas block and the quality of its effluent is comprehensively analyzed to evaluate its safety for reuse or discharge our study also establishes a method to comprehensively assess the inorganic characteristics resource potential and safety suitable for other kinds of wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and description of the pilot scale treatment facility five sgw samples from different shale gas blocks in the sichuan basin were collected for detection in 2021 two of the water samples were from the changning shale gas block denoted as c1 and c2 c1 was obtained from yuhua village in gongxian county and c2 was from leijiawan village in gongxian county other three water samples were collected from

the raw sgw sample w3 was treated by this combined system and the effluent of dtro was denoted as w3 dtro all water samples were preserved in sealed plastic buckets and transported to the laboratory 2 days after collection for analysis each sample was quantified with different instruments to analyze the general quality metal elements concentrations and norm radioactivity fig 1c before analysis all

chromatographic columns after filtration of the samples with 0 45 μm filters and 100 dilution for the raw sgw or no dilution for w3 dtro the qualitative and quantitative analysis of 57 trace metals and 4 non metal elements total contents in aqueous samples was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 1000 g perkin elmer waltham ma samples were prepared in acid washed glass bottles prior to measurements 13 5 ml of each sample was digested with 1 5 ml of nitric acid 69 3 ups kelong chemical co ltd chengdu china for 8 min at 130 c 5 min at 150 c and 5 min at 180 c no suspended solids were observed after digestion and holding for at least 12 h therefore filtration was not required a field blank was also prepared using the same method used for the samples at the beginning of the measurement three cleaning blanks of 2 nitric acid were run to clear any residual contamination from previous runs additionally two cleaning blanks were run between every sample to ensure no crossover between samples and no build up of contamination within the machine at least two parallel measurements were run for each sample to take the average result the concentrations of elements in the field blank were subtracted to get the final results the detection limits of the elements measured by ipc ms in this study are given in table s2 supporting information si concentrations were reported if the analysis results met the routinely determined and evaluated quality control parameters table s3 2 3 norm analysis six water samples of 10 l each for radionuclide analysis were collected in polyethylene containers and sent to the analytical laboratory of beijing research institute of uranium geology for norm detection the gross α and β activities were determined on the alpha beta counters mpc9604 ortec tennessee usa according to the standards of ej t 1075 1998 and ej t 900 1994 separately the concentrations of uranium u and thorium th were obtained with icp ms as discussed above following the guide of water quality determination of 65 elements inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hj 700 2014 the radioactivity of potassium 40 40k

cesium 137 137cs cobalt 60 60co and radium 228 228ra were determined on high purity germanium hpge γ spectroscopy counted 580 000 s with the volume of 0 2 l referring to the standard of determination

counters with the guide of ej t 859 1994 polonium 210 210po 234u 238u and 230th 232th were measured with α spectroscopy octe plus by gb t 13 071 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 general quality of sgw and major ions the general water quality and concentrations of major cations and anions in raw sgw samples in the sichuan basin are presented in table s1 si the tds and doc levels were similar to those commonly reported in other research chang et al 2019a huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 tang et al 2020 2021 zhong et al 2021 with tds values between 13 730 mg l c2 and 31 090 mg l c1 and with relatively low doc levels of 4 26 c1 to 26 8 mg l c2 the main inorganic ions in sgw were na and cl which accounted for 80 95 of the total tds ca2 ba2 sr2 and mg2 were major divalent cations li 11 5 33 7 mg l was also in medium to high concentrations which may be considered to have recycling potential kumar et al 2019 and this topic will be discussed in the next section br was another important anion accounting for 0 4 0 6 of tds generally these concentrations were in the same range as those reported before relative to sgw in the sichuan basin chang et al 2019a huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 2021 shang et al 2020 tang et al 2020 2021 zhong et al 2021 we also report the data associated with the shale gas regions of bakken dj basin and marcellus in the u s for comparison although the salinity and organics content in different regions are largely different the main ion composition is the same 3 2 potential to valuable elements recovery based on the analyses conducted for major ions table s1 trace metals tables s4 s5 and non metals table s6 the average concentration ranges of 71 elements in 15 iupac groups in raw sgw samples c1 c2 w1 w2 w3 are summarized in fig 2 a except for the known dominant elements other metal elements that existed in sgw are in low concentrations bdl 2 mg l among them the elements ag al au be bi pb se sn hf hg ir nb ta te pt pd in zr zn as well as some rare earth elements e g ce were below the detection limits hence unrecoverable other valuable metals such as li uranium u and other rare earth elements were found at diverse concentrations in order to assess their recovery potential the average concentrations and market prices tables s7 si of the elements higher than detection limits are provided in fig 3 a summaries 2021 https en institut seltene erden de aktuelle preise von seltenen erden generally speaking the concentration market price and extraction cost determine the economic feasibility of recovering an element from sgw as illustrated by shahmansouri et al 2015 in this study for simplicity the extraction cost ratio is normalized to 1 for all elements thus if the product cost market price average concentration in sgw of an element is greater than 1 it means that the extraction of this element from sgw may be economically feasible in fig 3a the elements represented by red dots may be potentially recovered with economic feasibility and the dots placed in the top right corner represent the most economical conditions although many kinds of metal elements were contained in sgw from the practical point of view only a limited number may be feasibly recovered the recovery of na mg ca ba k and useful nonmetal elements e g br which were found in high concentrations in sgw is technically feasible as that used for seawater and brine at the same time these elements are in high market demand illustrating that they are suitable and promising for extraction from sgw sr and li were also in medium to high concentrations as well as in high demand however their extraction method from sgw is currently being studied and not mature yet electrochemical separation adsorption and integrated system with membrane processes are regarded as the most promising techniques kumar et al 2019 boron b and silicon si are rarely recycled from water while the extraction technology of iodine i from natural brines and oil brines is commercially mature which contains up to 100 ppm of the element but the extraction of i from sgw ranging from 1 to 10 mg l has never been investigated the concentration of copper cu in sgw is approximately 1 mg l not very high considering the abundant reserves and wide sources of old scrap recycling cu from sgw is unnecessary the same for iron rb and ga were both found at concentrations higher than 0 2 mg l and are associated with high market prices ga based products have been used in defense applications fifth generation 5 g networks cable television transmission commercial wireless infrastructure power electronics and satellite china is the largest producer of ga 290 tonnes out of 300 globally however as for rb although its price is higher the application demand is low 2 tonnes in the u s in 2020 rb and its salts have little commercial use and small amounts are produced for research purposes mostly https www lenntech com therefore ga is more suitable for recovery from sgw than rb as for ru rh and ge their concentrations and demands were low their extraction is costly technically complex and not suitable for recovery as of today the extraction of elements depicted with the blue dots is not economical including rare earth elements however considering their strategic significance to economy and security it is necessary to develop extraction technologies from sgw which may be complex and costly but ultimately advantageous among them sc 6 46 12 7 μg l sm 4 89 9 54 μg l and eu 3 39 5 98 μg l were in relatively higher concentrations and probably the most potentially recyclable ones overall the challenges of metals recycling from sgw are enormous including i the composition of sgw is very complex containing various organic matters and inorganic ions and they are not easy to precipitate and crystallize using a single recovery operation ii the concentrations of different elements have huge differences and the selective separation of the valuable elements with lower concentrations from other dominant ions is difficult generally the key solutions for extracting metals from this wastewater include developing efficient and targeting adsorbents membrane based selective separation electrochemistry system and ion exchange resin however how to achieve the classification extraction of elements with different types and concentrations in complex water conditions is of great challenge in addition elements that are in low concentrations in raw sgw may be substantially higher in other streams such as concentrates e g ro concentrate which would represent better sources for extracting these valuable elements 3 3 potential health and environmental impacts of inorganic compounds in sgw the high salinity heavy metals and norm in sgw would likely cause environmental pollution and harm to human health following spills leakage into soil surface water or groundwater sun et al 2019 we assessed in detail the metal distribution and concentrations fig 2 as well as norm radioactivity fig 4 table s8 of sgw from the sichuan basin to estimate its potential risks to the environment and to human health a detailed description of the health effects and environmental impacts of all inorganic compounds above the detection limits in sgw is reported in table s9 si the high tds of sgw will increase salinity levels in nearby waters which has influence on fish and other aquatic species the concentrations of cl f ba b and no3 in sgw were far higher than the values associated with drinking water standard gb 5749 2022 the leakage into soil or surface water can do harm to plants and aquatic life br may also cause ecotoxicity effects jiang et al 2014 the leakage into drinking water sources can cause the formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts huang et al 2018 regarding heavy metals their non degradability and accumulation behavior in organisms may induce lasting environmental impacts al fe cr sb as be cd cu pb hg ni se ag mo v and zn are listed as primary contaminant metals by the u s environmental protection agency epa for their potential biotoxicity and wide ranging presence patnaik 2017 as pb hg cd cr are the most harmful ones with high ecotoxicity dökmeci 2020 in raw sgw from the sichuan basin the composition of heavy metals was varied but their concentrations were generally low cu 903 1451 μg l and fe 435 5727 μg l were in the highest concentrations among all heavy metals far higher than the values in the drinking water standard and integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 when released into the environment they may accumulate in soil and surface water and eventually reach plants and animals cu has negative effects on microorganisms and earthworms and may reduce plant diversity the concentrations of as mn and v also exceeded the drinking water standard the high ecotoxicity of as may increase the chances of alteration of genetic material of fish and this element is also readily absorbed by plants eventually it will enter the human body through the food chain resulting in potential health hazards mn and v both pose certain environmental impacts and v has strongly bioaccumulation property other elements i e rb ga ti and mo were in relatively high concentrations 20 μg l in sgw rb ga and ti are related with weak health and environmental risks nevertheless mo is characterized by high toxicity to humans and animals due to its teratogenicity but its concentration in sgw was below the drinking water standard thus associated with potentially impacts the rare earth elements sc tm and eu with concentrations of 10 μg l have no known biological role and would likely pose no threat to plants or animals finally the elements pb hg cd cr with very high intrinsic ecotoxicity were all in very low concentrations bdl or 5 μg l and within safety ranges leading to relatively low environmental impacts in the shale gas region other heavy metals were below 1 μg l in sgw and have low to moderate toxicity thus inducing negligible environmental impacts however for all heavy metals their bioaccumulation effect may not be negligible in the long term the presence of norm represents another significant risk in sgw fig 4 displays the gross α activity and gross β activity that reflect the overall radioactivity levels of raw sgw from the sichuan basin which were in the ranges of 3 71 83 4 bq l and 1 62 18 7 bq l respectively the contribution to gross α activity mainly came from 238u 232th 226ra while the gross β activity from 40k shi et al 2021 their values were much higher than those in drinking water standard and integrated wastewater discharge standard implying serious radiation risks long term exposure to radioactivity can cause major health problems related to cancer any leak into the environment would induce comprehensive systematic and persistent radioactive pollution to the surrounding water and soil affecting animals and plants around the shale gas regions shi et al 2021 from fig s1 si it can be seen that there is some correlation between radioactivity and tds r2 0 5182 because formation brine with higher salinity will promote the dissolution of radioactive material from the shale as reported by previous research mcmahon et al 2019 vengosh et al 2009 specifically the gross α activity of the water samples had a strong correlation r2 0 9745 with ra isotopes 226ra 228ra as depicted in fig s2 si 224ra has a short half life of 3 6 days so it was not considered in this study considering that the radioactivity of 228ra was below the detection limit 1 1 bq l 226ra radioactivity was mostly responsible for the gross α activity of the sgw previous research has reported that 226ra with a half life of 1600 years was the major component of norm and also the major contributor of radioactivity in sgw gusa and vidic 2019 the correlation between ra radioactivity and tds and alkaline earth metal concentration of ba is shown in fig s3 si the concentration of alkaline earth metal ba had strong correlation r2 0 8318 with the radioactivity of ra indicating that ba is a better predictor of ra activity than tds this phenomenon has also been reported by other reports fan et al 2018 226ra and 228ra are the decay products in water of 238u and 232th existing in the shale of lower silurian longmaxi formation of the sichuan basin the low radioactivity of 228ra may due to the low concentration of 232th in the shale to summarize 226ra was the major component of norm presented at radioactivity levels as high as 0 31 19 5 bq l in all sgw samples from the sichuan basin this result was consistent with the only previous report of radioactivity in sgw in weiyuan of the sichuan basin ni et al 2018 this was much higher than the drinking water standard 1 bq l implying that raw sgw would cause ra pollution to the surrounding water and soil plants and animals would likely absorb this element from the soil and water and accumulate bio magnify up the food chain eventually it would likely cause health problems to people in surrounding areas https www lenntech com analyzing the numbers in more detail the concentrations of u and th in raw sgw were very low and in the ranges of 0 067 0 17 μg l u and 0 003 0 064 μg l th respectively the concentration of u was much lower than the drinking water standard of 30 μg l the data also illustrates for the first time that the radioactivity of 210po in samples from weiyuan and changning was very low ranging from 0 011 to 0 259 bq l below the us epa drinking water guidelines 0 555 bq l however the values of 210pb in c2 and w2 were slightly higher than the us epa guidelines for 210pb exposure by ingestion 0 115 bq l the radioactivity of 210pb and 210po in sgw from the sichuan basin were a little higher than that in dj basin in the u s rosenblum et al 2017 other radioactivity indexes including 90mtc 137cs and 60co were too low for detection in general the radioactivity of sgw in the sichuan basin was found to be much lower than that in the marcellus shale and bakken shale in the u s and in a similar range to that in the dj basin in the u s this may be attributed to the presence of low levels of parent radionuclide 238u in the formation and to the low salinity of the formation brine however the radioactivity was still significantly higher than the safe range potentially posing health and environmental risks in the shale gas regions 3 4 safety of the effluent from the pretreatment dtro treatment system in order to obtain good effluent quality advanced dtro technology with relatively high cost and high energy consumption was investigated the detailed water quality of the effluent of the combined system w3 dtro fig 1b including general parameters concentrations of major ions and trace metals is summarized in table s9 and fig 2b upon treatment w3 dtro had a very low tds value of 14 9 mg l associated with a removal rate 99 9 with nacl being the main component left the concentrations of cl f ba b and no3 which were higher than the standards in raw sgw were all within the safety ranges after treatment the concentration of br was as low as 0 06 mg l lower than the concentrations which can typically lead to the formation of disinfection by products 0 1 mg l as for heavy metals most were below the detection limits in the effluent except for ga 9 97 μg l cu 2 55 μg l rb la sm eu with concentrations of 1 μg l and as v ge gd with concentrations of 0 1 μg l all the heavy metal indexes were lower than the drinking water standard indicating negligible ecotoxicity to the environment of shale gas regions the radioactivity of w3 dtro effluent is displayed in fig 4 the combined treatment process had the removal rates greater than 95 for all indexes reaching a gross α activity of 1 3 bq l and a gross β activity of 0 27 bq l the gross α activity was a little higher than that of the drinking water standard 0 5 bq l and integrated wastewater discharge standard 1 bq l and may result in substandard discharge to surface water continuous discharge may induce persistent radioactive pollution to the surrounding water and soil thus affecting animals and plants opportunely w3 dtro had a very low ra radioactivity of 0 177 bq l meeting the drinking water standard of 1 bq l moreover the radioactivity of 210pb and 210po in w3 dtro were 0 002 bq l and 0 001 bq l respectively below the us epa guidelines for 210pb exposure and the us epa drinking water guidelines for 210po implying negligible occupational and public health risks in general the advanced pretreatment dtro combined system was found to be highly efficient in the removal of organics 95 of doc inorganic contaminants 99 of tds and norm radioactivity 97 of α activity from raw sgw in the sichuan basin and the effluent water quality met the drinking water standard and integrated wastewater discharge standard table s8 si except for the index of gross α activity long term exposure to radioactivity will induce environmental and health problems including potential negative impacts to freshwater biota and increasing risks of cancer geeza et al 2018 gusa and vidic 2019 mcmahon et al 2019 sun et al 2019 therefore a specific polishing step may be additionally required for this index note that the dtro technology is usually more effective than the traditional and commonly used ro technology in removing various contaminants chen et al 2021 therefore the radioactive safety of a possible ro effluent would likely be higher and not meet the required standards 4 conclusions our study draws a comprehensive periodic table to reflect the inorganic composition of sgw from the sichuan basin based on it the resource potential and safety of sgw are systematically evaluated common salts sr li and ga are the most recyclable ones additional efforts are needed to develop efficient extraction methods such as electrochemistry adsorption and their potential use in an integrated system with membrane processes meanwhile potential risks associated with poor management of sgw are evaluated considering combined toxicity and concentrations salinity f cl br no3 ba b and fe cu as mn v and mo may pose the highest risks the radioactivity was also far higher than the discharge standards this may induce persistent pollution to the surrounding water and soil affecting animals and plants by accumulating and bio magnifying up the food chain these elements may eventually influence human health the safety of the effluent of the pretreatment dtro combined process is evaluated we found that gross α activity 1 3 bq l was still a little higher than the discharge standard of 1 bq l the effluent quality of advanced dtro technology is expected to be of higher quality than any effluent from traditional ro filtration which raises concerns about the radioactive contamination of sgw effluents treated with ro technology our study is the first to provide a comprehensive and in depth analysis of the inorganic composition of sgw in the sichuan basin it promotes the resources recovery and risk assessment of this wastewater the most important is that the detection and evaluation method we establish for sgw is also suitable for other kinds of complex wastewater in terms of the inorganic characteristics resource potential and safety credit authorship contribution

15863,shale gas wastewater sgw has great potential for the recovery of valuable elements but it also poses risks in terms of environmental pollution with heavy metals and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm being of major concerns however many of these species have not been fully determined for the first time we identify the elements present in sgw from the sichuan basin and consequently draw a comprehensive periodic table including 71 elements in 15 iupac groups based on it we analyze the elements possessing recycling opportunities or with risk potentials most of the metal elements in sgw exist at very low concentrations 0 2 mg l including rare earth elements revealing poor economic feasibility for recovery however salts strontium sr lithium li and gallium ga are in higher concentrations and have impressive market demands hence great potential to be recovered as for environmental burdens related to raw sgw management salinity f cl br no3 ba b and fe cu as mn v and mo pose relatively higher threats in view of the concentrations and toxicity the radioactivity is also much higher than the safety range with the gross α activity and gross β activity in sgw ranging from 3 71 83 4 bq l and 1 62 18 7 bq l respectively and radium 226 as the main component the advanced combined process pretreatment disk tube reverse osmosis dtro with pilot scale is evaluated for the safe reuse of sgw this process has high efficiency in the removal of metals and total radioactivity however the gross α activity of the effluent 1 3 bq l is slightly higher than the standard for discharge 1 bq l which is thus associated with potential long term environmental hazards graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords shale gas wastewater sgw heavy metal elements naturally occurring radioactive material norm safe disposal resources recovery 1 introduction abundant reserves of unconventional shale oil and gas have profoundly affected the energy landscape in china mayfield et al 2019 although the extraction of shale gas in china started 10 years later than that in the united states china is witnessing a shale gas boom and has become the third largest shale gas producer in the world the sichuan basin is the most active and commercially mature shale gas region in china fuling weiyuan changning and zhaotong are the four major shale gas blocks in the sichuan basin wei et al 2021 horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques for shale gas extraction rely heavily on water consumption as 20 000 to 50 000 m3 water is needed for the exploitation of each well in the sichuan basin liu et al 2022 a fraction of 15 50 of injected water returns to the surface and generates a large amount of shale gas wastewater sgw the composition of sgw is very complex due to the long term interaction with the formation brine containing high levels of total dissolved solids tds diverse metal elements a variety of organic compounds and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm chang et al 2019a huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 sun et al 2021 tang et al 2020 xie et al 2022 zhong et al 2021 the new developments to rational sgw management comprise not only the removal of these contaminants but also the recycling of valuable metals potentially contributing to economic benefits and meeting strategic needs however up to now the types and concentrations of valuable metal elements in sgw have not been comprehensively analyzed studies only reported that sodium chloride lithium li uranium u or rare earth elements might have resource recovery potential chang et al 2019b emmons et al 2022 kumar et al 2019 tian et al 2020 however the economic feasibility of the recovery of valuable metals from sgw has not been studied this feasibility is determined by the concentration market price extraction cost and market demand of each element shahmansouri et al 2015 reports on the adverse effects of shale gas extraction on infant health currie et al 2017 and the contamination of sgw to local ecosystems from poor management have raised public concerns kondash et al 2018 it is necessary to comprehensively detect harmful substances in sgw especially heavy metals and norm heavy metals are among the pollutants that disrupt the ecological balance of water soil and air cr as cd hg pb are typically hazardous heavy metals with high ecotoxicity which have been detected in sgw of the marcellus shale chang et al 2019a zhong et al 2021 bakken shale lauer et al 2016 xiao 2021 and denver julesburg dj basin rosenblum et al 2017 in the u s their concentrations vary greatly bdl to greater than 1 mg l in different shale gas regions due to the different geochemical characteristics of shale formations and brine however the analysis of heavy metals in sgw from the sichuan basin is very limited and their environmental impacts and health risks have not been assessed the same conclusion can be drawn for norm sgw often contains radionuclides from shale formations including α particles β particles potassium 40k radium 226ra and 228ra cesium 137cs lead 212pb polonium 210po thorium 228th 230th and 232th and uranium 234u 235u and 238u sun et al 2019 however only one work ni et al 2018 has reported the radioactivity of 226ra and 228ra in sgw from weiyuan in the sichuan basin in the u s norm and their environmental risk assessment in shale gas regions have been determined in the marcellus shale blondes et al 2018 geeza et al 2018 gusa and vidic 2019 mehta and kocar 2019 bakken shale lauer et al 2016 xiao 2021 and dj basin rosenblum et al 2017 it was found that each radionuclide in the dj basin was much lower than that in the marcellus shale or bakken shale long term exposure to radioactivity can cause major environmental and health problems geeza et al 2018 gusa and vidic 2019 mcmahon et al 2019 sun et al 2019 therefore comprehensive detection of the radioactivity of sgw is necessary in the sichuan basin together with assessment of potential associated risks given the high risks associated to sgw management the wide consensus is that it needs to be treated before discharge however despite increasingly stringent standards treated effluents may still contain salinity or halides heavy metals or radionuclides that are then released into surface waters research reports have proven that the salinity of the receiving streams and the radioactivity of its sediments can increase resulting to metals and radium bioenrichment or even contaminating urban drinking water in pennsylvania geeza et al 2018 warner et al 2013 therefore the detection of water quality including heavy metals and norm in the effluents from treatment facilities is also of vital importance before reuse or discharge an effort that however has been vastly neglected so far in this work we analyze sgw from five wells in different locations of weiyuan and changning blocks in the sichuan basin china general water quality metals and radionuclides are comprehensively reported to systematically evaluate the resource potential and safety of sgw moreover a combined pretreatment disk tube reverse osmosis dtro treatment process is constructed with the goal of sgw treatment in weiyuan shale gas block and the quality of its effluent is comprehensively analyzed to evaluate its safety for reuse or discharge our study also establishes a method to comprehensively assess the inorganic characteristics resource potential and safety suitable for other kinds of wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and description of the pilot scale treatment facility five sgw samples from different shale gas blocks in the sichuan basin were collected for detection in 2021 two of the water samples were from the changning shale gas block denoted as c1 and c2 c1 was obtained from yuhua village in gongxian county and c2 was from leijiawan village in gongxian county other three water samples were collected from the weiyuan shale gas block denoted as w1 w2 and w3 w1 was obtained from longhui village in weiyuan county w2 was from xinlong village in rongxian county and w3 was from macaoyan village in zizhong county their sites are depicted in fig 1 a in the location of w3 an advanced process including coagulation ultrafiltration uf and dtro etc for the reuse of sgw was studied by construction and performance evaluation of a pilot scale system a photographic image and the schematic of the process train are displayed in fig 1b the facility is framed within the white dotted line in this figure the raw sgw sample w3 was treated by this combined system and the effluent of dtro was denoted as w3 dtro all water samples were preserved in sealed plastic buckets and transported to the laboratory 2 days after collection for analysis each sample was quantified with different instruments to analyze the general quality metal elements concentrations and norm radioactivity fig 1c before analysis all samples were stored at 4 c in the dark 2 2 analytical methods for general water quality major cations and anions and trace metal elements the ph was measured with a pb 10 meter sartorius scientific

with 0 45 μm filters wanda co ltd zhejiang china an ultrameter ii 6pfc myron l company usa portable multifunctional meter was utilized to acquire the value of tds and conductivity the concentrations of major cations and anions na k ca2 mg2 ba2 sr2 li nh4 and cl br f so4 2 no3 no2 were determined by dionex integration hpic ion chromatography thermo fisher scientific inc usa with cs12a and as11 hc chromatographic columns after filtration of the samples with 0 45 μm filters and 100 dilution for the raw sgw or no dilution for w3 dtro the qualitative and quantitative analysis of 57 trace metals and 4 non metal elements total contents in aqueous samples was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 1000 g perkin elmer waltham ma samples were prepared in acid washed glass bottles prior to measurements 13 5 ml of each sample was digested with 1 5 ml of nitric acid 69 3 ups kelong chemical co ltd chengdu china for 8 min at 130 c 5 min at 150 c and 5 min at 180 c no suspended solids were observed after digestion and holding for at least 12 h therefore filtration was not required a field blank was also prepared using the same method used for the samples at the beginning of the measurement three cleaning blanks of 2 nitric acid were run to clear any residual contamination from previous runs additionally two cleaning blanks were run between every sample to ensure no crossover between samples and no build up of contamination within the machine at least two parallel measurements were run for each sample to take the average result the concentrations of elements in the field blank were subtracted to get the final results the detection limits of the elements measured by ipc ms in this study are given in table s2 supporting information si concentrations were reported if the analysis results met the routinely determined and evaluated quality control parameters table s3 2 3 norm analysis six water samples of 10 l each for radionuclide analysis were collected in polyethylene containers and sent to the analytical laboratory of beijing research institute of uranium geology for norm detection the gross α and β activities were determined on the alpha beta counters mpc9604 ortec tennessee usa according to the standards of ej t 1075 1998 and ej t 900 1994 separately the concentrations of uranium u and thorium th were obtained with icp ms as discussed above following the guide of water quality determination of 65 elements inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hj 700 2014 the radioactivity of potassium 40 40k was measured with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer z 2000 hitachi japan following the guide of analytical methods of potassium 40 in water gb 11 214 1989 the activities of technetium 90 m 90mtc cesium 137 137cs cobalt 60 60co and radium 228 228ra were determined on high purity germanium hpge γ spectroscopy counted 580 000 s with the volume of 0 2 l referring to the standard of determination of radionuclides in water by gamma spectrometry gb t 16 140 2018 radium 226 226ra was analyzed by radium radon emanation pc 2100 using gb 11 214 1989 plumbum 210 210pb was also analyzed by alpha beta counters with the guide of ej t 859 1994 polonium 210 210po 234u 238u and 230th 232th were measured with α spectroscopy octe plus by gb t 13 071 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 general quality of sgw and major ions the general water quality and concentrations of major cations and anions in raw sgw samples in the sichuan basin are presented in table s1 si the tds and doc levels were similar to those commonly reported in other research chang et al 2019a huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 tang et al 2020 2021 zhong et al 2021 with tds values between 13 730 mg l c2 and 31 090 mg l c1 and with relatively low doc levels of 4 26 c1 to 26 8 mg l c2 the main inorganic ions in sgw were na and cl which accounted for 80 95 of the total tds ca2 ba2 sr2 and mg2 were major divalent cations li 11 5 33 7 mg l was also in medium to high concentrations which may be considered to have recycling potential kumar et al 2019 and this topic will be discussed in the next section br was another important anion accounting for 0 4 0 6 of tds generally these concentrations were in the same range as those reported before relative to sgw in the sichuan basin chang et al 2019a huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 2021 shang et al 2020 tang et al 2020 2021 zhong et al 2021 we also report the data associated with the shale gas regions of bakken dj basin and marcellus in the u s for comparison although the salinity and organics content in different regions are largely different the main ion composition is the same 3 2 potential to valuable elements recovery based on the analyses conducted for major ions table s1 trace metals tables s4 s5 and non metals table s6 the average concentration ranges of 71 elements in 15 iupac groups in raw sgw samples c1 c2 w1 w2 w3 are summarized in fig 2 a except for the known dominant elements other metal elements that existed in sgw are in low concentrations bdl 2 mg l among them the elements ag al au be bi pb se sn hf hg ir nb ta te pt pd in zr zn as well as some rare earth elements e g ce were below the detection limits hence unrecoverable other valuable metals such as li uranium u and other rare earth elements were found at diverse concentrations in order to assess their recovery potential the average concentrations and market prices tables s7 si of the elements higher than detection limits are provided in fig 3 a summaries 2021 https en institut seltene erden de aktuelle preise von seltenen erden generally speaking the concentration market price and extraction cost determine the economic feasibility of recovering an element from sgw as illustrated by shahmansouri et al 2015 in this study for simplicity the extraction cost ratio is normalized to 1 for all elements thus if the product cost market price average concentration in sgw of an element is greater than 1 it means that the extraction of this element from sgw may be economically feasible in fig 3a the elements represented by red dots may be potentially recovered with economic feasibility and the dots placed in the top right corner represent the most economical conditions although many kinds of metal elements were contained in sgw from the practical point of view only a limited number may be feasibly recovered the recovery of na mg ca ba k and useful nonmetal elements e g br which were found in high concentrations in sgw is technically feasible as that used for seawater and brine at the same time these elements are in high market demand illustrating that they are suitable and promising for extraction from sgw sr and li were also in medium to high concentrations as well as in high demand however their extraction method from sgw is currently being studied and not mature yet electrochemical separation adsorption and integrated system with membrane processes are regarded as the most promising techniques kumar et al 2019 boron b and silicon si are rarely recycled from water while the extraction technology of iodine i from natural brines and oil brines is commercially mature which contains up to 100 ppm of the element but the extraction of i from sgw ranging from 1 to 10 mg l has never been investigated the concentration of copper cu in sgw is approximately 1 mg l not very high considering the abundant reserves and wide sources of old scrap recycling cu from sgw is unnecessary the same for iron rb and ga were both found at concentrations higher than 0 2 mg l and are associated with high market prices ga based products have been used in defense applications fifth generation 5 g networks cable television transmission commercial wireless infrastructure power electronics and satellite china is the largest producer of ga 290 tonnes out of 300 globally however as for rb although its price is higher the application demand is low 2 tonnes in the u s in 2020 rb and its salts have little commercial use and small amounts are produced for research purposes mostly https www lenntech com therefore ga is more suitable for recovery from sgw than rb as for ru rh and ge their concentrations and demands were low their extraction is costly technically complex and not suitable for recovery as of today the extraction of elements depicted with the blue dots is not economical including rare earth elements however considering their strategic significance to economy and security it is necessary to develop extraction technologies from sgw which may be complex and costly but ultimately advantageous among them sc 6 46 12 7 μg l sm 4 89 9 54 μg l and eu 3 39 5 98 μg l were in relatively higher concentrations and probably the most potentially recyclable ones overall the challenges of metals recycling from sgw are enormous including i the composition of sgw is very complex containing various organic matters and inorganic ions and they are not easy to precipitate and crystallize using a single recovery operation ii the concentrations of different elements have huge differences and the selective separation of the valuable elements with lower concentrations from other dominant ions is difficult generally the key solutions for extracting metals from this wastewater include developing efficient and targeting adsorbents membrane based selective separation electrochemistry system and ion exchange resin however how to achieve the classification extraction of elements with different types and concentrations in complex water conditions is of great challenge in addition elements that are in low concentrations in raw sgw may be substantially higher in other streams such as concentrates e g ro concentrate which would represent better sources for extracting these valuable elements 3 3 potential health and environmental impacts of inorganic compounds in sgw the high salinity heavy metals and norm in sgw would likely cause environmental pollution and harm to human health following spills leakage into soil surface water or groundwater sun et al 2019 we assessed in detail the metal distribution and concentrations fig 2 as well as norm radioactivity fig 4 table s8 of sgw from the sichuan basin to estimate its potential risks to the environment and to human health a detailed description of the health effects and environmental impacts of all inorganic compounds above the detection limits in sgw is reported in table s9 si the high tds of sgw will increase salinity levels in nearby waters which has influence on fish and other aquatic species the concentrations of cl f ba b and no3 in sgw were far higher than the values associated with drinking water standard gb 5749 2022 the leakage into soil or surface water can do harm to plants and aquatic life br may also cause ecotoxicity effects jiang et al 2014 the leakage into drinking water sources can cause the formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts huang et al 2018 regarding heavy metals their non degradability and accumulation behavior in organisms may induce lasting environmental impacts al fe cr sb as be cd cu pb hg ni se ag mo v and zn are listed as primary contaminant metals by the u s environmental protection agency epa for their potential biotoxicity and wide ranging presence patnaik 2017 as pb hg cd cr are the most harmful ones with high ecotoxicity dökmeci 2020 in raw sgw from the sichuan basin the composition of heavy metals was varied but their concentrations were generally low cu 903 1451 μg l and fe 435 5727 μg l were in the highest concentrations among all heavy metals far higher than the values in the drinking water standard and integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 when released into the environment they may accumulate in soil and surface water and eventually reach plants and animals cu has negative effects on microorganisms and earthworms and may reduce plant diversity the concentrations of as mn and v also exceeded the drinking water standard the high ecotoxicity of as may increase the chances of alteration of genetic material of fish and this element is also readily absorbed by plants eventually it will enter the human body through the food chain resulting in potential health hazards mn and v both pose certain environmental impacts and v has strongly bioaccumulation property other elements i e rb ga ti and mo were in relatively high concentrations 20 μg l in sgw rb ga and ti are related with weak health and environmental risks nevertheless mo is characterized by high toxicity to humans and animals due to its teratogenicity but its concentration in sgw was below the drinking water standard thus associated with potentially impacts the rare earth elements sc tm and eu with concentrations of 10 μg l have no known biological role and would likely pose no threat to plants or animals finally the elements pb hg cd cr with very high intrinsic ecotoxicity were all in very low concentrations bdl or 5 μg l and within safety ranges leading to relatively low environmental impacts in the shale gas region other heavy metals were below 1 μg l in sgw and have low to moderate toxicity thus inducing negligible environmental impacts however for all heavy metals their bioaccumulation effect may not be negligible in the long term the presence of norm represents another significant risk in sgw fig 4 displays the gross α activity and gross β activity that reflect the overall radioactivity levels of raw sgw from the sichuan basin which were in the ranges of 3 71 83 4 bq l and 1 62 18 7 bq l respectively the contribution to gross α activity mainly came from 238u 232th 226ra while the gross β activity from 40k shi et al 2021 their values were much higher than those in drinking water standard and integrated wastewater discharge standard implying serious radiation risks long term exposure to radioactivity can cause major health problems related to cancer any leak into the environment would induce comprehensive systematic and persistent radioactive pollution to the surrounding water and soil affecting animals and plants around the shale gas regions shi et al 2021 from fig s1 si it can be seen that there is some correlation between radioactivity and tds r2 0 5182 because formation brine with higher salinity will promote the dissolution of radioactive material from the shale as reported by previous research mcmahon et al 2019 vengosh et al 2009 specifically the gross α activity of the water samples had a strong correlation r2 0 9745 with ra isotopes 226ra 228ra as depicted in fig s2 si 224ra has a short half life of 3 6 days so it was not considered in this study considering that the radioactivity of 228ra was below the detection limit 1 1 bq l 226ra radioactivity was mostly responsible for the gross α activity of the sgw previous research has reported that 226ra with a half life of 1600 years was the major component of norm and also the major contributor of radioactivity in sgw gusa and vidic 2019 the correlation between ra radioactivity and tds and alkaline earth metal concentration of ba is shown in fig s3 si the concentration of alkaline earth metal ba had strong correlation r2 0 8318 with the radioactivity of ra indicating that ba is a better predictor of ra activity than tds this phenomenon has also been reported by other reports fan et al 2018 226ra and 228ra are the decay products in water of 238u and 232th existing in the shale of lower silurian longmaxi formation of the sichuan basin the low radioactivity of 228ra may due to the low concentration of 232th in the shale to summarize 226ra was the major component of norm presented at radioactivity levels as high as 0 31 19 5 bq l in all sgw samples from the sichuan basin this result was consistent with the only previous report of radioactivity in sgw in weiyuan of the sichuan basin ni et al 2018 this was much higher than the drinking water standard 1 bq l implying that raw sgw would cause ra pollution to the surrounding water and soil plants and animals would likely absorb this element from the soil and water and accumulate bio magnify up the food chain eventually it would likely cause health problems to people in surrounding areas https www lenntech com analyzing the numbers in more detail the concentrations of u and th in raw sgw were very low and in the ranges of 0 067 0 17 μg l u and 0 003 0 064 μg l th respectively the concentration of u was much lower than the drinking water standard of 30 μg l the data also illustrates for the first time that the radioactivity of 210po in samples from weiyuan and changning was very low ranging from 0 011 to 0 259 bq l below the us epa drinking water guidelines 0 555 bq l however the values of 210pb in c2 and w2 were slightly higher than the us epa guidelines for 210pb exposure by ingestion 0 115 bq l the radioactivity of 210pb and 210po in sgw from the sichuan basin were a little higher than that in dj basin in the u s rosenblum et al 2017 other radioactivity indexes including 90mtc 137cs and 60co were too low for detection in general the radioactivity of sgw in the sichuan basin was found to be much lower than that in the marcellus shale and bakken shale in the u s and in a similar range to that in the dj basin in the u s this may be attributed to the presence of low levels of parent radionuclide 238u in the formation and to the low salinity of the formation brine however the radioactivity was still significantly higher than the safe range potentially posing health and environmental risks in the shale gas regions 3 4 safety of the effluent from the pretreatment dtro treatment system in order to obtain good effluent quality advanced dtro technology with relatively high cost and high energy consumption was investigated the detailed water quality of the effluent of the combined system w3 dtro fig 1b including general parameters concentrations of major ions and trace metals is summarized in table s9 and fig 2b upon treatment w3 dtro had a very low tds value of 14 9 mg l associated with a removal rate 99 9 with nacl being the main component left the concentrations of cl f ba b and no3 which were higher than the standards in raw sgw were all within the safety ranges after treatment the concentration of br was as low as 0 06 mg l lower than the concentrations which can typically lead to the formation of disinfection by products 0 1 mg l as for heavy metals most were below the detection limits in the effluent except for ga 9 97 μg l cu 2 55 μg l rb la sm eu with concentrations of 1 μg l and as v ge gd with concentrations of 0 1 μg l all the heavy metal indexes were lower than the drinking water standard indicating negligible ecotoxicity to the environment of shale gas regions the radioactivity of w3 dtro effluent is displayed in fig 4 the combined treatment process had the removal rates greater than 95 for all indexes reaching a gross α activity of 1 3 bq l and a gross β activity of 0 27 bq l the gross α activity was a little higher than that of the drinking water standard 0 5 bq l and integrated wastewater discharge standard 1 bq l and may result in substandard discharge to surface water continuous discharge may induce persistent radioactive pollution to the surrounding water and soil thus affecting animals and plants opportunely w3 dtro had a very low ra radioactivity of 0 177 bq l meeting the drinking water standard of 1 bq l moreover the radioactivity of 210pb and 210po in w3 dtro were 0 002 bq l and 0 001 bq l respectively below the us epa guidelines for 210pb exposure and the us epa drinking water guidelines for 210po implying negligible occupational and public health risks in general the advanced pretreatment dtro combined system was found to be highly efficient in the removal of organics 95 of doc inorganic contaminants 99 of tds and norm radioactivity 97 of α activity from raw sgw in the sichuan basin and the effluent water quality met the drinking water standard and integrated wastewater discharge standard table s8 si except for the index of gross α activity long term exposure to radioactivity will induce environmental and health problems including potential negative impacts to freshwater biota and increasing risks of cancer geeza et al 2018 gusa and vidic 2019 mcmahon et al 2019 sun et al 2019 therefore a specific polishing step may be additionally required for this index note that the dtro technology is usually more effective than the traditional and commonly used ro technology in removing various contaminants chen et al 2021 therefore the radioactive safety of a possible ro effluent would likely be higher and not meet the required standards 4 conclusions our study draws a comprehensive periodic table to reflect the inorganic composition of sgw from the sichuan basin based on it the resource potential and safety of sgw are systematically evaluated common salts sr li and ga are the most recyclable ones additional efforts are needed to develop efficient extraction methods such as electrochemistry adsorption and their potential use in an integrated system with membrane processes meanwhile potential risks associated with poor management of sgw are evaluated considering combined toxicity and concentrations salinity f cl br no3 ba b and fe cu as mn v and mo may pose the highest risks the radioactivity was also far higher than the discharge standards this may induce persistent pollution to the surrounding water and soil affecting animals and plants by accumulating and bio magnifying up the food chain these elements may eventually influence human health the safety of the effluent of the pretreatment dtro combined process is evaluated we found that gross α activity 1 3 bq l was still a little higher than the discharge standard of 1 bq l the effluent quality of advanced dtro technology is expected to be of higher quality than any effluent from traditional ro filtration which raises concerns about the radioactive contamination of sgw effluents treated with ro technology our study is the first to provide a comprehensive and in depth analysis of the inorganic composition of sgw in the sichuan basin it promotes the resources recovery and risk assessment of this wastewater the most important is that the detection and evaluation method we establish for sgw is also suitable for other kinds of complex wastewater in terms of the inorganic characteristics resource potential and safety credit authorship contribution

15864,urban freshwater ecosystems have important ecosystem functions provide habitats for diverse microbial communities and are susceptible to multiple interconnected factors such as environmental pollution despite the ecological significance of bacteria and microeukaryotes little is known about how their community assembly responds to various environmental factors across water and sediment habitats and ecological processes shaping them here environmental dna based approaches were used to investigate the community assembly processes of bacteria and microeukaryotes including habitat generalists and specialists in urban water and sediment across an urban pollution gradient in wuhan central china the diversity community composition and potential function of bacteria and microeukaryotes showed significantly stronger variation between water and sediment than across an urban pollution gradient although bacterial and microeukaryotic community assemblies were dominated by strong selection processes in both water and sediment habitats but a contrasting community assembly mechanism was identified between habitat generalists and specialists bacterial and microeukaryotic communities showed a greater response to physicochemical variability in water while a strong distance decay relationship was found in sediment further cross kingdom microbial network analysis revealed strong modular associations of bacteria and microeukaryotes meanwhile microeukaryotic habitat specialists might be keystone but generalists have higher proportion of connections in the networks this study provides significant insights into the response of bacteria and microeukaryotes to different urban pollutions between water and sediment and the ecological processes structuring microbial community dynamics across habitat types under anthropogenic disturbances graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacteria microeukaryotes urban environment community ecology volatile organic compounds heavy metals 1 introduction urban water and sediment qualities are major issues among freshwater ecosystems worldwide affected by rapid urbanization processes and industrial pollution lee et al 2016 gad et al 2020 isaza et al 2020 environmental pollution can negatively affect freshwater ecosystems because exposure of individual or mixed pollutants may lead to changes in the composition and function of aquatic microbial communities dai et al 2017 ji et al 2017 rosi et al 2018 abdullah al et al 2021 however the responses of bacteria and microeukaryotes to different environmental factors are not yet clear thus deciphering their responses is necessary to understand the structuring of microbial communities and to predict the community response to environmental changes urban waterbodies e g rivers lakes drains open channels and tributaries provide habitats for diverse microbial communities that serve important ecosystem functions abdullah al et al 2021 gad et al 2022 biodiversity and associated ecosystem processes are increasingly stressed by multiple and often interconnected factors in urbanized areas such as the city of wuhan in central china where human induced stressors have arisen from all corners i e household industrial hospital and municipality therefore a timely and comprehensive assessment of microbial biodiversity or biogeographic distribution and its driving forces are of great significance to reveal the ecological mechanisms that maintain ecosystem functions and to predict the response of aquatic ecosystems to urbanization driven anthropogenic pollution however relatively little is known about microbial cross kingdom bacteria and microeukaryotes diversity and distribution patterns in water and sediment habitats here we hypothesized that urbanization driven anthropogenic pollution causes contrasting community structure and function of bacteria and microeukaryotes in urban water and its underlaying sediment due to ubiquitous distribution bacteria and microeukaryotes significantly contribute to global carbon fluxes biogeochemical cycles and water quality in ecosystems chen et al 2019a 2019b gad et al 2022 while they coexist in habitat they impart different effects on microbial community dynamics and ecosystem stability sloan et al 2006 logares et al 2018 gad et al 2020 in addition the wide distribution of microbial habitat generalists can contribute to ecosystem stability sloan et al 2006 yang et al 2016 chen et al 2019a while the narrower niche width of habitat specialists facilitates quick responses within varied environmental conditions and creates susceptibility to pollution level liao et al 2016 gad et al 2020 different pollutants are known as the main casual factors of community instability and reduced associated ecosystem functions either by changing static water conditions or by degrading sediment quality liao et al 2017 gad et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 it is generally accepted that the assembly of microbial communities is regulated by both deterministic and stochastic processes where deterministic processes influence the fitness of microbial communities and stochastic processes unpredictably changes the community structure by generating independent species assemblages sloan et al 2006 stegen et al 2012 bahram et al 2016 chen et al 2019b although community assembly of bacteria logares et al 2013 liao et al 2016 2017 or microeukaryotes bahram et al 2016 chen et al 2019b gad et al 2020 in different water or sediment habitats is well documented however a comprehensive study of cross kingdom bacteria and microeukaryotes together in water and its underlaying sediment habitats is still limited especially different levels of urban polluted waterbodies logares et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 2021 therefore it is necessary to understand whether bacterial and microeukaryotic communities show similar community patterns or contrast each other furthermore biotic interactions i e predation mutualism and competition abiotic environmental factors ph temperature and salinity and nutrients can determine or influence the community assembly patterns stegen et al 2012 bahram et al 2016 zhou and ning 2017 zou et al 2021 it is commonly believed that the modular structure of complex microbial co occurrence networks plays an important role in organisms functional attributes in ecosystems such as material cycling and energy fluxes poisot et al 2012 xue et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ratzke et al 2020 hence uncovering the cross kingdom species interactions in the microbial co occurrence network is of great importance to better comprehend the ecological structure of microbial communities to address the knowledge gaps in this study we investigated the significant drivers of water and sediment dowelling bacteria and microeukaryotes including habitat generalists and specialists and their community assembly processes from 20 waterbodies in wuhan city along a pollution gradient the aims of this study were to 1 compare the diversity composition and functional structure of bacteria and microeukaryotes in water and sediment habitats across a pollution gradient 2 disentangle the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes driving the community assembly of bacteria and microeukaryotes including habitat generalists and specialists and 3 determine the influence of habitat generalists and specialists on the cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic community interactions in water and sediment habitats 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection wuhan is one of the most populated and urbanized cities in central china more than twelve million inhabitants live within 8500 km² in this city although it has many lakes recreational waterbodies and large rivers i e yangtze and han rivers recent study has shown that rapid urbanization driven pollution i e anthropogenic nitrogen has strongly contributed to increasing urban black and odorous water with different levels of pollution and such polluted black odorous water has significant negative influence on water quality and aquatic biodiversity abdullah al et al 2021 in this study water and sediment samples were collected in may 2019 from nineteen urban waterbodies and one non urban waterbody to assess a comprehensive cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic community assemblages between water and sediment along an urban pollution gradient the urban waterbodies were comprising 6 shallow rivers 11 open channels wastewater carrying drains to rivers 1 lake reservoir and 1 tributary while the non urban drinking water reservoir was mulan lake fig s1 and table s1 the chinese ministry of housing and urban rural development classified urban black odor water into different levels of pollution based on chemical parameters namely transparency dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential and ammonium nitrogen scale is given in bottom of the fig s1 therefore all nineteen waterbodies were in the black and odorous water category with light l moderate m and heavy h pollution levels cao et al 2020 abdullah al et al 2021 mulan lake is a drinking water reservoir thus we denoted it as non urban polluted because the source of the pollutants was either from forested land wash or agriculture among the 40 samples including 20 water and 20 sediment samples 2 samples were categorized as non urban polluted waterbody 12 samples were lightly polluted 16 were moderately polluted and 10 samples were heavily polluted waterbodies the name of

nitrogen and gc ms conducted the separation and qualitative analysis 2 3 dna extraction high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics water samples were collected at a depth of 0 0 5 m and pre filtered by a 200 µm sieve to removal large particles and debris three replicated water samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm pore polycarbonate membrane 47 mm in diameter millipore billerica ma usa in different volumes considering water pollution level specifically 700 800 ml for drinking water reservoir 200 350 ml for lightly and moderately polluted water and 100 200 ml for heavily polluted

at 20 ºc in the field then immediately brought to the laboratory and preserved at 80 ºc three replicated sediment samples were mixed well before dna extraction and subsequent analyses such as nutrient measurements dna was directly extracted from filter membranes and wet sediments using the fastdna spin kit and the fastprep instrument mp biomedicales santa ana ca usa the hypervariable v3 4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna gene and v9 region of microeukaryotic 18s rrna gene were amplified following previous studies amaral zettler et al 2009 liu et al 2017 nyirabuhoro et al 2021 the pcr reaction was setup as follows initial 5 min at 95 ºc 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 ºc 30 s at 55 ºc and 30 s at 72 ºc then followed by 5 min extension at 72 ºc at the end of amplification three replicated purified pcr products were pooled in equal quantity and then sequenced on an illumina platform illumina inc san diego ca usa the raw paired end reads were denoised and assembled by using dada2 v1 16 0 https benjjneb github io dada2 tutorial html callahan et al 2016 the high quality reads were clustered as amplicon sequence variants asvs at 100 sequence identity the taxonomic annotation of 16s rdna and 18s rdna reads was performed by rdp classifier by using silva v138 1 quast et al 2013 and pr2 v 4 10 databases guillou et al 2013 respectively we randomly used 38 305 sequences per sample to normalize sequencing effects across the samples for bacteria while 236 616 sequence used for microeukaryotes the normalized final data sets retained 34 622 bacterial asvs 10 092 asvs in water and 26 909 asvs in sediment whereas 21 935 microeukaryote asvs 14 690 asvs in water and 13 392 asvs in sediment 2 4 functional annotation of bacteria and microeukaryotes the functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax was analyzed to predict functional characteristics of bacterial communities louca et al 2016 further assigned bacterial function groups as carbon nitrogen sulfur cycles and pathogens presented by heatmap and bar plots this analysis was performed in the python environment v 3 9 the functional annotation of the microeukaryotic communities corresponding to absence or presence of pigment in taxa was as described in previous studies de vargas et al 2015 simon et al 2015 xue et al 2018 adl et al 2019 the pigmented microeukaryotes are defined as phototrophs and mixotrophs while non pigmented taxa were denoted as heterotrophs and parasites unidentified taxa i e taxon at the unknown genus level were assigned to unknown function adl et al 2019 2 5 habitat generalist and specialists the habitat generalists and specialists of bacterial and microeukaryotic asvs were identified based on habitat specialization values with permutation algorithms 1000 permutations by using the ecolutils https github com guillemsalazar ecolutils salazar 2022 the asvs were identified as habitat generalists or specialists on the basis of observed habitat specialization values exceeding the upper 95 confidence interval or falling below the lower 95 confidence interval respectively in this method each water body treated as an individual habitat while levins niche breadth shannon diversity and occurrence frequency of bacterial and microeukaryotic asvs were calculated separately and finally shared asvs of three methods were considered as generalists and specialists fig s2 these analyses were performed in r v 3 5 0 r core team 2020 we identified 1101 and 856 asvs as habitat generalists and 3281 and 1238 asvs as habitat specialists for bacteria and microeukaryotes respectively 2 6 data analyses 2 6 1 diversity and community composition the variation in asv richness shannon wiener pielou s evenness and simpson diversity were computed in the diverse function in primer v 7 0 21 anderson et al 2008 the effects of habitat and pollution on bacterial and microeukaryotic biodiversity additionally were tested by one way anova in spss v 22 0 xue et al 2018 the variation in community composition was exhibited by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarity after square root transformation anderson et al 2008 clarke and gorley 2015 while the significant differences between water and sediment as well as non urban and urban pollution sites were tested by anosim analysis of similarity anderson and walsh 2013 clarke and gorley 2015 2 6 2 the contribution of stochastic and deterministic processes on community assembly to explore the importance of neutral processes in community assembly we first evaluated the fit of sloan s neutral community model ncm sloan et al 2006 the asvs occurrence frequency in a set of local communities and their regional relative abundances across the wider metacommunity were used for describing neutral distribution of asvs hubbell 2001 sloan et al 2006 zhou and ning 2017 further the pairwise phylogenetic turnover between communities was calculated as the mean nearest taxon distance metric βmntd and the β nearest taxon index βnti is the difference between observed βmntd and mean of the null distribution of βmntd normalized with its standard deviation stegen et al 2012 the phylogenetic signal occurs when more closely related species are more ecologically similar and it quantitatively estimates the percentage of compositional turnover linked to deterministic and stochastic processes zhou and ning 2017 stegen et al 2012 βnti values 2 and 2 indicated that the community was driven by heterogenous selection and homogeneous selection respectively the relative contribution of dispersal limitation was calculated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 while the relative contribution of homogenizing dispersal was assessed as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the ecological drift unidentified was calculated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 2 6 3 relationship between microbial communities and environmental factors the significant spatial variation of environmental factors was assessed by permanova with monte carlo tests 9999 permutations anderson and walsh 2013 while environmental heterogeneity of environmental factors was assessed by principal coordinate analysis pcoa using primer v 7 0 21 anderson et al 2008 clarke and gorley 2015 to model the percentage of community variation accounted for by each of the environmental variables we conducted distance based linear modeling distlm the marginal test was performed to determine how individual variables explain the relationship and the sequential tests showed the cumulative proportion of the variation explained using forward selection by fitting the variables sequentially with 9999 permutations at p 0 05 further to observe the response of bacteria and microeukaryotes including whole community habitat generalist and specialists in water and sediment habitats the second step of the distlm was used to partition environmental factors based on the adjusted r square adj r2 using the permanova function in primer anderson et al 2008 to explore biotic species species and abiotic species environmental factor interactions we constructed co occurrence network for water and sediment samples respectively newman 2006 to minimize complexity and false positive prediction only asvs containing more than 20 sequences were chosen for network construction barberan et al 2012 xue et al 2018 abdullah al et al 2021 the possible pairwise spearmen s rank correlations were calculated by the picante package in r the significant p 0 01 and strongly correlated r 0 80 asvs and environmental variables were incorporated into network analyses using gephi v 0 9 2 visualization each node in the network represented each asv or environmental variable while the edges in the network were weighted by the strength of the correlation between two nodes and the degree was considered as the number of correlations further the louvain community detection algorithm network modules was applied for describing network topological properties blondel et al 2008 martín gonzález et al 2010 tikhonov et al 2017 asvs were detected as keystone taxon in the network if asv has higher degree 100 and lower betweenness centrality 5000 xue et al 2018 2 7 data availability the raw sequence data for 16s rrna and 18s rrna genes have been stored in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under bioproject numbers prjna772367 and prjna729577 respectively all raw sequences data of 16s rrna and 18s rrna genes have also been submitted to the node the national omics data encyclopedia database under the project ids oep002820 and oep002081 respectively https www biosino org node 3 results 3 1 community composition diversity and functional profile of microbial communities in water and sediment habitats the bray curtis based beta diversity of both bacteria and microeukaryotes including the habitat generalists and specialists showed stronger significant differences between water and sediment habitats than those of pollution categories and pollution levels tables 1 and s2 further all samples were partitioned into mainly two clusters either between water and sediment or between non urban pollution and urban pollution sites fig s3 the anosim tests showed higher global r values for the bacterial overall communities habitat generalist and specialists than those of microeukaryotic overall communities habitat generalist and specialists table 1 indicating the effects of habitat was more pronounced for bacterial communities than microeukaryotic communities the mean shannon wiener index values were 5 47 0 48 in water and 6 90 0 42 in sediment for bacterial overall communities while were 5 50 0 52 and 5 56 0 64 for microeukaryotic overall communities in water and sediment respectively fig 1 a both bacteria and microeukaryotes had higher asv richness in sediment than water with 6 87 shared bacterial asvs 57 14 sequences and 28 08 shared microeukaryotes asvs 88 43 sequences fig 1a in this study the mean shannon wiener index showed no significant difference for bacterial overall communities across four pollution levels both in water and sediment while shannon wiener index of microeukaryotic overall communities showed significant variation between light and moderate pollution water fig 1b further all biodiversity indexes without simpson index of bacterial habitat specialists of bacterial habitat generalists and specialists showed significant variation between water and sediment habitats but non significant difference was found for microeukaryotes table 2 additionally the asv richness of both bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat generalists and specialists showed significant variation between non urban and urban pollution sites table 2 only simpson index of bacterial habitat specialists and asv richness of microeukaryotic habitat specialists showed significant variation across four pollution levels table 2 overall actinobacteria bacteroidetes campylobacteria chloroflexi cyanobacteria desulfobacteria and verrucomicrobiota were dominant bacterial taxa fig 1c and the functional prediction analysis revealed 64 functional groups were related to carbon nitrogen sulfur cycles and pathogens group fig s4 as for microeukaryotes apicomplexa chlorophyta ciliophora cryptophyta fungi katablepharidophyta metazoa streptophyta and stramenopiles were the dominant taxa fig 1c and belonging to phototrophs mixotrophs heterotrophs parasites and unknown function figs 1d and s5 the mean functional compositions of both bacteria and microeukaryotes showed heterogenous structure between water and sediment across pollution levels figs s4 and s5 the bacterial functional groups related to carbon and oxygen cycles were relatively higher in non urban polluted site while nitrogen sulfur and pathogens were found higher in moderately to heavily polluted sites both in water and sediment fig 1d among the microeukaryotic functional groups phototrophs and mixotrophs were greater in non urban polluted site in water whereas more heterotrophs were found in moderately and heavily polluted sites in sediment fig 1d 3 2 community assembly mechanisms of bacteria and microeukaryotes in water and sediment the relationship between the distribution and relative abundance of asvs accounted for 50 4 and 44 9 of the variation in total bacterial and microeukaryotic communities fig 2 a the neutral community model ncm explained 50 7 of bacterial community variation in water and 67 5 in sediment while the model accounted for 37 8 and 48 3 of community variations for microeukaryotes in water and sediment respectively fig 2a these variations were mainly driven by stronger selection processes which explained 79 2 and 70 3 variation in bacterial and microeukaryotic overall communities respectively while the contribution of dispersal limitation was 20 8 and 29 7 respectively fig 2b the null model roughly explained 88 9 and 82 6 of community structural variation in bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in water while 94 2 and 91 1 in sediment respectively fig 2b the ncm model explained only 30 7 community variation for bacterial habitat generalists and 10 7 for habitat specialists while it explained 39 6 and 59 3 for microeukaryotic habitat generalists and specialists respectively fig 2a further null model showed that both processes were important in shaping community assembly of habitat generalists and specialists fig 2b the model accounted for 64 9 and 53 9 of community structural variation in bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat generalists while stochastic processes drove 60 1 and 76 9 of bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat specialists respectively fig 2b by comparing generalists and specialists in water and sediment habitats generalists were more neutrally distributed than specialists and the model fitted values were higher in sediment than water from the ncm model fig 2a the null model approach showed that different mechanisms contributed to bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat generalists in water fig 2b showing that the stochastic processes explained 69 0 i e homogenizing dispersal and undominated of variation in bacterial habitat generalists while deterministic processes explained 61 0 i e homogenous selection of microeukaryotic habitat generalists fig 2b on the other hand specialists were primarily driven by stochastic processes of dispersal limitation and undominated processes which accounted for 65 8 and 90 0 of variation in both bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat specialists respectively fig 2b in sediment bacterial habitat generalists were strongly driven by deterministic processes 75 8 while microeukaryotic habitat specialists were mainly driven by stochastic processes 72 7 fig 2b both processes jointly contributed to bacterial habitat specialists and roughly 58 3 and 41 7 of their variations were driven by stochastic and deterministic processes respectively whereas 48 5 and 51 5 of microeukaryotic habitat generalists respectively fig 2b 3 3 factors controlling community assembly of bacteria and microeukaryotes in water and sediment our results revealed that bacteria and microeukaryotes including habitat generalists and specialists responded to the environment factors differently fig 3 and table s3 in water bacteria and microeukaryotes showed the highest response to physicochemical factors 31 17 vs 24 78 followed by nutrients 16 37 vs 12 20 and dissolved gasses 12 58 vs 6 16 heavy metals 6 04 vs 6 04 and primary productivity 4 02 vs 6 54 fig 3a this indicated that microbial communities are vulnerable to environmental stresses including physicochemical condition anthropogenic nutrients load voscs and heavy metals in sediment bacterial communities mainly responded to nutrients 23 12 followed by dissolved gasses 8 85 and physicochemical 8 82 while microeukaryotes significantly responded to physicochemical 22 74 followed by primary production 5 02 and dissolved gasses 4 07 fig 3b overall the model accounted for 70 19 and 55 71 of community assembly variations for bacterial and microeukaryotic overall communities in water fig 3a respectively while 40 80 and 31 83 of community variations were found in sediment fig 3b in term of habitat generalists and specialists bacterial habitat specialists showed strong responses to environmental factors 67 25 in water and 35 01 in sediment while generalists responded to 33 62 and 36 15 in water and sediment respectively fig 3 the responses of microeukaryotic habitat generalists were 44 64 in water and 32 27 in sediment whereas specialists were 40 53 and 12 55 in water and sediment respectively fig 3 together our findings indicated significant influence of multiple environment stressors on water and sediment microbial community assembly in urban waterbodies additionally the geographical distance of the sampling sites spatial factors showed a significantly stronger influence on bacterial 13 53 and microeukaryotic overall communities 14 75 as well as habitat generalist 15 15 for bacteria and 19 94 for microeukaryotes and specialist 12 58 for bacteria and 19 03 for microeukaryotes in sediment habitat fig 3b the distance decay process on sediment microbial communities was stronger in urban sediment 12 than that in water habitat 7 fig 3 and table s3 3 4 microbial cross kingdom co occurrence in water and sediment the integrated microbial co occurrence network consisted of 6580 nodes asvs 99 60 positive and 0 40 negative correlations 65 535 edges in water whereas there were 8028 nodes with 99 57 positive and 0 43 negative correlations 65 535 edges in the sediment fig 4 a b and table 3 we found a strong modular structure in both water and sediment networks with a modularity value 0 80 in water and 0 89 in sediment such higher modularity indicated a complex microbial network structure table 3 the microbial networks in water and sediment clearly defined into eight major modules which accounted for more than 90 nodes of the whole networks fig 4a b the percentage of bacterial asvs in eight main modules were 10 13 17 45 22 35 27 57 10 16 8 40 23 30 and 35 59 in water while 25 76 43 06 22 27 27 90 22 31 31 57 18 35 and 39 74 in sediment microbial network fig 4a b indicating that bacterial interactions may have influence in shaping cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic network structure moreover the water microbial network had a slightly higher degree 19 92 vs 16 33 but clustering coefficient 0 53 vs 0 59 path length 7 37 vs 7 63 closeness centrality 0 23 vs 0 24 and betweenness centrality 13 399 62 vs 14 893 04 were lower in water than in sediment table 3 suggesting that microbial network structure was different between water and sediment habitats furthermore in each module the number of habitat specialists asvs were substantially higher than generalists and they belonged to actinobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflexi firmicutes and proteobacteria of the bacterial taxa and alveolata archaeplastida excavata opisthokonta and stramenopiles of the microeukaryotic taxa fig 4b the percentage of bacterial habitat generalists accounted for 1 61 106 out of 6580 and 1 69 136 out of 8028 nodes in water and sediment microbial networks respectively while microeukaryotic generalists were 4 09 269 out of 6580 nodes and 3 53 283 out of 8028 nodes in water and sediment respectively fig 4a the percentage of bacterial habitat specialists were 3 36 221 out of 6580 nodes and 3 03 243 out of 8028 nodes while microeukaryotic specialists were 10 82 712 out of 6580 nodes and 7 96 639 out of 8028 nodes in water and sediment microbial networks respectively fig 4a our cross kingdom bacteria and microeukaryotes microbial network analyses have found 57 keystone taxa in water whereas 100 taxa in sediment and interestingly all keystone taxa were belonged to microeukaryotes both in water and sediment fig 4b among them thirteen microeukaryotic habitat specialists out of 57 were keystone in water while fifty six out of 100 were keystone in the sediment habitat fig 4b thus the results suggest that microeukaryotic habitat specialists have a significant role in regulating microbial network structure in water and sediment habitats 4 discussion 4 1 taxonomic and functional community profile of bacteria and microeukaryotes across habitat type although microbial diversity was higher in sediment we observed a higher bacterial asv richness in sediment than in water but the opposite was found for microeukaryotes fig 1a in line with our results recent work reported that sediment acts as a reservoir recruiting deposited microbes from surroundings e g soil sands and plant debris while decomposition driven increases in nutrients can profoundly increase bacterial diversity in sediment zhang et al 2021 on the other hand microeukaryotic communities are susceptible to water environmental conditions such as ph do water flow and temperature abdullah al et al 2021 gad et al 2022 meanwhile after partitioning community composition our results showed a strong significant variation between water and sediment habitats while a moderate level of effect was observed for non urban and urban pollution table 1 indicating that the effect of habitat diversification was stronger than those of pollution effects on bacterial and microeukaryotic microbial community composition recent study has shown that habitat types e g water and sediment were the main factors for the differences in community structure rather than different landforms for prokaryotic microbiota in glacier fed ecosystems zhang et al 2021 consistently bacterial overall communities including habitat generalists and specialists showed more variations in terms of diversity and composition than those of microeukaryotes tables 1 and 2 however the moderate level of pollution effect on bacterial and microeukaryotic community composition was consistent with previous studies considering protists in pearl river china zou et al 2021 and different urban reservoirs lakes tributaries and rivers abdullah al et al 2021 where anthropogenic stressors such as pollution and water logging disturbances were the main factors for community variation bacterial functional prediction and microeukaryotic community function profile showed heterogenous structure between water and sediment across pollution levels fig 1d it has been shown that nitrogen cycle associated and pathogenic bacteria were higher in heavily polluted water and sediment figs 1d and s4 indicating strong urban runoff and anthropogenic pollution increased nitrification denitrification and pathogenic bacteria furthermore the higher relative abundance in microeukaryotic phototrophs and mixotrophs in non urban polluted water and higher heterotrophs in moderately to heavily polluted sediments figs 1d and s5 indicated their different contributions in transferring carbon and nutrients across habitat types the study by zhang et al 2019 in the black odor urban river jinchuan river a contaminated river in china and study by kim et al 2016 in the santa fe ranch tributaries of north florida usa showed similarities with our results that anthropogenic activities industrial and agricultural runoff act as non point sources of decreasing ecosystem function across habitat types 4 2 contrasting mechanisms underlying the community assembly of microbial habitat generalists and specialists to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to compare the assembly mechanisms of bacteria and microeukaryotes including their habitat generalists and specialists in water and its underlaying sediment in urban aquatic ecosystems fig 2 very few studies have investigated the structure of prokaryotic vs microeukaryotic communities either in water or in sediment habitat logares et al 2018 gad et al 2020 in this study we found a comparatively higher number of habitat specialists than generalists for both bacteria and microeukaryotes fig s2 such higher numbers of specialists would have been expected in a scenario of strong environmental selection logares et al 2013 and indicated that microbial community assemblage was mainly regulated by species sorting environmental selection and niche partitioning stegen et al 2012 monard et al 2016 graham and stegen 2017 consistently our findings revealed that community assembly of bacteria and microeukaryotes overall communities were driven by deterministic processes of homogenous selection in both water and sediment habitats fig 2b in this study our results showed that bacterial overall communities were more neutrally distributed by stochastic processes than those of microeukaryotes fig 2a with smaller cell size and higher metabolic rates of bacteria compared to the microeukaryotes ecological stochasticity is higher for bacteria hubbell 2001 sloan et al 2006 vass et al 2020 gad et al 2020 which is consistent with our present findings gad et al 2020 investigated the microeukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in the anthropogenically polluted jiulong river watershed areas in china showing that stochastic processes were stronger divers of community structure in prokaryotic communities than they were in microeukaryotic communities additionally using ncm in 49 lakes of paris french by roguet et al 2015 reported model fits of 76 bacterial community variation while östman et al 2010 in lakes streams or rock pools reported 85 variation for bacterial communities in line with another study chen et al 2019b reported a fit of 89 9 for microeukaryotic communities in a subtropical river reservoir system indicating dominance of stochastic processes in shaping eukaryotic microbial communities however our study showed lowers model fitted values than those of previous studies which indicating that urban pollution might be contributed to stronger environmental selection on microbial community structure fig 2b by comparing community assembly mechanisms of the generalists and specialists in water and sediment habitats generalists were more neutrally distributed than specialists and the model fitted values were higher in sediment than water from the ncm model fig 2a which is supported by previous studies that due to their broader niche width than specialists and less affected by environmental changes pandit et al 2009 monard et al 2016 liao et al 2016 gad et al 2020 although habitat generalists in sediment accounted a bit higher value by neutral model however null model clearly shown that community assembly of bacterial habitat generalists were mainly driven by heterogenous selection and microeukaryotic habitat generalists were driven by homogenous selection with a limited contribution of dispersal and drift fig 2b indicating that both neutral and niche processes are important in shaping their community assembly in urban polluted waterbodies generally sediment acts as a seed bank of resting propagules such as pollen seeds spores and eggs which form less sensitive to environmental changes pandit et al 2009 liao et al 2016 gad et al 2020 consistently our results showed that in total 40 80 bacterial community variation and 31 83 microeukaryotic community variation in sediment were explained by environmental factors which were lower than those of water respectively fig 3 the community assembly mechanisms of microbes can be driven by stochastic processes e g birth growth mutation and trade off as well as different niche widths and environmental tolerance bahram et al 2016 kong et al 2019 hou et al 2019 a previous study stated that mass effect and ecological drift were the main drivers for stochastic distribution of small soil eukaryote communities bahram et al 2016 while different environmental conditions increased determinisms to bacterial communities hou et al 2019 thus our results clearly elucidated a stronger influence of deterministic processes e g homogenous selection in shaping community assembly of microeukaryotic generalists and a stronger stochastic influence e g dispersal and ecological drift on habitat specialists including bacterial habitat generalists in water habitat fig 2b which is supported by the findings of study in anthropogenically affected the jiulong river china gad et al 2020 furthermore deterministic processes selection strongly drove the sediment bacterial habitat generalists and stochastic processes dispersal were influenced on microeukaryotic habitat specialists in sediment habitat which are consistent with qualitative conclusions from previous studies showing that selection and dispersal limitation have detectable influence on microbial communities in sediment habitat bahram et al 2016 stegen et al 2013 hou et al 2019 although direct comparable studies concerning bacteria and microeukaryotes and water versus sediment comparisons are still limited our findings reveal significant insights into community assembly mechanisms of bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat generalist and specialists in urban polluted waterbodies where anthropogenic pollution may favor stronger selection over neutral dynamics on microbial community assembly 4 3 bacterial and microeukaryotic communities responded differently to environmental factors it has been confirmed that the proportion of variation in bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in the urban black odor waterbodies were more likely to be affected by multiple stressors of water physicochemical water nutrients algal production heavy metals water dissolved gasses and sediment nutrients fig 3 recent studies in freshwater lakes reservoirs and tributaries disclosed that physicochemical variables yang et al 2016 liao et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 zou et al 2021 nutrient pollution heavy metals cosmetics and drugs have significant negative impacts on shaping microbial communities and the degree of effects vary with habitats and locations yangi et al 2010 abdullah al et al 2021 lu et al 2021 gad et al 2022 our results indicated that habitat generalists and specialists have varying responses to changes in the environmental factors and a higher degree of response was found for bacterial habitat specialists in water than those of sediment fig 3 and table s3 suggesting that bacterial habitat specialists could be attributed to a higher sensitivity to certain environmental changes in water importantly strong distance decay processes on sediment microbial communities indicated stronger biogeographic pattern of microbial communities in sediment than those of water this is consistent with previous studies in lakes hubbell 2001 logares et al 2013 and rivers suhonen et al 2014 debroas et al 2017 4 4 the role of generalists and specialists on cross kingdom microbial co occurrence network based on our results we found complex microbial network structure and modular association with strong species species and species environment interactions fig 4 and table 3 it is commonly believed that the modular structure of complex networks plays an important role in their functionality and community stability montoya et al 2006 barberan et al 2012 xue et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the topological properties suggested different mechanisms between water and sediment while taxonomic relatedness of bacteria and microeukaryotes might imply the importance of bacterial coexistence in keeping microeukaryotic community functions e g material cycles and energy transfer from bacteria to metazoa by n2 fixation or photo symbiosis consistently one recent study showed that bacterial communities have significant impact on protistan community assembly and stability zou et al 2021 our results showed that microbial networks in water and sediment habitats were complex and had strong modular structure suggesting that cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic interactions might have great significance in shaping community dynamics in both habitats it has been well documented that species interaction can drive the community dynamics which in turn stabilizes an ecological community in the ecosystem montoya et al 2006 newman 2006 poisot et al 2012 liu et al 2019 furthermore our results showed that the number of habitat specialists was substantially higher than generalists fig 4b previous studies shown that rare taxa may play an important role in species interactions than abundant ones in microbial networks xue et al 2018 liu et al 2019 in our study we found that all keystone taxa were belonged to microeukaryotic habitat specialists both in water and sediment microbial networks it is commonly believed that keystone taxa have ability to buffer against stress on structure of ecological network and their removal can cause a dramatic shift in microbial structure and function banerjee et al 2018 therefore our results suggesting that microeukaryotic habitat specialists have potential role in shaping modular structure of cross kingdom microbial community interactions in water and sediment habitats 5 conclusion our results showed that the bacterial biodiversity clearly differed between water and sediment across an urban pollution gradient while microeukaryotic biodiversity did not distinct community composition of bacteria and microeukaryotes between water and underlaying sediment indicated their environmental vulnerabilities and preferences however sediment microbial communities exhibited a stronger distance decay pattern than those of water microbial communities in general the community assembly of bacterial and microeukaryotic overall communities were shaped by selection processes with a little dispersal limitation especially in water however community assembly mechanisms of habitat generalists and specialists showed a different pattern in water stochastic processes dominated for the bacterial habitat generalists while deterministic processes dominated for the microeukaryotic habitat generalists the habitat specialists of bacteria and microeukaryotes were strongly driven by undominated and dispersal limitation processes in water respectively in sediment both stochastic and deterministic processes were important for sediment bacterial habitat specialists and microeukaryotic habitat generalists however bacterial habitat generalists were strongly driven by heterogeneous selection while microeukaryotic habitat specialists were mainly driven by dispersal limitation further our study elucidates a greater influence of microbial habitat specialists in cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic co occurrence network modular associations in water and sediment habitats thus our results provide advance knowledge on explaining community assembly differences of bacteria and

15864,urban freshwater ecosystems have important ecosystem functions provide habitats for diverse microbial communities and are susceptible to multiple interconnected factors such as environmental pollution despite the ecological significance of bacteria and microeukaryotes little is known about how their community assembly responds to various environmental factors across water and sediment habitats and ecological processes shaping them here environmental dna based approaches were used to investigate the community assembly processes of bacteria and microeukaryotes including habitat generalists and specialists in urban water and sediment across an urban pollution gradient in wuhan central china the diversity community composition and potential function of bacteria and microeukaryotes showed significantly stronger variation between water and sediment than across an urban pollution gradient although bacterial and microeukaryotic community assemblies were dominated by strong selection processes in both water and sediment habitats but a contrasting community assembly mechanism was identified between habitat generalists and specialists bacterial and microeukaryotic communities showed a greater response to physicochemical variability in water while a strong distance decay relationship was found in sediment further cross kingdom microbial network analysis revealed strong modular associations of bacteria and microeukaryotes meanwhile microeukaryotic habitat specialists might be keystone but generalists have higher proportion of connections in the networks this study provides significant insights into the response of bacteria and microeukaryotes to different urban pollutions between water and sediment and the ecological processes structuring microbial community dynamics across habitat types under anthropogenic disturbances graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacteria microeukaryotes urban environment community ecology volatile organic compounds heavy metals 1 introduction urban water and sediment qualities are major issues among freshwater ecosystems worldwide affected by rapid urbanization processes and industrial pollution lee et al 2016 gad et al 2020 isaza et al 2020 environmental pollution can negatively affect freshwater ecosystems because exposure of individual or mixed pollutants may lead to changes in the composition and function of aquatic microbial communities dai et al 2017 ji et al 2017 rosi et al 2018 abdullah al et al 2021 however the responses of bacteria and microeukaryotes to different environmental factors are not yet clear thus deciphering their responses is necessary to understand the structuring of microbial communities and to predict the community response to environmental changes urban waterbodies e g rivers lakes drains open channels and tributaries provide habitats for diverse microbial communities that serve important ecosystem functions abdullah al et al 2021 gad et al 2022 biodiversity and associated ecosystem processes are increasingly stressed by multiple and often interconnected factors in urbanized areas such as the city of wuhan in central china where human induced stressors have arisen from all corners i e household industrial hospital and municipality therefore a timely and comprehensive assessment of microbial biodiversity or biogeographic distribution and its driving forces are of great significance to reveal the ecological mechanisms that maintain ecosystem functions and to predict the response of aquatic ecosystems to urbanization driven anthropogenic pollution however relatively little is known about microbial cross kingdom bacteria and microeukaryotes diversity and distribution patterns in water and sediment habitats here we hypothesized that urbanization driven anthropogenic pollution causes contrasting community structure and function of bacteria and microeukaryotes in urban water and its underlaying sediment due to ubiquitous distribution bacteria and microeukaryotes significantly contribute to global carbon fluxes biogeochemical cycles and water quality in ecosystems chen et al 2019a 2019b gad et al 2022 while they coexist in habitat they impart different effects on microbial community dynamics and ecosystem stability sloan et al 2006 logares et al 2018 gad et al 2020 in addition the wide distribution of microbial habitat generalists can contribute to ecosystem stability sloan et al 2006 yang et al 2016 chen et al 2019a while the narrower niche width of habitat specialists facilitates quick responses within varied environmental conditions and creates susceptibility to pollution level liao et al 2016 gad et al 2020 different pollutants are known as the main casual factors of community instability and reduced associated ecosystem functions either by changing static water conditions or by degrading sediment quality liao et al 2017 gad et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 it is generally accepted that the assembly of microbial communities is regulated by both deterministic and stochastic processes where deterministic processes influence the fitness of microbial communities and stochastic processes unpredictably changes the community structure by generating independent species assemblages sloan et al 2006 stegen et al 2012 bahram et al 2016 chen et al 2019b although community assembly of bacteria logares et al 2013 liao et al 2016 2017 or microeukaryotes bahram et al 2016 chen et al 2019b gad et al 2020 in different water or sediment habitats is well documented however a comprehensive study of cross kingdom bacteria and microeukaryotes together in water and its underlaying sediment habitats is still limited especially different levels of urban polluted waterbodies logares et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 2021 therefore it is necessary to understand whether bacterial and microeukaryotic communities show similar community patterns or contrast each other furthermore biotic interactions i e predation mutualism and competition abiotic environmental factors ph temperature and salinity and nutrients can determine or influence the community assembly patterns stegen et al 2012 bahram et al 2016 zhou and ning 2017 zou et al 2021 it is commonly believed that the modular structure of complex microbial co occurrence networks plays an important role in organisms functional attributes in ecosystems such as material cycling and energy fluxes poisot et al 2012 xue et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ratzke et al 2020 hence uncovering the cross kingdom species interactions in the microbial co occurrence network is of great importance to better comprehend the ecological structure of microbial communities to address the knowledge gaps in this study we investigated the significant drivers of water and sediment dowelling bacteria and microeukaryotes including habitat generalists and specialists and their community assembly processes from 20 waterbodies in wuhan city along a pollution gradient the aims of this study were to 1 compare the diversity composition and functional structure of bacteria and microeukaryotes in water and sediment habitats across a pollution gradient 2 disentangle the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes driving the community assembly of bacteria and microeukaryotes including habitat generalists and specialists and 3 determine the influence of habitat generalists and specialists on the cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic community interactions in water and sediment habitats 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection wuhan is one of the most populated and urbanized cities in central china more than twelve million inhabitants live within 8500 km² in this city although it has many lakes recreational waterbodies and large rivers i e yangtze and han rivers recent study has shown that rapid urbanization driven pollution i e anthropogenic nitrogen has strongly contributed to increasing urban black and odorous water with different levels of pollution and such polluted black odorous water has significant negative influence on water quality and aquatic biodiversity abdullah al et al 2021 in this study water and sediment samples were collected in may 2019 from nineteen urban waterbodies and one non urban waterbody to assess a comprehensive cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic community assemblages between water and sediment along an urban pollution gradient the urban waterbodies were comprising 6 shallow rivers 11 open channels wastewater carrying drains to rivers 1 lake reservoir and 1 tributary while the non urban drinking water reservoir was mulan lake fig s1 and table s1 the chinese ministry of housing and urban rural development classified urban black odor water into different levels of pollution based on chemical parameters namely transparency dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential and ammonium nitrogen scale is given in bottom of the fig s1 therefore all nineteen waterbodies were in the black and odorous water category with light l moderate m and heavy h pollution levels cao et al 2020 abdullah al et al 2021 mulan lake is a drinking water reservoir thus we denoted it as non urban polluted because the source of the pollutants was either from forested land wash or agriculture among the 40 samples including 20 water and 20 sediment samples 2 samples were categorized as non urban polluted waterbody 12 samples were lightly polluted 16 were moderately polluted and 10 samples were heavily polluted waterbodies the name of

filtered by a 200 µm sieve to removal large particles and debris three replicated water samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm pore polycarbonate membrane 47 mm in diameter millipore billerica ma usa in different volumes considering water pollution level specifically 700 800 ml for drinking water reservoir 200 350 ml for lightly and moderately polluted water and 100 200 ml for heavily polluted water respectively filtered membranes were stored at 80 ºc until dna extraction sediment at the water sediment interface was collected by horizontal dragging of a sediment collector and was preserved at 20 ºc in the field then immediately brought to the laboratory and preserved at 80 ºc three replicated sediment samples were mixed well before dna extraction and subsequent analyses such as nutrient measurements dna was directly extracted from filter membranes and wet sediments using the fastdna spin kit and the fastprep instrument mp biomedicales santa ana ca usa the hypervariable v3 4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna gene and v9 region of microeukaryotic 18s rrna gene were amplified following previous studies amaral zettler et al 2009 liu et al 2017 nyirabuhoro et al 2021 the pcr reaction was setup as follows initial 5 min at 95 ºc 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 ºc 30 s at 55 ºc and 30 s at 72 ºc then followed by 5 min extension at 72 ºc at the end of amplification three replicated purified pcr products were pooled in equal quantity and then sequenced on an illumina platform illumina inc san diego ca usa the raw paired end reads were denoised and assembled by using dada2 v1 16 0 https benjjneb github io dada2 tutorial html callahan et al 2016 the high quality reads were clustered as amplicon sequence variants asvs at 100 sequence identity the taxonomic annotation of 16s rdna and 18s rdna reads was performed by rdp classifier by using silva v138 1 quast et al 2013 and pr2 v 4 10 databases guillou et al 2013 respectively we randomly used 38 305 sequences per sample to normalize sequencing effects across the samples for bacteria while 236 616 sequence used for microeukaryotes the normalized final data sets retained 34 622 bacterial asvs 10 092 asvs in water and 26 909 asvs in sediment whereas 21 935 microeukaryote asvs 14 690 asvs in water and 13 392 asvs in sediment 2 4 functional annotation of bacteria and microeukaryotes the functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax was analyzed to predict functional characteristics of bacterial communities louca et al 2016 further assigned bacterial function groups as carbon nitrogen sulfur cycles and pathogens presented by heatmap and bar plots this analysis was performed in the python environment v 3 9 the functional annotation of the microeukaryotic communities corresponding to absence or presence of pigment in taxa was as described in previous studies de vargas et al 2015 simon et al 2015 xue et al 2018 adl et al 2019 the pigmented microeukaryotes are defined as phototrophs and mixotrophs while non pigmented taxa were denoted as heterotrophs and parasites unidentified taxa i e taxon at the unknown genus level were assigned to unknown function adl et al 2019 2 5 habitat generalist and specialists the habitat generalists and specialists of bacterial and microeukaryotic asvs were identified based on habitat specialization values with permutation algorithms 1000 permutations by using the ecolutils https github com guillemsalazar ecolutils salazar 2022 the asvs were identified as habitat generalists or specialists on the basis of observed habitat specialization values exceeding the upper 95 confidence interval or falling below the lower 95 confidence interval respectively in this method each water body treated as an individual habitat while levins niche breadth shannon diversity and occurrence frequency of bacterial and microeukaryotic asvs were calculated separately and finally shared asvs of three methods were considered as generalists and specialists fig s2 these analyses were performed in r v 3 5 0 r core team 2020 we identified 1101 and 856 asvs as habitat generalists and 3281 and 1238 asvs as habitat specialists for bacteria and microeukaryotes respectively 2 6 data analyses 2 6 1 diversity and community composition the variation in asv richness shannon wiener pielou s evenness and simpson diversity were computed in the diverse function in primer v 7 0 21 anderson et al 2008 the effects of habitat and pollution on bacterial and microeukaryotic biodiversity additionally were tested by one way anova in spss v 22 0 xue et al 2018 the variation in community composition was exhibited by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarity after square root transformation anderson et al 2008 clarke and gorley 2015 while the significant differences between water and sediment as well as non urban and urban pollution sites were tested by anosim analysis of similarity anderson and walsh 2013 clarke and gorley 2015 2 6 2 the contribution of stochastic and deterministic processes on community assembly to explore the importance of neutral processes in community assembly we first evaluated the fit of sloan s neutral community model ncm sloan et al 2006 the asvs occurrence frequency in a set of local communities and their regional relative abundances across the wider metacommunity were used for describing neutral distribution of asvs hubbell 2001 sloan et al 2006 zhou and ning 2017 further the pairwise phylogenetic turnover between communities was calculated as the mean nearest taxon distance metric βmntd and the β nearest taxon index βnti is the difference between observed βmntd and mean of the null distribution of βmntd normalized with its standard deviation stegen et al 2012 the phylogenetic signal occurs when more closely related species are more ecologically similar and it quantitatively estimates the percentage of compositional turnover linked to deterministic and stochastic processes zhou and ning 2017 stegen et al 2012 βnti values 2 and 2 indicated that the community was driven by heterogenous selection and homogeneous selection respectively the relative contribution of dispersal limitation was calculated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 while the relative contribution of homogenizing dispersal was assessed as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the ecological drift unidentified was calculated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 2 6 3 relationship between microbial communities and environmental factors the significant spatial variation of environmental factors was assessed by permanova with monte carlo tests 9999 permutations anderson and walsh 2013 while environmental heterogeneity of environmental factors was assessed by principal coordinate analysis pcoa using primer v 7 0 21 anderson et al 2008 clarke and gorley 2015 to model the percentage of community variation accounted for by each of the environmental variables we conducted distance based linear modeling distlm the marginal test was performed to determine how individual variables explain the relationship and the sequential tests showed the cumulative proportion of the variation explained using forward selection by fitting the variables sequentially with 9999 permutations at p 0 05 further to observe the response of bacteria and microeukaryotes including whole community habitat generalist and specialists in water and sediment habitats the second step of the distlm was used to partition environmental factors based on the adjusted r square adj r2 using the permanova function in primer anderson et al 2008 to explore biotic species species and abiotic species environmental factor interactions we constructed co occurrence network for water and sediment samples respectively newman 2006 to minimize complexity and false positive prediction only asvs containing more than 20 sequences were chosen for network construction barberan et al 2012 xue et al 2018 abdullah al et al 2021 the possible pairwise spearmen s rank correlations were calculated by the picante package in r the significant p 0 01 and strongly correlated r 0 80 asvs and environmental variables were incorporated into network analyses using gephi v 0 9 2 visualization each node in the network represented each asv or environmental variable while the edges in the network were weighted by the strength of the correlation between two nodes and the degree was considered as the number of correlations further the louvain community detection algorithm network modules was applied for describing network topological properties blondel et al 2008 martín gonzález et al 2010 tikhonov et al 2017 asvs were detected as keystone taxon in the network if asv has higher degree 100 and lower betweenness centrality 5000 xue et al 2018 2 7 data availability the raw sequence data for 16s rrna and 18s rrna genes have been

functional profile of microbial communities in water and sediment habitats the bray curtis based beta diversity of both bacteria and microeukaryotes including the habitat generalists and specialists showed stronger significant differences between water and sediment habitats than those of pollution categories and pollution levels tables 1 and s2 further all samples were partitioned into mainly two clusters either between water and sediment or between non urban pollution and urban pollution sites fig s3 the anosim tests showed higher global r values for the bacterial overall communities habitat generalist and specialists than those of microeukaryotic overall communities habitat generalist and specialists table 1 indicating the effects of habitat was more pronounced for bacterial communities than microeukaryotic communities the mean shannon wiener index values were 5 47 0 48 in water and 6 90 0 42 in sediment for bacterial overall communities while were 5 50 0 52 and 5 56 0 64 for microeukaryotic overall communities in water and sediment respectively fig 1 a both bacteria and microeukaryotes had higher asv richness in sediment than water with 6 87 shared bacterial asvs 57 14 sequences and 28 08 shared microeukaryotes asvs 88 43 sequences fig 1a in this study the mean shannon wiener index showed no significant difference for bacterial overall communities across four pollution levels both in water and sediment while shannon wiener index of microeukaryotic overall communities showed significant variation between light and moderate pollution water fig 1b further all biodiversity indexes without simpson index of bacterial habitat specialists of bacterial habitat generalists and specialists showed significant variation between water and sediment habitats but non significant difference was found for microeukaryotes table 2 additionally the asv richness of both bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat generalists and specialists showed significant variation between non urban and urban pollution sites table 2 only simpson index of bacterial habitat specialists and asv richness of microeukaryotic habitat specialists showed significant variation across four pollution levels table 2 overall actinobacteria bacteroidetes campylobacteria chloroflexi cyanobacteria desulfobacteria and verrucomicrobiota were dominant bacterial taxa fig 1c and the functional prediction analysis revealed 64 functional groups were related to carbon nitrogen sulfur cycles and pathogens group fig s4 as for microeukaryotes apicomplexa chlorophyta ciliophora cryptophyta fungi katablepharidophyta metazoa streptophyta and stramenopiles were the dominant taxa fig 1c and belonging to phototrophs mixotrophs heterotrophs parasites and unknown function figs 1d and s5 the mean functional compositions of both bacteria and microeukaryotes showed heterogenous structure between water and sediment across pollution levels figs s4 and s5 the bacterial functional groups related to carbon and oxygen cycles were relatively higher in non urban polluted site while nitrogen sulfur and pathogens were found higher in moderately to heavily polluted sites both in water and sediment fig 1d among the microeukaryotic functional groups phototrophs and mixotrophs were greater in non urban polluted site in water whereas more heterotrophs were found in moderately and heavily polluted sites in sediment fig 1d 3 2 community assembly mechanisms of bacteria and microeukaryotes in water and sediment the relationship between the distribution and relative abundance of asvs accounted for 50 4 and 44 9 of the variation in total bacterial and microeukaryotic communities fig 2 a the neutral community model ncm explained 50 7 of bacterial community variation in water and 67 5 in sediment while the model accounted for 37 8 and 48 3 of community variations for microeukaryotes in water and sediment respectively fig 2a these variations were mainly driven by stronger selection processes which explained 79 2 and 70 3 variation in bacterial and microeukaryotic overall communities respectively while the contribution of dispersal limitation was 20 8 and 29 7 respectively fig 2b the null model roughly explained 88 9 and 82 6 of community structural variation in bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in water while 94 2 and 91 1 in sediment respectively fig 2b the ncm model explained only 30 7 community variation for bacterial habitat generalists and 10 7 for habitat specialists while it explained 39 6 and 59 3 for microeukaryotic habitat generalists and specialists respectively fig 2a further null model showed that both processes were important in shaping community assembly of habitat generalists and specialists fig 2b the model accounted for 64 9 and 53 9 of community structural variation in bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat generalists while stochastic processes drove 60 1 and 76 9 of bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat specialists respectively fig 2b by comparing generalists and specialists in water and sediment habitats generalists were more neutrally distributed than specialists and the model fitted values were higher in sediment than water from the ncm model fig 2a the null model approach showed that different mechanisms contributed to bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat generalists in water fig 2b showing that the stochastic processes explained 69 0 i e homogenizing dispersal and undominated of variation in bacterial habitat generalists while deterministic processes explained 61 0 i e homogenous selection of microeukaryotic habitat generalists fig 2b on the other hand specialists were primarily driven by stochastic processes of dispersal limitation and undominated processes which accounted for 65 8 and 90 0 of variation in both bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat specialists respectively fig 2b in sediment bacterial habitat generalists were strongly driven by deterministic processes 75 8 while microeukaryotic habitat specialists were mainly driven by stochastic processes 72 7 fig 2b both processes jointly contributed to bacterial habitat specialists and roughly 58 3 and 41 7 of their variations were driven by stochastic and deterministic processes respectively whereas 48 5 and 51 5 of microeukaryotic habitat generalists respectively fig 2b 3 3 factors controlling community assembly of bacteria and microeukaryotes in water and sediment our results revealed that bacteria and microeukaryotes including habitat generalists and specialists responded to the environment factors differently fig 3 and table s3 in water bacteria and microeukaryotes showed the highest response to physicochemical factors 31 17 vs 24 78 followed by nutrients 16 37 vs 12 20 and dissolved gasses 12 58 vs 6 16 heavy metals 6 04 vs 6 04 and primary productivity 4 02 vs 6 54 fig 3a this indicated that microbial communities are vulnerable to environmental stresses including physicochemical condition anthropogenic nutrients load voscs and heavy metals in sediment bacterial communities mainly responded to nutrients 23 12 followed by dissolved gasses 8 85 and physicochemical 8 82 while microeukaryotes significantly responded to physicochemical 22 74 followed by primary production 5 02 and dissolved gasses 4 07 fig 3b overall the model accounted for 70 19 and 55 71 of community assembly variations for bacterial and microeukaryotic overall communities in water fig 3a respectively while 40 80 and 31 83 of community variations were found in sediment fig 3b in term of habitat generalists and specialists bacterial habitat specialists showed strong responses to environmental factors 67 25 in water and 35 01 in sediment while generalists responded to 33 62 and 36 15 in water and sediment respectively fig 3 the responses of microeukaryotic habitat generalists were 44 64 in water and 32 27 in sediment whereas specialists were 40 53 and 12 55 in water and sediment respectively fig 3 together our findings indicated significant influence of multiple environment stressors on water and sediment microbial community assembly in urban waterbodies additionally the geographical distance of the sampling sites spatial factors showed a significantly stronger influence on bacterial 13 53 and microeukaryotic overall communities 14 75 as well as habitat generalist 15 15 for bacteria and 19 94 for microeukaryotes and specialist 12 58 for bacteria and 19 03 for microeukaryotes in sediment habitat fig 3b the distance decay process on sediment microbial communities was stronger in urban sediment 12 than that in water habitat 7 fig 3 and table s3 3 4 microbial cross kingdom co occurrence in water and sediment the integrated microbial co occurrence network consisted of 6580 nodes asvs 99 60 positive and 0 40 negative correlations 65 535 edges in water whereas there were 8028 nodes with 99 57 positive and 0 43 negative correlations 65 535 edges in the sediment fig 4 a b and table 3 we found a strong modular structure in both water and sediment networks with a modularity value 0 80 in water and 0 89 in sediment such higher modularity indicated a complex microbial network structure table 3 the microbial networks in water and sediment clearly defined into eight major modules which accounted for more than 90 nodes of the whole networks fig 4a b the percentage of bacterial asvs in eight main modules were 10 13 17 45 22 35 27 57 10 16 8 40 23 30 and 35 59 in water while 25 76 43 06 22 27 27 90 22 31 31 57 18 35 and 39 74 in sediment microbial network fig 4a b indicating that bacterial interactions may have influence in shaping cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic network structure moreover the water microbial network had a slightly higher degree 19 92 vs 16 33 but clustering coefficient 0 53 vs 0 59 path length 7 37 vs 7 63 closeness centrality 0 23 vs 0 24 and betweenness centrality 13 399 62 vs 14 893 04 were lower in water than in sediment table 3 suggesting that microbial network structure was different between water and sediment habitats furthermore in each module the number of habitat specialists asvs were substantially higher than generalists and they belonged to actinobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflexi firmicutes and proteobacteria of the bacterial taxa and alveolata archaeplastida excavata opisthokonta and stramenopiles of the microeukaryotic taxa fig 4b the percentage of bacterial habitat generalists accounted for 1 61 106 out of 6580 and 1 69 136 out of 8028 nodes in water and sediment microbial networks respectively while microeukaryotic generalists were 4 09 269 out of 6580 nodes and 3 53 283 out of 8028 nodes in water and sediment respectively fig 4a the percentage of bacterial habitat specialists were 3 36 221 out of 6580 nodes and 3 03 243 out of 8028 nodes while microeukaryotic specialists were 10 82 712 out of 6580 nodes and 7 96 639 out of 8028 nodes in water and sediment microbial networks respectively fig 4a our cross kingdom bacteria and microeukaryotes microbial network analyses have found 57 keystone taxa in water whereas 100 taxa in sediment and interestingly all keystone taxa were belonged to microeukaryotes both in water and sediment fig 4b among them thirteen microeukaryotic habitat specialists out of 57 were keystone in water while fifty six out of 100 were keystone in the sediment habitat fig 4b thus the results suggest that microeukaryotic habitat specialists have a significant role in regulating microbial network structure in water and sediment habitats 4 discussion 4 1 taxonomic and functional community profile of bacteria and microeukaryotes across habitat type although microbial diversity was higher in sediment we observed a higher bacterial asv richness in sediment than in water but the opposite was found for microeukaryotes fig 1a in line with our results recent work reported that sediment acts as a reservoir recruiting deposited microbes from surroundings e g soil sands and plant debris while decomposition driven increases in nutrients can profoundly increase bacterial diversity in sediment zhang et al 2021 on the other hand microeukaryotic communities are susceptible to water environmental conditions such as ph do water flow and temperature abdullah al et al 2021 gad et al 2022 meanwhile after partitioning community composition our results showed a strong significant variation between water and sediment habitats while a moderate level of effect was observed for non urban and urban pollution table 1 indicating that the effect of habitat diversification was stronger than those of pollution effects on bacterial and microeukaryotic microbial community composition recent study has shown that habitat types e g water and sediment were the main factors for the differences in community structure rather than different landforms for prokaryotic microbiota in glacier fed ecosystems zhang et al 2021 consistently bacterial overall communities including habitat generalists and specialists showed more variations in terms of diversity and composition than those of microeukaryotes tables 1 and 2 however the moderate level of pollution effect on bacterial and microeukaryotic community composition was consistent with previous studies considering protists in pearl river china zou et al 2021 and different urban reservoirs lakes tributaries and rivers abdullah al et al 2021 where anthropogenic stressors such as pollution and water logging disturbances were the main factors for community variation bacterial functional prediction and microeukaryotic community function profile showed heterogenous structure between water and sediment across pollution levels fig 1d it has been shown that nitrogen cycle associated and pathogenic bacteria were higher in heavily polluted water and sediment figs 1d and s4 indicating strong urban runoff and anthropogenic pollution increased nitrification denitrification and pathogenic bacteria furthermore the higher relative abundance in microeukaryotic phototrophs and mixotrophs in non urban polluted water and higher heterotrophs in moderately to heavily polluted sediments figs 1d and s5 indicated their different contributions in transferring carbon and nutrients across habitat types the study by zhang et al 2019 in the black odor urban river jinchuan river a contaminated river in china and study by kim et al 2016 in the santa fe ranch tributaries of north florida usa showed similarities with our results that anthropogenic activities industrial and agricultural runoff act as non point sources of decreasing ecosystem function across habitat types 4 2 contrasting mechanisms underlying the community assembly of microbial habitat generalists and specialists to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to compare the assembly mechanisms of bacteria and microeukaryotes including their habitat generalists and specialists in water and its underlaying sediment in urban aquatic ecosystems fig 2 very few studies have investigated the structure of prokaryotic vs microeukaryotic communities either in water or in sediment habitat logares et al 2018 gad et al 2020 in this study we found a comparatively higher number of habitat specialists than generalists for both bacteria and microeukaryotes fig s2 such higher numbers of specialists would have been expected in a scenario of strong environmental selection logares et al 2013 and indicated that microbial community assemblage was mainly regulated by species sorting environmental selection and niche partitioning stegen et al 2012 monard et al 2016 graham and stegen 2017 consistently our findings revealed that community assembly of bacteria and microeukaryotes overall communities were driven by deterministic processes of homogenous selection in both water and sediment habitats fig 2b in this study our results showed that bacterial overall communities were more neutrally distributed by stochastic processes than those of microeukaryotes fig 2a with smaller cell size and higher metabolic rates of bacteria compared to the microeukaryotes ecological stochasticity is higher for bacteria hubbell 2001 sloan et al 2006 vass et al 2020 gad et al 2020 which is consistent with our present findings gad et al 2020 investigated the microeukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in the anthropogenically polluted jiulong river watershed areas in china showing that stochastic processes were stronger divers of community structure in prokaryotic communities than they were in microeukaryotic communities additionally using ncm in 49 lakes of paris french by roguet et al 2015 reported model fits of 76 bacterial community variation while östman et al 2010 in lakes streams or rock pools reported 85 variation for bacterial communities in line with another study chen et al 2019b reported a fit of 89 9 for microeukaryotic communities in a subtropical river reservoir system indicating dominance of stochastic processes in shaping eukaryotic microbial communities however our study showed lowers model fitted values than those of previous studies which indicating that urban pollution might be contributed to stronger environmental selection on microbial community structure fig 2b by comparing community assembly mechanisms of the generalists and specialists in water and sediment habitats generalists were more neutrally distributed than specialists and the model fitted values were higher in sediment than water from the ncm model fig 2a which is supported by previous studies that due to their broader niche width than specialists and less affected by environmental changes pandit et al 2009 monard et al 2016 liao et al 2016 gad et al 2020 although habitat generalists in sediment accounted a bit higher value by neutral model however null model clearly shown that community assembly of bacterial habitat generalists were mainly driven by heterogenous selection and microeukaryotic habitat generalists were driven by homogenous selection with a limited contribution of dispersal and drift fig 2b indicating that both neutral and niche processes are important in shaping their community assembly in urban polluted waterbodies generally sediment acts as a seed bank of resting propagules such as pollen seeds spores and eggs which form less sensitive to environmental changes pandit et al 2009 liao et al 2016 gad et al 2020 consistently our results showed that in total 40 80 bacterial community variation and 31 83 microeukaryotic community variation in sediment were explained by environmental factors which were lower than those of water respectively fig 3 the community assembly mechanisms of microbes can be driven by stochastic processes e g birth growth mutation and trade off as well as different niche widths and environmental tolerance bahram et al 2016 kong et al 2019 hou et al 2019 a previous study stated that mass effect and ecological drift were the main drivers for stochastic distribution of small soil eukaryote communities bahram et al 2016 while different environmental conditions increased determinisms to bacterial communities hou et al 2019 thus our results clearly elucidated a stronger influence of deterministic processes e g homogenous selection in shaping community assembly of microeukaryotic generalists and a stronger stochastic influence e g dispersal and ecological drift on habitat specialists including bacterial habitat generalists in water habitat fig 2b which is supported by the findings of study in anthropogenically affected the jiulong river china gad et al 2020 furthermore deterministic processes selection strongly drove the sediment bacterial habitat generalists and stochastic processes dispersal were influenced on microeukaryotic habitat specialists in sediment habitat which are consistent with qualitative conclusions from previous studies showing that selection and dispersal limitation have detectable influence on microbial communities in sediment habitat bahram et al 2016 stegen et al 2013 hou et al 2019 although direct comparable studies concerning bacteria and microeukaryotes and water versus sediment comparisons are still limited our findings reveal significant insights into community assembly mechanisms of bacterial and microeukaryotic habitat generalist and specialists in urban polluted waterbodies where anthropogenic pollution may favor stronger selection over neutral dynamics on microbial community assembly 4 3 bacterial and microeukaryotic communities responded differently to environmental factors it has been confirmed that the proportion of variation in bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in the urban black odor waterbodies were more likely to be affected by multiple stressors of water physicochemical water nutrients algal production heavy metals water dissolved gasses and sediment nutrients fig 3 recent studies in freshwater lakes reservoirs and tributaries disclosed that physicochemical variables yang et al 2016 liao et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 zou et al 2021 nutrient pollution heavy metals cosmetics and drugs have significant negative impacts on shaping microbial communities and the degree of effects vary with habitats and locations yangi et al 2010 abdullah al et al 2021 lu et al 2021 gad et al 2022 our results indicated that habitat generalists and specialists have varying responses to changes in the environmental factors and a higher degree of response was found for bacterial habitat specialists in water than those of sediment fig 3 and table s3 suggesting that bacterial habitat specialists could be attributed to a higher sensitivity to certain environmental changes in water importantly strong distance decay processes on sediment microbial communities indicated stronger biogeographic pattern of microbial communities in sediment than those of water this is consistent with previous studies in lakes hubbell 2001 logares et al 2013 and rivers suhonen et al 2014 debroas et al 2017 4 4 the role of generalists and specialists on cross kingdom microbial co occurrence network based on our results we found complex microbial network structure and modular association with strong species species and species environment interactions fig 4 and table 3 it is commonly believed that the modular structure of complex networks plays an important role in their functionality and community stability montoya et al 2006 barberan et al 2012 xue et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the topological properties suggested different mechanisms between water and sediment while taxonomic relatedness of bacteria and microeukaryotes might imply the importance of bacterial coexistence in keeping microeukaryotic community functions e g material cycles and energy transfer from bacteria to metazoa by n2 fixation or photo symbiosis consistently one recent study showed that bacterial communities have significant impact on protistan community assembly and stability zou et al 2021 our results showed that microbial networks in water and sediment habitats were complex and had strong modular structure suggesting that cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic interactions might have great significance in shaping community dynamics in both habitats it has been well documented that species interaction can drive the community dynamics which in turn stabilizes an ecological community in the ecosystem montoya et al 2006 newman 2006 poisot et al 2012 liu et al 2019 furthermore our results showed that the number of habitat specialists was substantially higher than generalists fig 4b previous studies shown that rare taxa may play an important role in species interactions than abundant ones in microbial networks xue et al 2018 liu et al 2019 in our study we found that all keystone taxa were belonged to microeukaryotic habitat specialists both in water and sediment microbial networks it is commonly believed that keystone taxa have ability to buffer against stress on structure of ecological network and their removal can cause a dramatic shift in microbial structure and function banerjee et al 2018 therefore our results suggesting that microeukaryotic habitat specialists have potential role in shaping modular structure of cross kingdom microbial community interactions in water and sediment habitats 5 conclusion our results showed that the bacterial biodiversity clearly differed between water and sediment across an urban pollution gradient while microeukaryotic biodiversity did not distinct community composition of bacteria and microeukaryotes between water and underlaying sediment indicated their environmental vulnerabilities and preferences however sediment microbial communities exhibited a stronger distance decay pattern than those of water microbial communities in general the community assembly of bacterial and microeukaryotic overall communities were shaped by selection processes with a little dispersal limitation especially in water however community assembly mechanisms of habitat generalists and specialists showed a different pattern in water stochastic processes dominated for the bacterial habitat generalists while deterministic processes dominated for the microeukaryotic habitat generalists the habitat specialists of bacteria and microeukaryotes were strongly driven by undominated and dispersal limitation processes in water respectively in sediment both stochastic and deterministic processes were important for sediment bacterial habitat specialists and microeukaryotic habitat generalists however bacterial habitat generalists were strongly driven by heterogeneous selection while microeukaryotic habitat specialists were mainly driven by dispersal limitation further our study elucidates a greater influence of microbial habitat specialists in cross kingdom bacterial and microeukaryotic co occurrence network modular associations in water and sediment habitats thus our results provide advance knowledge on explaining community assembly differences of bacteria and microeukaryotes including habitat generalists and specialists in urban water and sediment habitats declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interests the authors
