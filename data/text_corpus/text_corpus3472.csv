17360,within a plantwide water and resource recovery facility context an important requirement for a primary sedimentation unit model is the correct fractionation of the settleable portion primary sludge ps of the raw wastewater total suspended solids tss according to the i unbiodegradable particulate organic upo ii biodegradable particulate organic bpo and iii inorganic settleable solid iss components this paper focuses on improving a current tss based primary settling tank pst model to account for correct proportions of these three components with characterized settling velocity groups the steps taken towards development of the primary sedimentation unit model involved the development of a discrete particle settling model in microsoft excel and the utilisation of well characterised municipal wastewater data from previous studies in the discrete particle settling model to reproduce ps and settled wastewater outputs in settling fractions of upo bpo and iss via steady state and dynamic calculations and under strict material mass balances finally the insights obtained from discrete particle settling model calculations were implemented in the development of a dynamic university of cape town primary sedimentation unit uctpsu model this dynamic model was rigorously verified to be internally consistent with regards to material mass balances and utilised to simulate plantwide scenarios under steady state conditions whereby the impact of incorrect characterisation of tss components upo bpo and iss fractions was evaluated from these evaluations it was noted that the incorrect disaggregation of the tss components of primary sludge can lead to incorrect predictions with regard to parameters such as the settled wastewater composition and the activated sludge system capacity thus the investigation revealed the need to measure key wastewater parameters such as particle settling velocities and the upo fraction towards realistically modelling the primary sedimentation unit operations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biodegradability particle settling velocity distribution primary sedimentation model settleometer settling proportions discrete settling 1 introduction wastewater treatment systems are to be converted to facilities that can recover and reuse the by products generated during the treatment process towards developing sustainable infrastructures a relevant process in the development of waste resource recovery facilities wrrf is the anaerobic digestion ad of primary sludge whereby the biodegradable organics are converted to biogas through complex bioprocesses mediated by acidogens acetoclastic methanogens hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetogens ikumi 2011 that could be in turn used towards energy savings therefore a realistic model for the primary sedimentation process that generates this primary sludge is crucial for the accurate prediction of the ad including the energy production potential since primary sedimentation mainly involves complex physical processes of solid liquid separation in primary settling tanks psts it has been difficult to propose models that accurately depicts these mechanisms and hence the pst has been overlooked in plant modelling bachis et al 2015 there has been a lot of research that has contributed towards the development and advancement of pst models some examples include i the model of takács et al 1991 which replicates settling behaviours of solids including discrete flocculent and hindered settling ii ribes et al 2002 pst model that includes sedimentation and compression processes together with biological processes for prediction of volatile fatty acid vfa generation iii the inclusion of computational fluid dynamic cfd in primary settler models he et al 2004 liu and garcia 2011 most of the current models have been able to predict the pst output primary sludge ps from the influent total suspended solids tss and this was done with reasonable accuracy lessard beck 1988 otterpohl freund 1992 gernaey et al 2001 maruejouls et al 2012 bachis et al 2015 table 1 presents a comparative analysis of these models that were used towards the development of the current research amerlinck 2015 recommends the differentiation between organic and inorganic matter as a crucial improvement in pst models required for the succeeding biological treatment for most current models see table 1 the predicted pst solid removals are tss sensitive and do not characterize that removed tss according to its relevant components of unbiodegradable particulate organic upo biodegradable particulate organic bpo and inorganic settleable solids iss this is because the data used to calibrate these models was measured in terms of tss only of which the abovementioned composition was not included in these data collections furthermore when an attempt of the tss removed prediction is performed the composition is usually incorrect with respect to the fractions of its components in fact the tss in these models is assumed to be removed in equal fractions of its constituents and subsequently at the same settling velocity this was first noted by sötemann et al 2005b and recently highlighted in the plant wide configuration of the benchmark simulation model no 2 for phosphorus solon et al 2017 however wentzel et al 2006 and ikumi et al 2014 have observed that upo bpo and iss settle out in the pst in different percentages of 60 70 30 40 and 70 90 respectively it then means that pst models which do not model the removals of the upo bpo and iss materials well do not model the split of these materials between the ps of the anaerobic digester where energy is generated and settled wastewater settled ww of the activated sludge system where energy is consumed well too with the result that the energy self sufficiency of the wastewater treatment plant is not adequately predicted hence a better model for the pst fractionation of the ps and settled ww subsequently is required in order to depict a realistic picture of sedimentation in the pst model the psvd concept maruejouls et al 2012 vallet et al 2014 bachis et al 2015 can serve as a good tool in fact the psvd model can account for solids distribution based on the settling velocity of particles matko et al 1996 therefore it assists in predicting the tss with reasonable accuracy by fractionating it into a limited number of particle groups and assigning time varying settling fractions bachis et al 2015 as such different compounds can be grouped in characterized settling velocity groups to allow the ps to be fractionated into its different components since they settle at different velocities the objective of this paper is therefore to present the development of a realistic pst model which is an improved tss based model with upo bpo and iss in correct proportions the model is expected to predict under steady state and dynamic simulations the primary sludge composition in terms of upo bpo and iss as well as the composition of the settled ww that is treated in subsequent units 2 discrete particle setting model development to propose a realistic model of the pst a discrete particle settling approach was developed into microsoft excel this approach was applied to the particles making up the tss which is categorized into upo bpo and iss the aim of this settling model is to realistically describe sedimentation patterns in a pst of a wwtp with diurnal data such that removals of upo bpo and iss settleable particles is achieved in observed fractions wentzel et al 2006 ikumi et al 2014 which yield the observed ps unbiodegradable and characteristics of the volatile suspended solids vss with regards to the tss vss tss so that the settled ww characteristics can be predicted from the raw wastewater raw ww characteristics and the pst performance the influent wastewater characteristics used in the calculations with the discrete particle settling model were the same as those used in previous publications i e wrc 1984 ekama 2009 2011 and ekama 2017 this wastewater data is made of steady state inputs constant flow and load and dynamic inputs changing flows and loads and comprises all the required measurements for developing the pst model the rationale behind selecting this data set in describing the pst settling model stems from its rigorous data reconciliation process to produce typical sewage characteristics for south african wastewater systems in terms of raw ww settled ww as well as ps characteristics while maintaining mass balances over the pst the raw influent cod concentration used as input to the settling model is fractionated into 5 organics components i e i volatile fatty acids vfa ii fermentable biodegradable soluble organics fbso iii unbiodegradable soluble organics uso iv bpo and v upo to these organics components are added 3 inorganics components which are i free and saline ammonia fsa ii orthophosphate op and iii iss the upo bpo and iss are divided into settleable and non settleable fractions as observed in wentzel et al 2006 and ikumi et al 2014 and together make up the total tss the five organics groups each have a cod carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p to vss mass ratio denoted as fcv fc fn and fp respectively hence once the raw ww component cod i e organics concentrations are determined computed from parameterized raw wastewater cod fractions they are utilized together with the mass ratios to calculate the organically bound n and p concentrations orgn and orgp the total kjeldhal nitrogen tkn and total phosphorus tp are calculated as the respective sums of the organic n and fsa as well as the organic p and op tkn orgn fsa tp orgp op the soluble components are theoretically the same for the raw ww settled ww and ps i e the pst is considered as a non reactive tank with the unbiodegradable particulate fraction fs up of the settled ww 0 029 being independent from the raw ww 0 130 and only dependent on the pst performance the soluble and non settleable concentrations make up the settled ww and the ps is made of the soluble and settleable solids concentrations furthermore the pst is modelled to remove 100 of settleable solids while ensuring a 100 water cod n p and iss material mass balance in other words the upo bpo and iss settled out in the pst are set depending on the pst performance the upo bpo and iss removed in the pst of the wrc 1984 wastewater data to yield the settled ww characteristics are 84 upo 47 bpo and 80 iss and show that the upo and iss is removed in greater proportion than the bpo an influent flow rate average dry weather flow adwf of 15 0 ml d is selected and the underflow of the ps is fixed at a percentage of that influent flow rate 0 5 of adwf in this case 3 theoretical approach in the pst of waste resource recovery facilities wrrfs particles can be modelled in discrete fashion and assumed to settle in one dimension vertically only in this paper the psvd approach that bachis et al 2015 applied to the tss is applied to each of the upo bpo and iss it is shown that by assigning different settling velocities to the upo bpo and iss each divided in settling proportions modelled as percentages and grouped into 5 different settling velocity groups the observed different fractions of upo bpo and iss removed by psts can be modelled for these removals to take place the upflow velocity in the pst is compared to the settling velocity assigned to each settling velocity group which contains different settling proportions of upo bpo and iss if the upflow velocity in the pst is slower than the settling velocity of a settling velocity group then the upo bpo and iss settling proportions of that group are completely removed from the water flow and become part of the primary sludge on the other hand if the upflow velocity in the pst is faster than the settling velocity of that settling velocity group then none of the upo bpo or iss are removed from the water flow and remain part of the settled ww exiting the pst the settling velocity groups are assigned decreasing settling velocities to mimic velocity patterns in a settleometer experiment and in such a way that they allow realistic removals that are in accordance with the maximum overflow rates for psts operations at peak wet weather flow pwwf and adwf which are 2 4 m h and 1 2 m h respectively ekama 2018 the settleometer method was described by poinapen et al 2009 the settling device is made of five vertical transparent pvc columns of equal height and increasing internal diameters see fig 1 below the columns are interconnected with a plastic tube and the raw wastewater is pumped from the smallest column to the largest at a constant flow rate the fastest settling particles settle and remain in the first column which has the smallest diameter and where the upflow velocity is highest the slowest settling particles settle and remain in the last column with the largest diameter where the upflow velocity is slowest the particles that do not settle at all are non settleable and flow out of the largest column hence by collecting the sludge mass that settles in each tube since their settling velocity is higher than the upflow velocity the sludge can be fractionated according to the size and density of particles therefore in assigning a settling velocity to each settling velocity group the following boundary conditions need to be met the sum of the upo bpo and iss settling proportions from the respective settling velocity groups must add up to the total upo bpo and iss fractions that made up the influent raw ww tss this boundary condition assumes that the incoming upo bpo and iss with settling velocity faster than the pst overflow rate settle out completely in the pst and those with settling velocity slower than the pst overflow rate remain in the settled ww to ensure material mass balance checks because of the previous boundary condition the sum of the settling proportions of each of the upo bpo and iss must add up to 100 at all time steps 4 modelling results to match the given primary sludge data set with the outputs obtained from the model an initial set of settling proportions was applied to the upo bpo and iss into the five settling velocity groups and varied with each selection of a settling proportion different removals of upo bpo or iss were obtained by sequentially varying the five settling proportions assigned to a selected tss component upo bpo or iss across the five settling velocity groups the removal percentages obtained could be checked the settling velocities selected as input to the model the matrix of settling proportions that could fit the data as well as a comparison between the calculated removals and those embedded in the data set wrc 1984 ekama 2009 2011 ekama 2017 are presented in table 2 and fig 2 minor discrepancies between the data set and the calculated removals occurred because the discrete settling model did not account for the pst underflow and the dissolved constituents in the calculations which were factored in the wastewater characteristics used furthermore since particles could either be removed 100 or not 0 with the number of settling velocity groups and settling velocities used discretization the calculated removals could not be exact it was also observed after a few trials that the calculated removal percentages were converging to the expected primary sludge data when the settling proportions across the five settling velocity groups were varied in a descending order for the upo and iss and interestingly in an ascending order for the bpo as shown in fig 3 therefore under steady state conditions the discrete particle settling model confirmed that the upo and iss are removed in higher fractions than the bpo in fact the upo and iss were removed in high proportions because of the larger settling proportions in the fastest settling velocity groups and decreased towards the slowest settling velocity groups on the other hand the bpo were removed in low proportions in the fastest settling velocity groups and gradually increased towards the slowest settling velocity groups the increase of settlement ratio of bpo and subsequently the decrease of settlement ratio of upo and iss is occurring in this fashion because the data used is specific to south african municipal wastewater and as such the settling properties are specific to the pollutants and the waste source this is highlighting the model need of a data driven approach since a lot of required parameters are specific to the type of waste considered the discrete settling model was extended to mimic dynamic calculations where the only modification with regards to the steady state calculations was the variation in flows and loads as such the results generated by the dynamic calculations and using the steady state set of settling proportions as inputs were similar to the removals obtained with these steady state calculations as displayed in table 3 5 uctpsu model implementation and evaluation the uctpsu model was developed in pwm sa ikumi et al 2015 which is within the west vanhooren et al 2003 wastewater modelling software and simulation platform this model development is based on the work of bachis et al 2015 which considered tss only the key modification in the uctpsu model was to disaggregate the tss into three sub components that are upo bpo and iss as described in the discrete particle settling model each of these components were split in five settling velocity groups to which settling velocities were assigned the settling velocities from the discrete settling particle model were used as initial parameters in this model 6 model verification the verification consisted of checking the internal consistency with regards to the relevant uctpsu model components which are the upo bpo and iss that make up the tss this was performed under steady state conditions firstly material mass balances over the uctpsu model were assessed in that regards the settling velocities which were this time expressed in m d and settling mass proportions extracted in table 2 as well as the influent data extracted from wrc 1984 and ekama 2017 were used as inputs the results are presented in table 4 and 100 mass balances were obtained furthermore other specific loading conditions were applied by polorigni 2020 to the model to confirm its internal consistency and were successful results provided as supplementary material these specific loading conditions were chosen in such a way that predictions generated can be intuitively expected and verified they included assigning very low settling velocities to all the settling velocity groups and checking that each settling velocity group could individually carry the removals if allocated all the particles assigning very high settling velocities to all the settling velocity groups and checking that each settling velocity group could also individually carry the removals if allocated all the particles assigning very high velocities to some settling velocity groups and very low velocities to others and verifying that the model is predicting the effluent and the underflow in expected proportions of the settling proportions allocated 7 preliminary uctpsu model plant wide integration initial steady state simulations have been performed for a typical wastewater treatment plant treating 15 0 ml d of settled ww with the typical wastewater characteristics obtained from values used in previous studies wrc 1984 ekama 2017 this was done to initiate a process of quantitative evaluation on the predictive capacity of the uctpsu model by assessing its application and its impact in a plant wide context the west platform was again used as the simulation environment where the modified pwm sa model with pst included was used to virtually replicate the pst linked to two gravity thickeners gt to thicken the ps and waste activated sludge was coming out of the pst and the activated sludge as system respectively an as unit with three zones anaerobic anoxic and aerobic two ads systems and one secondary settling tank see fig 4 below to simulate the application and demonstrate the impact of the uctpsu model two removal scenarios were applied scenario 1 consisted of removing the upo bpo and iss at 50 each as operated in most of the current models that perform the tss fractionation solon et al 2017 scenario 2 removed these components in realistic proportions as experimentally observed in wentzel et al 2006 and ikumi et al 2014 it is worth mentioning that the wastewater characteristics from wrc 1984 and ekama 2017 were selected as dataset for this study because they are made of steady state inputs constant flow and load and dynamic inputs changing flows and loads and comprise all the required measurements for developing the uctpsu model in fact this dataset has been subjected to a rigorous data reconciliation process to produce typical sewage characteristics for south african wastewater systems in terms of raw ww settled ww as well as ps characteristics while maintaining mass balances over the pst furthermore the removal scenarios wentzel et al 2006 ikumi et al 2014 solon et al 2017 were chosen owing to their tss characterisation in terms of upo bpo and iss components different settling proportions were tested by trial and error in the uctpsu model to achieve the removal percentages of the two scenarios in the ps these results are summarized in table 5 and table 6 the impact of the uctpsu model was assessed by comparing the output compositions of some downstream unit processes mainly the settled ww compositions and the capacity of the as system when simulating different settling proportions of upo bpo and iss to vary the removal percentages the predicted settled ww characteristics for scenarios 1 and 2 are compared with the data set values wrc 1984 ekama 2017 in table 7 the soluble components concentrations are not changing since a 100 water balance is assumed throughout scenarios 1 and 2 showed similar values of bpo cod tkn and tp to the data set values in fact scenario 2 predicted settled ww characteristics that are very close to those of the data set since upo bpo and iss in both cases were removed in realistic proportions as experimentally observed by wentzel et al 2006 and ikumi et al 2014 furthermore the low removals in the primary sludge of upo and iss in scenario 1 yielded a very high content in the settled ww characteristics predicted and subsequently a much higher unbiodegradable cod particulate fraction fs up value the as system capacity focused on the reactor tss concentration and the potential variation in reactor volume in response to the increase or decrease of organic load as well as the secondary settling tank sst capacity results showed that the organic load on the as reactor was much less in scenario 2 compared to scenario 1 because of the high removals of upo and iss in scenario 2 hence there was a significant decrease of 12 in reactor volume subsequently the optimized sst surface area was also reduced by 7 from scenario 1 to 2 therefore incorrect pst predictions could lead to incorrect plant capacity estimation in terms of as reactor volume and sst surface area however it was found that the tss concentration of the as reactor in scenario 2 is less than the tss concentration of scenario 1 this could be explained by the lower fs up value obtained in scenario 2 these results are summarized in fig 5 furthermore the oxygen utilized ou and oxygen utilization rate our in the as system and the methane gas production through ad processes were investigated if more bpo settle in the settled ww of the as then more oxygen will be required for aeration towards the breakdown of organics as well as the endogenous respiration of the dead biomass however because the bpo proportions of the settled ww for both scenarios are very close 50 in scenario 1 compared to 53 for scenario 2 the quantitative impact in terms of the ou as well as the our was not clearly demarcated hence the ou was 2 less from scenario 1 to 2 as expected more oxygen is required for organics breakdown and endogenous respiration in scenario 2 should further incorrect assumptions from realistic proportions be made with regards to scenario 1 the inaccuracies in the energy estimations will increase as well with regards to the ad output the main variable of interest is the methane gas production which depends on the proportion of bpo that is available it was established that scenario 2 yielded 47 of bpo compared to 50 in scenario 1 through ps production as such the predicted methane gas generated has increased by 6 from scenario 1 to 2 concerning the ad of the was a decrease of 2 in methane production was noted from scenario 1 to 2 this decrease is due to the higher bpo content of the was in scenario 2 compared to scenario 1 which is derived from the higher bpo content of the settled ww which therefore produces more active biomass 8 conclusions primary sedimentation modelling has shifted from a black box approach with empirical equations to an opaque box modelling and lately to the glass box approach to accurately depict particle settling processes in that regard this paper presented the development of a mathematical model of a pst which can account for a realistic representation of pst removal of settleable particulates in municipal sewage in correct proportions of upo bpo and iss to fulfil this aim a discrete particle settling model was first developed and the results obtained from calculations in this model were then used to feed into the development of a current tss based dynamic model the dynamic model was successfully verified through a rigorous procedure and using data from previous studies wrc 1984 ekama 2017 finally a preliminary plant wide integration was presented to demonstrate the application and potential impact of the model this paper has highlighted the need to measure key parameters in a wastewater treatment plant these parameters include particle settling velocities which are critical in realistically predicting pst removals as well as the unbiodegradable particulate cod fraction which will assist in fractionating the vss into upo and bpo and subsequently the iss fraction can be determined from the tss however it must be noted that the model is limited to the south african municipal wastewater context furthermore a comprehensive database would be useful for a better fractionation of the primary sludge in terms of settling velocities and settling fractions measurements towards strengthening this model development an extensive evaluation sensitivity analysis calibration and validation procedures will add more robustness to the model in addition the model will benefit from the incorporation of cept parameters as well as biological processes and kinetics fermentation and hydrolysis etc the inclusion of the modified pst in plant wide simulations has shown that incorrect assumptions of component settling proportions can lead to subsequent incorrect predictions and potentially compromise an accurate tracking of the energy line through the system as well as tactical decision making to optimize the whole plant hence the need of developing a realistic pst model that can account for these predictions by allowing measurements of key parameters such as particle settling velocities and the unbiodegradable particulate fraction of the cod as well as assisting in making better operation decisions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

that settles in each tube since their settling velocity is higher than the upflow velocity the sludge can be fractionated according to the size and density of particles therefore in assigning a settling velocity to each settling velocity group the following boundary conditions need to be met the sum of the upo bpo and iss settling proportions from the respective settling velocity groups must add up to the total upo bpo and iss fractions that made up the influent raw ww tss this boundary condition assumes that the incoming upo bpo and iss with settling velocity faster than the pst overflow rate settle out completely in the pst and those with settling velocity slower than the pst overflow rate remain in the settled ww to ensure material mass balance checks because of the previous boundary condition the sum of the settling proportions of each of the upo bpo and iss must add up to 100 at all time steps 4 modelling results to match the given primary sludge data set with the outputs obtained from the model an initial set of settling proportions was applied to the upo bpo and iss into the five settling velocity groups and varied with each selection of a settling proportion different removals of upo bpo or iss were obtained by sequentially varying the five settling proportions assigned to a selected tss component upo bpo or iss across the five settling velocity groups the removal percentages obtained could be checked the settling velocities selected as input to the model the matrix of settling proportions that could fit the data as well as a comparison between the calculated removals and those embedded in the data set wrc 1984 ekama 2009 2011 ekama 2017 are presented in table 2 and fig 2 minor discrepancies between the data set and the calculated removals occurred because the discrete settling model did not account for the pst underflow and the dissolved constituents in the calculations which were factored in the wastewater characteristics used furthermore since particles could either be removed 100 or not 0 with the number of settling velocity groups and settling velocities used discretization the calculated removals could not be exact it was also observed after a few trials that the calculated removal percentages were converging to the expected primary sludge data when the settling proportions across the five settling velocity groups were varied in a descending order for the upo and iss and interestingly in an ascending order for the bpo as shown in fig 3 therefore under steady state conditions the discrete particle settling model confirmed that the upo and iss are removed in higher fractions than the bpo in fact the upo and iss were removed in high proportions because of the larger settling proportions in the fastest settling velocity groups and decreased towards the slowest settling velocity groups on the other hand the bpo were removed in low proportions in the fastest settling velocity groups and gradually increased towards the slowest settling velocity groups the increase of settlement ratio of bpo and subsequently the decrease of settlement ratio of upo and iss is occurring in this fashion because the data used is specific to south african municipal wastewater and as such the settling properties are specific to the pollutants and the waste source this is highlighting the model need of a data driven approach since a lot of required parameters are specific to the type of waste considered the discrete settling model was extended to mimic dynamic calculations where the only modification with regards to the steady state calculations was the variation in flows and loads as such the results generated by the dynamic calculations and using the steady state set of settling proportions as inputs were similar to the removals obtained with these steady state calculations as displayed in table 3 5 uctpsu model implementation and evaluation the uctpsu model was developed in pwm sa ikumi et al 2015 which is within the west vanhooren et al 2003 wastewater modelling software and simulation platform this model development is based on the work of bachis et al 2015 which considered tss only the key modification in the uctpsu model was to disaggregate the tss into three sub components that are upo bpo and iss as described in the discrete particle settling model each of these components were split in five settling velocity groups to which settling velocities were assigned the settling velocities from the discrete settling particle model were used as initial parameters in this model 6 model verification the verification consisted of checking the internal consistency with regards to the relevant uctpsu model components which are the upo bpo and iss that make up the tss this was performed under steady state conditions firstly material mass balances over the uctpsu model were assessed in that regards the settling velocities which were this time expressed in m d and settling mass proportions extracted in table 2 as well as the influent data extracted from wrc 1984 and ekama 2017 were used as inputs the results are presented in table 4 and 100 mass balances were obtained furthermore other specific loading conditions were applied by polorigni 2020 to the model to confirm its internal consistency and were successful results provided as supplementary material these specific loading conditions were chosen in such a way that predictions generated can be intuitively expected and verified they included assigning very low settling velocities to all the settling velocity groups and checking that each settling velocity group could individually carry the removals if allocated all the particles assigning very high settling velocities to all the settling velocity groups and checking that each settling velocity group could also individually carry the removals if allocated all the particles assigning very high velocities to some settling velocity groups and very low velocities to others and verifying that the model is predicting the effluent and the underflow in expected proportions of the settling proportions allocated 7 preliminary uctpsu model plant wide integration initial steady state simulations have been performed for a typical wastewater treatment plant treating 15 0 ml d of settled ww with the typical wastewater characteristics obtained from values used in previous studies wrc 1984 ekama 2017 this was done to initiate a process of quantitative evaluation on the predictive capacity of the uctpsu model by assessing its application and its impact in a plant wide context the west platform was again used as the simulation environment where the modified pwm sa model with pst included was used to virtually replicate the pst linked to two gravity thickeners gt to thicken the ps and waste activated sludge was coming out of the pst and the activated sludge as system respectively an as unit with three zones anaerobic anoxic and aerobic two ads systems and one secondary settling tank see fig 4 below to simulate the application and demonstrate the impact of the uctpsu model two removal scenarios were applied scenario 1 consisted of removing the upo bpo and iss at 50 each as operated in most of the current models that perform the tss fractionation solon et al 2017 scenario 2 removed these components in realistic proportions as experimentally observed in wentzel et al 2006 and ikumi et al 2014 it is worth mentioning that the wastewater characteristics from wrc 1984 and ekama 2017 were selected as dataset for this study because they are made of steady state inputs constant flow and load and dynamic inputs changing flows and loads and comprise all the required measurements for developing the uctpsu model in fact this dataset has been subjected to a rigorous data reconciliation process to produce typical sewage characteristics for south african wastewater systems in terms of raw ww settled ww as well as ps characteristics while maintaining mass balances over the pst furthermore the removal scenarios wentzel et al 2006 ikumi et al 2014 solon et al 2017 were chosen owing to their tss characterisation in terms of upo bpo and iss components different settling proportions were tested by trial and error in the uctpsu model to achieve the removal percentages of the two scenarios in the ps these results are summarized in table 5 and table 6 the impact of the uctpsu model was assessed by comparing the output compositions of some downstream unit processes mainly the settled ww compositions and the capacity of the as system when simulating different settling proportions of upo bpo and iss to vary the removal percentages the predicted settled ww characteristics for scenarios 1 and 2 are compared with the data set values wrc 1984 ekama 2017 in table 7 the soluble components concentrations are not changing since a 100 water balance is assumed throughout scenarios 1 and 2 showed similar values of bpo cod tkn and tp to the data set values in fact scenario 2 predicted settled ww characteristics that are very close to those of the data set since upo bpo and iss in both cases were removed in realistic proportions as experimentally observed by wentzel et al 2006 and ikumi et al 2014 furthermore the low removals in the primary sludge of upo and iss in scenario 1 yielded a very high content in the settled ww characteristics predicted and subsequently a much higher unbiodegradable cod particulate fraction fs up value the as system capacity focused on the reactor tss concentration and the potential variation in reactor volume in response to the increase or decrease of organic load as well as the secondary settling tank sst capacity results showed that the organic load on the as reactor was much less in scenario 2 compared to scenario 1 because of the high removals of upo and iss in scenario 2 hence there was a significant decrease of 12 in reactor volume subsequently the optimized sst surface area was also reduced by 7 from scenario 1 to 2 therefore incorrect pst predictions could lead to incorrect plant capacity estimation in terms of as reactor volume and sst surface area however it was found that the tss concentration of the as reactor in scenario 2 is less than the tss concentration of scenario 1 this could be explained by the lower fs up value obtained in scenario 2 these results are summarized in fig 5 furthermore the oxygen utilized ou and oxygen utilization rate our in the as system and the methane gas production through ad processes were investigated if more bpo settle in the settled ww of the as then more oxygen will be required for aeration towards the breakdown of organics as well as the endogenous respiration of the dead biomass however because the bpo proportions of the settled ww for both scenarios are very close 50 in scenario 1 compared to 53 for scenario 2 the quantitative impact in terms of the ou as well as the our was not clearly demarcated hence the ou was 2 less from scenario 1 to 2 as expected more oxygen is required for organics breakdown and endogenous respiration in scenario 2 should further incorrect assumptions from realistic proportions be made with regards to scenario 1 the inaccuracies in the energy estimations will increase as well with regards to the ad output the main variable of interest is the methane gas production which depends on the proportion of bpo that is available it was established that scenario 2 yielded 47 of bpo compared to 50 in scenario 1 through ps production as such the predicted methane gas generated has increased by 6 from scenario 1 to 2 concerning the ad of the was a decrease of 2 in methane production was noted from scenario 1 to 2 this decrease is due to the higher bpo content of the was in scenario 2 compared to scenario 1 which is derived from the higher bpo content of the settled ww which therefore produces more active biomass 8 conclusions primary sedimentation modelling has shifted from a black box approach with empirical equations to an opaque box modelling and lately to the glass box approach to accurately depict particle settling processes in that regard this paper presented the development of a mathematical model of a pst which can account for a realistic representation of pst removal of settleable particulates in municipal sewage in correct proportions of upo bpo and iss to fulfil this aim a discrete particle settling model was first developed and the results obtained from calculations in this model were then used to feed into the development of a current tss based dynamic model the dynamic model was successfully verified through a rigorous procedure and using data from previous studies wrc 1984 ekama 2017 finally a preliminary plant wide integration was presented to demonstrate the application and potential impact of the model this paper has highlighted the need to measure key parameters in a wastewater treatment plant these parameters include particle settling velocities which are critical in realistically predicting pst removals as well as the unbiodegradable particulate cod fraction which will assist in fractionating the vss into upo and bpo and subsequently the iss fraction can be determined from the tss however it must be noted that the model is limited to the south african municipal wastewater context furthermore a comprehensive database would be useful for a better fractionation of the primary sludge in terms of settling velocities and settling fractions measurements towards strengthening this model development an extensive evaluation sensitivity analysis calibration and validation procedures will add more robustness to the model in addition the model will benefit from the incorporation of cept parameters as well as biological processes and kinetics fermentation and hydrolysis etc the inclusion of the modified pst in plant wide simulations has shown that incorrect assumptions of component settling proportions can lead to subsequent incorrect predictions and potentially compromise an accurate tracking of the energy line through the system as well as tactical decision making to optimize the whole plant hence the need of developing a realistic pst model that can account for these predictions by allowing measurements of key parameters such as particle settling velocities and the unbiodegradable particulate fraction of the cod as well as assisting in making better operation decisions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17361,wetland ecosystems play an important role in nitrogen cycling yet the role of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox in tropical wetlands remains unclear in the current study the anammox process accounted for 29 8 57 3 of nitrogen loss in ex situ activity batch tests of microcosms established from anoxic sediments of different tropical wetlands with the highest activity being 17 95 0 51 nmol n g dry sediment h this activity was most likely driven by sulfide oxidation with dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium sulfide driven dnra microbial community analyses revealed a variety of anammox bacteria related to several known lineages including candidatus anammoximicrobium candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia at different wetlands metagenome predictions batch tests and isotope tracing suggested that the high level of anammox activity was due to sulfide driven dnra this was corroborated by a strong correlation through pearson s analysis between the abundance of anammox bacteria and the nrfa a dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium gene and dsra a sulfate reductase gene genes as well as sulfate ammonium and nitrate concentrations these correlations suggest syntrophic interactions among sulfate reducing sulfide driven dnra and anammox bacterial populations a better understanding of the role of sulfur in nitrogen loss via the anammox reaction in natural systems could inform development of a viable wastewater treatment strategy that utilizes sulfate to minimize the activity of denitrifying bacteria and thus to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox nitrogen removal tropical wetlands dnra sulfate reduction 1 introduction wetlands act as sinks for a variety of biologically important elements e g carbon phosphorus and nitrogen and play an important role in maintaining the balance of these elements in the biosphere nutrient cycling within wetland ecosystems is determined by the hydrology and geography of the catchment and different nutrients are present in organic or inorganic forms depending upon the oxygenicity of the environment barker and maltby 2009 because of these high nutrient levels wetlands are considered to be among the most biologically diverse ecosystems and play a vital role in global nitrogen cycling keddy 2010 it has long been assumed that denitrification is the dominant nitrogen removal process in wetlands brodrick et al 1988 dodla et al 2008 kjellin et al 2007 but recent findings that anaerobic oxidation of ammonium anammox has a more prominent role in global nitrogen cycling than was initially thought jasper et al 2014 suggest that the same could be true for nitrogen cycling in wetlands for example it has been estimated that the anammox reaction accounts for 50 of n2 production in marine environments capone and knapp 2007 kuypers et al 2003 and for up to 35 of nitrogen removal in some freshwater systems schubert et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 the anammox process was even found to account for up to 12 of n2 production in an upland forest ecosystem xi et al 2016b the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal in wetlands is less well described yet is of particular importance because of the role wetlands playing in eliminating excess environmental fixed nitrogen fixed nitrogen in natural ecosystems tends to exist as either ammonium or nitrate rather than as nitrite since nitrite can be easily oxidized into nitrate smith 2018 because nitrite is required for the anammox reaction it remains unclear how anammox bacteria can contribute to nitrogen loss under such conditions kartal et al 2012 however one recent report provided evidence that nitrite for the anammox reaction is provided via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in reduced environments such as those in wetlands thamdrup 2012 since then the importance of dnra in nitrogen cycling especially in biological nitrate reduction using sulfide or organic carbon as electron donors has been linked to anammox activity in low oxygen environments canfield et al 2010 most studies of the anammox process have focused on the contribution of anammox to nitrogen loss in natural ecosystems xi et al 2016b without investigating the relationship between anammox bacteria and other functional microorganisms and it seems plausible that growth of anammox bacteria depends upon other microbial metabolic activities lotti et al 2014 the apparent but poorly understood interdependence among sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob sulfate reducing bacteria srb dnra bacteria and anammox bacteria in the cycling of sulfur and nitrogen in reduced oxygen environments exemplifies the challenges of characterizing the anammox process in the current study we investigated the contribution of the anammox process to nitrogen loss in tropical wetland ecosystems anammox bacteria grow optimally between 30 and 40 c chen and jin 2017 making tropical areas ideal places for anammox bacteria to thrive environmental conditions that best supported proliferation and phylogenetic diversity of anammox bacteria as well as the synergistic relationships of anammox bacteria and other functional populations in the microbial community were also evaluated to provide a clearer picture of the actual nitrogen removal pathways in these

functional populations sediments were collected from five geographically distinct sites representative of different wetland ecosystems in singapore supplementary table s1 while only small variations were observed in some measured properties such as temperature and ph there were meaningful differences in site characteristics site j exhibited the highest nh4 and no2 concentrations the necessary substrates to fuel the anammox reaction but not the highest total inorganic nitrogen tin due to the high concentration of no3 at site p site j showed the highest concentration of so4 but the lowest do sites k and bt had the lowest tin and so4 and site k was the only site with no quantifiable no3 the abundance of anammox bacteria srb and dnra bacteria were determined by qpcr of total genomic dna extracted from sediments at each site site j exhibited the highest number 1 08 0 10 108 gene copies g dry sediment and relative abundance 0 82 0 08 of anammox bacteria while site k showed the lowest though srb comprised a higher fraction of the overall microbial communities at sites s 60 24 7 41 and p 88 79 3 95 than at site j site p 2 76 0 12 exhibited the highest relative abundance of dnra bacteria among all the sites site j possessed the highest absolute abundance of each functional population assayed fig 1 the abundances of these populations at each site were positively correlated supplementary table s5 the vfas concentrations were poorly correlated with abundance of anammox bacteria srb and dnra bacteria in situ metabolic activity of anammox bacteria was indirectly estimated by quantification of hzs mrna and was detected at all sites at levels proportional to the detected abundance of anammox bacteria 16s rrna genes fig 1 3 2 phylogenetic diversity and distribution of anammox bacteria the sequences of the anammox amplicons differed among the sites supplementary table s6 interestingly with the exception of site k which showed equal numbers of anammoximicrobium and kuenenia each site tended to be dominated by a single phylogenetic lineage of anammox bacteria anammoximicrobium at sites j and bt kuenenia at sites s and p supplementary table s6 the anammox sequences identified in the clone libraries formed five main clusters within known genera of anammox bacteria fig 2 sequences most similar to anammoximicrobium and kuenenia were the most abundant among those identified 46 5 and 52 2 of anammox clones respectively but the similarity among the anammox bacteria in this study and previously described anammox bacteria was marginal the majority of the anammox sequences identified in this study shared less than 97 identity to previously identified species of anammox bacteria and could be grouped into five distinct clusters three of these clusters are affiliated with the genus anammoximicrobium and two are affiliated with the genus kuenenia fig 2 interestingly the two constructed wetlands sites j and bt were both found to be dominated by anammoximicrobium despite differences in the physicochemical properties of these two sites supplementary table s1 3 3 microbial activity batch tests batch activity tests were performed on sediments collected from each site to investigate the capacity of the autochthonous microbial communities for biological transformation of nitrogen and sulfur when spiked with nitrate and sulfide sediments from sites j and s showed the highest conversion rates of nitrate to ammonium 32 7 and 20 6 within 3 days respectively fig 3 a during this period 6 8 0 21 mm s and 8 4 0 26 mm s mg l sulfide was oxidized to sulfate in sediments from sites j and s respectively fig 3b suggesting that sulfide driven dnra was occurring in these batches the lower rate of nitrate to ammonium conversion at site s than site j is likely due to higher rates of sulfide driven dnra leading to accumulation of nitrite fig 3a at the remaining three sites conversion of nitrate to ammonium or nitrite was negligible and only minimal conversion of sulfide to sulfate was observed batch tests to monitor reduction of sulfate to sulfide were also performed fig 3c in the batch medium spiked with sulfate and acetate all sites exhibited reduction of sulfate to sulfide which in turn would provide an electron donor for sulfide driven dnra site j accumulated the highest amount of sulfide 29 2 mg l or 0 91 mm s from reducing sulfate with in initial concentration of 41 8 mg lor 1 31mm s compared to sulfide amount at sites s p and bt each 16 mg l or 0 5 mm s to further investigate whether the anammox reaction was associated with sulfide driven dnra in these batches nitrate and ammonium were amended to the anaerobic medium with sulfide as the sole electron donor under this condition nitrate reduction via sulfide driven dnra would be the only possible pathway to supply nitrite for the anammox reaction fig 4 sediments from all sites exhibited concurrent decreases of nitrate ammonium and sulfide fig 4 and supplementary fig s1 indicating syntrophic relationship of anammox and the sulfide driven dnra a 15n nitrogen isotope pairing technique in which formation of 29n2 indicates pairing of 15no2 and 14nh4 by the anammox reaction and formation of 30n2 indicates reduction of 15no2 either by denitrification pairing of 15no2 and 15no2 no apparent lag in 30n2 production or the anammox reaction pairing of 15nh4 produced by dnra and 15no2 delayed 30no2 production was used to evaluate the contribution of the anammox reaction to n2 production and the rate of the anammox reaction in homogenized sediment incubated at 30 c accumulation of both 29n2 and 30n2 was observed in sediments from all sites amended with 14nh4 and 15no2 with no apparent lag time fig 5 a and supplementary fig s2 indicating anammox activity interestingly there was substantial production of 15n15n without lag in the 15no2 incubations from all sites which is normally taken as evidence for concurrent denitrification fig 5a d and supplementary fig s2 the anammox reaction produced between 5 76 0 27 and 17 95 0 51 nmol n g dry sediment h with the highest rate observed in sediments from site j although denitrification rates did not correspond well with anammox reaction rates supplementary table s7a the highest denitrification rate was observed in sediments from site p 10 53 0 13 nmol n g dry sediment h in which the anammox reaction was just 70 that of site j supplementary table s7b while the denitrification rates in sediments from sites j and s were lower than their respective anammox reaction rates high levels of 15nh4 production from the 15no2 pool particularly at sites j s and p where high anammox rates were also detected supplementary table s7a indicated high net dnra rates in the samples 4 65 0 35 to 8 56 0 12 nmol n g dry sediment h fig 5b supplementary fig s3 and supplementary table s7c the anammox reaction was calculated to contribute 29 8 57 4 of total nitrogen loss in these tests with the remainder attributed to denitrification and dnra site j showed the highest contribution of the anammox reaction to nitrogen loss fig 5 3 4 microbial community analysis the microbial communities at sites s p and j showed the highest abundance of planctomycetes 4 74 4 56 and 3 92 respectively with much lower abundance of this phylum at sites k and bt fig 6 a due to the comparatively small number of anammox bacterial 16s rrna genes annotated in current taxonomic databases only a few anammox bacteria could be identified in the microbial community inferred from the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing however large fractions of the planctomycetes were categorized as either unassigned or uncultured and these may represent anammox bacteria hence anammox bacteria were enumerated by qpcr using recently reported specific primers the relative abundance of anammox bacteria detected using the specific primers was generally 0 30 at all sites fig 1 but 0 30 using 16s rrna targeted amplicon sequencing fig 6a inset notably while clone library analysis revealed sequences related to at least three known genera of anammox bacteria supplementary table s6 only ca anammoximicrobium populations were present in the communities predicted by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing contrary to findings from clone libraries that showed ca anammoximicrobium populations at both sites k and bt supplementary table s6 no ca anammoximicrobium were identified in miseq reads from these two sites fig 6a inset although proteobacteria the phylum to which most srb denitrifying bacteria and dnra bacteria belong comprised large fractions of the microbial communities of all five sites meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn about potential functionality due to the phylogenetic diversity of these types of bacteria there was significant difference in the relative abundance of euryarchaeota p 0 05 at sites j s p k and bt with the lowest abundance at site j metagenomic inference of the microbial community using picrust was used to predict differences in the abundance of kegg orthologs related to functional pathways associated with the microbial activity observed in batch tests fig 6b the predicted metagenomes of all sites exhibited higher abundances of genes related to dnra and nitrogen fixation than to traditional nitrification and denitrification notably inference of the functional metagenome of the microbial communities at each site showed that site j had the highest predicted number of functional genes related to dissimilatory sulfate reduction to sulfide and assimilatory sulfate reduction to sulfide pathways site j also showed the second highest number of predicted functional genes related to dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways with sites s and p also having high numbers of such genes there was a conspicuously low abundance of genes related to denitrification pathways in the predicted metagenomes of all sites especially at sites s and p 4 discussion the presence and abundance of anammox bacteria in different ecosystems are governed by a variety of physical and biological parameters li et al 2015 thamdrup 2012 xi et al 2016a in the current study we used high throughput sequencing clone library and targeted qpcr to determine the diversity and abundance of anammox bacteria in geographically distinct tropical wetlands with differing soil and water quality characteristics supplementary table s1 and performed a series of batch activity tests to investigate the functional microbial interactions contributing to nitrogen and sulfur removal in these wetlands the different sites exhibited distinct anammox activity and variable abundance of anammox bacteria with the highest in situ anammox activity and abundance of anammox bacteria at site j figs 1 and 2 consistent with previous reports strous et al 1999 typical physical characteristics that are more favorable to growth of heterotrophic bacteria e g toc vfas were poorly correlated with in situ abundance of anammox bacteria supplementary table s5 notably other factors that are known to affect growth of anammox bacteria particularly temperature and orp were not correlated with abundance of anammox bacteria most likely because there was minimal variation in these factors 30 4 1 0 ºc and 44 2 24 2 mv respectively among the sites and all sites had temperature and orp within the optimum range for growth of anammox bacteria gao et al 2015 the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were positively correlated with the abundance of anammox bacteria the correlations between the abundance of srb dnra bacteria and anammox bacteria supplementary table s5 may suggest that sulfide driven dnra plays an important role in sulfur and nitrogen cycling in wetland ecosystems by supporting nitrogen removal mediated by the anammox process the anammox reaction was responsible for 29 8 57 4 of observed nitrogen loss in batch tests of microcosms established from the wetlands in this study fig 5c demonstrating the importance of anammox to nitrogen cycling in these tropical wetlands the contribution of the anammox process to total nitrogen loss observed in the wetlands of this study was generally higher than that in similar studies of wetlands in beijing china 33 zhu et al 2011 casino australia 24 erler et al 2008 and california usa 25 jasper et al 2014 tropical climates are generally conducive to bacterial growth which can allow flourishing of fastidious bacterial populations that may be underrepresented in the microbial communities of temperate regions the highest nitrogen removal rate due to anammox 17 75 0 51 nmol n g dry sediment h and the highest contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal 57 4 were both observed at site j fig 5c and supplementary table s7a a constructed wetland receiving influent waters from a variety of sources including industrial wastewater that also had the highest incidence of srb and dnra bacteria as determined by the abundance dsra and nrfa genes as well as the highest sulfate ammonium nitrate and nitrite concentrations fig 1 and supplementary table s1 these results suggest that sulfate concentrations and abundance of srb and dnra bacteria could provide indirect evidence of anammox activity in these ecosystems the nitrogen removal rate observed in site j sediments ex situ was comparable to that reported in a constructed wetland receiving synthetic wastewater as influent between 1 6 and 18 nmol n g dry sediment h zhu et al 2011 which may indicate that constant provision of substrates i e from industrial or synthetic wastewater favors a higher abundance and activity of anammox bacteria the fraction of nitrogen loss that can be attributed to the anammox reaction varies widely within different ecological niches jones et al 2017 li et al 2015 long et al 2013 xi et al 2016a yoshinaga et al 2011 but is highest in marine systems 20 80 engström et al 2009 trimmer and nicholls 2009 anammox activity in marine ecosystems is positively correlated with water depth likely because of the reduced availability of organic matter at increased depth dale et al 2009 dalsgaard et al 2005 suggesting that higher anammox activity would be associated with lower concentrations of organics i e toc and vfa in wetlands the weak correlation between concentrations of organic carbon and abundance of anammox bacteria in the current study supplementary table s5 was likely due to intense in situ competition for organic carbon among different heterotrophs such as denitrifying bacteria methanogens and srb based on these observations we posit that syntrophic interactions among dnra bacteria srb and anammox bacteria create a mutually favorable growth environment for each population in this model heterotrophic srb consume available organic carbon as an electron donor to reduce sulfate to sulfide subsequently the produced sulfide rather than organic carbon was the most likely electron donor for dnra bacteria because dnra bacteria cannot compete effectively with srb and methanogens for limited carbon sources rittmann and mccarty 2012 therefore the low carbon content in the system supplementary table s1 supports the use of sulfide as an electron donor by dnra bacteria to produce ammonium and nitrite the products of dnra i e ammonium and nitrite are then utilized by anammox bacteria which generate nitrate as an end product of the anammox reaction this nitrate can then support further activity by dnra bacteria creating a virtuous circle that further facilitates anammox reaction fig 4 and supplementary fig s1 the correlation between the abundance of the functional genes nrfa and dsra p 0 05 supplementary table s5 indicating a relationship between dnra and sulfate reduction respectively provides indirect evidence in support of this model anammox bacteria represented between 0 30 0 04 to 0 82 0 08 of the microbial community at the sites surveyed in this study fig 1 suggesting that these bacteria are ubiquitous in the wetlands around singapore phylogenetic analysis revealed that many of the anammox bacteria in the wetlands studied are likely new species within previously described genera fig 2 the large number of novel anammox bacteria observed is probably due to a dearth of environmental surveys of anammox bacteria in tropical wetlands resulting in the large number of unassigned planctomycetes identified by amplicon sequencing fig 6a interestingly nearly half of the clones contained a sequence highly similar to that of the recently described anammoximicrobium moscowii supplementary table s6 which was enriched from the filtrate of fermented wastewater residue suggesting that previous surveys of anammox may have overlooked the crucial role of this genus in nitrogen loss notably the lineages of the dominant anammox populations differed from site to site even at sites yielding similar batch test results supplementary table s6 the sites with higher ph ph 7 5 sites j and bt and low orp orp 60 mv were dominated by the genus anammoximicrobium whereas the sites with more neutral ph and higher orp were dominated by the genus kuenenia supplementary tables s1 and s6 anammox bacteria belonging to the genus kuenenia are commonly found in municipal wastewater treatment systems with ph values of 7 0 7 4 ding et al 2020 wang et al 2018a b 2015 suggesting that different lineages of anammox bacteria can emerge as dominant populations depending on slight variations in environmental conditions denitrification processes regulate the relative amounts of nitrite and nitrate in wwtps but are sensitive to the ratio of carbon to nitrogen c n for example in low c n environments denitrification does not proceed to completion nelson et al 2004 in reactors where denitrification and anammox reactions occur simultaneously anammox bacteria likely depended on this partial denitrification to release ammonium from organic nitrogen however the comparative lack of genes related to denitrification pathways in the predicted functional metagenomes of the microbial communities of the tropical wetlands in the current study suggest that partial denitrification may not be the main process supplying substrates for anammox bacteria in these wetlands fig 5a rather it is most likely that sulfide driven dnra producing nitrite as an intermediate and ammonium as a final product generates both of the necessary substrates required for the observed anammox activity at sites j s and p this conclusion is supported by batch tests that showed nitrate conversion to ammonium and nitrite accumulation at sites j s and p along with oxidation of sulfide to sulfate fig 3 the apparent sulfur imbalance during dnra fig 3b may be due to desorption of sulfate from the sediment of sites j and s the imbalance of sulfur during the reduction of sulfate to sulfide fig 3c can be explained by incomplete sulfate reduction caused by a shortage of electron donors leading to reduction of some sulfate to elemental sulfur muyzer and stams 2008 moreover consumption of organic carbon by srb could lead to a gain in electrons and it seems that higher anammox activity fig 5 and supplementary fig s2 and sulfate reduction potentials fig 3c fig 6b might be associated with a lower abundance of euryarchaeota fig 6a p 0 05 many of which are methanogens that would otherwise compete for electron donors bräuer et al 2011 the higher sulfate reduction potential was also reflected by the higher number of functional genes related to dissimilatory sulfate reduction fig 6b in the predicted metagenome of some wetlands the predominance of dnra in 15n nitrogen isotope pairing experiments fig 5b and supplementary fig s3 and the evidence of dnra in the one to one relationship between the nh4 and no2 produced from no3 in cultures provided sulfide as the sole electron donor fig 4 and supplementary fig s1 provide additional evidence for the role of sulfide driven dnra in these wetlands although heterotrophic denitrification is thermodynamically favorable to dnra one study has shown that denitrifying bacteria have lower growth yields than dnra bacteria strohm et al 2007 this may lead to an energetic advantage of dnra bacteria over heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the environment and lead to a cooperative partnership between anammox and dnra bacteria and the accumulation of nitrite observed in batch tests of sediments from sites j s and p fig 3a suggests that anammox activity may have been triggered by nitrite generated via dnra nevertheless the sulfide that supports sulfide driven dnra may inhibit anammox bacteria as the ic50 of sulfide towards anammox bacteria in some anammox processes has been reported to 1 5 mm in different reactors dapena mora et al 2007 van de graaf et al 1996 the cooperation between anammox and sulfide driven dnra may play a significant role in environments where sulfur cycling is active and where actual sulfide concentrations are below the mm range lamers et al 1998 it should also be noted that ex situ sediment incubations may overestimate in situ anammox activity due to the excess supply of nutrients prolonged pre incubation periods and the potential for co denitrification processes long et al 2013 however the ubiquity of anammox bacteria and abundance of functional genotypes identified at the different sites provide robust evidence that anammox bacteria make meaningful contributions to the metabolic functioning of the microbial community and play an important role in nitrogen removal in situ indeed this supposition was corroborated by the abundance of predicted genes associated with assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction as well as assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate reduction to sulfide in the microbial communities at the sites exhibiting the highest anammox activity in batch tests fig 6b an elevated supply of nutrients in lab scale tests maximizes reaction rates but does not necessarily reflect in situ conditions nevertheless such experiments reveal the potential of microbial communities to the best of our knowledge this is the first survey of anammox bacteria in tropical wetlands the consistently high temperatures characteristic of tropical environments is more suitable for growth of anammox bacteria than the temperate regions in which most environmental surveys of anammox bacteria have been performed erler et al 2008 jones et al 2017 zhu et al 2011 the anammox reaction was a major contributor to nitrogen loss in batch tests of sediments from the wetlands surveyed in this study indicating that anammox bacteria are an important part of the metabolic functioning of the microbial communities in these ecosystems we also noted a high abundance of srb and dnra bacteria particularly at sites with low c n ratios and high sulfate concentrations the degree of anammox activity and sulfide oxidation sulfate reduction in batch tests provides evidence of a link between sulfide driven dnra and anammox activity in situ as has been previously noted in other ecosystems francis et al 2007 nelson et al 2004 hence it is likely that interactions among srb dnra bacteria and anammox bacteria are an important part of a complex microbial network responsible for sulfur and nitrogen cycling in tropical wetland ecosystems fig 7 this finding has environmental and industrial implications as the abundance of srb and dnra bacteria in microbial communities is associated with local concentrations of inorganic sulfur concentrations discharge of inorganic sulfur from wwtps is not typically regulated nor are inorganic sulfur compounds typically monitored during environmental assessments qiu et al 2019 wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 similarly the concentration of inorganic sulfate is not usually considered in analyses of nitrogen removal in wwtps adapting anammox bacteria that are naturally associated with sulfide driven dnra to conditions in wwtps may offer an interesting opportunity for nitrogen removal creating and maintaining an autotrophic environment suitable for proliferation of anammox bacteria fueled by nitrate reduction and a constant influx of sulfide and ammonium further emissions of nitrous oxide a potent greenhouse gas emitted by wwtps could also be controlled by utilizing the sulfate present in wastewater to minimize the activity of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 5 conclusion the contribution of the anammox process to nitrogen loss in tropical wetland ecosystems was 29 8 57 4 anammox bacteria are ubiquitous in the wetlands around singapore with a relative abundance of 0 30 0 04 to 0 82 0 08 populations include members of the genera of ca anammoximicrobium ca brocadia ca kuenenia and likely new species correlations among the abundance of srb dnra bacteria and anammox bacteria suggest that sulfide driven dnra plays an important role in sulfur and nitrogen cycling in wetland ecosystems by supporting nitrogen removal mediated by the anammox process the predicted metagenomes of the different wetlands demonstrate a comparative lack of genes related to denitrification pathways providing indirect evidence that sulfide driven dnra supported growth of anammox bacteria batch tests and isotope tracing confirmed the presence of sulfide driven dnra with sulfide as the electron donor which can be an important biochemical process to supply substrates for anammox bacteria and emphasizes the critical microbial interactions in promoting anammox activity in situ sulfate

17361,wetland ecosystems play an important role in nitrogen cycling yet the role of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox in tropical wetlands remains unclear in the current study the anammox process accounted for 29 8 57 3 of nitrogen loss in ex situ activity batch tests of microcosms established from anoxic sediments of different tropical wetlands with the highest activity being 17 95 0 51 nmol n g dry sediment h this activity was most likely driven by sulfide oxidation with dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium sulfide driven dnra microbial community analyses revealed a variety of anammox bacteria related to several known lineages including candidatus anammoximicrobium candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia at different wetlands metagenome predictions batch tests and isotope tracing suggested that the high level of anammox activity was due to sulfide driven dnra this was corroborated by a strong correlation through pearson s analysis between the abundance of anammox bacteria and the nrfa a dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium gene and dsra a sulfate reductase gene genes as well as sulfate ammonium and nitrate concentrations these correlations suggest syntrophic interactions among sulfate reducing sulfide driven dnra and anammox bacterial populations a better understanding of the role of sulfur in nitrogen loss via the anammox reaction in natural systems could inform development of a viable wastewater treatment strategy that utilizes sulfate to minimize the activity of denitrifying bacteria and thus to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox nitrogen removal tropical wetlands dnra sulfate reduction 1 introduction wetlands act as sinks for a variety of biologically important elements e g carbon phosphorus and nitrogen and play an important role in maintaining the balance of these elements in the biosphere nutrient cycling within wetland ecosystems is determined by the hydrology and geography of the catchment and different nutrients are present in organic or inorganic forms depending upon the oxygenicity of the environment barker and maltby 2009 because of these high nutrient levels wetlands are considered to be among the most biologically diverse ecosystems and play a vital role in global nitrogen cycling keddy 2010 it has long been assumed that denitrification is the dominant nitrogen removal process in wetlands brodrick et al 1988 dodla et al 2008 kjellin et al 2007 but recent findings that anaerobic oxidation of ammonium anammox has a more prominent role in global nitrogen cycling than was initially thought jasper et al 2014 suggest that the same could be true for nitrogen cycling in wetlands for example it has been estimated that the anammox reaction accounts for 50 of n2 production in marine environments capone and knapp 2007 kuypers et al 2003 and for up to 35 of nitrogen removal in some freshwater systems schubert et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 the anammox process was even found to account for up to 12 of n2 production in an upland forest ecosystem xi et al 2016b the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal in wetlands is less well described yet is of particular importance because of the role wetlands playing in eliminating excess environmental fixed nitrogen fixed nitrogen in natural ecosystems tends to exist as either ammonium or nitrate rather than as nitrite since nitrite can be easily oxidized into nitrate smith 2018 because nitrite is required for the anammox reaction it remains unclear how anammox bacteria can contribute to nitrogen loss under such conditions kartal et al 2012 however one recent report provided evidence that nitrite for the anammox reaction is provided via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in reduced environments such as those in wetlands thamdrup 2012 since then the importance of dnra in nitrogen cycling especially in biological nitrate reduction using sulfide or organic carbon as electron donors has been linked to anammox activity in low oxygen environments canfield et al 2010 most studies of the anammox process have focused on the contribution of anammox to nitrogen loss in natural ecosystems xi et al 2016b without investigating the relationship between anammox bacteria and other functional microorganisms and it seems plausible that growth of anammox bacteria depends upon other microbial metabolic activities lotti et al 2014 the apparent but poorly understood interdependence among sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob sulfate reducing bacteria srb dnra bacteria and anammox bacteria in the cycling of sulfur and nitrogen in reduced oxygen environments exemplifies the challenges of characterizing the anammox process in the current study we investigated the contribution of the anammox process to nitrogen loss in tropical wetland ecosystems anammox bacteria grow optimally between 30 and 40 c chen and jin 2017 making tropical areas ideal places for anammox bacteria to thrive environmental conditions that best supported proliferation and phylogenetic diversity of anammox bacteria as well as the synergistic relationships of anammox bacteria and other functional populations in the microbial community were also evaluated to provide a clearer picture of the actual nitrogen removal pathways in these

functional populations sediments were collected from five geographically distinct sites representative of different wetland ecosystems in singapore supplementary table s1 while only small variations were observed in some measured properties such as temperature and ph there were meaningful differences in site characteristics site j exhibited the highest nh4 and no2 concentrations the necessary substrates to fuel the anammox reaction but not the highest total inorganic nitrogen tin due to the high concentration of no3 at site p site j showed the highest concentration of so4 but the lowest do sites k and bt had the lowest tin and so4 and site k was the only site with no quantifiable no3 the abundance of anammox bacteria srb and dnra bacteria were determined by qpcr of total genomic dna extracted from sediments at each site site j exhibited the highest number 1 08 0 10 108 gene copies g dry sediment and relative abundance 0 82 0 08 of anammox bacteria while site k showed the lowest though srb comprised a higher fraction of the overall microbial communities at sites s 60 24 7 41 and p 88 79 3 95 than at site j site p 2 76 0 12 exhibited the highest relative abundance of dnra bacteria among all the sites site j possessed the highest absolute abundance of each functional population assayed fig 1 the abundances of these populations at each site were positively correlated supplementary table s5 the vfas concentrations were poorly correlated with abundance of anammox bacteria srb and dnra bacteria in situ metabolic activity of anammox bacteria was indirectly estimated by quantification of hzs mrna and was detected at all sites at levels proportional to the detected abundance of anammox bacteria 16s rrna genes fig 1 3 2 phylogenetic diversity and distribution of anammox bacteria the sequences of the anammox amplicons differed among the sites supplementary table s6 interestingly with the exception of site k which showed equal numbers of anammoximicrobium and kuenenia each site tended to be dominated by a single phylogenetic lineage of anammox bacteria anammoximicrobium at sites j and bt kuenenia at sites s and p supplementary table s6 the anammox sequences identified in the clone libraries formed five main clusters within known genera of anammox bacteria fig 2 sequences most similar to anammoximicrobium and kuenenia were the most abundant among those identified 46 5 and 52 2 of anammox clones respectively but the similarity among the anammox bacteria in this study and previously described anammox bacteria was marginal the majority of the anammox sequences identified in this study shared less than 97 identity to previously identified species of anammox bacteria and could be grouped into five distinct clusters three of these clusters are affiliated with the genus anammoximicrobium and two are affiliated with the genus kuenenia fig 2 interestingly the two constructed wetlands sites j and bt were both found to be dominated by anammoximicrobium despite differences in the physicochemical properties of these two sites supplementary table s1 3 3 microbial activity batch tests batch activity tests were performed on sediments collected from each site to investigate the capacity of the autochthonous microbial communities for biological transformation of nitrogen and sulfur when spiked with nitrate and sulfide sediments from sites j and s showed the highest conversion rates of nitrate to ammonium 32 7 and 20 6 within 3 days respectively fig 3 a during this period 6 8 0 21 mm s and 8 4 0 26 mm s mg l sulfide was oxidized to sulfate in sediments from sites j and s respectively fig 3b suggesting that sulfide driven dnra was occurring in these batches the lower rate of nitrate to ammonium conversion at site s than site j is likely due to higher rates of sulfide driven dnra leading to accumulation of nitrite fig 3a at the remaining three sites conversion of nitrate to ammonium or nitrite was negligible and only minimal conversion of sulfide to sulfate was observed batch tests to monitor reduction of sulfate to sulfide were also performed fig 3c in the batch medium spiked with sulfate and acetate all sites exhibited reduction of sulfate to sulfide which in turn would provide an electron donor for sulfide driven dnra site j accumulated the highest amount of sulfide 29 2 mg l or 0 91 mm s from reducing sulfate with in initial concentration of 41 8 mg lor 1 31mm s compared to sulfide amount at sites s p and bt each 16 mg l or 0 5 mm s to further investigate whether the anammox reaction was associated with sulfide driven dnra in these batches nitrate and ammonium were amended to the anaerobic medium with sulfide as the sole electron donor under this condition nitrate reduction via sulfide driven dnra would be the only possible pathway to supply nitrite for the anammox reaction fig 4 sediments from all sites exhibited concurrent decreases of nitrate ammonium and sulfide fig 4 and supplementary fig s1 indicating syntrophic relationship of anammox and the sulfide driven dnra a 15n nitrogen isotope pairing technique in which formation of 29n2 indicates pairing of 15no2 and 14nh4 by the anammox reaction and formation of 30n2 indicates reduction of 15no2 either by denitrification pairing of 15no2 and 15no2 no apparent lag in 30n2 production or the anammox reaction pairing of 15nh4 produced by dnra and 15no2 delayed 30no2 production was used to evaluate the contribution of the anammox reaction to n2 production and the rate of the anammox reaction in homogenized sediment incubated at 30 c accumulation of both 29n2 and 30n2 was observed in sediments from all sites amended with 14nh4 and 15no2 with no apparent lag time fig 5 a and supplementary fig s2 indicating anammox activity interestingly there was substantial production of 15n15n without lag in the 15no2 incubations from all sites which is normally taken as evidence for concurrent denitrification fig 5a d and supplementary fig s2 the anammox reaction produced between 5 76 0 27 and 17 95 0 51 nmol n g dry sediment h with the highest rate observed in sediments from site j although denitrification rates did not correspond well with anammox reaction rates supplementary table s7a the highest denitrification rate was observed in sediments from site p 10 53 0 13 nmol n g dry sediment h in which the anammox reaction was just 70 that of site j supplementary table s7b while the denitrification rates in sediments from sites j and s were lower than their respective anammox reaction rates high levels of 15nh4 production from the 15no2 pool particularly at sites j s and p where high anammox rates were also detected supplementary table s7a indicated high net dnra rates in the samples 4 65 0 35 to 8 56 0 12 nmol n g dry sediment h fig 5b supplementary fig s3 and supplementary table s7c the anammox reaction was calculated to contribute 29 8 57 4 of total nitrogen loss in these tests with the remainder attributed to denitrification and dnra site j showed the highest contribution of the anammox reaction to nitrogen loss fig 5 3 4 microbial community analysis the microbial communities at sites s p and j showed the highest abundance of planctomycetes 4 74 4 56 and 3 92 respectively with much lower abundance of this phylum at sites k and bt fig 6 a due to the comparatively small number of anammox bacterial 16s rrna genes annotated in current taxonomic databases only a few anammox bacteria could be identified in the microbial community inferred from the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing however large fractions of the planctomycetes were categorized as either unassigned or uncultured and these may represent anammox bacteria hence anammox bacteria were enumerated by qpcr using recently reported specific primers the relative abundance of anammox bacteria detected using the specific primers was generally 0 30 at all sites fig 1 but 0 30 using 16s rrna targeted amplicon sequencing fig 6a inset notably while clone library analysis revealed sequences related to at least three known genera of anammox bacteria supplementary table s6 only ca anammoximicrobium populations were present in the communities predicted by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing contrary to findings from clone libraries that showed ca anammoximicrobium populations at both sites k and bt supplementary table s6 no ca anammoximicrobium were identified in miseq reads from these two sites fig 6a inset although proteobacteria the phylum to which most srb denitrifying bacteria and dnra bacteria belong comprised large fractions of the microbial communities of all five sites meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn about potential functionality due to the phylogenetic diversity of these types of bacteria there was significant difference in the relative abundance of euryarchaeota p 0 05 at sites j s p k and bt with the lowest abundance at site j metagenomic inference of the microbial community using picrust was used to predict differences in the abundance of kegg orthologs related to functional pathways associated with the microbial activity observed in batch tests fig 6b the predicted metagenomes of all sites exhibited higher abundances of genes related to dnra and nitrogen fixation than to traditional nitrification and denitrification notably inference of the functional metagenome of the microbial communities at each site showed that site j had the highest predicted number of functional genes related to dissimilatory sulfate reduction to sulfide and assimilatory sulfate reduction to sulfide pathways site j also showed the second highest number of predicted functional genes related to dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways with sites s and p also having high numbers of such genes there was a conspicuously low abundance of genes related to denitrification pathways in the predicted metagenomes of all sites especially at sites s and p 4 discussion the presence and abundance of anammox bacteria in different ecosystems are governed by a variety of physical and biological parameters li et al 2015 thamdrup 2012 xi et al 2016a in the current study we used high throughput sequencing clone library and targeted qpcr to determine the diversity and abundance of anammox bacteria in geographically distinct tropical wetlands with differing soil and water quality characteristics supplementary table s1 and performed a series of batch activity tests to investigate the functional microbial interactions contributing to nitrogen and sulfur removal in these wetlands the different sites exhibited distinct anammox activity and variable abundance of anammox bacteria with the highest in situ anammox activity and abundance of anammox bacteria at site j figs 1 and 2 consistent with previous reports strous et al 1999 typical physical characteristics that are more favorable to growth of heterotrophic bacteria e g toc vfas were poorly correlated with in situ abundance of anammox bacteria supplementary table s5 notably other factors that are known to affect growth of anammox bacteria particularly temperature and orp were not correlated with abundance of anammox bacteria most likely because there was minimal variation in these factors 30 4 1 0 ºc and 44 2 24 2 mv respectively among the sites and all sites had temperature and orp within the optimum range for growth of anammox bacteria gao et al 2015 the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were positively correlated with the abundance of anammox bacteria the correlations between the abundance of srb dnra bacteria and anammox bacteria supplementary table s5 may suggest that sulfide driven dnra plays an important role in sulfur and nitrogen cycling in wetland ecosystems by supporting nitrogen removal mediated by the anammox process the anammox reaction was responsible for 29 8 57 4 of observed nitrogen loss in batch tests of microcosms established from the wetlands in this study fig 5c demonstrating the importance of anammox to nitrogen cycling in these tropical wetlands the contribution of the anammox process to total nitrogen loss observed in the wetlands of this study was generally higher than that in similar studies of wetlands in beijing china 33 zhu et al 2011 casino australia 24 erler et al 2008 and california usa 25 jasper et al 2014 tropical climates are generally conducive to bacterial growth which can allow flourishing of fastidious bacterial populations that may be underrepresented in the microbial communities of temperate regions the highest nitrogen removal rate due to anammox 17 75 0 51 nmol n g dry sediment h and the highest contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal 57 4 were both observed at site j fig 5c and supplementary table s7a a constructed wetland receiving influent waters from a variety of sources including industrial wastewater that also had the highest incidence of srb and dnra bacteria as determined by the abundance dsra and nrfa genes as well as the highest sulfate ammonium nitrate and nitrite concentrations fig 1 and supplementary table s1 these results suggest that sulfate concentrations and abundance of srb and dnra bacteria could provide indirect evidence of anammox activity in these ecosystems the nitrogen removal rate observed in site j sediments ex situ was comparable to that reported in a constructed wetland receiving synthetic wastewater as influent between 1 6 and 18 nmol n g dry sediment h zhu et al 2011 which may indicate that constant provision of substrates i e from industrial or synthetic wastewater favors a higher abundance and activity of anammox bacteria the fraction of nitrogen loss that can be attributed to the anammox reaction varies widely within different ecological niches jones et al 2017 li et al 2015 long et al 2013 xi et al 2016a yoshinaga et al 2011 but is highest in marine systems 20 80 engström et al 2009 trimmer and nicholls 2009 anammox activity in marine ecosystems is positively correlated with water depth likely because of the reduced availability of organic matter at increased depth dale et al 2009 dalsgaard et al 2005 suggesting that higher anammox activity would be associated with lower concentrations of organics i e toc and vfa in wetlands the weak correlation between concentrations of organic carbon and abundance of anammox bacteria in the current study supplementary table s5 was likely due to intense in situ competition for organic carbon among different heterotrophs such as denitrifying bacteria methanogens and srb based on these observations we posit that syntrophic interactions among dnra bacteria srb and anammox bacteria create a mutually favorable growth environment for each population in this model heterotrophic srb consume available organic carbon as an electron donor to reduce sulfate to sulfide subsequently the produced sulfide rather than organic carbon was the most likely electron donor for dnra bacteria because dnra bacteria cannot compete effectively with srb and methanogens for limited carbon sources rittmann and mccarty 2012 therefore the low carbon content in the system supplementary table s1 supports the use of sulfide as an electron donor by dnra bacteria to produce ammonium and nitrite the products of dnra i e ammonium and nitrite are then utilized by anammox bacteria which generate nitrate as an end product of the anammox reaction this nitrate can then support further activity by dnra bacteria creating a virtuous circle that further facilitates anammox reaction fig 4 and supplementary fig s1 the correlation between the abundance of the functional genes nrfa and dsra p 0 05 supplementary table s5 indicating a relationship between dnra and sulfate reduction respectively provides indirect evidence in support of this model anammox bacteria represented between 0 30 0 04 to 0 82 0 08 of the microbial community at the sites surveyed in this study fig 1 suggesting that these bacteria are ubiquitous in the wetlands around singapore phylogenetic analysis revealed that many of the anammox bacteria in the wetlands studied are likely new species within previously described genera fig 2 the large number of novel anammox bacteria observed is probably due to a dearth of environmental surveys of anammox bacteria in tropical wetlands resulting in the large number of unassigned planctomycetes identified by amplicon sequencing fig 6a interestingly nearly half of the clones contained a sequence highly similar to that of the recently described anammoximicrobium moscowii supplementary table s6 which was enriched from the filtrate of fermented wastewater residue suggesting that previous surveys of anammox may have overlooked the crucial role of this genus in nitrogen loss notably the lineages of the dominant anammox populations differed from site to site even at sites yielding similar batch test results supplementary table s6 the sites with higher ph ph 7 5 sites j and bt and low orp orp 60 mv were dominated by the genus anammoximicrobium whereas the sites with more neutral ph and higher orp were dominated by the genus kuenenia supplementary tables s1 and s6 anammox bacteria belonging to the genus kuenenia are commonly found in municipal wastewater treatment systems with ph values of 7 0 7 4 ding et al 2020 wang et al 2018a b 2015 suggesting that different lineages of anammox bacteria can emerge as dominant populations depending on slight variations in environmental conditions denitrification processes regulate the relative amounts of nitrite and nitrate in wwtps but are sensitive to the ratio of carbon to nitrogen c n for example in low c n environments denitrification does not proceed to completion nelson et al 2004 in reactors where denitrification and anammox reactions occur simultaneously anammox bacteria likely depended on this partial denitrification to release ammonium from organic nitrogen however the comparative lack of genes related to denitrification pathways in the predicted functional metagenomes of the microbial communities of the tropical wetlands in the current study suggest that partial denitrification may not be the main process supplying substrates for anammox bacteria in these wetlands fig 5a rather it is most likely that sulfide driven dnra producing nitrite as an intermediate and ammonium as a final product generates both of the necessary substrates required for the observed anammox activity at sites j s and p this conclusion is supported by batch tests that showed nitrate conversion to ammonium and nitrite accumulation at sites j s and p along with oxidation of sulfide to sulfate fig 3 the apparent sulfur imbalance during dnra fig 3b may be due to desorption of sulfate from the sediment of sites j and s the imbalance of sulfur during the reduction of sulfate to sulfide fig 3c can be explained by incomplete sulfate reduction caused by a shortage of electron donors leading to reduction of some sulfate to elemental sulfur muyzer and stams 2008 moreover consumption of organic carbon by srb could lead to a gain in electrons and it seems that higher anammox activity fig 5 and supplementary fig s2 and sulfate reduction potentials fig 3c fig 6b might be associated with a lower abundance of euryarchaeota fig 6a p 0 05 many of which are methanogens that would otherwise compete for electron donors bräuer et al 2011 the higher sulfate reduction potential was also reflected by the higher number of functional genes related to dissimilatory sulfate reduction fig 6b in the predicted metagenome of some wetlands the predominance of dnra in 15n nitrogen isotope pairing experiments fig 5b and supplementary fig s3 and the evidence of dnra in the one to one relationship between the nh4 and no2 produced from no3 in cultures provided sulfide as the sole electron donor fig 4 and supplementary fig s1 provide additional evidence for the role of sulfide driven dnra in these wetlands although heterotrophic denitrification is thermodynamically favorable to dnra one study has shown that denitrifying bacteria have lower growth yields than dnra bacteria strohm et al 2007 this may lead to an energetic advantage of dnra bacteria over heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the environment and lead to a cooperative partnership between anammox and dnra bacteria and the accumulation of nitrite observed in batch tests of sediments from sites j s and p fig 3a suggests that anammox activity may have been triggered by nitrite generated via dnra nevertheless the sulfide that supports sulfide driven dnra may inhibit anammox bacteria as the ic50 of sulfide towards anammox bacteria in some anammox processes has been reported to 1 5 mm in different reactors dapena mora et al 2007 van de graaf et al 1996 the cooperation between anammox and sulfide driven dnra may play a significant role in environments where sulfur cycling is active and where actual sulfide concentrations are below the mm range lamers et al 1998 it should also be noted that ex situ sediment incubations may overestimate in situ anammox activity due to the excess supply of nutrients prolonged pre incubation periods and the potential for co denitrification processes long et al 2013 however the ubiquity of anammox bacteria and abundance of functional genotypes identified at the different sites provide robust evidence that anammox bacteria make meaningful contributions to the metabolic functioning of the microbial community and play an important role in nitrogen removal in situ indeed this supposition was corroborated by the abundance of predicted genes associated with assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction as well as assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate reduction to sulfide in the microbial communities at the sites exhibiting the highest anammox activity in batch tests fig 6b an elevated supply of nutrients in lab scale tests maximizes reaction rates but does not necessarily reflect in situ conditions nevertheless such experiments reveal the potential of microbial communities to the best of our knowledge this is the first survey of anammox bacteria in tropical wetlands the consistently high temperatures characteristic of tropical environments is more suitable for growth of anammox bacteria than the temperate regions in which most environmental surveys of anammox bacteria have been performed erler et al 2008 jones et al 2017 zhu et al 2011 the anammox reaction was a major contributor to nitrogen loss in batch tests of sediments from the wetlands surveyed in this study indicating that anammox bacteria are an important part of the metabolic functioning of the microbial communities in these ecosystems we also noted a high abundance of srb and dnra bacteria particularly at sites with low c n ratios and high sulfate concentrations the degree of anammox activity and sulfide oxidation sulfate reduction in batch tests provides evidence of a link between sulfide driven dnra and anammox activity in situ as has been previously noted in other ecosystems francis et al 2007 nelson et al 2004 hence it is likely that interactions among srb dnra bacteria and anammox bacteria are an important part of a complex microbial network responsible for sulfur and nitrogen cycling in tropical wetland ecosystems fig 7 this finding has environmental and industrial implications as the abundance of srb and dnra bacteria in microbial communities is associated with local concentrations of inorganic sulfur concentrations discharge of inorganic sulfur from wwtps is not typically regulated nor are inorganic sulfur compounds typically monitored during environmental assessments qiu et al 2019 wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 similarly the concentration of inorganic sulfate is not usually considered in analyses of nitrogen removal in wwtps adapting anammox bacteria that are naturally associated with sulfide driven dnra to conditions in wwtps may offer an interesting opportunity for nitrogen removal creating and maintaining an autotrophic environment suitable for proliferation of anammox bacteria fueled by nitrate reduction and a constant influx of sulfide and ammonium further emissions of nitrous oxide a potent greenhouse gas emitted by wwtps could also be controlled by utilizing the sulfate present in wastewater to minimize the activity of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 5 conclusion the contribution of the anammox process to nitrogen loss in tropical wetland ecosystems was 29 8 57 4 anammox bacteria are ubiquitous in the wetlands around singapore with a relative abundance of 0 30 0 04 to 0 82 0 08 populations include members of the genera of ca anammoximicrobium ca brocadia ca kuenenia and likely new species correlations among the abundance of srb dnra bacteria and anammox bacteria suggest that sulfide driven dnra plays an important role in sulfur and nitrogen cycling in wetland ecosystems by supporting nitrogen removal mediated by the anammox process the predicted metagenomes of the different wetlands demonstrate a comparative lack of genes related to denitrification pathways providing indirect evidence that sulfide driven dnra supported growth of anammox bacteria batch tests and isotope tracing confirmed the presence of sulfide driven dnra with sulfide as the electron donor which can be an important biochemical process to supply substrates for anammox bacteria and emphasizes the critical microbial interactions in promoting anammox activity in situ sulfate concentrations and abundance of dsra and nrfa genes in ecosystems could provide indirect evidence of anammox activity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17362,the recovery of phosphorus p from wastewaters is a worthy goal considering the potential environmental and economic benefits flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi which employs flowable carbon electrodes instead of the static electrodes used in conventional cdi has been demonstrated to be a promising p recovery technology fcdi outperforms cdi and other competitive technologies in a number of aspects including i large salt adsorption capacity and ii extremely high water recovery rate in this study magnetic fe3o4 impregnated activated carbon particles were prepared and applied as fcdi electrodes the magnetic carbon electrodes were found to have a strong affinity towards p facilitating the selective adsorption of p to the magnetic particles through a ligand exhange mechanism continuous operation of the fcdi system could be achieved with only three minutes required to separate the electrode particles from the brine stream on application of an external magnetic field a p rich stream was produced on regeneration of the exhausted magnetic electrodes using alkali solution we envision that the use of magnetic carbon enhanced flow electrodes will pave the way for efficient operation of fcdi as well as the preferential recovery of p graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization magnetic carbon phosphate recovery continuous operation 1 introduction while phosphorus p is required for the normal functioning of all organisms excessive p input into water bodies is partially responsible for the exacerbation of eutrophication and the global occurrence of harmful algal blooms with resultant threats to the safety of drinking water supplies and to the ecological balance of aquatic systems conley et al 2009 elser and bennett 2011 smith 2003 municipal and industrial wastewaters are generally considered to be the dominant point sources for p discharge whereas agricultural run off is recognized to be the major non point source almeelbi and bezbaruah 2012 reduction of these p inputs into receiving waters is essential if eutrophication is to be prevented with increasingly stringent regulations being enforced especially for sensitive waterbodies such as lakes or rivers serving as drinking water supplies loganathan et al 2014 despite the ecosystem degradation caused by severe p pollution the availability of readily accessible p resources is rapidly decreasing with available mineral reserves expected to be depleted in less than one hundred years bradford hartke et al 2015 cordell et al 2009 to address this conundrum it is vital that p be recovered from waste streams rather than transferred from solution phase into a waste sludge phase dong et al 2017 lei et al 2018a lei et al 2020 a variety of p harvesting techniques have been explored with the more successful of these expected to assist in alleviating the increasingly serious p crisis cunha et al 2018 one of the promising techniques is to harvest p in mineral form as struvite vivianite or calcium phosphate however the cystallization approach is reported to suffer from i unsatisfactory recovery efficiency 10 50 ii complex operational conditions including the need for additional mg2 dosage and ph adjustment and iii generation of low value products at excessive cost hao et al 2013 tian et al 2019 wilfert et al 2015 wilfert et al 2020 apart from chemical crystallization electrochemically based technologies have been proposed as efficient means of p pre concentration and recovery bian et al 2020 cid et al 2018 lei et al 2018b recently a one step membrane free electrochemical process was proposed involving the formation of cap without the need for additional chemicals lei et al 2017 taking advantage of the in situ increase in ph through electro mediated water reduction homogeneous and heterogeneous cap nucleation takes place on or near the cathode surface results demonstrated that 60 p can be eventually harvested from the cathode in the form of cap lei et al 2017 however it was shown that the presence of organic matter carbonate and mg2 had a negative impact on efficiency of p recovery and resulted in a decrease in the purity of the obtained products electrodialysis ed represents a potential alternative method to accumulate p and salts in the concentrate chamber with simultaneous production of freshwater in the dilute chamber rotta et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 while ed is highly efficient for p preconcentration further separation of p from other co existing ions in the concentrate stream remains a challenge flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi in which flowable carbon electrodes adsorb charged species from the feed stream has the potential for continuous and energy efficient operation hatzell et al 2015 he et al 2018 jeon et al 2013 rommerskirchen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a although initially developed as an innovative approach for saline water desalination fcdi application has recently been broadened to resource recovery including phosphorus nitrogen and precious metals with the potential for near zero liquid discharge bian et al 2019 fang et al 2018 rommerskirchen et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a previous investigations have revealed that 80 of the ions present in the feed stream can be effectively concentrated in the fcdi electrode chambers fang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b unfortunately as is the case for ed it is difficult to selectively separate p from other undesired ions e g cl in the electrode chamber another critical technical challenge for fcdi is to effectively separate carbon electrodes from the brine solution thereby realizing continuous operation doornbusch et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2018 it is possible however that the particulate activated carbon electrodes that normally serve as the core component for ion adsorption could potentially be tailored for selective p recovery as well as continuous fcdi operation for instance through modification with iron oxides such as ferrihydrite am feooh goethite α feooh or magnetite fe3o4 p may associate strongly with the electrodes via formation of fe p inner sphere complexes while competing ions such as chloride would be expected to loosely associate with the absorbents thines et al 2017 wu et al 2020 if a magnetic iron oxide such as magnetite fe3o4 or maghemite γ fe2o3 is used the iron oxide impregnated materials can be rapidly separated by application of an external magnetic field thereby enabling the efficient recovery of the adsorbed p fang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 in this study we first synthesized magnetic carbon electrodes by coating fe3o4 on the surface of activated carbon particles the properties of the synthesized electrodes were throughly evaluated via a series of methods including brunauer emmet teller bet analysis x ray diffraction xrd vibrating sample magnetometry vsm test and conductivity the efficacy of the fcdi system with magnetic flow electrodes for salt removal and p recovery was then examined the impacts of current density hydraulic retention time hrt and electrolyte salt concentration on fcdi performance were systematicallly investigated based on the optimal parameters obtained the fcdi system was operated for an extended period 4 days to further examine the robustness of the magnetic iron oxide impregnated carbon flow electrode enhanced p

prepared by mixing 9 wt magnetic carbon particles 1 wt carbon black powder vulcan xc72r from cabot co usa and 90 wt milli q water as illustrated in fig 1 a the fcdi cell consists of two graphite current collectors 90 mm 90 mm thickness 4 mm a pair of ion exchange membranes aem type ii cem type ii fujifilm europe and a polyester net 100 mesh 44 mm 50 mm thickness 0 5 mm which were held together by a pair of polyvinyl chloride pvc endplates serpentine channels 2 mm 2 mm total length of 570 mm were carved on graphite current collectors allowing for the flow electrodes to flow anode and cathode chambers were formed by covering the current collectors with aem and cem respectively the whole contact area between the current collector and iem a was 22 0 cm2 while the effective contact area between the flow channel and iem aeff was 11 9 cm2 the polyester net was placed between two iems forming a spacer chamber through which feed water can flow silicone gaskets were employed between all components to prevent water leakage all experiments were conducted in single pass mode with the wastewater flowing through the spacer chamber at a flowrate controlled by a peristaltic pump bt100 1l longer flow electrodes were recirculated between the electrode chamber and the shared reservoir at a constant flowrate of 29 ml min 1 in order to determine the optimal operating conditions

monitored using a vernier current probe samples of the treated water and electrolyte were obtained by filtering the slurry electrodes through a 0 22 µm microfiltration membrane at the end of the operation the p rich electrodes were separated by applying an external magnetic field fig 1b after adding a certain amount of naoh solution into the electrodes p was efficiently desorbed accompanied by the regeneration of the electrodes fig 1c the overall p extraction process is illustrated in fig s1 2 3 characterizations and calculations the surface area of the electrodes was determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms using the brunauer emmet teller bet method while the pore size distribution was obtained by a non local density functional theory nldft method hisaki et al 2018 prior to

fitted with a co tube operated at 45 kv and 40 ma to measure the slurry electrode conductivity a special electrochemical cell was fabricated fig s3 during the test the flow electrode passed through the spacer chamber located between the two current collectors titanium plates at a flowrate of 4 5 ml min 1 a constant voltage i e 50 mv was applied to the two current collectors using a dc power

represents the distance between the two current collectors and a plate is the effective area of the current collector in order to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the magnetic carbon particles 0 1 g of particles was added to a 10 ml solution with different p concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 mg l 1 for 24 h to reach the adsorption equilibrium the residual p concentrations in the aqueous

intensities were observed for magnetic carbon powders containing greater fe3o4 contents indicating the formation of more active sites for p adsorption 3 1 2 magnetic properties fig 2b depicts the typical magnetization hysteresis loops of the magnetic carbon particles at room temperature with higher fe3o4 contents resulting in greater magnetization response no remanence or coercivity was observed suggesting that the magnetic carbon particles are superparamagnetic yantasee et al 2007 saturation magnetization sm values of magnetic carbon with 5 10 20 and 30 wt fe3o4 were calculated as 0 51 2 73 6 82 and 11 33 emu g 1 respectively although the sm value in the 10 wt scenario was relatively low it was still sufficient to realize the effective separation of the solid particles inserted photo in fig 2b from the liquid phase with the assistance of an external magnetic field with the partitioning of the solid and liquid phases being achieved much more rapidly 3 min than could be achieved by sedimentation or membrane filtration processes drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 such ease of separation not only provides the opportunity for continuous operation of the fcdi system but also allows for subsequent p extraction via alkaline regeneration 3 1 3 bet analyses the bet specific surface area and porosity of carbon samples were investigated via n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k using liquid nitrogen as the adsorbent as illustrated in fig 3 a all the carbon samples exhibit a typical type i isotherm according to the bddt brunauer deming deming and teller classification do duong 1998 which revealed that mesopores and micropores were the main contributors to n2 adsorption the major textural parameters i e bet surface area and average pore diameter of all these samples can be calculated from the n2 adsorption isotherms and are presented in fig 3b it is no surprise that the introduction of fe3o4 onto the carbon particle surface resulted in a decrease in both surface area and average pore diameter for instance the surface area and average pore diameter of pristine carbon were 1090 9 m2 g 1 and 1 29 µm respectively on adding10 wt fe3o4 only a marginal decrease in these values was observed yet a sharp decrease especially in surface area was evident on increasing the fe3o4 content to 30 wt these results are in line with previous reports with the reduction in surface area and pore diameter attributed to the blocking of activated carbon pores by the crystalline fe3o4 do et al 2011 3 1 4 equilibrium isotherm under static adsorption to gain more insight into the adsorption process between p and the magnetic carbon particles classical langmuir isotherm models were employed to describe the equilibrium p sorption data the langmuir isotherm model is representative of monolayer sorption occurring on an energetically uniform surface on which the adsorbed molecules are not interactive accordingly equilibrium is attained once the monolayer is completely saturated the experimental adsorption data was fitted by the langmuir isotherm models expressed as 9 q e q max k l c 1 k l c where q e is the amount of p adsorbed c is p concentration in the solution qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity k l is the langmuir constant related to the adsorption energy or affinity respectively as illustrated in fig 4 a the isotherm data were well fitted by the langmuir model with the obtained model parameters presented in table 1 note that the regression coefficients for the langmuir model were close to 1 implying the excellent applicability of the langmuir model for description of equilibrium p adsorption the results also revealed that the interaction between p and magnetic particles was likely to be a monolayer sorption process magnetic carbon particles with higher fe3o4 contents possessed larger q max especially when the iron oxide content increased from 5 to 10 wt further increase in fe3o4 contents to 20 or 30 wt showed less effect in enhancing the p adsorption capacity with this lack of improvement possibly associated with the increasing extent of aggregation of the fe3o4 particles as the iron oxide loading is increased with a concomitant overall reduction in surface area the dominant mechanism of p trapping by magnetic carbon absorbents is inner sphere complexation via the ligand exchange process li et al 2016 loganathan et al 2014 actually the surfaces of the iron oxides are generally covered with hydroxyl groups in aqueous solution with these hydroxyl groups being replaced by p through the covalent chemical bond formed between the ligand and the iron atom as clearly illustrated in fig s2 an inner sphere complex can be formed when a p molecule interacts with one or two iron atoms mono or binuclear respectively via one or two oxygen bonds mono or bidentate respectively in contrast other competitive anions such as chloride and nitrate only have a weak interaction with iron oxide through outer sphere complex formation as a water molecule is generally present between the anion and the iron oxide surface thus magnetic carbon particles appear to be an ideal option for p selective adsorption even when competing co existing anions are present 3 1 5 conductivity of the slurry electrodes composed of magnetic carbon particles flow electrodes were prepared by mixing 10 wt magnetic carbon particles and 90 wt milli q water for more than 12 hours the well mixed slurry electrodes flowed through a specially designed electrochemical cell fig s3 and a constant voltage was applied across the two current collectors with the current response monitored the conductivity of the flow electrodes can be obtained according to eq 3 with results shown in fig 4b obviously impregnating fe3o4 onto the carbon surface led to a negative influence on the electrical conductivity of the flow electrodes for instance the pristine carbon slurry electrode has a conductivity of 160 µs cm 1 with this value reduced by nearly 45 after modifying with 20 wt fe3o4 this result is not particularly surprising as the intrinsic electrical conductivity of fe3o4 is relatively low compared to that of carbon to reduce the electrical resistance and enhance the overall performance 1 wt of conductive carbon black was added into the flowable electrodes as reported in previous studies akuzum et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a our tests found that the final conductivity of the magnetic carbon modified 10 wt fe3o4 flow electrodes increased nearly 3 times by adding carbon black particles fig s4 3 2 critical parameters influencing fcdi performance in order to obtain the optimal operating conditions the impacts of parameters such as current density hrt and electrolyte salinity on fcdi salt removal and p electro adsorption performances were investigated the obtained results are summarized in fig 5 3 2 1 effects of current density fig 5a reveals the variation of ion removal efficiency and p cl selectivity in treated streams during single pass mode hrt fixed at 2 45 min electrolyte salinity controlled at 20 g l 1 with the current density ranging from 3 4 to 8 0 a m 2 it should be noted that p was prone to removal at a lower current density range whereas cl tended to be eliminated more rapidly over a higher current density range consequently a high p cl selectivity of up to 1 42 was observed at a current density of 3 4 a m 2 while a substantially lower selectivity of 0 86 was observed on increasing the current density to 8 0 a m 2 as the c 0 p c 0 cl ratio is extremely low in municipal wastewater the removal of p faced severe competition from cl similar to previous other selective removal studies hawks et al 2019 wang and lin 2019 operating at higher external current densities will increase the competition between orthophosphate and chloride anions with respect to passage through the aem thereby resulting in a reduction in selectivity for p fig 5d shows the change of the cell voltage and the electrical energy consumption for p extraction as a function of the applied current density a marginal increase in cell voltage with increase in current density to around 6 a m 2 was observed but rose more quickly at higher current densities the electrical energy consumption for p extraction follows a similar trend to that of cell voltage with a reasonable value of approximately 20 kwh kg 1 p achieved at a current density of 6 a m 2 3 2 2 effects of hrt the effects of hrt on fcdi performance are illustrated in fig 5b and 5e while p and cl removal efficiency increased with increase in hrt the p cl selectivity changed little with change in hrt with values ranging from 0 77 to 0 84 the insensitivity of p cl selectivity to hrt is unsurprising as the allocation of charge to inducement of p and cl migration is expected to be fixed for particular current density and electrolyte nacl concentration according to eq 7 the electrical energy consumption for p capture is mainly determined by the cell voltage and extent of reduction in p concentration on extending the hrt the cell voltage only exhibited a small increase but the extent of p concentration reduction increased linearly with this discrepancy leading to a decrease in energy consumption per unit mass of p removed from 33 2 to 23 5 kwh kg 1 p over the hrt range of 1 5 to 3 0 minutes considering the ion removal rate 60 water productivity 1 3 l d 1 per unit and electrical energy consumption 23 kwh kg 1 p the optimal hrt is determined to be 2 45 min 3 2 3 effects of electrolyte salinity as revealed above magnetic carbon particles have a strong affinity for p but no preferential adsorption for cl this intrinsic property suggests that the fate of p and cl transported into the electrode chamber of a short circuited closed cycle scc fcdi would likely be dramatically different with p expected to be retained by the magnetic carbon electrodes and cl released for the most part into the electrolyte when discharging takes place in the shared reservoir ma et al 2019 this difference in behaviour is expected to exert a significant influence on the selective extraction of target compounds in order to mimic this phenomenon magnetic slurry electrodes with various nacl concentrations were prepared and tested in an fcdi system in order to better understand the potential effect of electrolyte salinity on p selectivity as presented in fig 5c cl removal efficiency decreased linearly with increasing electrolyte nacl concentration whereas p removal efficiency only showed marginal reduction especially for nacl concentrations higher than 20 g l 1 with only minor deterioration in p removal efficiency p cl selectivity showed a positive correlation to electrolyte salinity with the final value reaching 1 1 at nacl concentrations under 40 g l 1 pleasingly both the cell voltage and electrical energy consumption decreased with increasing electrolyte salinity fig 5f with this effect primarily ascribed to the decreased internal resistance of the fcdi cell as has been discussed extensively in previous publications yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019b 3 3 long term operation on the basis of the optimal parameters current density 6 14 a m 2 hrt 2 45 min obtained long term 96 hour experiments were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the magnetic carbon electrodes for p selective capture as presented in fig 6 a b the use of magnetic carbon electrodes led to the retention of more than 60 p especially when the elapsed time was longer than 40 hours whereas a consistent decrease in p removal efficiency was observed in the pristine carbon case in addition both cl removal efficiency and cell voltage decreased in a similar manner in the two scenarios indicating that magnetic carbon particles represent an excellent choice for fcdi electrodes if ongoing p removal is required as a consequence increased p cl selectivity was achieved in the magnetic carbon electrode enhanced fcdi process with the final selectivity factor reaching 1 11 i e 32 1 higher than that in the pristine carbon electrode scenario more interestingly the p extraction energy consumption in the magnetic carbon electrode enhanced fcdi process decreased from 26 2 initially to 21 8 kwh kg 1 p at the end of the operation in contrast the p extraction energy consumption in the pristine carbon electrode scenario increased by 18 9 from 25 5 initially to 30 3 kwh kg 1 p at the end of the 96 hour study fig 6c based on the calculation from eq 8 an extremely high water recovery rate of 97 can be achieved however it would be difficult to further improve this value in view of the osmotically induced water transport from the spacer chamber to the electrode chamber as the ion concentration in the flow electrolyte continues to increase throughout the p recovery process additionally iron concentration in the effluent stream was below the detection limit of the icp analysis method used 0 5 mg l 1 revealing that insignificant leakage of iron from the electrode chamber to the spacer chamber took place during the p recovery process analyzing the ion distributions in the liquid phase of the flow electrodes could help to uncover the underlying mechanisms associated with the aforementioned phenomenon fig 7 a c no free p was present in the electrolyte of the magnetic carbon flow electrodes but continuous accumulation of p occurred in the electrolyte of the pristine carbon suspension electrodes fig 7a and b meanwhile the variations in cl concentration were similar in both cases with the final electrolyte salt nacl concentration reaching nearly 40 g l 1 schematic representations of the variations of anion p and cl distributions are clearly illustrated in fig 7d and e note that p was predominantly adsorbed by the magnetic carbon particles even when neutralized in the shared reservoir whereas cl remained free in the liquid solution fig 7e with the continuous accumulation of cl in the electrolyte an increasing cl concentration gradient developed across the aem which will significantly inhibit the migration of cl from the spacer chamber to the anode chamber in comparison negligible p can be observed in the electrolyte with this phenomenon facilitating the ongoing transport of p from the feed solution to the anode chamber thereby enhancing the p cl selectivity mass balance calculations revealed that 61 9 p was trapped by the solid magnetic carbon electrodes with 37 1 remaining in the effluent and only 1 0 present in the electrolyte for the pristine carbon scenario most of the p 82 5 can be found in the electrolyte and effluent fig 7c and fig s5 these results clearly demonstrate that p can only be selectively recovered with the assistance of magnetic carbon electrodes by employing an external magnetic field magnetic carbon particles could be effectively separated in less than 3 min when adding alkaline solution into the separated electrodes nearly 80 of the trapped p was desorbed into the solution fig s6 and the exhausted electrodes can be regenerated and reused for the following cycle note that the recovered p rich stream did not contain other undesired ions such as cl thereby rendering it easier to be further processed for generation of products such as food addtives or p fertilizers 4 conclusions in this study magnetic carbon particles were synthesized by impregnating fe3o4 onto the surface of the carbon particles a series of characterizations were conducted with results demonstrating that the magnetic carbon electrodes with 10 wt fe3o4 was the optimal choice in view of their relatively high surface area good electrical conductivity reasonable static adsorption capacity and magnetization response fcdi incorporated with the magnetic carbon flow electrodes was employed for salt removal and p selective capture from artificial municipal wastewaters based on the optimized operational parameters i e current density 6 14 a m 2 hrt 2 45 min a 96 hour continuous experiment was successfully conducted our results show that 61 9 p can be effectively extracted from the wastewater at a reasonable electrical energy cost of 21 8 kwh kg 1 p the p cl selectivity factor improved from 32 over the course of the 96 hour trial as a consequence of the preferential partitioning of p to the fe3o4 impregnated activated carbon electrodes by separating the magnetic particles by application of a magnetic field a p rich stream can be easily obtained via regeneration of the p loaded magnetic carbon electrode particles with alkaline solution

17362,the recovery of phosphorus p from wastewaters is a worthy goal considering the potential environmental and economic benefits flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi which employs flowable carbon electrodes instead of the static electrodes used in conventional cdi has been demonstrated to be a promising p recovery technology fcdi outperforms cdi and other competitive technologies in a number of aspects including i large salt adsorption capacity and ii extremely high water recovery rate in this study magnetic fe3o4 impregnated activated carbon particles were prepared and applied as fcdi electrodes the magnetic carbon electrodes were found to have a strong affinity towards p facilitating the selective adsorption of p to the magnetic particles through a ligand exhange mechanism continuous operation of the fcdi system could be achieved with only three minutes required to separate the electrode particles from the brine stream on application of an external magnetic field a p rich stream was produced on regeneration of the exhausted magnetic electrodes using alkali solution we envision that the use of magnetic carbon enhanced flow electrodes will pave the way for efficient operation of fcdi as well as the preferential recovery of p graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization magnetic carbon phosphate recovery continuous operation 1 introduction while phosphorus p is required for the normal functioning of all organisms excessive p input into water bodies is partially responsible for the exacerbation of eutrophication and the global occurrence of harmful algal blooms with resultant threats to the safety of drinking water supplies and to the ecological balance of aquatic systems conley et al 2009 elser and bennett 2011 smith 2003 municipal and industrial wastewaters are generally considered to be the dominant point sources for p discharge whereas agricultural run off is recognized to be the major non point source almeelbi and bezbaruah 2012 reduction of these p inputs into receiving waters is essential if eutrophication is to be prevented with increasingly stringent regulations being enforced especially for sensitive waterbodies such as lakes or rivers serving as drinking water supplies loganathan et al 2014 despite the ecosystem degradation caused by severe p pollution the availability of readily accessible p resources is rapidly decreasing with available mineral reserves expected to be depleted in less than one hundred years bradford hartke et al 2015 cordell et al 2009 to address this conundrum it is vital that p be recovered from waste streams rather than transferred from solution phase into a waste sludge phase dong et al 2017 lei et al 2018a lei et al 2020 a variety of p harvesting techniques have been explored with the more successful of these expected to assist in alleviating the increasingly serious p crisis cunha et al 2018 one of the promising techniques is to harvest p in mineral form as struvite vivianite or calcium phosphate however the cystallization approach is reported to suffer from i unsatisfactory recovery efficiency 10 50 ii complex operational conditions including the need for additional mg2 dosage and ph adjustment and iii generation of low value products at excessive cost hao et al 2013 tian et al 2019 wilfert et al 2015 wilfert et al 2020 apart from chemical crystallization electrochemically based technologies have been proposed as efficient means of p pre concentration and recovery bian et al 2020 cid et al 2018 lei et al 2018b recently a one step membrane free electrochemical process was proposed involving the formation of cap without the need for additional chemicals lei et al 2017 taking advantage of the in situ increase in ph through electro mediated water reduction homogeneous and heterogeneous cap nucleation takes place on or near the cathode surface results demonstrated that 60 p can be eventually harvested from the cathode in the form of cap lei et al 2017 however it was shown that the presence of organic matter carbonate and mg2 had a negative impact on efficiency of p recovery and resulted in a decrease in the purity of the obtained products electrodialysis ed represents a potential alternative method to accumulate p and salts in the concentrate chamber with simultaneous production of freshwater in the dilute chamber rotta et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 while ed is highly efficient for p preconcentration further separation of p from other co existing ions in the concentrate stream remains a challenge flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi in which flowable carbon electrodes adsorb charged species from the feed stream has the potential for continuous and energy efficient operation hatzell et al 2015 he et al 2018 jeon et al 2013 rommerskirchen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a although initially developed as an innovative approach for saline water desalination fcdi application has recently been broadened to resource recovery including phosphorus nitrogen and precious metals with the potential for near zero liquid discharge bian et al 2019 fang et al 2018 rommerskirchen et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a previous investigations have revealed that 80 of the ions present in the feed stream can be effectively concentrated in the fcdi electrode chambers fang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b unfortunately as is the case for ed it is difficult to selectively separate p from other undesired ions e g cl in the electrode chamber another critical technical challenge for fcdi is to effectively separate carbon electrodes from the brine solution thereby realizing continuous operation doornbusch et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2018 it is possible however that the particulate activated carbon electrodes that normally serve as the core component for ion adsorption could potentially be tailored for selective p recovery as well as continuous fcdi operation for instance through modification with iron oxides such as ferrihydrite am feooh goethite α feooh or magnetite fe3o4 p may associate strongly with the electrodes via formation of fe p inner sphere complexes while competing ions such as chloride would be expected to loosely associate with the absorbents thines et al 2017 wu et al 2020 if a magnetic iron oxide such as magnetite fe3o4 or maghemite γ fe2o3 is used the iron oxide impregnated materials can be rapidly separated by application of an external magnetic field thereby enabling the efficient recovery of the adsorbed p fang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 in this study we first synthesized magnetic carbon electrodes by coating fe3o4 on the surface of activated carbon particles the properties of the synthesized electrodes were throughly evaluated via a series of methods including brunauer emmet teller bet analysis x ray diffraction xrd vibrating sample magnetometry vsm test and conductivity the efficacy of the fcdi system with magnetic flow electrodes for salt removal and p recovery was then examined the impacts of current density hydraulic retention time hrt and electrolyte salt concentration on fcdi performance were systematicallly investigated based on the optimal parameters obtained the fcdi system was operated for an extended period 4 days to further examine the robustness of the magnetic iron oxide impregnated carbon flow electrode enhanced p

prepared by mixing 9 wt magnetic carbon particles 1 wt carbon black powder vulcan xc72r from cabot co usa and 90 wt milli q water as illustrated in fig 1 a the fcdi cell consists of two graphite current collectors 90 mm 90 mm thickness 4 mm a pair of ion exchange membranes aem type ii cem type ii fujifilm europe and a polyester net 100 mesh 44 mm 50 mm thickness 0 5 mm which were held together by a pair of polyvinyl chloride pvc endplates serpentine channels 2 mm 2 mm total length of 570 mm were carved on graphite current collectors allowing for the flow electrodes to flow anode and cathode chambers were formed by covering the current collectors with aem and cem respectively the whole contact area between the current collector and iem a was 22 0 cm2 while the effective contact area between the flow channel and iem aeff was 11 9 cm2 the polyester net was placed between two iems forming a spacer chamber through which feed water can flow silicone gaskets were employed between all components to prevent water leakage all experiments were conducted in single pass mode with the wastewater flowing through the spacer chamber at a flowrate controlled by a peristaltic pump bt100 1l longer flow electrodes were recirculated between the electrode chamber and the shared reservoir at a constant flowrate of 29 ml min 1 in order to determine the optimal operating conditions

dionex subsequent to these optimization trials a 4 day continuous operation was conducted utilizing the optimal parameters determined the current i and voltage u through the electrical circuit were monitored using a vernier current probe samples of the treated water and electrolyte were obtained by filtering the slurry electrodes through a 0 22 µm microfiltration membrane at the end of the operation the p rich electrodes were separated by applying an external magnetic field fig 1b after adding a certain amount of naoh solution into the electrodes p was efficiently desorbed accompanied by the regeneration of the electrodes fig 1c the overall p extraction process is illustrated in fig s1 2 3 characterizations and calculations the surface area of the electrodes was determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms using the brunauer emmet teller bet method while the pore size distribution was obtained by a non local density functional theory nldft method hisaki et al 2018 prior to surface area analysis the samples were heated at 573 k in a vacuum line for more than 9 hours the magnetic properties of the materials were analyzed using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm equipped

fitted with a co tube operated at 45 kv and 40 ma to measure the slurry electrode conductivity a special electrochemical cell was fabricated fig s3 during the test the flow electrode passed through the spacer chamber located between the two current collectors titanium plates at a flowrate of 4 5 ml min 1 a constant voltage i e 50 mv was applied to the two current collectors using a dc power supply mp3094 powertech after 600 s the steady response current was recorded via a vernier voltage probe and sensordaq the conductivity of the flow electrodes was calculated according to 3 σ i fe i 0 u cell d cell a plate where i 0 is the background current with milli q water only i fe is the response current in the presence of the flow electrodes under a constant cell voltage u cell d cell represents the distance between the two current collectors and a plate is the effective area of the current collector in order to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the magnetic carbon particles 0 1 g of particles was added to a 10 ml solution with different p concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 mg l 1 for 24 h to reach the adsorption equilibrium the residual p concentrations in the aqueous solutions were determined using ion chromatography p adsorbed at equilibrium q e can be calculated according to 4 q e v c 0 c e m where v is the volume of solution m is the mass of magnetic carbon electrodes and c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium p concentrations the relationship between the equilibrium p concentration and carbon adsorption capacity was fitted using a classical

electrodes are displayed in fig 2 a well resolved diffraction peaks confirmed the existence and high crystallinity of magnetite fe3o4 in the samples the major peaks of magnetite are located at 2θ values of approximately 35 5 43 5 62 6 74 2 corresponding to the 311 400 440 and 533 crystal planes of face centered cubic fe3o4 jcpds standard card 19 0629 respectively hung et al 2016 higher intensities were observed for magnetic carbon powders containing greater fe3o4 contents indicating the formation of more active sites for p adsorption 3 1 2 magnetic properties fig 2b depicts the typical magnetization hysteresis loops of the magnetic carbon particles at room temperature with higher fe3o4 contents resulting in greater magnetization response no remanence or coercivity was observed suggesting that the magnetic carbon particles are superparamagnetic yantasee et al 2007 saturation magnetization sm values of magnetic carbon with 5 10 20 and 30 wt fe3o4 were calculated as 0 51 2 73 6 82 and 11 33 emu g 1 respectively although the sm value in the 10 wt scenario was relatively low it was still sufficient to realize the effective separation of the solid particles inserted photo in fig 2b from the liquid phase with the assistance of an external magnetic field with the partitioning of the solid and liquid phases being achieved much more rapidly 3 min than could be achieved by sedimentation or membrane filtration processes drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 such ease of separation not only provides the opportunity for continuous operation of the fcdi system but also allows for subsequent p extraction via alkaline regeneration 3 1 3 bet analyses the bet specific surface area and porosity of carbon samples were investigated via n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k using liquid nitrogen as the adsorbent as illustrated in fig 3 a all the carbon samples exhibit a typical type i isotherm according to the bddt brunauer deming deming and teller classification do duong 1998 which revealed that mesopores and micropores were the main contributors to n2 adsorption the major textural parameters i e bet surface area and average pore diameter of all these samples can be calculated from the n2 adsorption isotherms and are presented in fig 3b it is no surprise that the introduction of fe3o4 onto the carbon particle surface resulted in a decrease in both surface area and average pore diameter for instance the surface area and average pore diameter of pristine carbon were 1090 9 m2 g 1 and 1 29 µm respectively on adding10 wt fe3o4 only a marginal decrease in these values was observed yet a sharp decrease especially in surface area was evident on increasing the fe3o4 content to 30 wt these results are in line with previous reports with the reduction in surface area and pore diameter attributed to the blocking of activated carbon pores by the crystalline fe3o4 do et al 2011 3 1 4 equilibrium isotherm under static adsorption to gain more insight into the adsorption process between p and the magnetic carbon particles classical langmuir isotherm models were employed to describe the equilibrium p sorption data the langmuir isotherm model is representative of monolayer sorption occurring on an energetically uniform surface on which the adsorbed molecules are not interactive accordingly equilibrium is attained once the monolayer is completely saturated the experimental adsorption data was fitted by the langmuir isotherm models expressed as 9 q e q max k l c 1 k l c where q e is the amount of p adsorbed c is p concentration in the solution qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity k l is the langmuir constant related to the adsorption energy or affinity respectively as illustrated in fig 4 a the isotherm data were well fitted by the langmuir model with the obtained model parameters presented in table 1 note that the regression coefficients for the langmuir model were close to 1 implying the excellent applicability of the langmuir model for description of equilibrium p adsorption the results also revealed that the interaction between p and magnetic particles was likely to be a monolayer sorption process magnetic carbon particles with higher fe3o4 contents possessed larger q max especially when the iron oxide content increased from 5 to 10 wt further increase in fe3o4 contents to 20 or 30 wt showed less effect in enhancing the p adsorption capacity with this lack of improvement possibly associated with the increasing extent of aggregation of the fe3o4 particles as the iron oxide loading is increased with a concomitant overall reduction in surface area the dominant mechanism of p trapping by magnetic carbon absorbents is inner sphere complexation via the ligand exchange process li et al 2016 loganathan et al 2014 actually the surfaces of the iron oxides are generally covered with hydroxyl groups in aqueous solution with these hydroxyl groups being replaced by p through the covalent chemical bond formed between the ligand and the iron atom as clearly illustrated in fig s2 an inner sphere complex can be formed when a p molecule interacts with one or two iron atoms mono or binuclear respectively via one or two oxygen bonds mono or bidentate respectively in contrast other competitive anions such as chloride and nitrate only have a weak interaction with iron oxide through outer sphere complex formation as a water molecule is generally present between the anion and the iron oxide surface thus magnetic carbon particles appear to be an ideal option for p selective adsorption even when competing co existing anions are present 3 1 5 conductivity of the slurry electrodes composed of magnetic carbon particles flow electrodes were prepared by mixing 10 wt magnetic carbon particles and 90 wt milli q water for more than 12 hours the well mixed slurry electrodes flowed through a specially designed electrochemical cell fig s3 and a constant voltage was applied across the two current collectors with the current response monitored the conductivity of the flow electrodes can be obtained according to eq 3 with results shown in fig 4b obviously impregnating fe3o4 onto the carbon surface led to a negative influence on the electrical conductivity of the flow electrodes for instance the pristine carbon slurry electrode has a conductivity of 160 µs cm 1 with this value reduced by nearly 45 after modifying with 20 wt fe3o4 this result is not particularly surprising as the intrinsic electrical conductivity of fe3o4 is relatively low compared to that of carbon to reduce the electrical resistance and enhance the overall performance 1 wt of conductive carbon black was added into the flowable electrodes as reported in previous studies akuzum et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a our tests found that the final conductivity of the magnetic carbon modified 10 wt fe3o4 flow electrodes increased nearly 3 times by adding carbon black particles fig s4 3 2 critical parameters influencing fcdi performance in order to obtain the optimal operating conditions the impacts of parameters such as current density hrt and electrolyte salinity on fcdi salt removal and p electro adsorption performances were investigated the obtained results are summarized in fig 5 3 2 1 effects of current density fig 5a reveals the variation of ion removal efficiency and p cl selectivity in treated streams during single pass mode hrt fixed at 2 45 min electrolyte salinity controlled at 20 g l 1 with the current density ranging from 3 4 to 8 0 a m 2 it should be noted that p was prone to removal at a lower current density range whereas cl tended to be eliminated more rapidly over a higher current density range consequently a high p cl selectivity of up to 1 42 was observed at a current density of 3 4 a m 2 while a substantially lower selectivity of 0 86 was observed on increasing the current density to 8 0 a m 2 as the c 0 p c 0 cl ratio is extremely low in municipal wastewater the removal of p faced severe competition from cl similar to previous other selective removal studies hawks et al 2019 wang and lin 2019 operating at higher external current densities will increase the competition between orthophosphate and chloride anions with respect to passage through the aem thereby resulting in a reduction in selectivity for p fig 5d shows the change of the cell voltage and the electrical energy consumption for p extraction as a function of the applied current density a marginal increase in cell voltage with increase in current density to around 6 a m 2 was observed but rose more quickly at higher current densities the electrical energy consumption for p extraction follows a similar trend to that of cell voltage with a reasonable value of approximately 20 kwh kg 1 p achieved at a current density of 6 a m 2 3 2 2 effects of hrt the effects of hrt on fcdi performance are illustrated in fig 5b and 5e while p and cl removal efficiency increased with increase in hrt the p cl selectivity changed little with change in hrt with values ranging from 0 77 to 0 84 the insensitivity of p cl selectivity to hrt is unsurprising as the allocation of charge to inducement of p and cl migration is expected to be fixed for particular current density and electrolyte nacl concentration according to eq 7 the electrical energy consumption for p capture is mainly determined by the cell voltage and extent of reduction in p concentration on extending the hrt the cell voltage only exhibited a small increase but the extent of p concentration reduction increased linearly with this discrepancy leading to a decrease in energy consumption per unit mass of p removed from 33 2 to 23 5 kwh kg 1 p over the hrt range of 1 5 to 3 0 minutes considering the ion removal rate 60 water productivity 1 3 l d 1 per unit and electrical energy consumption 23 kwh kg 1 p the optimal hrt is determined to be 2 45 min 3 2 3 effects of electrolyte salinity as revealed above magnetic carbon particles have a strong affinity for p but no preferential adsorption for cl this intrinsic property suggests that the fate of p and cl transported into the electrode chamber of a short circuited closed cycle scc fcdi would likely be dramatically different with p expected to be retained by the magnetic carbon electrodes and cl released for the most part into the electrolyte when discharging takes place in the shared reservoir ma et al 2019 this difference in behaviour is expected to exert a significant influence on the selective extraction of target compounds in order to mimic this phenomenon magnetic slurry electrodes with various nacl concentrations were prepared and tested in an fcdi system in order to better understand the potential effect of electrolyte salinity on p selectivity as presented in fig 5c cl removal efficiency decreased linearly with increasing electrolyte nacl concentration whereas p removal efficiency only showed marginal reduction especially for nacl concentrations higher than 20 g l 1 with only minor deterioration in p removal efficiency p cl selectivity showed a positive correlation to electrolyte salinity with the final value reaching 1 1 at nacl concentrations under 40 g l 1 pleasingly both the cell voltage and electrical energy consumption decreased with increasing electrolyte salinity fig 5f with this effect primarily ascribed to the decreased internal resistance of the fcdi cell as has been discussed extensively in previous publications yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019b 3 3 long term operation on the basis of the optimal parameters current density 6 14 a m 2 hrt 2 45 min obtained long term 96 hour experiments were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the magnetic carbon electrodes for p selective capture as presented in fig 6 a b the use of magnetic carbon electrodes led to the retention of more than 60 p especially when the elapsed time was longer than 40 hours whereas a consistent decrease in p removal efficiency was observed in the pristine carbon case in addition both cl removal efficiency and cell voltage decreased in a similar manner in the two scenarios indicating that magnetic carbon particles represent an excellent choice for fcdi electrodes if ongoing p removal is required as a consequence increased p cl selectivity was achieved in the magnetic carbon electrode enhanced fcdi process with the final selectivity factor reaching 1 11 i e 32 1 higher than that in the pristine carbon electrode scenario more interestingly the p extraction energy consumption in the magnetic carbon electrode enhanced fcdi process decreased from 26 2 initially to 21 8 kwh kg 1 p at the end of the operation in contrast the p extraction energy consumption in the pristine carbon electrode scenario increased by 18 9 from 25 5 initially to 30 3 kwh kg 1 p at the end of the 96 hour study fig 6c based on the calculation from eq 8 an extremely high water recovery rate of 97 can be achieved however it would be difficult to further improve this value in view of the osmotically induced water transport from the spacer chamber to the electrode chamber as the ion concentration in the flow electrolyte continues to increase throughout the p recovery process additionally iron concentration in the effluent stream was below the detection limit of the icp analysis method used 0 5 mg l 1 revealing that insignificant leakage of iron from the electrode chamber to the spacer chamber took place during the p recovery process analyzing the ion distributions in the liquid phase of the flow electrodes could help to uncover the underlying mechanisms associated with the aforementioned phenomenon fig 7 a c no free p was present in the electrolyte of the magnetic carbon flow electrodes but continuous accumulation of p occurred in the electrolyte of the pristine carbon suspension electrodes fig 7a and b meanwhile the variations in cl concentration were similar in both cases with the final electrolyte salt nacl concentration reaching nearly 40 g l 1 schematic representations of the variations of anion p and cl distributions are clearly illustrated in fig 7d and e note that p was predominantly adsorbed by the magnetic carbon particles even when neutralized in the shared reservoir whereas cl remained free in the liquid solution fig 7e with the continuous accumulation of cl in the electrolyte an increasing cl concentration gradient developed across the aem which will significantly inhibit the migration of cl from the spacer chamber to the anode chamber in comparison negligible p can be observed in the electrolyte with this phenomenon facilitating the ongoing transport of p from the feed solution to the anode chamber thereby enhancing the p cl selectivity mass balance calculations revealed that 61 9 p was trapped by the solid magnetic carbon electrodes with 37 1 remaining in the effluent and only 1 0 present in the electrolyte for the pristine carbon scenario most of the p 82 5 can be found in the electrolyte and effluent fig 7c and fig s5 these results clearly demonstrate that p can only be selectively recovered with the assistance of magnetic carbon electrodes by employing an external magnetic field magnetic carbon particles could be effectively separated in less than 3 min when adding alkaline solution into the separated electrodes nearly 80 of the trapped p was desorbed into the solution fig s6 and the exhausted electrodes can be regenerated and reused for the following cycle note that the recovered p rich stream did not contain other undesired ions such as cl thereby rendering it easier to be further processed for generation of products such as food addtives or p fertilizers 4 conclusions in this study magnetic carbon particles were synthesized by impregnating fe3o4 onto the surface of the carbon particles a series of characterizations were conducted with results demonstrating that the magnetic carbon electrodes with 10 wt fe3o4 was the optimal choice in view of their relatively high surface area good electrical conductivity reasonable static adsorption capacity and magnetization response fcdi incorporated with the magnetic carbon flow electrodes was employed for salt removal and p selective capture from artificial municipal wastewaters based on the optimized operational parameters i e current density 6 14 a m 2 hrt 2 45 min a 96 hour continuous experiment was successfully conducted our results show that 61 9 p can be effectively extracted from the wastewater at a reasonable electrical energy cost of 21 8 kwh kg 1 p the p cl selectivity factor improved from 32 over the course of the 96 hour trial as a consequence of the preferential partitioning of p to the fe3o4 impregnated activated carbon electrodes by separating the magnetic particles by application of a magnetic field a p rich stream can be easily obtained via regeneration of the p loaded magnetic carbon electrode particles with alkaline solution

17363,growing evidence shows that riverine networks surrounding urban landscapes may be hotspots of riverine greenhouse gas ghg emissions this study strengthens the evidence by investigating the spatial variability of diffusive ghg n2o ch4 co2 emissions from river reaches that drain from different types of landscapes i e urban agricultural mixed and forest landscapes in the chaohu lake basin of eastern china our results showed that almost all the rivers were oversaturated with dissolved ghgs urban rivers were identified as emission hotspots with mean fluxes of 470 μmol m 2 d 1 for n2o 7 mmol m 2 d 1 for ch4 and 900 mmol m 2 d 1 for co2 corresponding to 14 seven and two times of those from the non urban rivers in the chaohu lake basin respectively factors related to the high n2o and ch4 emissions in urban rivers included large nutrient supply and hypoxic environments the factors affecting co2 were similar in all the rivers which were temperature dependent with suitable environments that allowed rapid decomposition of organic matter overall this study highlights that better recognition of the influence that river networks have on global warming is required particularly when it comes to urban rivers as urban land cover and populations will continue to expand in the future management measures should incorporate regional hotspots to more efficiently mitigate ghg emissions graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords watershed chaohu lake basin carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide urban 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 are well known greenhouse gasses ghg raymond et al 2013 reay et al 2012 recent monitoring by the world meteorological organization showed that their concentrations in the global atmosphere have reached 331 1 0 1 parts per billion ppb 1869 2 ppb and 408 0 0 1 parts per million ppm steadily increasing by 123 259 and 147 since the mid 18th century respectively wmo 2019 such high atmospheric ghg enrichment has resulted in a number of issues including global warming and associated ecological damages convey and peck 2019 an intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report showed that global warming is likely to reach 1 5 c in the next 10 30 years as ghg are continuously added to the atmosphere which undoubtedly increases climate related risks for natural and human systems ipcc 2018 ghg emissions from various ecosystems have thus become one of the key issues in ecology and global change research raymond et al 2013 yvon durocher et al 2014 direct ghg production from terrestrial ecosystems as a result of intensified human activities has been well documented and thus has become a relatively well constrained component of the global ghg budget quick et al 2019 in contrast ghg emissions from river networks have received less attention and are consequently less constrained although studies have increasingly demonstrated that rivers play an important role in global ghg budgets that is disproportional to their areal extent borges et al 2015b cole et al 2007 therefore including more measurements of in stream ghg emissions is essential to close knowledge gaps in both global and regional ghg assessment efforts as well as to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms behind riverine ghg production forested urban and agricultural rivers that drain different watershed landscapes result in different riverine dissolved ghg concentrations and fluxes borges et al 2018 mwanake et al 2019 of these forested rivers were most frequently found to have low ghg emissions per unit area for example borges et al 2018 showed that forested rivers are important n2o sources although their areal emissions were generally lower than agricultural rivers they can also behave as n2o sinks as exhibited in some tropical forested rivers where do levels were low and microbial conversion of n2o to n2 was strong particularly when they are connected to wetlands borges et al 2019 audet et al 2020 also observed source sink dynamics of n2o emissions in forested streams from sweden for ch4 and co2 forested rivers are usually found to be significant atmospheric sources as observed in the amazon river amaral et al 2018 melack et al 2004 and congo river borges et al 2015a such differences among ghg types and across regions underscores the complexity of ghg emissions from forested rivers implying the necessity of more regional specific ghg measurements in contrast to emissions from forested rivers ghg emissions from agricultural rivers have received more attention ranging from low order headwater streams outram and hiscock 2012 schade et al 2016 wilcock and sorrell 2008 to high order rivers turner et al 2015 xia et al 2013 these studies consistently documented the significance of ghg emissions from agricultural streams and rivers largely due to high inputs from surface runoff and groundwater recharge as well as strong in stream ghg production laini et al 2011 qin et al 2020 xia et al 2013 the main controls are dependent on riverine physical and chemical conditions including carbon and nitrogen n availability temperature dissolved oxygen do and ph quick et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 a growing number of studies focusing on agricultural rivers have improved the methods for regional and global scale ghg budget accounting tian et al 2019 wallin et al 2014 while also drawing more attention to refined agricultural practices designed to better mitigate ghg emissions mwanake et al 2019 peterson et al 2001 urban impacted river networks however receive less attention though they are fed by treated and untreated sewage and their ghg emissions are sometimes substantial existing studies on urban rivers were mainly focused on their spatial and temporal patterns of ghg emissions the influences of sewage discharge and damming e g jin et al 2018 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for example several studies documented that the highest ghg n2o ch4 co2 emissions were often observed in rivers surrounded by highly urbanized regions e g he et al 2017 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and yu et al 2013 their areal ghg emissions can be several to tens of times those reported in nearby less urbanized rivers similarly a parallel analysis of the sewage draining river sections also indicated that their ghg emissions were up to 10 times higher than the river sections without sewage discharge hu et al 2018 other studies discerned that damming on urban rivers had an amplifying effect on ghg emissions jin et al 2018 yang et al 2020 overall ghg emissions from urban rivers are higher than those of forested rivers in many circumstances urban river emissions appear to be even higher than those of zero order agricultural streams which are widely accepted as ghg emission hotspots liu et al 2019 smith et al 2017 these studies consistently support a growing awareness that urban impacted rivers are likely greenhouse gas emission hotspots however surface water emissions of co2 ch4 and n2o have rarely been determined basin wide in river systems that drain different watershed landscapes the compiled data from different rivers across the world as shown in table 1s suggested that ghg fluxes from some agricultural and forested rivers were even higher than most of the urban rivers showing that the roles of the specific river types in contributing ghg fluxes are unclear this points to the need for more careful investigations on ghg emissions from different rivers moreover current bottom up ghg budget accountings mainly emphasize agricultural and forested rivers e g audet et al 2020 iurii et al 2014 melack et al 2004 reay et al 2012 and tian et al 2019 with poor considerations of urban rivers although urban rivers could contribute even higher ghg emissions this further underscores the necessity of more reasonable specifications on ghg emissions from urban rivers in the future as urban land and population continue to expand the associated contributions of ghg to climate forcing will undoubtedly increase thus quantification of the magnitudes and controls of ghg fluxes from urban rivers is critical to comprehensively understand global climate change processes and formulate ghg mitigation strategies for sustainable development this study determined whether urban rivers behave as regional hotspots of diffusive greenhouse gas n2o ch4 co2 emissions as compared to other river types here the urban rivers drain watersheds with 20 of the urban area we measured riverine dissolved n2o ch4 and co2 concentrations in 95 different river reaches in the mixed landscape chaohu lake basin of eastern china 19 of the reaches represented urban rivers the remaining 21 18 and 37 reaches were agricultural forested and mixed river reaches all ghg data were obtained following the same sampling storage and measurement protocols which allowed us to focus on the differences in ghg emissions between the rivers in a comparable way in addition to addressing the overall scientific question this study also aimed at answering the following specific questions 1 what are the magnitudes and patterns of ghg concentrations in river networks in a mixed landscape basin 2 what riverine physical and chemical conditions are influencing riverine ghg saturation 3 what are the controls of the spatial variabilities of ghg emissions among rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampled riverine types chaohu lake is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china fig 1 with a surface area of 780 km2 and a basin area of 13 500 km2 it lies on the north shore of the lower reaches of the yangtze river and is adjacent to the highly developed and densely populated yangtze river delta the lake is mainly fed by 33 rivers but only a few e g the nanfei and hangbu rivers contribute most of the water the population in the basin has reached 10 2 million most of which is concentrated in the highly urbanized northern area to reveal the magnitudes and their controls of ghg emissions we measured dissolved ghg concentrations in 95 river reaches in the chaohu lake basin to further compare the ghg emission differences among rivers we separated the river reaches into different types i e urban agricultural forested and mixed river reaches the distinctions were made according to the landscape compositions in the watersheds which drained into these sampled sites here the four types forested watersheds forests 50 agricultural watersheds cropland 60 urban watersheds urban 20 and mixed watersheds forest 50 cropland 60 and urban 20 were sorted and their mainstems were defined as corresponding riverine types zhang et al 2020 the cutoff percentages used to establish the river classification sought a compromise between accurate classification of river type and local landscape composition to better balance the collected data to ensure that each group had a similar number of datasets thus though our classification may not be precise it is adequate to test our hypothesis that urban rivers are hotspots of riverine ghg emission 2 2 sample collection and analysis samples were collected from 95 sites throughout the chaohu lake basin at bimonthly intervals between february 2018 and december 2018 so that six visits were made to each site and 570 samples were collected in total of the 95 sites 19 21 18 and 37 of them were collected from river reaches in urban agricultural forested and mixed watersheds respectively for each sampling visit water samples were collected at a depth of 20 cm below the water surface from bridges using a niskin bottle subsamples for n2o and ch4 analysis were then transferred into borosilicate serum bottles 135 ml several volumes were allowed to overflow and a 0 2 ml saturated zncl2 solution was added to stop microbial metabolism the sample bottles were sealed with a rubber septum with no headspace or bubble and stored underwater at 4 c during the transportation but kept at ambient temperature 12 h before analysis subsamples for co2 analysis were obtained using polypropylene syringes three 50 ml syringes were used to take 25 ml water samples with a mix of 25 ml air of known co2 concentration and gently shaken for 5 min to allow for equilibration under in situ conditions the headspace volume 25 ml was then transferred into a new gastight syringe and carefully preserved to avoid gas leakage more details about this can be found in dalsgaard et al 2000 and teodoru et al 2015 we also collected 600 ml of surface water at each sampling site using a polyethylene bucket to measure water quality concentrations including total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total phosphorus tp and the permanganate index of chemical oxygen demand cod gaseous samples for n2o and ch4 analysis were obtained from the headspace of a glass bottle 135 ml filled with 85 ml of water tightly capped and shaken vigorously for 5 min to reach gas equilibrium between the headspace and water phase the headspace was created using 50 ml ultra pure n2 following the headspace equilibration technique dalsgaard et al 2000 ten milliliters of the headspace gas as well as the co2 samples in the syringes were separately drawn out and injected into a gas chromatograph 7890 b agilent technologies santa clara california usa configured with electron capture ecd and flame ionization fid to obtain ghg concentration data the precolumn and analytical columns were 1 8 m and 3 6 m long steel columns packed with hayesep q 80 100 mesh a standard gas mixture of known n2o 2 07 ppm ch4 0 513 ppm and co2 409 ppm concentrations was adopted for calibration the detection limit of n2o ch4 and co2 is 0 014 ppm 0 011 ppm and 0 089 ppm respectively and the corresponding reproducibility of measurements was 2 8 5 8 and 5 1 respectively the in situ ghg concentrations in water were then calculated based on their corresponding solubility at laboratory temperature and pressure vs in situ temperature and pressure wanninkhof 1992 weiss and price 1980 for the laboratory determinations of the water quality indicators the 0 7 μm filtered water samples were used to analyze the dissolved forms of nutrients i e nh4 n no3 n and no2 n and the raw water samples were used for measuring tn tp and cod concentrations all of these water quality indicators were analyzed following standard protocols mep 2002 in situ physical and chemical indicators such as water temperature temp dissolved oxygen do specific conductance spc oxidation reduction potential orp chlorophyll a chl a fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom and turbidity were measured by a ysi 6000 multiprobe field meter riverine attributes such as width depth and mean flow rates at all sampling riverine reaches were obtained independently for each sampling visit by a boat mounted acoustic doppler current profiler adcp riversurveyor m9 sontex san diego ca usa 2 3 data calculations the percentage saturation of ghg in the water samples was calculated as 1 g h g s a t u r a t i o n c w c e q 100 where cw is the measured ghg concentration in water measured by the headspace equilibration method described in section 2 2 ceq is the corresponding equilibrium ghg concentration in river water that is in equilibrium with the ambient atmosphere at the in situ pressure and temperature the methods of obtaining ceq for n2o ch4 and co2 can be found in weiss and price 1980 wiesenburg and guinasso 1979 and weiss 1974 respectively the diffuse fluxes of ghg f μmol m 2 d 1 n2o mmol m 2 d 1 ch4 or mmol m 2 d 1 co2 at the interface of the river and the atmosphere were calculated as 2 f k c w c e q where k is the integrated gas transfer coefficient m s 1 for ghg that incorporates physical processes the coefficient k was calculated as clough et al 2007 3 k d u h 2 78 e 6 α u 10 2 s c 660 0 5 where d u h is the water current term which was calculated using the river water velocity u m s 1 average river depth h m and a diffusion coefficient for each gas in the water d m2 s 1 2 78 e 6 α u 10 2 s c 660 0 5 is a wind term 2 78 e 6 is a unit conversion factor cm h 1 to m s 1 α is a constant 0 31 and u 10 is the wind speed at a height of 10 m above the river s c is the schmidt number for the corresponding gas which can be obtained from wanninkhof 1992 river depth and water velocity data were derived from in situ measurements for each sampling visit as described in section 2 2 the diffusion coefficient for each of the gasses was derived from jähne et al 1987 the wind speed data u 10 was obtained from nearby weather stations which are available from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en in addition other methods such as those in raymond et al 2012 have been applied to obtain gas transfer coefficients k audet et al 2017 borges et al 2019 wang et al 2020 to evaluate the influences of different methods of k on the estimated fluxes we provide two datasets of ghg fluxes that were derived from the empirical models ray01 eq 1 in raymond et al 2012 and ray05 eq 5 in raymond et al 2012 ray01 predicts k as a function of the slope s unitless stream velocity u m s 1 and depth h m at sampling time while ray05 is only based on s and u raymond et al 2012 more details about the methods and estimated results can be found in the supplementary material 2 4 data analysis statistically significant differences in ghg saturation fluxes and water physical and chemical indicators among rivers were determined using the one way analysis of variance one way anova the pearson correlation was calculated first to determine the level of correlation between riverine physical and chemical parameters and ghg saturations a stepwise multiple linear regression was used to further explore the relative importance of riverine physical and chemical parameters in explaining the spatial temporal variability of ghg saturation the normality of the parameters was tested using the kolmogorov smirnov test if the data did not follow a normal distribution log transformed parameters were applied the adjusted r2 of the model was used to evaluate the explanatory power of the variable intervariable collinearity of the regression models was diagnosed by referring to the variance inflation factor vif a variable with a vif 5 was considered strong collinearity with other variables and was discarded all of these statistical tests were performed with spss version 19 0 ibm corp 2010 a statistical product and service solution software the spatial distributions of ghg concentration and fluxes were exhibited using the arcgis desktop software version 10 3 esri 2014 to identify the regions with the greatest diffusive ghg emissions we applied hotspot analysis using the hot spot analysis getis ord gi tool in gis the analysis is a screening tool focusing on the locations of abundant phenomena nelson and boots 2010 which is suitable for discerning cluster structures of high hotspot or low cold spot values this method has been intensively used in analyzing spatial patterns of environmental data jana and sar 2016 zhang et al 2019 more details of this method can be found in mitchell 2005 3 results 3 1 riverine physical and chemical characteristics the overall physical and chemical characteristics of the different rivers are presented in table 1 with mean values and their standard deviations sd riverine characteristics in urban rivers differed significantly from other rivers the differences mainly included higher tn tp spc fdom and chl a concentrations and lower ph and do contents on average tn and tp concentrations in the urban rivers reached 7 7 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively which is 3 times of those in non urban rivers nh4 n was one of the main n forms accounting for 40 of tn in urban rivers in contrast to its minor percentages in other rivers significant nutrient enrichment in urban rivers along with their relatively high spc cod fdom and chl a indicate that local urban rivers are polluted by intensive domestic and industrial sewage discharges in contrast concentrations of tn tp and other nutrient related indicators in non urban rivers were lower with most of the lowest concentrations recorded in less disturbed forested rivers the mean contents of tn and tp in forested rivers reached 1 72 mg l and 0 11 mg l do levels in forested rivers 9 7 mg l indicated aerobic environments concentrations of main indicators in the agricultural and mixed rivers often fell between those in urban and forested rivers with some exceptions for example cod was highest in agricultural rivers 3 2 variability of ghg concentrations riverine dissolved ghg n2o ch4 co2 concentrations for different rivers are presented in fig 2 all of their mean concentrations had strong spatial variabilities which spanned up to three orders of magnitude even so most of the dissolved concentrations 99 were far above the theoretical water atmosphere equilibrium values indicating significant oversaturation of ghg in the rivers studied here averaged concentrations of riverine ghg can be ranked as urban rivers mixed rivers agricultural rivers forested rivers ghg concentrations in urban rivers were among the highest with mean concentrations of 408 nmol l 1 5 5 μmol l 1 and 671 μmol l 1 for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively these values correspond to 4 1 9 7 9 1 17 6 and 1 4 2 9 times of those in non urban rivers one way anova further demonstrated that ghg contents in urban rivers were significantly larger than others the parallel analysis did not always determine significant differences between agricultural and mixed rivers but their ghg contents were higher than forested rivers fig 3 shows the spatial patterns of the gas concentrations illustrating the similarity between the gasses the relatively high dissolved concentrations were always observed in the rivers nearby or within urban regions while the low concentrations were mainly found in the southwestern rivers draining from forested dominant landscapes along rivers there were visible upstream to downstream patterns which may be related to the spatial heterogeneity of the landscapes for example the maps of the spatial distributions of ghg in highly urbanized regions show that along the same reaches e g the nanfei river as shown in fig 3 the ghg levels were relatively low in the upstream but as the rivers passed through urbanized regions ghg contents became high the coefficient of variation c v of ghg contents differed among the rivers a higher c v in urban rivers suggests stronger temporal variabilities of ghg production 3 3 influences of environmental factors to discern potential controls of ghg production we analyzed the correlations between each of the environmental variables and ghg saturation as shown in fig 4 it is evident that the physical and chemical indicators have different relationships with ghg saturation among rivers in the urban rivers fdom a proxy of dissolved organic matter in rivers was most significantly related to n2o saturation in the rivers with less n enrichment such as forested and mixed rivers n related indicators e g no3 n and tn became the main explanatory variables meanwhile in the forested rivers do was highly related to n2o saturation for ch4 the indicators tn nh4 n tp and cod were positively related to its saturation in urban rivers the parallel relationships were also determined in agricultural and mixed rivers but water temperature in these rivers was found to be more significantly related to ch4 in forested rivers no3 n was negatively related to ch4 saturation as for co2 both chl a and conductivity i e spc were positively related to its saturation across the different rivers many of other factors e g n related indicators that were correlated to co2 in urban rivers have not shown any relationship with co2 in agricultural and forested rivers suggesting the different mechanisms of riverine co2 production among rivers 3 4 diffusive ghgs emission fluxes the mean estimated diffusive n2o ch4 and co2 emission fluxes mean sd from chaohu lake basin rivers was 115 3 496 8 μmol m 2 d 1 2 3 8 3 mmol m 2 d 1 and 574 5 597 3 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively urban river reaches were found to have the highest n2o ch4 and co2 fluxes with a mean value of 471 2 1048 8 μmol m 2 d 1 7 1 17 2 mmol m 2 d 1 and 895 7 780 0 mmol m 2 d 1 equivalent to 14 seven and two times that of the non urban rivers respectively table 2 mixed rivers emitted the second highest gas fluxes except for ch4 which was only 50 of that in agricultural watersheds as expected forested rivers emitted the lowest ghg fluxes among the rivers however flux estimations using clough et al 2007 may be conservative especially compared with the methods from raymond et al 2012 see fig 1s the estimated fluxes for the rivers of the chaohu lake basin using ray01 and ray05 were 195 5 1847 0 and 206 0 951 3 μmol m 2 d 1 for n2o 2 1 7 9 and 3 9 13 3 mmol m 2 d 1 for ch4 and 584 5 1455 and 1007 4 919 1 mmol m 2 d 1 for co2 respectively using the global warming potential gwp factor for n2o of 265 co2 equivalent and ch4 of 28 co2 equivalent for a 100 year time horizon ipcc 2014 the mean ghg fluxes in the chaohu lake basin s river network was translated to the co2 equivalent flux of 27 6 g co2 m 2 d 1 co2 was the main contributor to the riverine gwp with n2o and ch4 contributing only 5 and 4 respectively to the 100 year gwp urban rivers had the largest co2 equivalent fluxes across the rivers about 1 8 3 4 times that of the other rivers the co2 equivalent fluxes in urban rivers using ray01 and ray05 were 53 and 85 g co2 m 2 d 1 which were 1 7 3 2 times and 2 0 2 9 times of those in the other rivers respectively as shown in fig 1s fig 5 shows the ghg fluxes for urban mixed agricultural and forested rivers the fluxes of all the gasses had clear spatial patterns with relatively low ghg fluxes in the upstream headwaters and high fluxes in the downstream along a river ghg fluxes tended to increase when the river passed through urbanized or agricultural regions that spatial pattern is most clearly exhibited in two contrasting rivers the hangbu river and the nanfei river which mainly drain agricultural and urban landscapes respectively along both of those rivers there were visible trends of increasing ghg fluxes along their upstream to downstream continuums but this pattern was more explicitly observed in the urban impacted nanfei river further hotspot analyses showed that 20 11 and 9 sites clustered in or adjacent to the urban region were identified as emission hotspots of n2o ch4 and co2 at the 90 confidence level respectively as shown in figs 5b 5d and 5f specifically two sites in agricultural rivers were also identified as co2 hotspots suggesting that agricultural rivers also may be prone to contribute significant co2 fluxes agricultural rivers also had co2 cold spots see fig 5f indicating a strong spatial heterogeneity across agricultural rivers as expected 7 out of 18 sites that sampled forested rivers were identified as co2 cold spots this agrees with established knowledge that forested rivers are normally subject to less co2 production parallel cold spots for n2o and ch4 were not determined for forested rivers or other types of rivers which also agrees well with previous findings that forested rivers could be important sources for regional n2o and ch4 emissions audet et al 2020 melack et al 2004 the parallel estimations using ray01 and ray05 had similar spatial patterns of ghg hotspots see figs 2s and 3s therefore all of the methods support the assertion that urban rivers are the ghg hotspots although their magnitudes of the estimated fluxes were different 4 discussion 4 1 the roles of riverine physical and chemical factors mean n2o ch4 and co2 saturations in the river networks of the chaohu lake basin reached 1000 60 000 and 2900 respectively such high riverine ghg saturations may be highly associated with biogenic processes including incomplete denitrification quick et al 2019 methanogenesis cotovicz et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 and respiration humborge et al 2010 sobek et al 2005 any factors that are direct or indirectly involved in these processes could be their potential proximate controls as expected many riverine factors including availability of carbon as represented by fdom and cod and nitrogen e g no3 n nh4 n do temperature spc and ph have relationships with ghg saturations see fig 4 among them nutrient related indicators e g tn no3 n nh4 n fdom and cod were most significantly correlated suggesting the importance of nutrient supply in promoting ghg production laini et al 2011 turner et al 2016 the findings match those observations in other aquatic ecosystems including inland rivers borges et al 2015b raymond et al 2013 lakes cunada et al 2018 davidson et al 2015 and coastal bays cotovicz et al 2016 do is another important factor related to gas production as the associated functional microorganisms are usually facultative aerobes or obligate anaerobes marescaux et al 2018 quick et al 2019 thus it is not surprising to observe that n2o and ch4 saturations were negatively correlated to do in oxic forested rivers fig 4 in general n2o production was usually favored under suboxic conditions a suitable environment for coupled nitrification denitrification ji et al 2015 wrage et al 2001 which allows denitrifiers to obtain no3 n through aerobic nitrification leading to n2o production quick et al 2019 in the urban rivers studied here mean do level reached 6 4 mg l which can be characterized as suboxic conditions thus the optimal do condition for n2o production could be obtained quick et al 2019 and small variations of do as indicated by its low sd in table 1 can hardly become an important control unlike that of n2o ch4 production usually prefers anaerobic conditions stanley et al 2016 therefore the two gasses can react differently to do variations in some settings e g in urban rivers see fig 4 if we now turn to co2 saturation we find that spc is an important influential factor high spc usually indicates a river water s greater ability to conduct electrical current which may imply a more suitable condition for the rapid decomposition of organic matter for microbial production quick et al 2019 high spc may also indicate more contributions of water and dissolved gasses from groundwater recharge or wastewater as their conductivity could be higher the most surprising aspect of the data is in the positive relationships between co2 saturation and chl a which is contrary to established knowledge that primary producers represented by chl a usually deplete riverine co2 to build biomass davidson et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 it should be documented that chl a was measured by a ysi multiprobe field meter which can be influenced by light and some substances that have similar fluorescent properties with those of chl a thus in the spatial dimension high chl a may indicate high presences of algae and bioavailable substances that may favor co2 production our data showed that ghg levels are also related to water temperature with exceptions of n2o and ch4 in urban rivers the results challenge the established empirical evidence for temperature dependence on riverine microbial production davidson et al 2015 these results are perhaps not surprising as thermal influence does not act in isolation in any ecosystem and can be concealed by more important factors when these factors also correlate with water temperature stanley et al 2016 for example borges et al 2015 analyzed 12 different basins across a whole continent of africa and found that connectivity with wetland landscapes was a more important factor than temperature in tropical regions in our study it is clear that n related indicators were usually negatively related to water temperature see fig 4 and thus the variability in nutrient supply may have overwhelmed temperature controls on microbial metabolisms with the net result that the ghg saturations missed the linkage with water temperature to better discern differentiated controls of ghg saturation among rivers we performed a stepwise regression analysis as shown in fig 6 the considerable differences in the explanatory power of the stepwise regressions and associated predictors reflect multiple controls on the production of ghg among rivers for n2o around 37 57 of the spatial and temporal variabilities can be explained by variables including fdom no3 n cod do and temperature this demonstrated that n2o production is mainly sensitive to nutrient supply and do he et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 wang et al 2015 however controls of n2o saturations differed among rivers for example in the n enriched urban rivers n2o production could be limited by unmatched supplies of electron donors e g organic carbon with respect to that of n see table 1 this was supported by the highest explanatory power of the proxy of the carbon sources i e fdom in explaining the variations of n2o saturation in the less n enriched mixed and agricultural rivers however n2o saturation is most significantly explained by no3 n and in the forested rivers do become the most significant limiting factor suggesting that do is the primary control of n2o production in oxygen saturated environments venkiteswaran et al 2014 in comparison to n2o fewer variations in ch4 saturation 20 44 can be explained by the physical and chemical indicators the fuel for respiration i e organic matter was the main control of ch4 production throughout the rivers as indicated by the highest explanatory power of its proxy variables e g cod and fdom for both urban and non urban rivers in the non urban rivers n related indicators were interpreted as primary predictors of ch4 saturation e g in mixed and agricultural rivers this relation can be explained given that n contents in the water column could be indicative of the availability of decomposable organic matter in rivers which were influenced by intensive agricultural production and other land use activities renwick et al 2018 in the forested rivers do explains the largest variations in ch4 underscoring that lotic methanogenesis is anaerobic stanley et al 2016 the overall explanatory power of multiple linear regressions of co2 saturation showed that the highest and lowest r2 were reported in the urban and forested rivers respectively among all the rivers co2 saturation is primarily explained by water temperature and conductivity the temperature dependence of co2 efflux across rivers is expected as carbon dioxide co2 is the major end product of temperature dependent respiration stanley et al 2016 but there is an exception in forested rivers where chl a was interpreted as the main control this may be due to the strong collinear between chl a and temperature see fig 4 and chl a s better explanatory power nh4 n also was included as a variable of co2 prediction rather than considering this substance as an influential factor nh4 n may be another byproduct of organic matter mineralization which theoretically can be collinear with co2 thus the main mechanism behind co2 production across rivers is temperature dependent with a suitable environment that allows the rapid decomposition of organic matter 4 2 urban river are hotspots of diffusive ghg emissions differing results observed among rivers from the chaohu lake basin highlight the significance of ghg emissions from urban rivers the mean estimated n2o ch4 and co2 fluxes from the urban rivers reached 471 μmol m 2 d 1 7 1 mmol m 2 d 1 and 895 7 mmol m 2 d 1 which are nearly 14 seven and two times of those from the non urban rivers respectively significantly higher ghg fluxes from urban rivers have also been previously documented hu et al 2018 compared ghg fluxes from the haihe river basin of china and concluded that the n2o ch4 and co2 fluxes in sewage draining urban rivers were almost 1 1 3 1 3 1 10 9 and 1 2 2 4 times those of other rivers wang et al 2018 and he et al 2017 found that river networks within the highly urbanized regions commonly emitted the largest areal ghg emissions with values of 590 μmol m 2 d 1 3 6 mmol m 2 d 1 and 873 mmol m 2 d 1 for riverine n2o ch4 and co2 fluxes corresponding to 13 12 and 6 times of those reported in less urbanized rivers respectively similarly cotovicz et al 2016 found that ch4 fluxes in the urban impacted coastal bay in brazil can reach 4 8 mmol m 2 d 1 a value of 12 times higher than a nearby forested bay the compiled datasets as shown in table 1s further showed that mean ghg fluxes reported in worldwide urban rivers were generally 600 μmol m 2 d 1 for n2o 6 mmol m 2 d 1 for ch4 and 900 mmol m 2 d 1 for co2 respectively though wide ranges of variation were also presented see table 1s for details evidently our estimations were quite close to these upper limits indicating comparably higher ghg emissions from the urban rivers here this may be attributable to high population density locally and low sewage treatment rates huang et al 2018 which could consistently result in high ghg emissions considering the landscapes that river drained it is clear that the fluxes of each gas at each watershed were significantly related to the percentage of urban area included see fig 7 however the parallel analysis using a percentage of agricultural land as an independent variable failed to show similar relationships p 0 05 this information along with the ghg hotspots that were frequently identified in urban sampled sites implies that urban rivers are likely ghg emission hotspots several factors lead to significantly high ghg in urban rivers urban rivers usually receive substantial nutrients inputs from various sources which can provide desirable environmental conditions for in stream ghg production it has been well documented that most of the processes that favor ghg production such as nitrification denitrification and methanogenesis usually prefer a low do environment cotovicz et al 2016 quick et al 2019 enhanced aerobic metabolism of organic matter which is available due to insufficient sewage treatment and direct domestic discharges may rapidly deplete do in the water column creating suboxic environments that are suitable for biogenic production low do could also be enhanced by damming urban rivers which would reduce the influx of do from the atmosphere due to the attenuated flow rates see table 1 in addition to suitable do adequate supplies of nutrients in urban rivers also motivate microbial metabolisms as well as mitigate their resource competitions schade et al 2016 documented significant resource competition between denitrifiers and methanogens in headwater streams but this is unlikely to occur in nutrient enriched urban rivers evidence for that can be found in significantly positive relationships between n2o and ch4 saturation in urban rivers see fig 4 the considerable presence of some specific substances in urban rivers can prevent the rapid depletion of dissolved ghg hydrogen sulfide h2s one of these substances has been documented as an important inhibitor of critical enzyme activity such as nitrous oxide reductase and some organisms involved in converting ghg dalsgaard et al 2014 quick et al 2019 in aggregate high availability of nutrients and desirable do levels favor ghg production while some substances inhibit their subsequent depletion in the water column urban rivers may also receive external ghg fluxes from sewage direct measurements of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent showed that the concentrations for n2o and ch4 typically lay within 1200 3300 nmol l 1 beaulieu et al 2010 and 0 01 1 06 μmol l 1 wang et al 2011 respectively which is generally higher than the direct measurements in rivers see fig 2 similarly co2 concentrations in the final effluent of wwtps can reach 30 mmol l 1 caniani et al 2019 this suggests that once passed into rivers wwtp effluent may become an important source of riverine ghg moreover there are also considerable untreated sewage discharges in this basin province 2017 which may further increase riverine ghg enrichment consequently the river segments in which significant sewage is discharged are more likely to become ghg emission hotspots additional factors include urban heat island effects and warm sewages discharged from households and industries the mean in situ water temperature of all sampling campaigns for urban rivers was 19 5 c which was roughly 1 0 2 0 c higher than other rivers in the chaohu lake basin thus associated organisms and microorganisms could utilize such favorable thermal advantages and produce more ghg 4 3 implications of this study the global warming potential in the urban rivers rose to 48 g co2 m 2 d 1 which was about 1 8 3 4 times of that in the non urban rivers upon further inspection in each sampling campaign we conclude that on average urban rivers always have the highest global warming potential among rivers p 0 05 this underscores that the current ipcc budget accounting of ghg emissions without differentiation between the river types may result in poorly constrained estimates ipcc 2019 we encourage regional and global scale ghg budget estimates to consider urban rivers more specifically given that ghg emissions from urban rivers were higher than from other rivers and that urban land cover and populations will continue to expand in the future foley et al 2005 however the true level of ghg emissions could be even higher because we only considered diffusive fluxes while other pathways such as the ebullitive emission via bubbles and plant mediated transport via the passages in vascular plants were not included stanley et al 2016 for example according to baulch et al 2011 ebullition was an important pathway of ch4 emissions contributing 20 67 of the total fluxes moreover ghg emissions via ebullition can also be promoted by damming maeck et al 2013 ran et al 2017 which is observed in the highly managed chaohu lake basin to comprehensively estimate ghg emissions therefore future work should carefully include more in situ measurement of ghg emissions on rivers and include all emission pathways our estimations have uncertainties one of the largest uncertainties is derived from our low sampling frequency the monte carlo analysis as shown in the supplementary material has suggested that finer sampling frequencies can lead to 0 3 5 8 differences in the estimated ghg fluxes as shown in table 2s but the differences could be greater for some specific rivers see the supplementary material for details this points to a need for more field measurements with wider spatial coverage and finer frequency to achieve more credible estimations another uncertainty is associated with the calculation of k as there are various methods see details in raymond et al 2012 here we adopted equations as proposed by clough et al 2007 to calculate k this method considers the influence of wind and water currents requiring variables such as in situ temperature flow rate wind speed and riverine width we obtained all of these data under in situ conditions to ensure the accurate estimation of k and the subsequent robust estimation of ghg fluxes however in comparison with other equations such as ray01 and ray05 we found that our estimated fluxes were generally close to those using ray01 see the supplementary material while ray01 was more suitable for low order rivers audet et al 2017 which were not precisely applicable in our case as our monitored rivers were relatively large in this sense our choice of the empirical model from clough et al 2007 may downplay by 50 of the gwp if we compared with the ray05 estimates see the supplementary material to assess the accuracy of different calculations of k and to obtain more credible estimates therefore local measurements of k in the hydro system of the chaohu lake basin are recommended 5 conclusions the main goal of the study was to examine whether urban rivers behave as regional hotspots of diffusive greenhouse gas n2o ch4 co2 emissions in this study we investigated the spatial variability of ghg emissions from different rivers in the mixed landscape chaohu lake basin our results demonstrated that urban rivers were the emission hotspots for all greenhouse gasses the mean areal fluxes reached 471 2 1048 8 μmol m 2 d 1 7 1 17 2 mmol m 2 d 1 and 895 7 780 0 mmol m 2 d 1 which were 14 seven and two times those from non urban rivers respectively on a co2 equivalent basis the global warming potential in the urban rivers can rise to 48 g co2 m 2 d 1 which was about 1 8 3 4 times of that in the non urban rivers further stepwise regression revealed why ghg emissions vary significantly across rivers we concluded that the suboxic conditions with adequate nutrient supply in the water column of urban rivers were the common reasons for higher n2o and ch4 emissions which were in contrast with the aerobic conditions with limited nutrient supply present in the non urban rivers the main controls for co2 were similar among rivers which were strongly related to water temperature and conductivity the urban rivers may have emitted more co2 largely because of the high availability of organic matter and physical and chemical conditions that allow rapid decomposition in them overall our studies highlighted the significance

17363,growing evidence shows that riverine networks surrounding urban landscapes may be hotspots of riverine greenhouse gas ghg emissions this study strengthens the evidence by investigating the spatial variability of diffusive ghg n2o ch4 co2 emissions from river reaches that drain from different types of landscapes i e urban agricultural mixed and forest landscapes in the chaohu lake basin of eastern china our results showed that almost all the rivers were oversaturated with dissolved ghgs urban rivers were identified as emission hotspots with mean fluxes of 470 μmol m 2 d 1 for n2o 7 mmol m 2 d 1 for ch4 and 900 mmol m 2 d 1 for co2 corresponding to 14 seven and two times of those from the non urban rivers in the chaohu lake basin respectively factors related to the high n2o and ch4 emissions in urban rivers included large nutrient supply and hypoxic environments the factors affecting co2 were similar in all the rivers which were temperature dependent with suitable environments that allowed rapid decomposition of organic matter overall this study highlights that better recognition of the influence that river networks have on global warming is required particularly when it comes to urban rivers as urban land cover and populations will continue to expand in the future management measures should incorporate regional hotspots to more efficiently mitigate ghg emissions graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords watershed chaohu lake basin carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide urban 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 are well known greenhouse gasses ghg raymond et al 2013 reay et al 2012 recent monitoring by the world meteorological organization showed that their concentrations in the global atmosphere have reached 331 1 0 1 parts per billion ppb 1869 2 ppb and 408 0 0 1 parts per million ppm steadily increasing by 123 259 and 147 since the mid 18th century respectively wmo 2019 such high atmospheric ghg enrichment has resulted in a number of issues including global warming and associated ecological damages convey and peck 2019 an intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report showed that global warming is likely to reach 1 5 c in the next 10 30 years as ghg are continuously added to the atmosphere which undoubtedly increases climate related risks for natural and human systems ipcc 2018 ghg emissions from various ecosystems have thus become one of the key issues in ecology and global change research raymond et al 2013 yvon durocher et al 2014 direct ghg production from terrestrial ecosystems as a result of intensified human activities has been well documented and thus has become a relatively well constrained component of the global ghg budget quick et al 2019 in contrast ghg emissions from river networks have received less attention and are consequently less constrained although studies have increasingly demonstrated that rivers play an important role in global ghg budgets that is disproportional to their areal extent borges et al 2015b cole et al 2007 therefore including more measurements of in stream ghg emissions is essential to close knowledge gaps in both global and regional ghg assessment efforts as well as to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms behind riverine ghg production forested urban and agricultural rivers that drain different watershed landscapes result in different riverine dissolved ghg concentrations and fluxes borges et al 2018 mwanake et al 2019 of these forested rivers were most frequently found to have low ghg emissions per unit area for example borges et al 2018 showed that forested rivers are important n2o sources although their areal emissions were generally lower than agricultural rivers they can also behave as n2o sinks as exhibited in some tropical forested rivers where do levels were low and microbial conversion of n2o to n2 was strong particularly when they are connected to wetlands borges et al 2019 audet et al 2020 also observed source sink dynamics of n2o emissions in forested streams from sweden for ch4 and co2 forested rivers are usually found to be significant atmospheric sources as observed in the amazon river amaral et al 2018 melack et al 2004 and congo river borges et al 2015a such differences among ghg types and across regions underscores the complexity of ghg emissions from forested rivers implying the necessity of more regional specific ghg measurements in contrast to emissions from forested rivers ghg emissions from agricultural rivers have received more attention ranging from low order headwater streams outram and hiscock 2012 schade et al 2016 wilcock and sorrell 2008 to high order rivers turner et al 2015 xia et al 2013 these studies consistently documented the significance of ghg emissions from agricultural streams and rivers largely due to high inputs from surface runoff and groundwater recharge as well as strong in stream ghg production laini et al 2011 qin et al 2020 xia et al 2013 the main controls are dependent on riverine physical and chemical conditions including carbon and nitrogen n availability temperature dissolved oxygen do and ph quick et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 a growing number of studies focusing on agricultural rivers have improved the methods for regional and global scale ghg budget accounting tian et al 2019 wallin et al 2014 while also drawing more attention to refined agricultural practices designed to better mitigate ghg emissions mwanake et al 2019 peterson et al 2001 urban impacted river networks however receive less attention though they are fed by treated and untreated sewage and their ghg emissions are sometimes substantial existing studies on urban rivers were mainly focused on their spatial and temporal patterns of ghg emissions the influences of sewage discharge and damming e g jin et al 2018 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for example several studies documented that the highest ghg n2o ch4 co2 emissions were often observed in rivers surrounded by highly urbanized regions e g he et al 2017 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and yu et al 2013 their areal ghg emissions can be several to tens of times those reported in nearby less urbanized rivers similarly a parallel analysis of the sewage draining river sections also indicated that their ghg emissions were up to 10 times higher than the river sections without sewage discharge hu et al 2018 other studies discerned that damming on urban rivers had an amplifying effect on ghg emissions jin et al 2018 yang et al 2020 overall ghg emissions from urban rivers are higher than those of forested rivers in many circumstances urban river emissions appear to be even higher than those of zero order agricultural streams which are widely accepted as ghg emission hotspots liu et al 2019 smith et al 2017 these studies consistently support a growing awareness that urban impacted rivers are likely greenhouse gas emission hotspots however surface water emissions of co2 ch4 and n2o have rarely been determined basin wide in river systems that drain different watershed landscapes the compiled data from different rivers across the world as shown in table 1s suggested that ghg fluxes from some agricultural and forested rivers were even higher than most of the urban rivers showing that the roles of the specific river types in contributing ghg fluxes are unclear this points to the need for more careful investigations on ghg emissions from different rivers moreover current bottom up ghg budget accountings mainly emphasize agricultural and forested rivers e g audet et al 2020 iurii et al 2014 melack et al 2004 reay et al 2012 and tian et al 2019 with poor considerations of urban rivers although urban rivers could contribute even higher ghg emissions this further underscores the necessity of more reasonable specifications on ghg emissions from urban rivers in the future as urban land and population continue to expand the associated contributions of ghg to climate forcing will undoubtedly increase thus quantification of the magnitudes and controls of ghg fluxes from urban rivers is critical to comprehensively understand global climate change processes and formulate ghg mitigation strategies for sustainable development this study determined whether urban rivers behave as regional hotspots of diffusive greenhouse gas n2o ch4 co2 emissions as compared to other river types here the urban rivers drain watersheds with 20 of the urban area we measured riverine dissolved n2o ch4 and co2 concentrations in 95 different river reaches in the mixed landscape chaohu lake basin of eastern china 19 of the reaches represented urban rivers the remaining 21 18 and 37 reaches were agricultural forested and mixed river reaches all ghg data were obtained following the same sampling storage and measurement protocols which allowed us to focus on the differences in ghg emissions between the rivers in a comparable way in addition to addressing the overall scientific question this study also aimed at answering the following specific questions 1 what are the magnitudes and patterns of ghg concentrations in river networks in a mixed landscape basin 2 what riverine physical and chemical conditions are influencing riverine ghg saturation 3 what are the controls of the spatial variabilities of ghg emissions among rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampled riverine types chaohu lake is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china fig 1 with a surface area of 780 km2 and a basin area of 13 500 km2 it lies on the north shore of the lower reaches of the yangtze river and is adjacent to the highly developed and densely populated yangtze river delta the lake is mainly fed by 33 rivers but only a few e g the nanfei and hangbu rivers contribute most of the water the population in the basin has reached 10 2 million most of which is concentrated in the highly urbanized northern area to reveal the magnitudes and their controls of ghg emissions we measured dissolved ghg concentrations in 95 river reaches in the chaohu lake basin to further compare the ghg emission differences among rivers we separated the river reaches into different types i e urban agricultural forested and mixed river reaches the distinctions were made according to the landscape compositions in the watersheds which drained into these sampled sites here the four types forested watersheds forests 50 agricultural watersheds cropland 60 urban watersheds urban 20 and mixed watersheds forest 50 cropland 60 and urban 20 were sorted and their mainstems were defined as corresponding riverine types zhang et al 2020 the cutoff percentages used to establish the river classification sought a compromise between accurate classification of river type and local landscape composition to better balance the collected data to ensure that each group had a similar number of datasets thus though our classification may not be precise it is adequate to test our hypothesis that urban rivers are hotspots of riverine ghg emission 2 2 sample collection and analysis samples were collected from 95 sites throughout the chaohu lake basin at bimonthly intervals between february 2018 and december 2018 so that six visits were made to each site and 570 samples were collected in total of the 95 sites 19 21 18 and 37 of them were collected from river reaches in urban agricultural forested and mixed watersheds respectively for each sampling visit water samples were collected at a depth of 20 cm below the water surface from bridges using a niskin bottle subsamples for n2o and ch4 analysis were then transferred into borosilicate serum bottles 135 ml several volumes were allowed to overflow and a 0 2 ml saturated zncl2 solution was added to stop microbial metabolism the sample bottles were sealed with a rubber septum with no headspace or bubble and stored underwater at 4 c during the transportation but kept at ambient temperature 12 h before analysis subsamples for co2 analysis were obtained using polypropylene syringes three 50 ml syringes were used to take 25 ml water samples with a mix of 25 ml air of known co2 concentration and gently shaken for 5 min to allow for equilibration under in situ conditions the headspace volume 25 ml was then transferred into a new gastight syringe and carefully preserved to avoid gas leakage more details about this can be found in dalsgaard et al 2000 and teodoru et al 2015 we also collected 600 ml of surface water at each sampling site using a polyethylene bucket to measure water quality concentrations including total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total phosphorus tp and the permanganate index of chemical oxygen demand cod gaseous samples for n2o and ch4 analysis were obtained from the headspace of a glass bottle 135 ml filled with 85 ml of water tightly capped and shaken vigorously for 5 min to reach gas equilibrium between the headspace and water phase the headspace was created using 50 ml ultra pure n2 following the headspace equilibration technique dalsgaard et al 2000 ten milliliters of the headspace gas as well as the co2 samples in the syringes were separately drawn out and injected into a gas chromatograph 7890 b agilent technologies santa clara california usa configured with electron capture ecd and flame ionization fid to obtain ghg concentration data the precolumn and analytical columns were 1 8 m and 3 6 m long steel columns packed with hayesep q 80 100 mesh a standard gas mixture of known n2o 2 07 ppm ch4 0 513 ppm and co2 409 ppm concentrations was adopted for calibration the detection limit of n2o ch4 and co2 is 0 014 ppm 0 011 ppm and 0 089 ppm respectively and the corresponding reproducibility of measurements was 2 8 5 8 and 5 1 respectively the in situ ghg concentrations in water were then calculated based on their corresponding solubility at laboratory temperature and pressure vs in situ temperature and pressure wanninkhof 1992 weiss and price 1980 for the laboratory determinations of the water quality indicators the 0 7 μm filtered water samples were used to analyze the dissolved forms of nutrients i e nh4 n no3 n and no2 n and the raw water samples were used for measuring tn tp and cod concentrations all of these water quality indicators were analyzed following standard protocols mep 2002 in situ physical and chemical indicators such as water temperature temp dissolved oxygen do specific conductance spc oxidation reduction potential orp chlorophyll a chl a fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom and turbidity were measured by a ysi 6000 multiprobe field meter riverine attributes such as width depth and mean flow rates at all sampling riverine reaches were obtained independently for each sampling visit by a boat mounted acoustic doppler current profiler adcp riversurveyor m9 sontex san diego ca usa 2 3 data calculations the percentage saturation of ghg in the water samples was calculated as 1 g h g s a t u r a t i o n c w c e q 100 where cw is the measured ghg concentration in water measured by the headspace equilibration method described in section 2 2 ceq is the corresponding equilibrium ghg concentration in river water that is in equilibrium with the ambient atmosphere at the in situ pressure and temperature the methods of obtaining ceq for n2o ch4 and co2 can be found in weiss and price 1980 wiesenburg and guinasso 1979 and weiss 1974 respectively the diffuse fluxes of ghg f μmol m 2 d 1 n2o mmol m 2 d 1 ch4 or mmol m 2 d 1 co2 at the interface of the river and the atmosphere were calculated as 2 f k c w c e q where k is the integrated gas transfer coefficient m s 1 for ghg that incorporates physical processes the coefficient k was calculated as clough et al 2007 3 k d u h 2 78 e 6 α u 10 2 s c 660 0 5 where d u h is the water current term which was calculated using the river water velocity u m s 1 average river depth h m and a diffusion coefficient for each gas in the water d m2 s 1 2 78 e 6 α u 10 2 s c 660 0 5 is a wind term 2 78 e 6 is a unit conversion factor cm h 1 to m s 1 α is a constant 0 31 and u 10 is the wind speed at a height of 10 m above the river s c is the schmidt number for the corresponding gas which can be obtained from wanninkhof 1992 river depth and water velocity data were derived from in situ measurements for each sampling visit as described in section 2 2 the diffusion coefficient for each of the gasses was derived from jähne et al 1987 the wind speed data u 10 was obtained from nearby weather stations which are available from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en in addition other methods such as those in raymond et al 2012 have been applied to obtain gas transfer coefficients k audet et al 2017 borges et al 2019 wang et al 2020 to evaluate the influences of different methods of k on the estimated fluxes we provide two datasets of ghg fluxes that were derived from the empirical models ray01 eq 1 in raymond et al 2012 and ray05 eq 5 in raymond et al 2012 ray01 predicts k as a function of the slope s unitless stream velocity u m s 1 and depth h m at sampling time while ray05 is only based on s and u raymond et al 2012 more details about the methods and estimated results can be found in the supplementary material 2 4 data analysis statistically significant differences in ghg saturation fluxes and water physical and chemical indicators among rivers were determined using the one way analysis of variance one way anova the pearson correlation was calculated first to determine the level of correlation between riverine physical and chemical parameters and ghg saturations a stepwise multiple linear regression was used to further explore the relative importance of riverine physical and chemical parameters in explaining the spatial temporal variability of ghg saturation the normality of the parameters was tested using the kolmogorov smirnov test if the data did not follow a normal distribution log transformed parameters were applied the adjusted r2 of the model was used to evaluate the explanatory power of the variable intervariable collinearity of the regression models was diagnosed by referring to the variance inflation factor vif a variable with a vif 5 was considered strong collinearity with other variables and was discarded all of these statistical tests were performed with spss version 19 0 ibm corp 2010 a statistical product and service solution software the spatial distributions of ghg concentration and fluxes were exhibited using the arcgis desktop software version 10 3 esri 2014 to identify the regions with the greatest diffusive ghg emissions we applied hotspot analysis using the hot spot analysis getis ord gi tool in gis the analysis is a screening tool focusing on the locations of abundant phenomena nelson and boots 2010 which is suitable for discerning cluster structures of high hotspot or low cold spot values this method has been intensively used in analyzing spatial patterns of environmental data jana and sar 2016 zhang et al 2019 more details of this method can be found in mitchell 2005 3 results 3 1 riverine physical and chemical characteristics the overall physical and chemical characteristics of the different rivers are presented in table 1 with mean values and their standard deviations sd riverine characteristics in urban rivers differed significantly from other rivers the differences mainly included higher tn tp spc fdom and chl a concentrations and lower ph and do contents on average tn and tp concentrations in the urban rivers reached 7 7 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively which is 3 times of those in non urban rivers nh4 n was one of the main n forms accounting for 40 of tn in urban rivers in contrast to its minor percentages in other rivers significant nutrient enrichment in urban rivers along with their relatively high spc cod fdom and chl a indicate that local urban rivers are polluted by intensive domestic and industrial sewage discharges in contrast concentrations of tn tp and other nutrient related indicators in non urban rivers were lower with most of the lowest concentrations recorded in less disturbed forested rivers the mean contents of tn and tp in forested rivers reached 1 72 mg l and 0 11 mg l do levels in forested rivers 9 7 mg l indicated aerobic environments concentrations of main indicators in the agricultural and mixed rivers often fell between those in urban and forested rivers with some exceptions for example cod was highest in agricultural rivers 3 2 variability of ghg concentrations riverine dissolved ghg n2o ch4 co2 concentrations for different rivers are presented in fig 2 all of their mean concentrations had strong spatial variabilities which spanned up to three orders of magnitude even so most of the dissolved concentrations 99 were far above the theoretical water atmosphere equilibrium values indicating significant oversaturation of ghg in the rivers studied here averaged concentrations of riverine ghg can be ranked as urban rivers mixed rivers agricultural rivers forested rivers ghg concentrations in urban rivers were among the highest with mean concentrations of 408 nmol l 1 5 5 μmol l 1 and 671 μmol l 1 for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively these values correspond to 4 1 9 7 9 1 17 6 and 1 4 2 9 times of those in non urban rivers one way anova further demonstrated that ghg contents in urban rivers were significantly larger than others the parallel analysis did not always determine significant differences between agricultural and mixed rivers but their ghg contents were higher than forested rivers fig 3 shows the spatial patterns of the gas concentrations illustrating the similarity between the gasses the relatively high dissolved concentrations were always observed in the rivers nearby or within urban regions while the low concentrations were mainly found in the southwestern rivers draining from forested dominant landscapes along rivers there were visible upstream to downstream patterns which may be related to the spatial heterogeneity of the landscapes for example the maps of the spatial distributions of ghg in highly urbanized regions show that along the same reaches e g the nanfei river as shown in fig 3 the ghg levels were relatively low in the upstream but as the rivers passed through urbanized regions ghg contents became high the coefficient of variation c v of ghg contents differed among the rivers a higher c v in urban rivers suggests stronger temporal variabilities of ghg production 3 3 influences of environmental factors to discern potential controls of ghg production we analyzed the correlations between each of the environmental variables and ghg saturation as shown in fig 4 it is evident that the physical and chemical indicators have different relationships with ghg saturation among rivers in the urban rivers fdom a proxy of dissolved organic matter in rivers was most significantly related to n2o saturation in the rivers with less n enrichment such as forested and mixed rivers n related indicators e g no3 n and tn became the main explanatory variables meanwhile in the forested rivers do was highly related to n2o saturation for ch4 the indicators tn nh4 n tp and cod were positively related to its saturation in urban rivers the parallel relationships were also determined in agricultural and mixed rivers but water temperature in these rivers was found to be more significantly related to ch4 in forested rivers no3 n was negatively related to ch4 saturation as for co2 both chl a and conductivity i e spc were positively related to its saturation across the different rivers many of other factors e g n related indicators that were correlated to co2 in urban rivers have not shown any relationship with co2 in agricultural and forested rivers suggesting the different mechanisms of riverine co2 production among rivers 3 4 diffusive ghgs emission fluxes the mean estimated diffusive n2o ch4 and co2 emission fluxes mean sd from chaohu lake basin rivers was 115 3 496 8 μmol m 2 d 1 2 3 8 3 mmol m 2 d 1 and 574 5 597 3 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively urban river reaches were found to have the highest n2o ch4 and co2 fluxes with a mean value of 471 2 1048 8 μmol m 2 d 1 7 1 17 2 mmol m 2 d 1 and 895 7 780 0 mmol m 2 d 1 equivalent to 14 seven and two times that of the non urban rivers respectively table 2 mixed rivers emitted the second highest gas fluxes except for ch4 which was only 50 of that in agricultural watersheds as expected forested rivers emitted the lowest ghg fluxes among the rivers however flux estimations using clough et al 2007 may be conservative especially compared with the methods from raymond et al 2012 see fig 1s the estimated fluxes for the rivers of the chaohu lake basin using ray01 and ray05 were 195 5 1847 0 and 206 0 951 3 μmol m 2 d 1 for n2o 2 1 7 9 and 3 9 13 3 mmol m 2 d 1 for ch4 and 584 5 1455 and 1007 4 919 1 mmol m 2 d 1 for co2 respectively using the global warming potential gwp factor for n2o of 265 co2 equivalent and ch4 of 28 co2 equivalent for a 100 year time horizon ipcc 2014 the mean ghg fluxes in the chaohu lake basin s river network was translated to the co2 equivalent flux of 27 6 g co2 m 2 d 1 co2 was the main contributor to the riverine gwp with n2o and ch4 contributing only 5 and 4 respectively to the 100 year gwp urban rivers had the largest co2 equivalent fluxes across the rivers about 1 8 3 4 times that of the other rivers the co2 equivalent fluxes in urban rivers using ray01 and ray05 were 53 and 85 g co2 m 2 d 1 which were 1 7 3 2 times and 2 0 2 9 times of those in the other rivers respectively as shown in fig 1s fig 5 shows the ghg fluxes for urban mixed agricultural and forested rivers the fluxes of all the gasses had clear spatial patterns with relatively low ghg fluxes in the upstream headwaters and high fluxes in the downstream along a river ghg fluxes tended to increase when the river passed through urbanized or agricultural regions that spatial pattern is most clearly exhibited in two contrasting rivers the hangbu river and the nanfei river which mainly drain agricultural and urban landscapes respectively along both of those rivers there were visible trends of increasing ghg fluxes along their upstream to downstream continuums but this pattern was more explicitly observed in the urban impacted nanfei river further hotspot analyses showed that 20 11 and 9 sites clustered in or adjacent to the urban region were identified as emission hotspots of n2o ch4 and co2 at the 90 confidence level respectively as shown in figs 5b 5d and 5f specifically two sites in agricultural rivers were also identified as co2 hotspots suggesting that agricultural rivers also may be prone to contribute significant co2 fluxes agricultural rivers also had co2 cold spots see fig 5f indicating a strong spatial heterogeneity across agricultural rivers as expected 7 out of 18 sites that sampled forested rivers were identified as co2 cold spots this agrees with established knowledge that forested rivers are normally subject to less co2 production parallel cold spots for n2o and ch4 were not determined for forested rivers or other types of rivers which also agrees well with previous findings that forested rivers could be important sources for regional n2o and ch4 emissions audet et al 2020 melack et al 2004 the parallel estimations using ray01 and ray05 had similar spatial patterns of ghg hotspots see figs 2s and 3s therefore all of the methods support the assertion that urban rivers are the ghg hotspots although their magnitudes of the estimated fluxes were different 4 discussion 4 1 the roles of riverine physical and chemical factors mean n2o ch4 and co2 saturations in the river networks of the chaohu lake basin reached 1000 60 000 and 2900 respectively such high riverine ghg saturations may be highly associated with biogenic processes including incomplete denitrification quick et al 2019 methanogenesis cotovicz et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 and respiration humborge et al 2010 sobek et al 2005 any factors that are direct or indirectly involved in these processes could be their potential proximate controls as expected many riverine factors including availability of carbon as represented by fdom and cod and nitrogen e g no3 n nh4 n do temperature spc and ph have relationships with ghg saturations see fig 4 among them nutrient related indicators e g tn no3 n nh4 n fdom and cod were most significantly correlated suggesting the importance of nutrient supply in promoting ghg production laini et al 2011 turner et al 2016 the findings match those observations in other aquatic ecosystems including inland rivers borges et al 2015b raymond et al 2013 lakes cunada et al 2018 davidson et al 2015 and coastal bays cotovicz et al 2016 do is another important factor related to gas production as the associated functional microorganisms are usually facultative aerobes or obligate anaerobes marescaux et al 2018 quick et al 2019 thus it is not surprising to observe that n2o and ch4 saturations were negatively correlated to do in oxic forested rivers fig 4 in general n2o production was usually favored under suboxic conditions a suitable environment for coupled nitrification denitrification ji et al 2015 wrage et al 2001 which allows denitrifiers to obtain no3 n through aerobic nitrification leading to n2o production quick et al 2019 in the urban rivers studied here mean do level reached 6 4 mg l which can be characterized as suboxic conditions thus the optimal do condition for n2o production could be obtained quick et al 2019 and small variations of do as indicated by its low sd in table 1 can hardly become an important control unlike that of n2o ch4 production usually prefers anaerobic conditions stanley et al 2016 therefore the two gasses can react differently to do variations in some settings e g in urban rivers see fig 4 if we now turn to co2 saturation we find that spc is an important influential factor high spc usually indicates a river water s greater ability to conduct electrical current which may imply a more suitable condition for the rapid decomposition of organic matter for microbial production quick et al 2019 high spc may also indicate more contributions of water and dissolved gasses from groundwater recharge or wastewater as their conductivity could be higher the most surprising aspect of the data is in the positive relationships between co2 saturation and chl a which is contrary to established knowledge that primary producers represented by chl a usually deplete riverine co2 to build biomass davidson et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 it should be documented that chl a was measured by a ysi multiprobe field meter which can be influenced by light and some substances that have similar fluorescent properties with those of chl a thus in the spatial dimension high chl a may indicate high presences of algae and bioavailable substances that may favor co2 production our data showed that ghg levels are also related to water temperature with exceptions of n2o and ch4 in urban rivers the results challenge the established empirical evidence for temperature dependence on riverine microbial production davidson et al 2015 these results are perhaps not surprising as thermal influence does not act in isolation in any ecosystem and can be concealed by more important factors when these factors also correlate with water temperature stanley et al 2016 for example borges et al 2015 analyzed 12 different basins across a whole continent of africa and found that connectivity with wetland landscapes was a more important factor than temperature in tropical regions in our study it is clear that n related indicators were usually negatively related to water temperature see fig 4 and thus the variability in nutrient supply may have overwhelmed temperature controls on microbial metabolisms with the net result that the ghg saturations missed the linkage with water temperature to better discern differentiated controls of ghg saturation among rivers we performed a stepwise regression analysis as shown in fig 6 the considerable differences in the explanatory power of the stepwise regressions and associated predictors reflect multiple controls on the production of ghg among rivers for n2o around 37 57 of the spatial and temporal variabilities can be explained by variables including fdom no3 n cod do and temperature this demonstrated that n2o production is mainly sensitive to nutrient supply and do he et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 wang et al 2015 however controls of n2o saturations differed among rivers for example in the n enriched urban rivers n2o production could be limited by unmatched supplies of electron donors e g organic carbon with respect to that of n see table 1 this was supported by the highest explanatory power of the proxy of the carbon sources i e fdom in explaining the variations of n2o saturation in the less n enriched mixed and agricultural rivers however n2o saturation is most significantly explained by no3 n and in the forested rivers do become the most significant limiting factor suggesting that do is the primary control of n2o production in oxygen saturated environments venkiteswaran et al 2014 in comparison to n2o fewer variations in ch4 saturation 20 44 can be explained by the physical and chemical indicators the fuel for respiration i e organic matter was the main control of ch4 production throughout the rivers as indicated by the highest explanatory power of its proxy variables e g cod and fdom for both urban and non urban rivers in the non urban rivers n related indicators were interpreted as primary predictors of ch4 saturation e g in mixed and agricultural rivers this relation can be explained given that n contents in the water column could be indicative of the availability of decomposable organic matter in rivers which were influenced by intensive agricultural production and other land use activities renwick et al 2018 in the forested rivers do explains the largest variations in ch4 underscoring that lotic methanogenesis is anaerobic stanley et al 2016 the overall explanatory power of multiple linear regressions of co2 saturation showed that the highest and lowest r2 were reported in the urban and forested rivers respectively among all the rivers co2 saturation is primarily explained by water temperature and conductivity the temperature dependence of co2 efflux across rivers is expected as carbon dioxide co2 is the major end product of temperature dependent respiration stanley et al 2016 but there is an exception in forested rivers where chl a was interpreted as the main control this may be due to the strong collinear between chl a and temperature see fig 4 and chl a s better explanatory power nh4 n also was included as a variable of co2 prediction rather than considering this substance as an influential factor nh4 n may be another byproduct of organic matter mineralization which theoretically can be collinear with co2 thus the main mechanism behind co2 production across rivers is temperature dependent with a suitable environment that allows the rapid decomposition of organic matter 4 2 urban river are hotspots of diffusive ghg emissions differing results observed among rivers from the chaohu lake basin highlight the significance of ghg emissions from urban rivers the mean estimated n2o ch4 and co2 fluxes from the urban rivers reached 471 μmol m 2 d 1 7 1 mmol m 2 d 1 and 895 7 mmol m 2 d 1 which are nearly 14 seven and two times of those from the non urban rivers respectively significantly higher ghg fluxes from urban rivers have also been previously documented hu et al 2018 compared ghg fluxes from the haihe river basin of china and concluded that the n2o ch4 and co2 fluxes in sewage draining urban rivers were almost 1 1 3 1 3 1 10 9 and 1 2 2 4 times those of other rivers wang et al 2018 and he et al 2017 found that river networks within the highly urbanized regions commonly emitted the largest areal ghg emissions with values of 590 μmol m 2 d 1 3 6 mmol m 2 d 1 and 873 mmol m 2 d 1 for riverine n2o ch4 and co2 fluxes corresponding to 13 12 and 6 times of those reported in less urbanized rivers respectively similarly cotovicz et al 2016 found that ch4 fluxes in the urban impacted coastal bay in brazil can reach 4 8 mmol m 2 d 1 a value of 12 times higher than a nearby forested bay the compiled datasets as shown in table 1s further showed that mean ghg fluxes reported in worldwide urban rivers were generally 600 μmol m 2 d 1 for n2o 6 mmol m 2 d 1 for ch4 and 900 mmol m 2 d 1 for co2 respectively though wide ranges of variation were also presented see table 1s for details evidently our estimations were quite close to these upper limits indicating comparably higher ghg emissions from the urban rivers here this may be attributable to high population density locally and low sewage treatment rates huang et al 2018 which could consistently result in high ghg emissions considering the landscapes that river drained it is clear that the fluxes of each gas at each watershed were significantly related to the percentage of urban area included see fig 7 however the parallel analysis using a percentage of agricultural land as an independent variable failed to show similar relationships p 0 05 this information along with the ghg hotspots that were frequently identified in urban sampled sites implies that urban rivers are likely ghg emission hotspots several factors lead to significantly high ghg in urban rivers urban rivers usually receive substantial nutrients inputs from various sources which can provide desirable environmental conditions for in stream ghg production it has been well documented that most of the processes that favor ghg production such as nitrification denitrification and methanogenesis usually prefer a low do environment cotovicz et al 2016 quick et al 2019 enhanced aerobic metabolism of organic matter which is available due to insufficient sewage treatment and direct domestic discharges may rapidly deplete do in the water column creating suboxic environments that are suitable for biogenic production low do could also be enhanced by damming urban rivers which would reduce the influx of do from the atmosphere due to the attenuated flow rates see table 1 in addition to suitable do adequate supplies of nutrients in urban rivers also motivate microbial metabolisms as well as mitigate their resource competitions schade et al 2016 documented significant resource competition between denitrifiers and methanogens in headwater streams but this is unlikely to occur in nutrient enriched urban rivers evidence for that can be found in significantly positive relationships between n2o and ch4 saturation in urban rivers see fig 4 the considerable presence of some specific substances in urban rivers can prevent the rapid depletion of dissolved ghg hydrogen sulfide h2s one of these substances has been documented as an important inhibitor of critical enzyme activity such as nitrous oxide reductase and some organisms involved in converting ghg dalsgaard et al 2014 quick et al 2019 in aggregate high availability of nutrients and desirable do levels favor ghg production while some substances inhibit their subsequent depletion in the water column urban rivers may also receive external ghg fluxes from sewage direct measurements of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent showed that the concentrations for n2o and ch4 typically lay within 1200 3300 nmol l 1 beaulieu et al 2010 and 0 01 1 06 μmol l 1 wang et al 2011 respectively which is generally higher than the direct measurements in rivers see fig 2 similarly co2 concentrations in the final effluent of wwtps can reach 30 mmol l 1 caniani et al 2019 this suggests that once passed into rivers wwtp effluent may become an important source of riverine ghg moreover there are also considerable untreated sewage discharges in this basin province 2017 which may further increase riverine ghg enrichment consequently the river segments in which significant sewage is discharged are more likely to become ghg emission hotspots additional factors include urban heat island effects and warm sewages discharged from households and industries the mean in situ water temperature of all sampling campaigns for urban rivers was 19 5 c which was roughly 1 0 2 0 c higher than other rivers in the chaohu lake basin thus associated organisms and microorganisms could utilize such favorable thermal advantages and produce more ghg 4 3 implications of this study the global warming potential in the urban rivers rose to 48 g co2 m 2 d 1 which was about 1 8 3 4 times of that in the non urban rivers upon further inspection in each sampling campaign we conclude that on average urban rivers always have the highest global warming potential among rivers p 0 05 this underscores that the current ipcc budget accounting of ghg emissions without differentiation between the river types may result in poorly constrained estimates ipcc 2019 we encourage regional and global scale ghg budget estimates to consider urban rivers more specifically given that ghg emissions from urban rivers were higher than from other rivers and that urban land cover and populations will continue to expand in the future foley et al 2005 however the true level of ghg emissions could be even higher because we only considered diffusive fluxes while other pathways such as the ebullitive emission via bubbles and plant mediated transport via the passages in vascular plants were not included stanley et al 2016 for example according to baulch et al 2011 ebullition was an important pathway of ch4 emissions contributing 20 67 of the total fluxes moreover ghg emissions via ebullition can also be promoted by damming maeck et al 2013 ran et al 2017 which is observed in the highly managed chaohu lake basin to comprehensively estimate ghg emissions therefore future work should carefully include more in situ measurement of ghg emissions on rivers and include all emission pathways our estimations have uncertainties one of the largest uncertainties is derived from our low sampling frequency the monte carlo analysis as shown in the supplementary material has suggested that finer sampling frequencies can lead to 0 3 5 8 differences in the estimated ghg fluxes as shown in table 2s but the differences could be greater for some specific rivers see the supplementary material for details this points to a need for more field measurements with wider spatial coverage and finer frequency to achieve more credible estimations another uncertainty is associated with the calculation of k as there are various methods see details in raymond et al 2012 here we adopted equations as proposed by clough et al 2007 to calculate k this method considers the influence of wind and water currents requiring variables such as in situ temperature flow rate wind speed and riverine width we obtained all of these data under in situ conditions to ensure the accurate estimation of k and the subsequent robust estimation of ghg fluxes however in comparison with other equations such as ray01 and ray05 we found that our estimated fluxes were generally close to those using ray01 see the supplementary material while ray01 was more suitable for low order rivers audet et al 2017 which were not precisely applicable in our case as our monitored rivers were relatively large in this sense our choice of the empirical model from clough et al 2007 may downplay by 50 of the gwp if we compared with the ray05 estimates see the supplementary material to assess the accuracy of different calculations of k and to obtain more credible estimates therefore local measurements of k in the hydro system of the chaohu lake basin are recommended 5 conclusions the main goal of the study was to examine whether urban rivers behave as regional hotspots of diffusive greenhouse gas n2o ch4 co2 emissions in this study we investigated the spatial variability of ghg emissions from different rivers in the mixed landscape chaohu lake basin our results demonstrated that urban rivers were the emission hotspots for all greenhouse gasses the mean areal fluxes reached 471 2 1048 8 μmol m 2 d 1 7 1 17 2 mmol m 2 d 1 and 895 7 780 0 mmol m 2 d 1 which were 14 seven and two times those from non urban rivers respectively on a co2 equivalent basis the global warming potential in the urban rivers can rise to 48 g co2 m 2 d 1 which was about 1 8 3 4 times of that in the non urban rivers further stepwise regression revealed why ghg emissions vary significantly across rivers we concluded that the suboxic conditions with adequate nutrient supply in the water column of urban rivers were the common reasons for higher n2o and ch4 emissions which were in contrast with the aerobic conditions with limited nutrient supply present in the non urban rivers the main controls for co2 were similar among rivers which were strongly related to water temperature and conductivity the urban rivers may have emitted more co2 largely because of the high availability of organic matter and physical and chemical conditions that allow rapid decomposition in them overall our studies highlighted the significance of urban rivers in ghg emissions and corresponding ghg mitigation measures that should be established around these regional hotspots declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

sol gel approach used to synthesize the fs nanoparticles is considered a convenient and easy approach for engineering the spacer s surface structure and roughness the performance of the fs coated printed surface was evaluated against other coating materials of different chemical properties the coated surfaces were characterized using water contact angle measurements atr ftir raman fesem edx atomic force and 3d microscopes the 3d printed surface s microscale roughness and hydrophobicity increased while its surface free energy decreased with fs nanoparticles coating the antiscaling

fs coated spacer was 0 24 mg cm 2 74 lower than on the uncoated 3d spacer 0 95 mg cm 2 also by using the antiscaling fs coated spacer scaling on the membrane surface dropped by 60 the predominant factors that helped minimize scaling with fs coating were microscale roughness induced hydrophobicity and reduced surface free energy that weakened the scalant s interaction with the spacer surface

is governed by multiple factors such as degree of supersaturation feed temperature flow conditions surface roughness and surface material gryta 2009 the main anti fouling strategies adopted for md

such as surface coating grafting and immobilization of nanomaterials are accompanied with trade offs in membrane permeability chen et al 2020 hou et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 the agglomeration of nanomaterials caused by the incompatibility and poor dispersion within the organic or aqueous phase during membrane synthesis is yet another concern goh et al 2019 feed spacers in md act as turbulence promoters suppressing the thermal and concentration boundary layers near the membrane surface thus maximizing flux and minimizing membrane fouling kim et al 2018 seo et al 2017 the feed spacer geometry influences the flow field convective solute transport to the membrane temperature and solute concentration distribution in the feed channel kiefer et al 2019a as the vapor permeates through the md membrane pores the local degree of supersaturation increases near the membrane surface causing surface crystallization the turbulence and mixing near the membrane surface can be increased by using a suitable feed spacer geometry and surface crystallization on membrane can be reduced by altering the hydrodynamic flow conditions thomas et al 2019 although the conventional mesh spacer promotes flow turbulence within the feed channel studies have reported that scalant deposition and entrapment occurs on the membrane surface close to the spacer filaments and membrane spacer contact points bush et al 2016 chen et al 2013 radu et al 2014 the low shear stress regions at spacer strand intersection or along spacer filaments create dead zones which are prone to scaling alwatban et al

2014 in a study investigating spacer induced integrity loss in forward osmosis process gypsum a crystal form of calcium sulfate scaling was observed to initiate near the spacer filament and progressively result in severe accumulation of gypsum scalant in the confined region near the filaments xie et al 2016 scalant crystals that form near the spacer filaments or on the polymeric mesh spacer may progressively aggregate and grow resulting in the formation of crystals on the membrane surface chen et al 2016 modifying the feed spacer geometry to alter the hydrodynamics in the flow channel and or modifying the surface chemistry of the feed spacer to weaken its interaction with scalant are plausible antiscaling strategies that can be further explored in recent years additive manufacturing or so called 3d printing has enabled creation of unique complex and irregular feed spacer geometries which cannot be synthesized with traditional manufacturing technologies a list of 3d printed spacer geometries and their impact on different membrane processes is presented in table s1 electronic supplementary information esi some of the previously investigated 3d printed spacer geometries specifically for md application are based on mathematically created triply periodic minimal surfaces tpms a minimal surface is characterized by a zero mean curvature at each given point on the surface and when such minimal surface is replicated in three dimensions a tpms geometry is obtained thomas et al 2018 the interpenetrating structures and increased turbulence of tpms geometries has been previously reported to improve flux in md by up to 60 than a conventional mesh spacer thomas et al 2018 in another study tpms spacer geometry was effective to reduce scaling on membrane by nearly 50 compared to the conventional mesh spacer thomas et al 2019 multiple factors such as surface roughness surface free energy sfe hydrophobicity and surface charge can influence scale deposition on a surface the surface finish quality of 3d printed material is influenced by numerous factors like machine resolution printing orientation and post processing techniques lee et al 2016 a rougher surface is prone to serious fouling or scaling because the protrusions i e bulges in the microstructure serve as easy adhesion or nucleation sites for the foulants or scalants whereas the notches provide a shelter against fluid shear forces cheong et al 2013 on the other hand the sfe of a material is indicative of its intermolecular or interfacial attractive forces a material with lower sfe contributes to lower adhesion forces thereby enabling the foulants to be easily detached by the shear forces li et al 2014 the sfe can be altered by modifying the surface chemistry of a material for instance the sfe of a material is reduced after ion implantation with certain elements such as f c h and si which reduces fouling zhao et al 2005 a simple and easy surface engineering technique such as surface coating can then be adopted as a mitigation strategy to thwart scaling with 3d printed spacers most previously reported studies on antifouling surface coating for spacers have focused on improving the conventional polypropylene spacers and predominantly dealt with the mitigation of biofouling some of the previously explored anti fouling coatings include copper ions charged chelating ligands silver nanoparticles metal coating e g gold zinc oxide nanoparticles copper oxide functionalized polymers hydrogels and zwitterionic polymer brushes abid et al 2017 bogler et al 2019 yang et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge there is no reported study that has specifically dealt with antiscaling surface coating of spacers and particularly none that targeted 3d printed one the present work focuses on exploring a shift in the antiscaling strategy in md from a membrane centric to spacer centric one herein we report a facile and easy approach to fabricate antiscaling 3d printed spacers via surface coating with a nanomaterial we hypothesize that altering the surface chemistry of 3d printed spacers would weaken the scalant interaction with the spacer surface at the membrane spacer contact regions and thus reduce membrane scaling to evaluate the hypothesis the impact of five different surface coatings on flat 3d printed polyamide pa surfaces was assessed based on their surface roughness hydrophobicity sfe and antiscaling efficiency batch scaling tests using calcium sulfate as a model scalant were utilized to select the surface coating that yielded the most remarkable drop in scalant deposition compared to an uncoated surface then uncoated and surface coated spacers of the same geometry were tested in direct contact md dcmd under dynamic and scale inducing flow conditions to specifically evaluate the antiscaling potential of surface coated 3d spacers in an md system 2 methodology 2 1 materials the following chemicals were procured from sigma

membrane with pore size 0 2 µm was supplied by memsys water technologies gmbh germany a hybrid 3d printed tpms which combines two tpms designs namely schoen gyroid and schwarz transverse crossed layer of parallels tclp dubbed gyr tclp cf fig 1 was selected as the spacer design for this study this spacer architecture was considered as it has been previously reported to yield 60 higher flux than a commercial polypropylene mesh spacer in dcmd thomas et al 2019 furthermore these tpms spacer geometries are reported to lower membrane scaling by up to 50 compared to a commercial mesh spacer in an md system thomas et al 2019 these tpms designs were formed by the replication of a specific volume element in three dimensions the volume element is represented by a level set equation which is shown

al 2018 the printed material was a thermoplastic pigment filled polyamide powder pa 2202 black eos surface characterizations of the printed spacers were difficult to perform on the curved geometries of the tpms structures hence 3d printed flat samples 2 1 cm2 were specially prepared for use in the preliminary analysis of the effects of different coatings on surface properties and in batch antiscaling performance experiments for the final assessment the performance of the uncoated and surface coated 3d printed gyr tclp as feed channel spacers was evaluated in a lab scale dcmd setup under similar operating conditions an uncoated gyr tclp spacer was placed in the permeate channel for each dcmd test the dimensions of each 3d printed tpms spacer were 8 5 3 9 cm2 with a thickness of 2 3 mm 2 2 material synthesis characterization and surface coating initially five different surface coatings were evaluated to identify the best coating to mitigate the deposition of scalant on the surface of the printed spacer the five different surface coatings were selected to cover a range of wettability surface free energy values and effect of functional groups on surface modification of the spacers please refer section s1 esi for more details the codes and compositions of all coatings are listed in table 1 graphene oxide go was synthesized from graphite powder according to the modified hummer s method kumar et al 2020 the go paste was diluted with di water to obtain a concentration of 0 5 g ml 1 for the go coating suspension an in situ thermal reduction was employed to obtain the rgo coating on the printed surface the suspension of go was coated on the printed surface and the coated sample was placed in a vacuum oven at 120 c for 3 h to obtain the rgo coating the rgo containing pvdf coating suspension denoted as rpvdf was prepared by dispersing 50 wt rgo into 5 wt pvdf solution in dmf note the wt of rgo is relative to the weight of pvdf in dmf solution a fourth coating suspension was prepared by dispersing pristine gn nanosheets in nmp which was denoted as pg the details for the preparation of the rpvdf and pg coating suspensions are provided in section s2 esi the fifth and last coating suspension to be investigated was based on fluorinated silica fs fs sol was initially prepared via a sol gel reaction fig s1 esi a coating suspension of dried fs nanoparticles in nmp was prepared with a nanoparticle loading of 2 mg ml 1 the detailed procedure for the synthesis of fs nanoparticles is included in section s3 esi the synthesis of go and fs nanoparticles was confirmed by atr ftir raman spectroscopy and edx elemental mapping section s4 esi based on the sem images the fs nanoparticles exhibit near spherical structures with nanoscale individual particles and microscale particle networking while the go exhibits a layered structure cf fig s2 esi prior to any surface coating the printed samples were thoroughly washed with di water dried at room temperature rt and further dried in an oven at 70 c for 3 h to eliminate any traces of residual moisture each coating suspension was applied twice onto the surface of a 3d printed sample via the drop casting method a fixed volume 40 µl of the coating solution was evenly spread over the sample surface with a micropipette and then dried at rt the sample was then placed in a vacuum oven at 70 c for 3 h the dried sample was removed from the oven and cooled down to rt this process was repeated to apply the second coating on the same surface of the sample the presence of the different coatings go rgo rpvdf pg or fs applied onto the 3d printed pa samples was confirmed by comparing the raman and atr ftir spectra of these samples with those of the pristine uncoated pa sample cf section s5 esi sem edx analysis was used to further confirm the presence of different coatings on the sample surfaces fig 2 the presence of f 12 27 wt and si 2 31 wt elements in the sem edx spectrum of the fs coated sample fig 2 and the presence of f element 24 51 wt in the rpvdf coated sample fig 2 b serve as an additional confirmation of the successful surface coating of these samples fig 2 f depicts the atomic carbon to oxygen c o ratio for go rgo and pg samples typically the c o ratio increases upon transitioning from go to gn due to the elimination of oxygen containing moieties seo et al 2013 the c o ratio in go and rgo samples was estimated to be 5 0 and 8 2 respectively confirming the loss of oxygen containing moieties up to a certain degree after thermal reduction as anticipated the highest c o ratio 10 5 was obtained for the pg sample based on the antiscaling efficiency under static experiment conditions which will be discussed later the fs coating was identified as the best coating to mitigate scaling deposition on the printed spacer surface hence an extended study was performed to determine the effect of increasing the number of fs coating layers this was done by applying four and six fs coating layers onto the 3d printed surface these are denoted as 4fs and 6fs respectively and their performance was compared to the sample with two fs coating layers 2fs prior to surface characterizations and performance assessment all coated samples were first rinsed with di water the samples were then immersed in di water in a beaker placed on a shaker and gently agitated at 100 rpm for 24 h at rt to wash out the loosely bound excess coating the samples were dried at rt and then oven dried for 3 h at 70 c prior to testing 2 3 surface analysis the coated samples were subjected to sem imaging to obtain the microstructural surface images and sem edx mapping for elemental compositions analysis prior to imaging the samples were sputter coated with a 10 nm layer of au pd the surface finishing of the coated specimen was analyzed based on roughness hydrophobicity and sfe both macroscale and microscale surface roughness were determined the macroscale roughness was measured using 3d profiles generated by 3d digital microscope hirox kh 7700 digital video microscope japan equipped with an extended depth of field 0 08 2 7 mm section s6 esi the microscale surface roughness of the coated 3d printed samples were measured using atomic force microscope afm nano observer csi france with an aluminum coated silicon cantilever ac200ts asylum research the topographic afm images were recorded in the tapping mode for a scanning area of 3 3 µm2 the recorded afm images were post processed using gwyddion software version 2 45 to obtain the roughness parameters the surface wettability was analyzed via a drop shape analysis system easy drop dsa20e krüss germany by measuring the static and dynamic water contact angles the contact angle was determined with a water droplet of 5 µl using the sessile drop method the reported contact angle measurements represent the average of five readings taken at different locations on the sample to ensure values representative of the entire sample the sfe of the coated samples was determined according to the owens wendt method using the contact angles of two liquids with different polarity i e water as polar liquid and glycerol as bipolar liquid kujawa et al 2014 the polar and dispersive components of sfe were calculated according to eqs s1 and s2 in esi 2 4 antiscaling performance of surface coated 3d printed spacer material the antiscaling performance of surface coated 3d printed samples was investigated under two experimental configurations static and dynamic for static batch experiment each surface coated flat sample 2 0 cm2 was placed in a round bottom glass crystallization dish containing 100 ml of 1 9 g l 1 caso4 2h2o solution the crystallization dish with the flat sample and caso4 2h2o solution was kept on a hot plate c mag hs7 ika usa and the solution temperature was maintained at 65 c for 5 h water evaporated from the crystallization dish over the course of the experiment resulting in a continuous heterogeneous nucleation scalant deposition and growth on the surface of the flat sample after 5 h the sample was carefully removed from the crystallization dish the scaled sample was quickly immersed in 20 ml of 2 citric acid solution and ultrasonicated for 30 min to dislodge and dissolve the deposited scalant into the citric acid solution the solution was further diluted with di water for calcium ion analysis using ion chromatography ic ics 5000 thermoscientific usa this experimental protocol allowed for a quick preliminary identification of the best coating for suppressing the attachment of scalant on the 3d printed surface the pearson product moment correlation coefficient was utilized to probe the correlation between the surface properties and the antiscaling performance using the different surface coatings the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated using eq s3 in esi the results from the static experiment indicated that the least deposition of scalant occurred on the fs coated sample as will be discussed later hence the effects of increased fs coating layers were further investigated under static experiment conditions based on the results from the above analyses four coatings of fs were applied via dip coating on the surface of the gyr tclp spacer for the dynamic flow through condition in dcmd the adhesion stability of the fs coating was inspected by performing a leaching test in di water under ultrasonication for 12 h at 40 khz the coated feed spacer was immersed in di water and sonicated in a bath sonicator for 12 h the leaching of the fs nanoparticles from the feed spacer was tested using a particle size analyzer zetapals brookhaven instruments corp usa for the presence of nanoparticles in the supernatant the nanoparticles in the supernatant solution was not detected this observation confirmed a stable adhesion of the coating on the feed spacer the antiscaling performance of fs coated and uncoated spacers was compared in a lab scale dcmd setup the hot feed 1 9 g l 1 caso4 2h2o solution average initial feed conductivity 1709 15 µs cm and cold permeate di water were recirculated in a counter flow mode through a flat sheet ptfe membrane module the effective membrane area was 34 cm2 the height of the flow channels in the md cell was 2 3 mm the temperature of the feed and permeate was set at 65 c and 35 c respectively whereas the feed and permeate recirculation velocity was fixed at 0 1 m s 1 each md test was performed for 15 h with a closed loop feed stream such that the rejected brine was returned to the feed vessel causing an increase of feed concentration as the experiment progressed at the end of each experiment the scaled spacer and membrane coupon were removed from the module gently rinsed with di water and dried at rt for further analysis to extract the deposited scalant from the scaled spacer and membrane coupon the specimens were immersed in 200 ml of 2 citric acid solution and ultrasonicated for 60 min the calcium ion concentration in the extracted solutions was analyzed by ic instrument after the needed dilution with di water moreover the deposition of scalant on the membrane surfaces was visualized using the alizarin red s ars staining technique thomas et al 2019 a small section 2 2 cm2 from the scaled membrane was cut and stained in 2 ars solution ph 4 1 to 4 3 for 30 min a template was applied to cut the membrane sample to ensure that the region of the membrane coupons used for the staining purpose was the same for all md tests optical images were taken of the stained membrane samples for qualitative comparison of membrane scaling 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of coatings on surface finishing the physio chemical properties and the material structure strongly influence the foulant interaction and adhesion onto the surface of a membrane or a spacer choudhury et al 2018 tan et al 2017 the surface roughness wettability and chemistry of these surfaces are therefore prominent characteristics that govern the antifouling behavior zhang et al 2016 fig 3 shows the effect of the five different surface coatings on the roughness and wettability of 3d printed surface the surface coatings did not create a significant variation in the surface roughness at a macroscale level fig 3 c which can be explained on the basis that the amount of coating material was not large enough to completely fill the notches created during the sintering of pa powder but it is interesting to note that the surface coatings caused significant changes in the microscale surface roughness analyzed by afm fig 3 f the fs coating resulted in the highest microscale surface roughness 115 4 nm compared to the uncoated surface 42 5 nm as seen from the sem image of fs coated sample fig 3 h the presence of near spherical fs nanoparticles scattered on the surface imparts a rough micro nano morphological pattern on the surface which leads to an increase in the microscale roughness iacono and jennings 2019 the other surface coatings with the exception of go increased the microscale surface roughness in the order pg 96 0 nm rpvdf 80 1 nm rgo 66 8 nm the increased microscale roughness for the pg sample was attributed to the protrusions and irregular stacking of gn sheets on the surface wang et al 2015 the thermal reduction to create the rgo coating induced atomic rearrangement and considerable disorder in go sheets resulting in increased roughness of the rgo sample bagri et al 2010 the go coating layer lowered the microscale roughness of the uncoated surface to 34 9 nm the surface sem image of go coated sample show a relatively smooth and homogenous morphology with wrinkles fig s5 esi the wettability of the coated printed surfaces based on static water contact angle measurements is illustrated in fig 3 i both chemical composition and surface roughness play key roles in determining the surface wettability the hydrophilicity of the uncoated pa sample with a contact angle of 84 9о was attributed to the water holding amide groups in pa hnilica et al 2014 the smooth coating of go dropped the contact angle to 55 6о by introducing oxygen containing functional groups oh c o cooh and epoxy that promote the water holding capacity of the modified sample surface via hydrogen bonding interactions yu et al 2020 the addition of rgo rpvdf and pg surface coatings increased the surface hydrophobicity as manifested in their water contact angle values of 93 3о 120 3о and 131 8о respectively the progressive absence of oxygen containing functional groups in rgo and gn explains the increased hydrophobicity of rgo and pg coated samples the hydrophobicity with gn is mostly attributed to the weak van der waal s forces at the gn water interface zhao et al 2017 the water contact angle of 3d printed surface after coating of fs nanoparticles increased sharply to 134 2о indicating that the surface hydrophobicity was increased greatly by the coating of fs nanoparticle the presence of f element with considerably low polarizability value contributes to the increased hydrophobicity in the fs coated sample the observed trend in surface hydrophobicity with the various coatings closely mimics the microscale roughness trend outlined above the positive correlation between hydrophobicity and microscale roughness specifically for the micro nanoscale hierarchy imposed by the fs coating can be explained based on the cassie baxter model the model stipulates that the increase in water contact angle on a rough micro patterned surface is attributed to the large amount of the entrapped air within the cavities formed by surface asperities si and guo 2015 the dynamic water contact angle measurements cf fig s6 esi of fs coated sample displayed a small decrease of only 12о compared to the 36о drop for the uncoated sample after a duration of 8 5 min indicating the relative stability of the hydrophobic feature exerted by the fs coating the sfe of solid surfaces serves as an indicator of the intermolecular or interfacial attractive forces and plays a crucial role in the nucleation of salt crystals on the surface based on the classical nucleation theory as will be discussed in section 3 2 the sfe of a solid surface γs is a sum of its polar γs p and dispersive γs d components the polar component includes the polar hydrogen inductive and acid base interactions while the dispersive component represents the strength of intermolecular interactions london forces kujawa et al 2014 a comparison of sfe and its components for different surface coatings is shown in fig 4 a the results indicate that the available functional groups on the surface of the coated samples influenced their sfe the go coating boosted the sfe with a considerable increase in the polar component the polar component fraction i e γs p γs in go sample increased to 0 66 compared to 0 55 in the uncoated sample on the contrary rgo rpvdf pg and fs coatings progressively reduced the sfe with a concomitant increase in the fraction of the dispersive component as represented by the drop in γs p γs ratio to 0 1 0 42 fig 4 b illustrates the difference in the interaction of a polar liquid like water with the uncoated sample with relatively high γs p γs ratio and fs coated sample with lower γs p γs ratio the decrease in polar sfe component with fs coating curbs the interaction between the polar liquid and the solid surface consequently the scaling propensity of fs coated surface is lowered the fs coating resulted in the largest reduction in sfe up to 92 in comparison to the uncoated sample the presence of f element in fs which is characterized by low polarizability due to the complete octet of electrons in their 2s2p6 orbitals leads to the incorporation of cfn bonds on the surface azimi et al 2014 the sfe has been reported to decrease in the order ch2 ch3 cf2 cf2h cf3 hare et al 1954 which further explains the reduced sfe for fs coated sample the overall decrease in sfe along with the reduction in the dispersive component is a favorable feature for antiscaling surfaces azimi et al 2014 3 2 antiscaling efficiency of surface coatings the deposition of calcium on the surface of uncoated and coated samples under static calcium sulfate scaling conditions is shown in fig 5 a the variation in the calcium deposition serves as an indicator of the influence of surface coating on the attachment of scalant and thus its antiscaling efficiency fs coating provided the best antiscaling performance by causing the highest reduction 80 in the deposition of calcium from 0 50 mg cm 2 on the uncoated sample to 0 09 mg cm 2 on the fs sample as discussed above the fs coating considerably increased the micro roughness which in turn contributed to the improved hydrophobicity by air entrapment within the surface cavities brassard et al 2011 the presence of surface bound trapped air is evidenced by the silvery and reflective appearance of the submerged coated sample cf fig s7 esi the sfe of the solid surface plays a crucial role in the nucleation of salt crystals on the surface according to the classical nucleation theory the free energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation depends on the critical radius of the scale nuclei the contact angle of scale nuclei with substrate the interfacial energies of scale nuclei substrate scale nuclei solution and substrate solution azimi et al 2014 low sfe of the solid reduces the affinity and interaction between the solid and scalant which favorably imposes a greater energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation azimi et al 2014 the decreased sfe reduces the nucleation potential on the surfaces while the entrapped air might reduce the attachment of scale nuclei therefore the reduced scaling on fs sample is attributed to the synergistic interplay of microscale roughness induced hydrophobicity and low sfe apart from go coating for which the deposition of calcium increased to 0 74 mg cm 2 the other surface coatings also repressed the deposition of calcium in the order pg 0 13 mg cm 2 rpvdf 0 14 mg cm 2 rgo 0 22 mg cm 2 the examination of go rgo and pg coating performance further supports the effect of the surface chemistry on scaling go enriched with carboxylic cooh groups fig s8 esi easily complexes with calcium ions thus facilitating heterogeneous crystallization and increased scaling tong et al 2019 xie and gray 2016 on the other hand rgo coating with predominantly hydroxyl oh groups displayed reduced scaling due to the low affinity of calcium ions with hydroxyl groups tong et al 2019 xie and gray 2016 lastly the gn coated pg sample without any functional groups exhibited lower scaling than the go and rgo coated samples the pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the influence of surface properties on calcium deposition fig 5 b illustrates the strength of pearson correlation coefficients for surface properties sfe roughness microscale and macroscale and hydrophobicity with the deposition of calcium on the different surfaces the macroscale roughness displayed a moderate negative correlation with an r value of 0 421 while the microscale roughness showed a strong negative correlation with scaling r 0 901 sfe and hydrophobicity r 0 948 and 0 945 respectively exhibited the strongest correlation with scaling this analysis further exemplifies that the reduced scaling achieved by fs coating is attributed to the combined effect of its reduced sfe and increased hydrophobicity it is worth mentioning that previous studies show that spacer surface properties also play an important role in controlling biofouling in a study that compared the biofouling resistance of commercial polypropylene spacer with different surface coatings it was found that polypropylene spacer inherently have good anti adhesive property due to its near ideal sfe rice et al 2018 hence a surface modification with biocidal surface coating was found to be most effective for biofouling control in another study modification of feed spacer by coating with crystalline zno nanorods was reported to achieve biocidal activity owing to a combination of abrasive surface of the crystalline nanorods hydrophobic repulsion and cumulative oxidation thamaraiselvan et al 2019 as fs coating was established thus far as the best antiscaling coating for 3d printed surfaces an extended study was carried out to examine the effects of multiple fs coating layers in addition to the base case reported thus far with two fs coating layers 2fs two other samples with four 4fs and six 6fs coating layers were also studied the top surface sem images of 2fs 4fs and 6fs layers coated samples fig 6 demonstrate the increased deposition of fs on the surface with increased number of coating layers sem edx mapping revealed an increase of f and si content to 6 and 14 respectively in the 4fs sample compared to 3 and 7 in the 2fs sample fig 6 the 6fs and 4fs samples had nearly similar composition of f and si elements which suggests that the most considerable improvement in fs nanoparticle surface loading is achieved up to four layers of fs coating a moderate increase in sample hydrophobicity was observed with increasing the number of fs coating layers as the water contact angle increased from 134 2 in 2fs to 140 1 and 143 1o in 4fs and 6fs respectively fig 7 a all three samples displayed a consistent stability of the hydrophobic nature of the fs coatings as the drop in water contact angle ranged from 12 to 14 over 8 min fig 7 b a preliminary examination of the stability of 4fs coated sample in particular was performed based on contact angle measurement the 4fs coated sample was immersed in di water and subjected to ultrasonication for 12 h at 40 khz the contact angle of the sample was then measured after drying at ambient temperature after the 12 h ultrasonic treatment the static contact angle of the sample 137 2 2 0 was comparable to the initial contact angle of 140 1 2 5 prior to ultrasonication with the increased number of fs coating layers a slight reduction in the total sfe was observed which could be attributed to the increased loading of fs on the surface of the coated sample however the γs p γs ratio for both 4fs and 6fs was equal 0 39 suggesting a low dispersive component of the total sfe fig 7 c the calcium deposition analysis of the scaled samples from the static experiment showed that a 55 reduction in scalant deposition was achieved with 4fs fig 7 d however the antiscaling performance of 4fs and 6fs was comparable suggesting the lack of improvement beyond four layers of fs coatings 3 3 antiscaling performance in dcmd the antiscaling performance of fs coated 3d printed spacer was tested using a lab scale dcmd unit based on the understanding of the surface properties and the discussed superior performance of the 4fs coating four layers of fs coating was applied onto the 3d printed spacer henceforth referred as fs spacer the coating on the spacer was qualitatively confirmed with sem edx analysis fig s9 esi the dcmd performance using both uncoated uc and fs spacers was assessed using calcium sulfate solution 1 9 g l 1 as feed and under similar dcmd operating conditions fig 8 presents the md flux and conductivity data over a 15 h experiment using both spacers the observed two stage permeate flux trend with a relatively stable flux in the first stage followed by a dramatic drop in the second stage is consistent with the literature qu et al 2020 zou et al 2018 the rapid flux decline in the second stage is attributed to the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of caso4 on the membrane surface which imparts additional resistance to heat and mass transfer in md and reduces the open membrane pore area available for water vapor transport zou et al 2018 the scaling induction time is defined as the point at which the flux begins to decline christie et al 2020 compared to the uc spacer where the flux begins to nosedive after 12 h of operation the fs spacer delays the flux decline by an additional 2 h and a sharp drop was observed only after 14 h of operation fig 8 a thus this is indicative of the delayed scaling induction time with the use of surface coated spacer the feed conductivity trend was similar for both spacers indicating the buildup of calcium sulfate concentration in the feed as the experiment progressed however the permeate conductivity surged 100 fold from 4 2 to 413 6 μs cm 1 for the uc spacer fig 8 b concomitant with an apparent spike in flux at 14 h this latter observation is a well documented indication of membrane wetting gryta 2009 interestingly the membrane wetting occurred only when using the uc spacer whereas the use of the fs spacer caused only a marginal increase in permeate conductivity which reached only 32 μs cm 1 at the end of the test the fs coating substantially reduced the attachment of calcium deposits on the spacer to 0 24 mg cm 2 a reduction by 74 compared to the uncoated spacer 0 95 mg cm 2 fig 9 a digital photographic images of the autopsied spacers at the end of dcmd experiment fig 9 b show a clear reduction in scalant deposition on the fs spacer the fs coating of the spacer also resulted in a 60 reduction in calcium deposition on the membrane fig 9 c the images of the autopsied membranes with ars staining solution help to visually appreciate the extent of scale reduction on the membrane when the fs spacer was used fig 9 d to the best of authors knowledge this is the first study that reports the reduction in membrane scaling achieved by surface modification of spacers the heightened energy barrier for crystal nucleation imparted by the reduced sfe of fs coating reduces the adhesion strength of the calcium sulfate crystals on the spacer surface the combined low adhesion strength and shear forces under dynamic flow conditions cause the scalants to be easily removed from the fs spacer this in turn likely interferes with the stable growth of crystals onto the free membrane area resulting in the observed reduced scaling upon using the fs spacer these findings depict enthralling prospects and merit further investigations to affirm the effectiveness of surface modified spacers as a scaling control strategy for real world membrane applications long term experimentation with actual feed waters laden with a plethora of scalants as well as mechanistic and parametric investigations are planned as future studies to evaluate the performance of antiscaling spacers under co precipitation conditions and interactive influence of organic and biological foulants recently researchers have performed in situ monitoring of scaling development in md using optical coherence tomography oct fortunato et al 2018 lee et al 2018 thus in a future study in situ monitoring with oct will be explored to understand the difference in scaling layer development in the bulk free membrane region away from spacer strands and within the membrane spacer contact points when using a coated and uncoated 3d spacer technical viability of the antiscaling spacers would also consider the impact of channel pressure drop and long term stability of fs coating with associated cost implications it is well understood that scaling is inevitable with long term membrane plant operation however what can be achieved with a well designed antiscaling spacer is a considerably delayed onset of membrane scaling this then would translate to sustained water flux over extended period of plant operation reduced cleaning frequency reduced consumption of eutrophication causing antiscalants increased membrane life and the associated cost savings 4 conclusions this study highlights how fluorinated silica fs surface coating on 3d printed spacers enhances the spacer s resistance to scaling and can potentially serve as an antiscaling strategy for md operation the fs surface coating was identified as the best option following a preliminary evaluation of five different surface coatings to alleviate scaling on 3d printed spacers the other surface coatings were based on graphene oxide reduced graphene oxide rgo graphene sheets and a dispersion of rgo in pvdf polymer solution the coatings on the 3d printed surface altered key features thereof such as wettability roughness and surface free energy the coating of fs nanoparticles on the 3d printed surface imbued micro and nano textured features on the surface this led to increased microscale roughness and consequently enhanced hydrophobicity as explained by the cassie baxter model the implantation of fluorine atoms with low polarizability not only lowered the surface free energy but also decreased the polar component of the sfe this limited the interaction between the scalants in solution and the spacer surface consequently fs coated 3d printed spacer tested with calcium sulfate solution as a feed in dcmd setup resulted in 74 decrease in the attachment of scalant on the spacer compared to the uncoated spacer over a 15 h experiment the fs coating also resulted in a 60 lower scale deposition on the membrane itself the fs nanomaterial coating discussed in this study is a promising approach to minimize spacer induced fouling a significant problem in membrane based water and wastewater applications the findings could also motivate researchers to consider a paradigm shift from a membrane centric to a spacer centric approach to maximize the potential of surface chemistry

desalination technology can help in mitigating the growing worldwide water crisis by catering to niche applications such as high salinity brine treatment and zero liquid discharge processes naidu et al 2020 thomas et al 2017 fouling particularly scaling is one of the main impediments to the industrial and commercial adoption of md technology given its technical advantages liao et al 2020 scaling is governed by multiple factors such as degree of supersaturation feed temperature flow conditions surface roughness and surface material gryta 2009 the main anti fouling strategies adopted for md operation are either feed pretreatment development of anti fouling membranes and optimization of process operating conditions lee et al 2020 anti fouling surface modifications of membranes via methods such as surface coating grafting and immobilization of nanomaterials are accompanied with trade offs in membrane permeability chen et al 2020 hou et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 the agglomeration of nanomaterials caused by the incompatibility and poor dispersion within the organic or aqueous phase during membrane synthesis is yet another concern goh et al 2019 feed spacers in md act as turbulence promoters suppressing the thermal and concentration boundary layers near the membrane surface thus maximizing flux and minimizing membrane fouling kim et al 2018 seo et al 2017 the feed spacer geometry influences the flow field convective solute transport to the membrane temperature and solute concentration distribution in the feed channel kiefer et al 2019a as the vapor permeates through the md membrane pores the local degree of supersaturation increases near the membrane surface causing surface crystallization the turbulence and mixing near the membrane surface can be increased by using a suitable feed spacer geometry and surface crystallization on membrane can be reduced by altering the hydrodynamic flow conditions thomas et al 2019 although the conventional mesh spacer promotes flow turbulence within the feed channel studies have reported that scalant deposition and entrapment occurs on the membrane surface close to the spacer filaments and membrane spacer contact points bush et al 2016 chen et al 2013 radu et al 2014 the low shear stress regions at spacer strand intersection or along spacer filaments create dead zones which are prone to scaling alwatban et al 2019 kiefer et al 2019b due to inadequate mixing in these niche regions polarization effect dominates creating high local solute concentration and scalant precipitation kiefer et al 2019b radu et al 2014 in a study investigating spacer induced integrity loss in forward osmosis process gypsum a crystal form of calcium sulfate scaling was observed to initiate near the spacer filament and progressively result in severe accumulation of gypsum scalant in the confined region near the filaments xie et al 2016 scalant crystals that form near the spacer filaments or on the polymeric mesh spacer may progressively aggregate and grow resulting in the formation of crystals on the membrane surface chen et al 2016 modifying the feed spacer geometry to alter the hydrodynamics in the flow channel and or modifying the surface chemistry of the feed spacer to weaken its interaction with scalant are plausible antiscaling strategies that can be further explored in recent years additive manufacturing or so called 3d printing has enabled creation of unique complex and irregular feed spacer geometries which cannot be synthesized with traditional manufacturing technologies a list of 3d printed spacer geometries and their impact on different membrane processes is presented in table s1 electronic supplementary information esi some of the previously investigated 3d printed spacer geometries specifically for md application are based on mathematically created triply periodic minimal surfaces tpms a minimal surface is characterized by a zero mean curvature at each given point on the surface and when such minimal surface is replicated in three dimensions a tpms geometry is obtained thomas et al 2018 the interpenetrating structures and increased turbulence of tpms geometries has been previously reported to improve flux in md by up to 60 than a conventional mesh spacer thomas et al 2018 in another study tpms spacer geometry was effective to reduce scaling on membrane by nearly 50 compared to the conventional mesh spacer thomas et al 2019 multiple factors such as surface roughness surface free energy sfe hydrophobicity and surface charge can influence scale deposition on a surface the surface finish quality of 3d printed material is influenced by numerous factors like machine resolution printing orientation and post processing techniques lee et al 2016 a rougher surface is prone to serious fouling or scaling because the protrusions i e bulges in the microstructure serve as easy adhesion or nucleation sites for the foulants or scalants whereas the notches provide a shelter against fluid shear forces cheong et al 2013 on the other hand the sfe of a material is indicative of its intermolecular or interfacial attractive forces a material with lower sfe contributes to lower adhesion forces thereby enabling the foulants to be easily detached by the shear forces li et al 2014 the sfe can be altered by modifying the surface chemistry of a material for instance the sfe of a material is reduced after ion implantation with certain elements such as f c h and si which reduces fouling zhao et al 2005 a simple and easy surface engineering technique such as surface coating can then be adopted as a mitigation strategy to thwart scaling with 3d printed spacers most previously reported studies on antifouling surface coating for spacers have focused on improving the conventional polypropylene spacers and predominantly dealt with the mitigation of biofouling some of the previously explored anti fouling coatings include copper ions charged chelating ligands silver nanoparticles metal coating e g gold zinc oxide nanoparticles copper oxide functionalized polymers hydrogels and zwitterionic polymer brushes abid et al 2017 bogler et al 2019 yang et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge there is no reported study that has specifically dealt with antiscaling surface coating of spacers and particularly none that targeted 3d printed one the present work focuses on exploring a shift in the antiscaling strategy in md from a membrane centric to spacer centric one herein we report a facile and easy approach to fabricate antiscaling 3d printed spacers via surface coating with a nanomaterial we hypothesize that altering the surface chemistry of 3d printed spacers would weaken the scalant interaction with the spacer surface at the membrane spacer contact regions and thus reduce membrane scaling to evaluate the hypothesis the impact of five different surface coatings on flat 3d printed polyamide pa surfaces was assessed based on their surface roughness hydrophobicity sfe and antiscaling efficiency batch scaling tests using calcium sulfate as a model scalant were utilized to select the surface coating that yielded the most remarkable drop in scalant deposition compared to an uncoated surface then uncoated and surface coated spacers of the same geometry were tested in direct contact md dcmd under dynamic and scale inducing flow conditions to specifically evaluate the antiscaling potential of surface coated 3d spacers in an md system 2 methodology 2 1 materials the following chemicals were procured from sigma

membrane with pore size 0 2 µm was supplied by memsys water technologies gmbh germany a hybrid 3d printed tpms which combines two tpms designs namely schoen gyroid and schwarz transverse crossed layer of parallels tclp dubbed gyr tclp cf fig 1 was selected as the spacer design for this study this spacer architecture was considered as it has been previously reported to yield 60 higher flux than a commercial polypropylene mesh spacer in dcmd thomas et al 2019 furthermore these tpms spacer geometries are reported to lower membrane scaling by up to 50 compared to a commercial mesh spacer in an md system thomas et al 2019 these tpms designs were formed by the replication of a specific volume element in three dimensions the volume element is represented by a level set equation which is shown

al 2018 the printed material was a thermoplastic pigment filled polyamide powder pa 2202 black eos surface characterizations of the printed spacers were difficult to perform on the curved geometries of the tpms structures hence 3d printed flat samples 2 1 cm2 were specially prepared for use in the preliminary analysis of the effects of different coatings on surface properties and in batch antiscaling performance experiments for the final assessment the performance of the uncoated and surface coated 3d printed gyr tclp as feed channel spacers was evaluated in a lab scale dcmd setup under similar operating conditions an uncoated gyr tclp spacer was placed in the permeate channel for each dcmd test the dimensions of each 3d printed tpms spacer were 8 5 3 9 cm2 with a thickness of 2 3 mm 2 2 material synthesis characterization and surface coating initially five different surface coatings were evaluated to identify the best coating to mitigate the deposition of scalant on the surface of the printed spacer the five different surface coatings were selected to cover a range of wettability surface free energy values and effect of functional groups on surface modification of the spacers please refer section s1 esi for more details the codes and compositions of all coatings are listed in table 1 graphene oxide go was synthesized from graphite powder according to the modified hummer s method kumar et al 2020 the go paste was diluted with di water to obtain a concentration of 0 5 g ml 1 for the go coating suspension an in situ thermal reduction was employed to obtain the rgo coating on the printed surface the suspension of go was coated on the printed surface and the coated sample was placed in a vacuum oven at 120 c for 3 h to obtain the rgo coating the rgo containing pvdf coating suspension denoted as rpvdf was prepared by dispersing 50 wt rgo into 5 wt pvdf solution in dmf note the wt of rgo is relative to the weight of pvdf in dmf solution a fourth coating suspension was prepared by dispersing pristine gn nanosheets in nmp which was denoted as pg the details for the preparation of the rpvdf and pg coating suspensions are provided in section s2 esi the fifth and last coating suspension to be investigated was based on fluorinated silica fs fs sol was initially prepared via a sol gel reaction fig s1 esi a coating suspension of dried fs nanoparticles in nmp was prepared with a nanoparticle loading of 2 mg ml 1 the detailed procedure for the synthesis of fs nanoparticles is included in section s3 esi the synthesis of go and fs nanoparticles was confirmed by atr ftir raman spectroscopy and edx elemental mapping section s4 esi based on the sem images the fs nanoparticles exhibit near spherical structures with nanoscale individual particles and microscale particle networking while the go exhibits a layered structure cf fig s2 esi prior to any surface coating the printed samples were thoroughly washed with di water dried at room temperature rt and further dried in an oven at 70 c for 3 h to eliminate any traces of residual moisture each coating suspension was applied twice onto the surface of a 3d printed sample via the drop casting method a fixed volume 40 µl of the coating solution was evenly spread over the sample surface with a micropipette and then dried at rt the sample was then placed in a vacuum oven at 70 c for 3 h the dried sample was removed from the oven and cooled down to rt this process was repeated to apply the second coating on the same surface of the sample the presence of the different coatings go rgo rpvdf pg or fs applied onto the 3d printed pa samples was confirmed by comparing the raman and atr ftir spectra of these samples with those of the pristine uncoated pa sample cf section s5 esi sem edx analysis was used to further confirm the presence of different coatings on the sample surfaces fig 2 the presence of f 12 27 wt and si 2 31 wt elements in the sem edx spectrum of the fs coated sample fig 2 and the presence of f element 24 51 wt in the rpvdf coated sample fig 2 b serve as an additional confirmation of the successful surface coating of these samples fig 2 f depicts the atomic carbon to oxygen c o ratio for go rgo and pg samples typically the c o ratio increases upon transitioning from go to gn due to the elimination of oxygen containing moieties seo et al 2013 the c o ratio in go and rgo samples was estimated to be 5 0 and 8 2 respectively confirming the loss of oxygen containing moieties up to a certain degree after thermal reduction as anticipated the highest c o ratio 10 5 was obtained for the pg sample based on the antiscaling efficiency under static experiment conditions which will be discussed later the fs coating was identified as the best coating to mitigate scaling deposition on the printed spacer surface hence an extended study was performed to determine the effect of increasing the number of fs coating layers this was done by applying four and six fs coating layers onto the 3d printed surface these are denoted as 4fs and 6fs respectively and their performance was compared to the sample with two fs coating layers 2fs prior to surface characterizations and performance assessment all coated samples were first rinsed with di water the samples were then immersed in di water in a beaker placed on a shaker and gently agitated at 100 rpm for 24 h at rt to wash out the loosely bound excess coating the samples were dried at rt and then oven dried for 3 h at 70 c prior to testing 2 3 surface analysis the coated samples were subjected to sem imaging to obtain the microstructural surface images and sem edx mapping for elemental compositions analysis prior to imaging the samples were sputter coated with a 10 nm layer of au pd the surface finishing of the coated specimen was analyzed based on roughness hydrophobicity and sfe both macroscale and microscale surface roughness were determined the macroscale roughness was measured using 3d profiles generated by 3d digital microscope hirox kh 7700 digital video microscope japan equipped with an extended depth of field 0 08 2 7 mm section s6 esi the microscale surface roughness of the coated 3d printed samples were measured using atomic force microscope afm nano observer csi france with an aluminum coated silicon cantilever ac200ts asylum research the topographic afm images were recorded in the tapping mode for a scanning area of 3 3 µm2 the recorded afm images were post processed using gwyddion software version 2 45 to obtain the roughness parameters the surface wettability was analyzed via a drop shape analysis system easy drop dsa20e krüss germany by measuring the static and dynamic water contact angles the contact angle was determined with a water droplet of 5 µl using the sessile drop method the reported contact angle measurements represent the average of five readings taken at different locations on the sample to ensure values representative of the entire sample the sfe of the coated samples was determined according to the owens wendt method using the contact angles of two liquids with different polarity i e water as polar liquid and glycerol as bipolar liquid kujawa et al 2014 the polar and dispersive components of sfe were calculated according to eqs s1 and s2 in esi 2 4 antiscaling performance of surface coated 3d printed spacer material the antiscaling performance of surface coated 3d printed samples was investigated under two experimental configurations static and dynamic for static batch experiment each surface coated flat sample 2 0 cm2 was placed in a round bottom glass crystallization dish containing 100 ml of 1 9 g l 1 caso4 2h2o solution the crystallization dish with the flat sample and caso4 2h2o solution was kept on a hot plate c mag hs7 ika usa and the solution temperature was maintained at 65 c for 5 h water evaporated from the crystallization dish over the course of the experiment resulting in a continuous heterogeneous nucleation scalant deposition and growth on the surface of the flat sample after 5 h the sample was carefully removed from the crystallization dish the scaled sample was quickly immersed in 20 ml of 2 citric acid solution and ultrasonicated for 30 min to dislodge and dissolve the deposited scalant into the citric acid solution the solution was further diluted with di water for calcium ion analysis using ion chromatography ic ics 5000 thermoscientific usa this experimental protocol allowed for a quick preliminary identification of the best coating for suppressing the attachment of scalant on the 3d printed surface the pearson product moment correlation coefficient was utilized to probe the correlation between the surface properties and the antiscaling performance using the different surface coatings the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated using eq s3 in esi the results from the static experiment indicated that the least deposition of scalant occurred on the fs coated sample as will be discussed later hence the effects of increased fs coating layers were further investigated under static experiment conditions based on the results from the above analyses four coatings of fs were applied via dip coating on the surface of the gyr tclp spacer for the dynamic flow through condition in dcmd the adhesion stability of the fs coating was inspected by performing a leaching test in di water under ultrasonication for 12 h at 40 khz the coated feed spacer was immersed in di water and sonicated in a bath sonicator for 12 h the leaching of the fs nanoparticles from the feed spacer was tested using a particle size analyzer zetapals brookhaven instruments corp usa for the presence of nanoparticles in the supernatant the nanoparticles in the supernatant solution was not detected this observation confirmed a stable adhesion of the coating on the feed spacer the antiscaling performance of fs coated and uncoated spacers was compared in a lab scale dcmd setup the hot feed 1 9 g l 1 caso4 2h2o solution average initial feed conductivity 1709 15 µs cm and cold permeate di water were recirculated in a counter flow mode through a flat sheet ptfe membrane module the effective membrane area was 34 cm2 the height of the flow channels in the md cell was 2 3 mm the temperature of the feed and permeate was set at 65 c and 35 c respectively whereas the feed and permeate recirculation velocity was fixed at 0 1 m s 1 each md test was performed for 15 h with a closed loop feed stream such that the rejected brine was returned to the feed vessel causing an increase of feed concentration as the experiment progressed at the end of each experiment the scaled spacer and membrane coupon were removed from the module gently rinsed with di water and dried at rt for further analysis to extract the deposited scalant from the scaled spacer and membrane coupon the specimens were immersed in 200 ml of 2 citric acid solution and ultrasonicated for 60 min the calcium ion concentration in the extracted solutions was analyzed by ic instrument after the needed dilution with di water moreover the deposition of scalant on the membrane surfaces was visualized using the alizarin red s ars staining technique thomas et al 2019 a small section 2 2 cm2 from the scaled membrane was cut and stained in 2 ars solution ph 4 1 to 4 3 for 30 min a template was applied to cut the membrane sample to ensure that the region of the membrane coupons used for the staining purpose was the same for all md tests optical images were taken of the stained membrane samples for qualitative comparison of membrane scaling 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of coatings on surface finishing the physio chemical properties and the material structure strongly influence the foulant interaction and adhesion onto the surface of a membrane or a spacer choudhury et al 2018 tan et al 2017 the surface roughness wettability and chemistry of these surfaces are therefore prominent characteristics that govern the antifouling behavior zhang et al 2016 fig 3 shows the effect of the five different surface coatings on the roughness and wettability of 3d printed surface the surface coatings did not create a significant variation in the surface roughness at a macroscale level fig 3 c which can be explained on the basis that the amount of coating material was not large enough to completely fill the notches created during the sintering of pa powder but it is interesting to note that the surface coatings caused significant changes in the microscale surface roughness analyzed by afm fig 3 f the fs coating resulted in the highest microscale surface roughness 115 4 nm compared to the uncoated surface 42 5 nm as seen from the sem image of fs coated sample fig 3 h the presence of near spherical fs nanoparticles scattered on the surface imparts a rough micro nano morphological pattern on the surface which leads to an increase in the microscale roughness iacono and jennings 2019 the other surface coatings with the exception of go increased the microscale surface roughness in the order pg 96 0 nm rpvdf 80 1 nm rgo 66 8 nm the increased microscale roughness for the pg sample was attributed to the protrusions and irregular stacking of gn sheets on the surface wang et al 2015 the thermal reduction to create the rgo coating induced atomic rearrangement and considerable disorder in go sheets resulting in increased roughness of the rgo sample bagri et al 2010 the go coating layer lowered the microscale roughness of the uncoated surface to 34 9 nm the surface sem image of go coated sample show a relatively smooth and homogenous morphology with wrinkles fig s5 esi the wettability of the coated printed surfaces based on static water contact angle measurements is illustrated in fig 3 i both chemical composition and surface roughness play key roles in determining the surface wettability the hydrophilicity of the uncoated pa sample with a contact angle of 84 9о was attributed to the water holding amide groups in pa hnilica et al 2014 the smooth coating of go dropped the contact angle to 55 6о by introducing oxygen containing functional groups oh c o cooh and epoxy that promote the water holding capacity of the modified sample surface via hydrogen bonding interactions yu et al 2020 the addition of rgo rpvdf and pg surface coatings increased the surface hydrophobicity as manifested in their water contact angle values of 93 3о 120 3о and 131 8о respectively the progressive absence of oxygen containing functional groups in rgo and gn explains the increased hydrophobicity of rgo and pg coated samples the hydrophobicity with gn is mostly attributed to the weak van der waal s forces at the gn water interface zhao et al 2017 the water contact angle of 3d printed surface after coating of fs nanoparticles increased sharply to 134 2о indicating that the surface hydrophobicity was increased greatly by the coating of fs nanoparticle the presence of f element with considerably low polarizability value contributes to the increased hydrophobicity in the fs coated sample the observed trend in surface hydrophobicity with the various coatings closely mimics the microscale roughness trend outlined above the positive correlation between hydrophobicity and microscale roughness specifically for the micro nanoscale hierarchy imposed by the fs coating can be explained based on the cassie baxter model the model stipulates that the increase in water contact angle on a rough micro patterned surface is attributed to the large amount of the entrapped air within the cavities formed by surface asperities si and guo 2015 the dynamic water contact angle measurements cf fig s6 esi of fs coated sample displayed a small decrease of only 12о compared to the 36о drop for the uncoated sample after a duration of 8 5 min indicating the relative stability of the hydrophobic feature exerted by the fs coating the sfe of solid surfaces serves as an indicator of the intermolecular or interfacial attractive forces and plays a crucial role in the nucleation of salt crystals on the surface based on the classical nucleation theory as will be discussed in section 3 2 the sfe of a solid surface γs is a sum of its polar γs p and dispersive γs d components the polar component includes the polar hydrogen inductive and acid base interactions while the dispersive component represents the strength of intermolecular interactions london forces kujawa et al 2014 a comparison of sfe and its components for different surface coatings is shown in fig 4 a the results indicate that the available functional groups on the surface of the coated samples influenced their sfe the go coating boosted the sfe with a considerable increase in the polar component the polar component fraction i e γs p γs in go sample increased to 0 66 compared to 0 55 in the uncoated sample on the contrary rgo rpvdf pg and fs coatings progressively reduced the sfe with a concomitant increase in the fraction of the dispersive component as represented by the drop in γs p γs ratio to 0 1 0 42 fig 4 b illustrates the difference in the interaction of a polar liquid like water with the uncoated sample with relatively high γs p γs ratio and fs coated sample with lower γs p γs ratio the decrease in polar sfe component with fs coating curbs the interaction between the polar liquid and the solid surface consequently the scaling propensity of fs coated surface is lowered the fs coating resulted in the largest reduction in sfe up to 92 in comparison to the uncoated sample the presence of f element in fs which is characterized by low polarizability due to the complete octet of electrons in their 2s2p6 orbitals leads to the incorporation of cfn bonds on the surface azimi et al 2014 the sfe has been reported to decrease in the order ch2 ch3 cf2 cf2h cf3 hare et al 1954 which further explains the reduced sfe for fs coated sample the overall decrease in sfe along with the reduction in the dispersive component is a favorable feature for antiscaling surfaces azimi et al 2014 3 2 antiscaling efficiency of surface coatings the deposition of calcium on the surface of uncoated and coated samples under static calcium sulfate scaling conditions is shown in fig 5 a the variation in the calcium deposition serves as an indicator of the influence of surface coating on the attachment of scalant and thus its antiscaling efficiency fs coating provided the best antiscaling performance by causing the highest reduction 80 in the deposition of calcium from 0 50 mg cm 2 on the uncoated sample to 0 09 mg cm 2 on the fs sample as discussed above the fs coating considerably increased the micro roughness which in turn contributed to the improved hydrophobicity by air entrapment within the surface cavities brassard et al 2011 the presence of surface bound trapped air is evidenced by the silvery and reflective appearance of the submerged coated sample cf fig s7 esi the sfe of the solid surface plays a crucial role in the nucleation of salt crystals on the surface according to the classical nucleation theory the free energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation depends on the critical radius of the scale nuclei the contact angle of scale nuclei with substrate the interfacial energies of scale nuclei substrate scale nuclei solution and substrate solution azimi et al 2014 low sfe of the solid reduces the affinity and interaction between the solid and scalant which favorably imposes a greater energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation azimi et al 2014 the decreased sfe reduces the nucleation potential on the surfaces while the entrapped air might reduce the attachment of scale nuclei therefore the reduced scaling on fs sample is attributed to the synergistic interplay of microscale roughness induced hydrophobicity and low sfe apart from go coating for which the deposition of calcium increased to 0 74 mg cm 2 the other surface coatings also repressed the deposition of calcium in the order pg 0 13 mg cm 2 rpvdf 0 14 mg cm 2 rgo 0 22 mg cm 2 the examination of go rgo and pg coating performance further supports the effect of the surface chemistry on scaling go enriched with carboxylic cooh groups fig s8 esi easily complexes with calcium ions thus facilitating heterogeneous crystallization and increased scaling tong et al 2019 xie and gray 2016 on the other hand rgo coating with predominantly hydroxyl oh groups displayed reduced scaling due to the low affinity of calcium ions with hydroxyl groups tong et al 2019 xie and gray 2016 lastly the gn coated pg sample without any functional groups exhibited lower scaling than the go and rgo coated samples the pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the influence of surface properties on calcium deposition fig 5 b illustrates the strength of pearson correlation coefficients for surface properties sfe roughness microscale and macroscale and hydrophobicity with the deposition of calcium on the different surfaces the macroscale roughness displayed a moderate negative correlation with an r value of 0 421 while the microscale roughness showed a strong negative correlation with scaling r 0 901 sfe and hydrophobicity r 0 948 and 0 945 respectively exhibited the strongest correlation with scaling this analysis further exemplifies that the reduced scaling achieved by fs coating is attributed to the combined effect of its reduced sfe and increased hydrophobicity it is worth mentioning that previous studies show that spacer surface properties also play an important role in controlling biofouling in a study that compared the biofouling resistance of commercial polypropylene spacer with different surface coatings it was found that polypropylene spacer inherently have good anti adhesive property due to its near ideal sfe rice et al 2018 hence a surface modification with biocidal surface coating was found to be most effective for biofouling control in another study modification of feed spacer by coating with crystalline zno nanorods was reported to achieve biocidal activity owing to a combination of abrasive surface of the crystalline nanorods hydrophobic repulsion and cumulative oxidation thamaraiselvan et al 2019 as fs coating was established thus far as the best antiscaling coating for 3d printed surfaces an extended study was carried out to examine the effects of multiple fs coating layers in addition to the base case reported thus far with two fs coating layers 2fs two other samples with four 4fs and six 6fs coating layers were also studied the top surface sem images of 2fs 4fs and 6fs layers coated samples fig 6 demonstrate the increased deposition of fs on the surface with increased number of coating layers sem edx mapping revealed an increase of f and si content to 6 and 14 respectively in the 4fs sample compared to 3 and 7 in the 2fs sample fig 6 the 6fs and 4fs samples had nearly similar composition of f and si elements which suggests that the most considerable improvement in fs nanoparticle surface loading is achieved up to four layers of fs coating a moderate increase in sample hydrophobicity was observed with increasing the number of fs coating layers as the water contact angle increased from 134 2 in 2fs to 140 1 and 143 1o in 4fs and 6fs respectively fig 7 a all three samples displayed a consistent stability of the hydrophobic nature of the fs coatings as the drop in water contact angle ranged from 12 to 14 over 8 min fig 7 b a preliminary examination of the stability of 4fs coated sample in particular was performed based on contact angle measurement the 4fs coated sample was immersed in di water and subjected to ultrasonication for 12 h at 40 khz the contact angle of the sample was then measured after drying at ambient temperature after the 12 h ultrasonic treatment the static contact angle of the sample 137 2 2 0 was comparable to the initial contact angle of 140 1 2 5 prior to ultrasonication with the increased number of fs coating layers a slight reduction in the total sfe was observed which could be attributed to the increased loading of fs on the surface of the coated sample however the γs p γs ratio for both 4fs and 6fs was equal 0 39 suggesting a low dispersive component of the total sfe fig 7 c the calcium deposition analysis of the scaled samples from the static experiment showed that a 55 reduction in scalant deposition was achieved with 4fs fig 7 d however the antiscaling performance of 4fs and 6fs was comparable suggesting the lack of improvement beyond four layers of fs coatings 3 3 antiscaling performance in dcmd the antiscaling performance of fs coated 3d printed spacer was tested using a lab scale dcmd unit based on the understanding of the surface properties and the discussed superior performance of the 4fs coating four layers of fs coating was applied onto the 3d printed spacer henceforth referred as fs spacer the coating on the spacer was qualitatively confirmed with sem edx analysis fig s9 esi the dcmd performance using both uncoated uc and fs spacers was assessed using calcium sulfate solution 1 9 g l 1 as feed and under similar dcmd operating conditions fig 8 presents the md flux and conductivity data over a 15 h experiment using both spacers the observed two stage permeate flux trend with a relatively stable flux in the first stage followed by a dramatic drop in the second stage is consistent with the literature qu et al 2020 zou et al 2018 the rapid flux decline in the second stage is attributed to the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of caso4 on the membrane surface which imparts additional resistance to heat and mass transfer in md and reduces the open membrane pore area available for water vapor transport zou et al 2018 the scaling induction time is defined as the point at which the flux begins to decline christie et al 2020 compared to the uc spacer where the flux begins to nosedive after 12 h of operation the fs spacer delays the flux decline by an additional 2 h and a sharp drop was observed only after 14 h of operation fig 8 a thus this is indicative of the delayed scaling induction time with the use of surface coated spacer the feed conductivity trend was similar for both spacers indicating the buildup of calcium sulfate concentration in the feed as the experiment progressed however the permeate conductivity surged 100 fold from 4 2 to 413 6 μs cm 1 for the uc spacer fig 8 b concomitant with an apparent spike in flux at 14 h this latter observation is a well documented indication of membrane wetting gryta 2009 interestingly the membrane wetting occurred only when using the uc spacer whereas the use of the fs spacer caused only a marginal increase in permeate conductivity which reached only 32 μs cm 1 at the end of the test the fs coating substantially reduced the attachment of calcium deposits on the spacer to 0 24 mg cm 2 a reduction by 74 compared to the uncoated spacer 0 95 mg cm 2 fig 9 a digital photographic images of the autopsied spacers at the end of dcmd experiment fig 9 b show a clear reduction in scalant deposition on the fs spacer the fs coating of the spacer also resulted in a 60 reduction in calcium deposition on the membrane fig 9 c the images of the autopsied membranes with ars staining solution help to visually appreciate the extent of scale reduction on the membrane when the fs spacer was used fig 9 d to the best of authors knowledge this is the first study that reports the reduction in membrane scaling achieved by surface modification of spacers the heightened energy barrier for crystal nucleation imparted by the reduced sfe of fs coating reduces the adhesion strength of the calcium sulfate crystals on the spacer surface the combined low adhesion strength and shear forces under dynamic flow conditions cause the scalants to be easily removed from the fs spacer this in turn likely interferes with the stable growth of crystals onto the free membrane area resulting in the observed reduced scaling upon using the fs spacer these findings depict enthralling prospects and merit further investigations to affirm the effectiveness of surface modified spacers as a scaling control strategy for real world membrane applications long term experimentation with actual feed waters laden with a plethora of scalants as well as mechanistic and parametric investigations are planned as future studies to evaluate the performance of antiscaling spacers under co precipitation conditions and interactive influence of organic and biological foulants recently researchers have performed in situ monitoring of scaling development in md using optical coherence tomography oct fortunato et al 2018 lee et al 2018 thus in a future study in situ monitoring with oct will be explored to understand the difference in scaling layer development in the bulk free membrane region away from spacer strands and within the membrane spacer contact points when using a coated and uncoated 3d spacer technical viability of the antiscaling spacers would also consider the impact of channel pressure drop and long term stability of fs coating with associated cost implications it is well understood that scaling is inevitable with long term membrane plant operation however what can be achieved with a well designed antiscaling spacer is a considerably delayed onset of membrane scaling this then would translate to sustained water flux over extended period of plant operation reduced cleaning frequency reduced consumption of eutrophication causing antiscalants increased membrane life and the associated cost savings 4 conclusions this study highlights how fluorinated silica fs surface coating on 3d printed spacers enhances the spacer s resistance to scaling and can potentially serve as an antiscaling strategy for md operation the fs surface coating was identified as the best option following a preliminary evaluation of five different surface coatings to alleviate scaling on 3d printed spacers the other surface coatings were based on graphene oxide reduced graphene oxide rgo graphene sheets and a dispersion of rgo in pvdf polymer solution the coatings on the 3d printed surface altered key features thereof such as wettability roughness and surface free energy the coating of fs nanoparticles on the 3d printed surface imbued micro and nano textured features on the surface this led to increased microscale roughness and consequently enhanced hydrophobicity as explained by the cassie baxter model the implantation of fluorine atoms with low polarizability not only lowered the surface free energy but also decreased the polar component of the sfe this limited the interaction between the scalants in solution and the spacer surface consequently fs coated 3d printed spacer tested with calcium sulfate solution as a feed in dcmd setup resulted in 74 decrease in the attachment of scalant on the spacer compared to the uncoated spacer over a 15 h experiment the fs coating also resulted in a 60 lower scale deposition on the membrane itself the fs nanomaterial coating discussed in this study is a promising approach to minimize spacer induced fouling a significant problem in membrane based water and wastewater applications the findings could also motivate researchers to consider a paradigm shift from a membrane centric to a spacer centric approach to maximize the potential of surface chemistry based strategies for scaling control furthermore the insights from this study can also help in developing antiscaling surfaces for 3d printing applications in other fields declaration of competing
