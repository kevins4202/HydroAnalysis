sufficient irrigation whereas plant growth was ameliorated with a small yield reduction when ltai was controlled at 60 fc chen et al 2016 thus determination of the appropriate lower soil water threshold for alternating irrigated side of the root zones is important for making full use of the advantages of apri on improving wue however little attention has been paid to the regulatory effects of ltais on crop growth and yield performance under apdi in field conditions this study was carried out to investigate the effects of different ltais in the previously dry root zone on the growth quality and iwue of tomato a common greenhouse vegetable under apdi the outcome of this study was expected to provide theoretical support and basis for achieving more efficient water management in tomato production materials and methods experimental site the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in xuji village 116 46 e 33 58 n duji district huaibei china from march to july of 2016 the site is a typical warm temperate humid climate with an annual average air temperature of 14 4 c frost free period of 202 days relative humidity of 71 and 2316 annual sunshine hours the temperature in the greenhouse ranged from 16 35 during the experiment the soil was sandy loam and its basic physical and chemical properties of the soil were shown in table 1 experimental design the experimental factors included drip irrigation amounts drip irrigation modes and ltais there were a total of eight treatments six of which were alternate partial root zone drip irrigation apdi coded as follows as80 as70 as60 ad80 ad70 and ad60 in the treatment codes a represented apdi s and d represented sufficient and deficit irrigation respectively and the numbers 60 70 and 80 indicated the ltais in the dry root zone controlled at 80 70 and 60 fc respectively another two treatments were added coded as csd and cdd indicating conventional drip irrigation with sufficient or deficit water supply respectively the values of the ltais were the average of soil moisture measured at different points of the dry root zone for apdi treatments or whole root zone for the conventional drip irrigation treatments each treatment was repeated in three plots 24 plots in total all plots were randomly arranged in the greenhouse each plot was 1 8 m wide and 3 6 m long with an area of 6 5 m2 fertilizers were supplied at the rate of 240 kg n ha 1as urea 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 as calcium superphosphate and 150 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulfate respectively a plastic film was buried vertically 60 cm depth between the plots as the isolation barrier for avoiding water infiltration on march 27 2016 three rows eight seedlings per row of 54 day old tomato seedlings lycopersicon esculentum l cv zhongyan 958 a local variety with uniform size were transplanted for each plot the row spacing is 60 cm and plant spacing 45 cm a total of 27 8 mm water was applied before irrigation treatment different water treatments were initiated on april 12 sixteen days after transplanting dat and ended on june 22 86 dat 2016 there were 18 irrigation events happened after irrigation treatment the drip irrigation system was composed of a main pipeline water delivery system and plot water delivery systems the former contained a laminated filter a solenoid valve main and submain 25 mm in diameter pipe lines the water delivery system in each experimental plot contained a 1 8 m long submain pipe connected with polyethene pe drip pipes 20 mm in diameter through switches each drip pipe was installed with pressure compensated drip emitters 2 l h 1 netafim israel at an interval of 45 cm for conventional drip irrigation treatment only one pe drip pipe was laid 3 cm away from plant roots for each plant row totally three pe pipes a plot for apdi treatment two pe drip pipes were laid for each row of plants 15 cm away from plant roots in each side totally six pe pipes a plot soil moisture in 0 60 cm was examined using pre buried tdr tubes coupled with a portable tdr soil moisture meter for the 0 20 top soil trime pico iph tdr imko germany the value of the soil water content in the 0 20 cm was an average of several readings from different points in the layer when the soil moisture content of the csd treatment decreased to 80 fc irrigation was carried out for all treatments the calculation of the irrigation amount up to 95 fc for the csd treatment was referred to our previous report liu et al 2020 in a brief the surface area of the plot is 6 48 m3 wetting proportion 0 8 the depth of the planned wetting layer for csd treatment was 0 20 cm for the seedling stage or 0 30 cm after the flowering stage the deficit irrigation treatments including cdd ad80 ad70 ad60 received 65 of irrigation water of csd for apdi treatment each drip pipe was manually switched on or off letting the water irrigated only to one side of the plant row at the next irrigation instance drip irrigation continued on the previously irrigated side if the soil moisture on the dry side had not decreased to the controlled ltai value otherwise the irrigation would be shifted to the dry side allowing the previously irrigated side to dry the total irrigation amount was 234 0 mm or 161 1 mm per plot for sufficient or deficit irrigation treatment respectively the deficit irrigation saved totally 31 2 irrigation water compared with the sufficient irrigation samplings measurements and analyses determination of plant height and stem diameter the plant height was measured with a tape on may 11 45 dat and july 12 107 dat the diameter of the stem 3 cm above the ground was measured with a 0 01 mm precision digital vernier caliper each value represented the plot was averaged from 9 plants determination of yield iwue and shoot biomass tomato fruits from the second to the seventh plants of each row were harvested at maturity and their fresh weights were recorded separately for each plant all plants were harvested 107 dat july 12 2016 proportional sub samples of stems and leaves were weighted and oven dried at 70 c for 3 4 days the shoot weight of a plant was calculated as the sum of the dry weight of stem and leaves the harvest index was obtained by dividing the fruit dry weight by the total plant dry weight root collection and determination nine roots from the second fourth and sixth plants in each row were selected the soil around the stem in a range of 45 45 cm2 was excavated to a depth of 0 60 cm in each 20 cm depth per layer and all visible roots were picked out by tweezers the root parameters were acquired by scanning and image analysis as described in our previously report zhang et al 2014 determination of fruit quality when ripe two batches of six fruits were randomly collected from the second or fourth tassels from different plants respectively the content of reducing sugars was determined using the 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid reagent colorimetric method teixeira et al 2012 soluble sugar was measured using the anthrone colorimetric method organic acids were titrated with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh and calculated as equivalents of citric acid expressed as a percentage of fresh mass chen et al 2013 the sugar acid ratio was calculated as the ratio of the reducing sugar and the organic acids vitamin c was measured using the extraction molybdate blue spectrophotometric method wang et al 2015 average values of the two batches of fruits were used to determine the fruit quality parameters statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine the differences among treatments with ibm spss statistics version 23 0 ibm armonk ny usa figures were made using sigmaplot 14 0 software systat software san jose ca usa results effects of ltais on root growth and distribution the values of all the examined root morphological parameters decreased significantly under deficit irrigation than these under sufficient irrigation table 2 compared with csd or cdd at the same irrigation level the total root biomass length surface area and volume tended to be increased gradually under apdi with ltais at 80 and 70 fc the highest values appeared at 70 fc and then decreased with ltai decreased to 60 fc irrespective of irrigation levels compared with the conventional drip irrigation the average diameter of the roots decreased under the apdi treatments and decreased further as ltai decreased at the same irrigation level table 2 the distribution of dry root biomass and root length was examined it was found that tomato roots were mainly concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil layer accounting for more than 90 of the whole root system fig 1 root biomass and length in the 0 20 cm soil decreased by 15 6 and 28 2 respectively under deficit irrigation compared with sufficient irrigation treatments root biomass and length increased gradually at the sequence of conventional drip irrigation apdi with ltai at 80 and 70 fc and then decreased at apdi with ltai at 60 fc at the same irrigation amount fig 1a b in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers significant difference in root weight was observed only in the 20 40 cm under sufficient irrigation fig 1a as for root length in the soil layers of 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm as70 and ad70 kept the highest among the treatments at the same irrigation level fig 1b effects of ltais on shoot growth and root to shoot ratio plant height decreased by an average of 12 3 on the 45 dat and 107 dat in the treatments with deficit irrigation compared with sufficient irrigation fig 2 a on 107 dat the heights of the plants under apdi with ltais at 70 fc and 60 fc were lower than that under conventional drip irrigation at the same irrigation amount reducing the irrigation amount didn t significantly decrease the stem diameter on the 45 dat but it did on the 107 dat fig 2b apdi with ltais at 80 and 70 fc increased stem diameter gradually as compared with the conventional drip irrigation at the same irrigation amount however stem diameter decreased significantly under apdi with ltais at 60 fc than 70 fc especially on 107 dat fig 2b under sufficient irrigation there was no significant difference in shoot biomass among treatments table 3 the shoot biomass reduced significantly under deficit irrigation the biomass of ad70 and ad60 was significantly lower than that of cdd under apdi root to shoot ratio tended to be greater when compared with that under conventional drip irrigation the root to shoot ratios of as70 ad70 and ad60 were significantly higher than that of csd and cdd at the same irrigation levels respectively in addition the root to shoot ratio was not significantly affected by irrigation amount under the same irrigation mode table 3 effects of ltais on fruit yield iwue and harvest index under sufficient irrigation fruit yield and thus iwue increased only in as70 by 6 4 compared with csd whereas the harvest index showed no significant difference among the treatments table 3 fruit yield decreased by 11 4 on average whereas iwue increased by 28 7 under deficit irrigation compared with the sufficient irrigation treatments compared with cdd the yield and thus iwue increased by 8 6 and 17 4 in ad80 and ad70 respectively in addition the yield of ad70 showed no significant difference but the iwue increased by 44 9 as compared with that of the csd whereas the yield and iwue of ad60 decreased compared with that of ad70 and showed no significant difference compared with cdd the harvest index of cdd was significantly lower than that of csd indicating fruit development was limited by deficit irrigation under deficit irrigation as compared with cdd the harvest index increased under apdi with the highest increment 13 4 occurred in ad70 table 3 effects of ltais on fruit quality under sufficient irrigation the contents of reducing sugar except as80 soluble sugar and vitamin c in fruits increased significantly under apdi the highest values appeared in the as70 treatment the contents of reducing sugar soluble sugar and vitamin c in fruits of as70 increased by 8 8 15 5 and 131 7 compared with that of csd respectively under apdi only the as60 treatment significantly decreased the organic acid content compared with that of csd the sugar acid ratio in as70 and as60 increased by 21 5 and 24 5 compared with that of csd respectively table 4 under deficit irrigation the content of reducing sugar soluble sugar vitamin c and the sugar acid ratio increased significantly but the content of organic acid was not significantly affected as compared with its counterpart treatment under sufficient irrigation under deficit irrigation and compared with cdd apdi significantly increased reducing sugar except ad80 soluble sugar vitamin c content and the sugar acid ratio the ad70 treatment had the highest values of reducing sugar and soluble sugar among the treatments under deficit irrigation the content of organic acid decreased significantly only in ad60 compared with cdd when the ltai decreased from 70 fc to 60 fc the content of soluble sugar decreased whereas the content of vitamin c increased while the reducing sugar organic acid and the sugar acid ratio remained unchanged table 4 discussion it is well established that apri could improve wue and save substantial irrigation water with no significant yield reduction kang et al 2004 dodd et al 2006 liu et al 2020 however in the present study the effects of apdi on iwue and yield were modulated by irrigation amount and ltais table 3 the yield and iwue increased only 6 4 for as70 treatment whereas 8 6 and 17 4 for the ad80 and ad70 treatments compared with the conventional drip irrigation at sufficient or deficit levels respectively however there was no significant difference in the yield and iwue between the apdi with ltai at 60 fc and the conventional drip irrigation treatment at the same irrigation level table 3 zhang et al 2014 found that the advantage of apri in promoting yield was more obvious under deficit irrigation this could be attributed to the difference in water infiltration and distribution under different irrigation amounts the lateral infiltration and distribution of water from the irrigated side to the non irrigated side depends on the irrigation amount and the soil type kang and zhang 2004 shao et al 2008 for apri water infiltration to the dry side was obvious under high irrigation levels but limited under deficit irrigation leading to obvious differences in water content in different root zones under deficit irrigation lehrsch et al 2000 shao et al 2008 aba generated from roots exposed to dry soil and thereafter from the wilting lower and older leaves could restrict stomatal conductance as well as shoot growth sobeih et al 2004 in accordance with this reduced shoot height induced by deficit irrigation and apri was observed in the present study fig 2a restricted shoot growth induced more assimilate allocated to roots resulting in promoted root growth chen et al 2016 however exposure of roots to drying soil may cause anatomical damages which occur concurrently with decreased hydraulic conductivity in roots north and nobel 1991 these changes decreased the capacity of roots in sensing and responding to soil drying however after a certain period of soil drying repeated cycles of alternating drying and re watering induced by apri could both stimulate the compensatory growth of roots and induce new root generation as well as root hair development root vigor and hydraulic conductivity was also enhanced under apri li et al 2011 chen et al 2016 in accordance with this in the present study enhanced root growth was observed under apri especially in as70 and ad70 treatments leading to the increased root to shoot ratio in as70 and ad70 treated plants compared with the corresponding conventional drip irrigation treatment tables 2 and 3 in addition the root diameter decreased with decreasing ltai table 2 indicating more fine roots developed under apri such new roots are able to restore anatomical structure and hydraulic conductivity and succulent enough to sense further soil drying which allow them to take up the nutrients and water from the rewetted soil zone north and nobel 1991 in addition our previous research showed that apri caused root distribution deeper in the soil profile wang et al 2014 2019 zhang et al 2014 which is in consistent with the present study fig 1a b this is beneficial for plants to absorb nutrients and water from the soil root growth decreased in 60 fc as60 ad60 compared with that in 70 fc treatments as70 ad70 table 2 fig 1 it was expected that exposure of roots to prolonged or severely drying soil may cause anatomical structure deterioration and may not be conductive for recovery of root function and compensatory growth north and nobel 1991 our previous experiment with potted plants indicated that severe water stress imposed by a lower ltai at 40 fc impeded root growth decreased root vigor and inhibited photosynthesis thereby resulting in a significant yield loss of 27 whereas yield loss was only 6 1 with ltai at 60 fc chen et al 2016 the harvest index showed no significant difference among treatments under sufficient irrigation but increased gradually at the sequence of the ad80 and ad70 treatments compared with that of cdd under deficit irrigation table 3 kirda et al 2004 found that the aba concentration in leaf tissue under apri was consistently the highest among all the treatments throughout the tomato growth season elevated aba concentration was suggested to play a vital role in enhancing carbon remobilization thus increasing yield as well as the harvest index under water stress conditions yang et al 2000 2004 however severe water stress on plant could reduce biomass accumulation induce severe early senescence reduce the filling rate and shorten the filling period leading to a decreased yield and harvest index yang et al 2000 farooq et al 2014 in this study apdi under deficit irrigation increased aba content in the shoot data not shown also see kang et al 2004 dodd et al 2006 whereas ltai at 60 fc under deficit irrigation ad60 treatment exposed severe drought stress and damage to roots and the plant leading to decreased yield and harvest index tables 2 and 3 intensive studies showed that apri could improve fruit quality both in nutritional and health related metabolites kirda et al 2004 du et al 2008 jovanovic and stikic 2018 in accordance with these findings fruit quality in terms of reducing sugar total soluble sugar vc and the sugar acid ratio was improved under apri at both deficit and sufficient irrigation in present study table 4 however little attention had been paid to the underlying mechanisms for the improved quality induced by apri from a metabolic and molecular perspective till now jovanovic and stikic 2018 it has been suggested that a higher synthesis and accumulation of photoassimilates and metabolites and enhanced transfer of these assimilates to fruits together with changed metabolic pathways improved fruit quality jovanovic and stikic 2018 while the yield was not significantly different most of the quality parameters observed in the present study were higher in as80 as60 and ad60 compared with the corresponding conventional drip irrigation treatment with the same irrigation amounts csd cdd respectively indicating that tomato fruit quality was sensitive to the irrigation mode and ltais more than the yield in the present study fruit quality improved further at lower ltais consistent with our previous findings chen et al 2016 however in the present study all treatments were irrigated based on a criterion for the csd some treatments probably endured an additional stress which affected yield plant development and water use further researchers on the effects of full replenishment of evapotranspiration to the dry root zone under apdi with different ltais are needed conclusions alternate partial root zone drip irrigation apdi combined by alternate partial root zone irrigation apri and drip irrigation is an efficient way to conduct apri and has great potential in saving irrigation water and improving iwue this study showed that to take full advantage of this technology the soil water content should be controlled properly results showed that irrigation altered to the previously dry root zone soil when its water content declined to 70 of field capacity fc was the best irrigation management practice under apdi apdi with a ltai setting at 70 fc promoted yield formation and improved fruit quality especially under deficit irrigation compared with the conventional sufficient irrigation treatments csd ad70 saved 32 1 of the total irrigation water without significant yield reduction ad70 treatments increased root growth root to shoot ratio harvest index and thus yield formation by 20 9 compared with conventional drip irrigation under deficit irrigation in addition fruit quality was significantly improved in ad70 however apdi with ltai set higher or lower than 70 fc had the risk of diminishing the advantages in yield improvement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

for the csd treatment was referred to our previous report liu et al 2020 in a brief the surface area of the plot is 6 48 m3 wetting proportion 0 8 the depth of the planned wetting layer for csd treatment was 0 20 cm for the seedling stage or 0 30 cm after the flowering stage the deficit irrigation treatments including cdd ad80 ad70 ad60 received 65 of irrigation water of csd for apdi treatment each drip pipe was manually switched on or off letting the water irrigated only to one side of the plant row at the next irrigation instance drip irrigation continued on the previously irrigated side if the soil moisture on the dry side had not decreased to the controlled ltai value otherwise the irrigation would be shifted to the dry side allowing the previously irrigated side to dry the total irrigation amount was 234 0 mm or 161 1 mm per plot for sufficient or deficit irrigation treatment respectively the deficit irrigation saved totally 31 2 irrigation water compared with the sufficient irrigation samplings measurements and analyses determination of plant height and stem diameter the plant height was measured with a tape on may 11 45 dat and july 12 107 dat the diameter of the stem 3 cm above the ground was measured with a 0 01 mm precision digital vernier caliper each value represented the plot was averaged from 9 plants determination of yield iwue and shoot biomass tomato fruits from the second to the seventh plants of each row were harvested at maturity and their fresh weights were recorded separately for each plant all plants were harvested 107 dat july 12 2016 proportional sub samples of stems and leaves were weighted and oven dried at 70 c for 3 4 days the shoot weight of a plant was calculated as the sum of the dry weight of stem and leaves the harvest index was obtained by dividing the fruit dry weight by the total plant dry weight root collection and determination nine roots from the second fourth and sixth plants in each row were selected the soil around the stem in a range of 45 45 cm2 was excavated to a depth of 0 60 cm in each 20 cm depth per layer and all visible roots were picked out by tweezers the root parameters were acquired by scanning and image analysis as described in our previously report zhang et al 2014 determination of fruit quality when ripe two batches of six fruits were randomly collected from the second or fourth tassels from different plants respectively the content of reducing sugars was determined using the 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid reagent colorimetric method teixeira et al 2012 soluble sugar was measured using the anthrone colorimetric method organic acids were titrated with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh and calculated as equivalents of citric acid expressed as a percentage of fresh mass chen et al 2013 the sugar acid ratio was calculated as the ratio of the reducing sugar and the organic acids vitamin c was measured using the extraction molybdate blue spectrophotometric method wang et al 2015 average values of the two batches of fruits were used to determine the fruit quality parameters statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine the differences among treatments with ibm spss statistics version 23 0 ibm armonk ny usa figures were made using sigmaplot 14 0 software systat software san jose ca usa results effects of ltais on root growth and distribution the values of all the examined root morphological parameters decreased significantly under deficit irrigation than these under sufficient irrigation table 2 compared with csd or cdd at the same irrigation level the total root biomass length surface area and volume tended to be increased gradually under apdi with ltais at 80 and 70 fc the highest values appeared at 70 fc and then decreased with ltai decreased to 60 fc irrespective of irrigation levels compared with the conventional drip irrigation the average diameter of the roots decreased under the apdi treatments and decreased further as ltai decreased at the same irrigation level table 2 the distribution of dry root biomass and root length was examined it was found that tomato roots were mainly concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil layer accounting for more than 90 of the whole root system fig 1 root biomass and length in the 0 20 cm soil decreased by 15 6 and 28 2 respectively under deficit irrigation compared with sufficient irrigation treatments root biomass and length increased gradually at the sequence of conventional drip irrigation apdi with ltai at 80 and 70 fc and then decreased at apdi with ltai at 60 fc at the same irrigation amount fig 1a b in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers significant difference in root weight was observed only in the 20 40 cm under sufficient irrigation fig 1a as for root length in the soil layers of 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm as70 and ad70 kept the highest among the treatments at the same irrigation level fig 1b effects of ltais on shoot growth and root to shoot ratio plant height decreased by an average of 12 3 on the 45 dat and 107 dat in the treatments with deficit irrigation compared with sufficient irrigation fig 2 a on 107 dat the heights of the plants under apdi with ltais at 70 fc and 60 fc were lower than that under conventional drip irrigation at the same irrigation amount reducing the irrigation amount didn t significantly decrease the stem diameter on the 45 dat but it did on the 107 dat fig 2b apdi with ltais at 80 and 70 fc increased stem diameter gradually as compared with the conventional drip irrigation at the same irrigation amount however stem diameter decreased significantly under apdi with ltais at 60 fc than 70 fc especially on 107 dat fig 2b under sufficient irrigation there was no significant difference in shoot biomass among treatments table 3 the shoot biomass reduced significantly under deficit irrigation the biomass of ad70 and ad60 was significantly lower than that of cdd under apdi root to shoot ratio tended to be greater when compared with that under conventional drip irrigation the root to shoot ratios of as70 ad70 and ad60 were significantly higher than that of csd and cdd at the same irrigation levels respectively in addition the root to shoot ratio was not significantly affected by irrigation amount under the same irrigation mode table 3 effects of ltais on fruit yield iwue and harvest index under sufficient irrigation fruit yield and thus iwue increased only in as70 by 6 4 compared with csd whereas the harvest index showed no significant difference among the treatments table 3 fruit yield decreased by 11 4 on average whereas iwue increased by 28 7 under deficit irrigation compared with the sufficient irrigation treatments compared with cdd the yield and thus iwue increased by 8 6 and 17 4 in ad80 and ad70 respectively in addition the yield of ad70 showed no significant difference but the iwue increased by 44 9 as compared with that of the csd whereas the yield and iwue of ad60 decreased compared with that of ad70 and showed no significant difference compared with cdd the harvest index of cdd was significantly lower than that of csd indicating fruit development was limited by deficit irrigation under deficit irrigation as compared with cdd the harvest index increased under apdi with the highest increment 13 4 occurred in ad70 table 3 effects of ltais on fruit quality under sufficient irrigation the contents of reducing sugar except as80 soluble sugar and vitamin c in fruits increased significantly under apdi the highest values appeared in the as70 treatment the contents of reducing sugar soluble sugar and vitamin c in fruits of as70 increased by 8 8 15 5 and 131 7 compared with that of csd respectively under apdi only the as60 treatment significantly decreased the organic acid content compared with that of csd the sugar acid ratio in as70 and as60 increased by 21 5 and 24 5 compared with that of csd respectively table 4 under deficit irrigation the content of reducing sugar soluble sugar vitamin c and the sugar acid ratio increased significantly but the content of organic acid was not significantly affected as compared with its counterpart treatment under sufficient irrigation under deficit irrigation and compared with cdd apdi significantly increased reducing sugar except ad80 soluble sugar vitamin c content and the sugar acid ratio the ad70 treatment had the highest values of reducing sugar and soluble sugar among the treatments under deficit irrigation the content of organic acid decreased significantly only in ad60 compared with cdd when the ltai decreased from 70 fc to 60 fc the content of soluble sugar decreased whereas the content of vitamin c increased while the reducing sugar organic acid and the sugar acid ratio remained unchanged table 4 discussion it is well established that apri could improve wue and save substantial irrigation water with no significant yield reduction kang et al 2004 dodd et al 2006 liu et al 2020 however in the present study the effects of apdi on iwue and yield were modulated by irrigation amount and ltais table 3 the yield and iwue increased only 6 4 for as70 treatment whereas 8 6 and 17 4 for the ad80 and ad70 treatments compared with the conventional drip irrigation at sufficient or deficit levels respectively however there was no significant difference in the yield and iwue between the apdi with ltai at 60 fc and the conventional drip irrigation treatment at the same irrigation level table 3 zhang et al 2014 found that the advantage of apri in promoting yield was more obvious under deficit irrigation this could be attributed to the difference in water infiltration and distribution under different irrigation amounts the lateral infiltration and distribution of water from the irrigated side to the non irrigated side depends on the irrigation amount and the soil type kang and zhang 2004 shao et al 2008 for apri water infiltration to the dry side was obvious under high irrigation levels but limited under deficit irrigation leading to obvious differences in water content in different root zones under deficit irrigation lehrsch et al 2000 shao et al 2008 aba generated from roots exposed to dry soil and thereafter from the wilting lower and older leaves could restrict stomatal conductance as well as shoot growth sobeih et al 2004 in accordance with this reduced shoot height induced by deficit irrigation and apri was observed in the present study fig 2a restricted shoot growth induced more assimilate allocated to roots resulting in promoted root growth chen et al 2016 however exposure of roots to drying soil may cause anatomical damages which occur concurrently with decreased hydraulic conductivity in roots north and nobel 1991 these changes decreased the capacity of roots in sensing and responding to soil drying however after a certain period of soil drying repeated cycles of alternating drying and re watering induced by apri could both stimulate the compensatory growth of roots and induce new root generation as well as root hair development root vigor and hydraulic conductivity was also enhanced under apri li et al 2011 chen et al 2016 in accordance with this in the present study enhanced root growth was observed under apri especially in as70 and ad70 treatments leading to the increased root to shoot ratio in as70 and ad70 treated plants compared with the corresponding conventional drip irrigation treatment tables 2 and 3 in addition the root diameter decreased with decreasing ltai table 2 indicating more fine roots developed under apri such new roots are able to restore anatomical structure and hydraulic conductivity and succulent enough to sense further soil drying which allow them to take up the nutrients and water from the rewetted soil zone north and nobel 1991 in addition our previous research showed that apri caused root distribution deeper in the soil profile wang et al 2014 2019 zhang et al 2014 which is in consistent with the present study fig 1a b this is beneficial for plants to absorb nutrients and water from the soil root growth decreased in 60 fc as60 ad60 compared with that in 70 fc treatments as70 ad70 table 2 fig 1 it was expected that exposure of roots to prolonged or severely drying soil may cause anatomical structure deterioration and may not be conductive for recovery of root function and compensatory growth north and nobel 1991 our previous experiment with potted plants indicated that severe water stress imposed by a lower ltai at 40 fc impeded root growth decreased root vigor and inhibited photosynthesis thereby resulting in a significant yield loss of 27 whereas yield loss was only 6 1 with ltai at 60 fc chen et al 2016 the harvest index showed no significant difference among treatments under sufficient irrigation but increased gradually at the sequence of the ad80 and ad70 treatments compared with that of cdd under deficit irrigation table 3 kirda et al 2004 found that the aba concentration in leaf tissue under apri was consistently the highest among all the treatments throughout the tomato growth season elevated aba concentration was suggested to play a vital role in enhancing carbon remobilization thus increasing yield as well as the harvest index under water stress conditions yang et al 2000 2004 however severe water stress on plant could reduce biomass accumulation induce severe early senescence reduce the filling rate and shorten the filling period leading to a decreased yield and harvest index yang et al 2000 farooq et al 2014 in this study apdi under deficit irrigation increased aba content in the shoot data not shown also see kang et al 2004 dodd et al 2006 whereas ltai at 60 fc under deficit irrigation ad60 treatment exposed severe drought stress and damage to roots and the plant leading to decreased yield and harvest index tables 2 and 3 intensive studies showed that apri could improve fruit quality both in nutritional and health related metabolites kirda et al 2004 du et al 2008 jovanovic and stikic 2018 in accordance with these findings fruit quality in terms of reducing sugar total soluble sugar vc and the sugar acid ratio was improved under apri at both deficit and sufficient irrigation in present study table 4 however little attention had been paid to the underlying mechanisms for the improved quality induced by apri from a metabolic and molecular perspective till now jovanovic and stikic 2018 it has been suggested that a higher synthesis and accumulation of photoassimilates and metabolites and enhanced transfer of these assimilates to fruits together with changed metabolic pathways improved fruit quality jovanovic and stikic 2018 while the yield was not significantly different most of the quality parameters observed in the present study were higher in as80 as60 and ad60 compared with the corresponding conventional drip irrigation treatment with the same irrigation amounts csd cdd respectively indicating that tomato fruit quality was sensitive to the irrigation mode and ltais more than the yield in the present study fruit quality improved further at lower ltais consistent with our previous findings chen et al 2016 however in the present study all treatments were irrigated based on a criterion for the csd some treatments probably endured an additional stress which affected yield plant development and water use further researchers on the effects of full replenishment of evapotranspiration to the dry root zone under apdi with different ltais are needed conclusions alternate partial root zone drip irrigation apdi combined by alternate partial root zone irrigation apri and drip irrigation is an efficient way to conduct apri and has great potential in saving irrigation water and improving iwue this study showed that to take full advantage of this technology the soil water content should be controlled properly results showed that irrigation altered to the previously dry root zone soil when its water content declined to 70 of field capacity fc was the best irrigation management practice under apdi apdi with a ltai setting at 70 fc promoted yield formation and improved fruit quality especially under deficit irrigation compared with the conventional sufficient irrigation treatments csd ad70 saved 32 1 of the total irrigation water without significant yield reduction ad70 treatments increased root growth root to shoot ratio harvest index and thus yield formation by 20 9 compared with conventional drip irrigation under deficit irrigation in addition fruit quality was significantly improved in ad70 however apdi with ltai set higher or lower than 70 fc had the risk of diminishing the advantages in yield improvement declaration of

10586,evapotranspiration et is a major hydrologic flux in water resources planning and irrigation management while recent advances in remote sensing rs have enabled availability of high spatial and temporal resolution et data a lack of information related to error in the estimations has made it challenging to use this data for on farm irrigation management decision making in this study three commonly used single source rs based et models pysebal a new version of the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebs surface energy balance system algorithm and metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration were used to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration eta for almonds processing tomatoes and maize in the central valley of california model evaluation was conducted by comparing the predicted eta from rs with in situ measured eta using surface renewal results indicated that the rs based eta estimations for all three models were within acceptable levels of uncertainty and agreed well with surface renewal estimates except for the underestimation by pysebal and metric during early season growth stages of processing tomatoes this underestimation was attributed to the lack of accuracy when using single source et models under lower vegetation cover condition when et is dominated by soil evaporation better estimates of eta with pysebal and metric were detected at full cover which explains the applicability of these two models to irrigation management during peak crop water demand sebs performed the best among the three rs based models for daily eta estimation for all crops this suggests that sebs based eta estimates can be adopted in operational irrigation management programs for farms that have not installed in field eta sensors such as tule sensors tule technologies inc in addition rs based et is spatially distributed which can help to identity spatial variability between different irrigation zones keywords remote sensing daily evapotranspiration pysebal metric sebs surface renewal 1 introduction climate change and population growth have put a lot of pressure on the finite fresh water resources on the earth mancosu et al 2015 nyolei et al 2019 california s central valley is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world according to the recent usda irrigation and water management survey in 2018 california had approximately 3 403 million hectares of irrigated farmland usda 2018 california s agriculture is very diverse ranging from livestock to field crops and specialty crops according to the california department of food and agriculture in 2018 california farms and ranches received approximately 50 billion dollars in cash receipts for their output cdfa 2018 however the recent multi year drought competition for water from other users urban and environmental and groundwater depletion threaten sustainability of california s irrigated agriculture to remain viable california farmers will need to optimize agricultural water management by increasing water productivity through adoption of advanced management practices such as site specific zone irrigation management recent new water regulations such as the sustainable groundwater management act sgma will be forcing farmers to adapt to constrained water supplies when the new regulations are fully implemented et is a major hydrological flux that links water energy and carbon cycles and plays an important role in hydrology meteorology and agricultural water management li et al 2009 su 2002 anderson et al 2008 allen et al 2011a hu et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 site specific irrigation management requires knowing crop eta for each management zone conventional et estimation techniques such as bowen ratio eddy covariance surface renewal weighing lysimeter soil water balance and scintillometer can provide relatively accurate estimates of eta at field scale but are not spatially explicit and some are expensive and not readily available to growers wang and dickinson 2012 long et al 2014 the ability of remote sensing based models to provide eta at high spatiotemporal resolutions makes them suitable for scaling up and commercialization in precision agricultural water management lian and huang 2016 rango 1994 because of its potential benefits this topic has attracted a lot of attention from researchers over the past several decades bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 jiang and islam 1999 allen et al 2007a senay et al 2016 despite differences in theory and complexity of these models they generate reasonable eta maps for different specific conditions with acceptable error and uncertainty khan et al 2010 tasumi and kimura 2013 most rs based eta estimation models estimate only instantaneous or daily eta on the satellite overpass date while most practical applications in water resources and agricultural managements long require time series of daily eta at the field scale therefore it is essential to obtain long time series estimates of eta landsat 8 provides an opportunity for an 8 day overpass frequency usable images can be impacted by clouds which makes it suitable for monitoring water use and vegetation conditions landsat allows calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi at 30 m resolution land surface temperature is acquired at different spatial resolutions based on the landsat mission 120 m for the thermal band in landsat 5 60 m for landsat 7 and 100 m for landsat 8 landsat also provides the longest most continuous measurements of relevant bands for agricultural water management over the past two decades rs based et models using landsat imagery have been validated both at the field scale and the regional scale mohamed et al 2004 whitfield et al 2011 bastiaanssen et al 2002 allen et al 2007a evett et al 2012 the most commonly used rs based eta models can be divided into two categories the first is based on semi empirical methods using vegetation indices from surface reflectance data to estimate crop coefficients kc and then calculating eta using the estimated kc and reference evapotranspiration et0 and the second on biophysical processes such as the surface energy balance one major weakness of the semi empirical models is the requirement of prior knowing site specific parameters which limits the application of these models to estimate eta over regional scales with variable surface conditions eta estimation models based on the surface energy balance can be divided into two groups one source and two source models one source models consider soil and vegetation as an integration with a unified surface temperature to do land surface energy exchange bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007b su 2002 carlson 2007 senay et al 2007 two source models simulate evaporation and transpiration separately norman et al 1995 zhang et al 2005 mu et al 2011 long and singh 2012 the most difficult part in using two source et models are that they require the pre knowledge of surface temperature of soil and vegetation which is usually not directly obtainable from satellite images thus single source models are often used among many rs based et estimation models e g surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007b the simplified surface energy balance sseb senay et al 2007 and the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 sebal has long been recognized as the most suitable rs based model to estimate eta without prior knowledge of the field conditions such as crop types soils and management practices bastiaanssen et al 2005 nyolei et al 2019 the sebal model and its variant metric model employ the contextual method in et estimation in which pixel wise sensible heat flux and latent heat flux are calculated under the constraint of selected hot and cold extreme pixels within an area of interest it uses the information of the whole satellite image for the estimation of eta at each pixel sebs based on single pixel method calculates sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux Œªe by solving the surface energy budget for each pixel independently from other pixels which requires the ground observation of vegetation height surface wind speed and air temperature sebal and metric employ the contextual method that requires the user to select anchor pixels with extreme temperature and vegetation conditions which affects the accuracy of these models for eta estimation when where a hot cold pixel cannot be easily selected by the user consequently selecting pixels manually causes bias in eta estimation and the process of manually selecting anchor pixels is time consuming and subjective to overcome the challenges of manual anchor pixel selection semi automated and automated selection procedures to identify cold and hot pixels were developed recently jaafar and ahmad 2019 this work demonstrated that semi automated and automated anchor pixel selection procedures could be used to identify hot and cold pixels based on parameters characterizing extreme conditions in the satellite image such as surface albedo roughness length land surface temperature and ndvi a new python version of sebal model 3 0 pysebal incorporates an automation pixel selection procedure and is currently under development and testing at the ihe delft institute unesco ihe 2018 bhattarai et al 2017 proposed a fully automated procedure and applied it to sebal and metric models based on an exhaustive search algorithm and the comparison of the eta results with manual pixel selection procedures showed good agreement although the automated pixel selection procedure still requires pre defined information of the hot and cold pixels this technique can help in eliminating user subjectivity spatial field scale eta estimation from rs based models are widely used in irrigation management they provide the amount of water that needs to be applied to each irrigation zone to meet crop water needs sanchez et al 2017 validation of eta results from rs based models are usually done using conventional ground based eta measurement techniques such as weighing lysimeters and micrometeorological methods eddy covariance surface renewal bowen ratio energy balance etc allen et al 2011b concluded that considerable accuracy of ground based eta measurements can be obtained once these instruments were correctly installed and operated most of these ground based eta measurement techniques are expensive to implement and need to be installed and operated by experienced technicians snyder et al 2008 however simpler micrometeorological approaches such as surface renewal can significantly reduce cost but require trained technicians to operate properly with the surface renewal crop eta can be determined by calculating it as the residual of the energy balance h derived from the surface renewal techniques obtained by a simpler and less expensive method which uses fine wire thermocouples to measure high frequency air temperatures at the surface atmosphere interface mengistu and savage 2010 hu et al 2018 shapland et al 2012 in general surface renewal measurements costs much less than many other ground based et measurement techniques such as eddy covariance thus it provides a low cost way to measure crop eta but requires measuring or estimating net radiation as early as 1995 kyaw et al 1995 reported that the surface renewal method could be used accurately for stable conditions for canopies of 6 m high or lower and calibration against eddy covariance or other methods may be needed under unstable conditions when the surface renewal errors are greater later the application of surface renewal in eta estimation has been conducted for various crops including processing tomato rosa et al 2013 grapevine spano et al 2000 pecans simmons et al 2007 cotton payero and harris 2010 etc good correction between surface renewal method and other ground based et measurements such as lysimeters and eddy covariance were reported in these researches these results however are preliminary and additional testing with other crops and environments are now underway great potential has been demonstrated for using the surface renewal method as a cheaper alternative to lysimeters and eddy covariance for directly measuring daily et in california the surface renewal approach has been successfully commercialized by tule technologies inc http www tuletechnologies com the farmer pays an annual subscription fee the company processes surface energy fluxes and delivers field specific daily eta to the farmer since 2017 many studies reported the good correlation between the et estimations from the tule technologies surface renewal stations and eddy covariance flux towers fulton et al 2017 rieger 2017 zaccaria et al 2017 montazar et al 2018 there is a need to compare this new technology with existing remote sensing models the objectives of this study were to 1 compare eta from three remote sensing based models pysebal metric and sebs to ground based measurements from surface renewal stations in almonds processing tomatoes and maize and 2 evaluate energy balance components on satellite overpass date from the three models to identify causes of deviation and to quantify sources of uncertainty 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description three single source rs based et models pysebal metric and sebs were selected for evaluation of eta this section describes the specific algorithms for each model all three models are based on the surface energy balance eta is calculated based on the acquisition of satellite imagery containing the radiometric information at the satellite overpass time thus instantaneous eta calculations are first conducted and then converted to daily eta due to the lack of information on the surface resistances related to the evaporative process the instantaneous latent heat flux from these three rs based models are all computed as a residual of the surface energy balance equation kustas et al 1994 boegh et al 2002 1 Œª e r n h g where Œªe is the instantaneous latent heat flux in the atmosphere boundary layer w m2 rn is the instantaneous net radiation flux w m2 h is the instantaneous sensible heat flux w m2 and g is the instantaneous soil heat flux w m2 similarities and differences between these three rs based et models are described in the next sections 2 1 1 pysebal pysebal is a version of the sebal algorithm that has been developed by hessels et al 2017 in python environment which is an open source platform that run sebal by semi automatically processing selected landsat satellite imagery both pysebal and metric use an automated anchor pixel approach in selecting cold and hot pixels the selection of cold and hot pixels involves setting a predefined criterion and then using computer algorithms to identify the pixels in the image that meet those criteria the predefined criteria includes assessing ranges in ndvi ts momentum roughness length zom and Œ± rn is calculated by deducting all outgoing radiation fluxes from all incoming radiation fluxes as 2 r n 1 Œ± r s Œµ 0 r l Œµ 0 œÉ t s 4 where rs is the incoming shortwave radiation calculated at the satellite overpass time with clear sky conditions w m2 and rl is the incoming longwave radiation w m2 Œ± is the surface albedo Œµ0 is the surface emissivity estimated by a semi empirical relationship involving ndvi and leaf area index lai which can be retrieved from the red and near infrared bands œÉ is the stephen boltzman constant as 5 67 10 8 w m2 k4 and t s is land surface temperature composite soil and vegetation radiometric temperature k g is calculated as a fraction of the rn and pysebal uses the empirical equation of g developed by bastiaanssen 1995 3 g t s d a t u m 0 0038 0

applied in pysebal thus no extra atmospheric correction of ts is needed h in pysebal is calculated using the bulk aerodynamic resistance equation 4 h œÅ c p d t r a h where œÅ is the air density kg m3 and cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure which is 1004 j kg k rah is the aerodynamic resistance of heat transfer between z1 and z2 s m dt parameter is the temperature difference between two near surface height z1 0 1 m and z2 2 m above the canopy layer k which is estimated as a linear function of corrected surface temperature ts datum eq 5 being a major assumption for estimating sensible heat flux allen et al 2005 bastiaanssen 1995 the coefficients a and b in the eq 5 are determined iteratively for extreme anchors cold and hot pixels thus they are specific for every satellite

identify three pixel populations namely i cold vegetative pixels ii water pixels and iii hot pixels the cold vegetative pixels were automatically identified as those having maximum ndvi in the scene water pixels were classified using top of atmosphere reflectance bands involving a combination of non freezing temperature and negative ndvi as described in jaafar and ahmad 2019 ts for the cold pixels was selected from the minimum of vegetative and water pixels hot pixels were identified as those having ndvi values in the range of 0 03 and 0 2 detailed conditions applied for the anchor pixel limit selection in the pysebal metric and sebs are represented in table 1 based on the instantaneous rn h and g at the satellite overpass time the instantaneous evaporative fraction efi can be calculated eq 8 and converted into daily evaporative fraction ef24 eq 9 by using an advection factor œâ which is used to reduce errors caused by the eta increase during the afternoon hong et al 2014 8

height and ea is the actual vapor pressure above canopy height the daily eta is then calculated for each pixel in pysebal as 11 e t 24 8 64 10 7 œâ e f i r n 24 g 24 Œª œÅ w where et24 is the daily eta rate of the satellite overpass date mm d and Œª is the latent heat of vaporization j kg and œÅw is the density of water kg m3 rwasoka et al 2011 g24 is the daily average soil heat flux w m2 which is assumed as 0 for soil and vegetation surfaces rn24 is the average net radiation of the day w m2 which can be calculated as 12 r n 24 1 Œ± r a 110 œÑ s w where ra is the daily extraterrestrial solar radiation w m2 œÑsw is the daily atmospheric transmissivity affected by humidity dust and other pollutants in the air more details of the algorithm in the pysebal can be obtained from hessels et al 2017 2 1 2 metric as a variant of the sebal model the calculation method of instantaneous h and g in metric are the same as in pysebal both assume a linear relationship between ts and dt however there are some notable differences 1 metric does not assume that h w e t 0 and that Œª e w e t r n g at the wet pixel instead it uses a soil water balance to track soil water content to confirm that at the hot pixel latent heat approaches zero and at the wet pixel latent equals to 1 05 etr hourly alfalfa et0 estimated using asce penman monteith 2 cold pixel are typically selected in well irrigated agricultural areas where the biophysical characteristics for example crop height and lai are similar to the reference crop alfalfa and 3 the upscaling of instantaneous to daily eta is based on the reference et fraction in metric the automated anchor pixel selection starts by determining the minimum and maximum temperatures for the 5 quantile of the pixel values of the land surface temperature raster then the cold and hot pixel populations are determined by applying conditional selection based on the following surface parameters ts Œ± ndvi lai and zom the two models also use similar approaches in estimation of rn24 the only difference being the term œÑsw in which metric uses air pressure and water content of atmosphere while pysebal uses height above mean sea level based on the calculated rn h and g instantaneous eta at each pixel within the aoi at the satellite overpass time can be computed as 13 e t i n s 3600 r n h g Œª œÅ œâ where etins is the instantaneous eta rate mm h then the reference evaporative fraction etrf is calculated as 14 e t r f e t i n s e t r where etr is the et0 of alfalfa per hour mm h at the satellite overpass time which is usually calculated from meteorological data from a nearby weather station assuming a constant daily etrf daily et24 is computed as 15 e t 24 e t r f e t r 24 where etr 24 is the cumulative daily etr at the satellite overpass

metric model has been written and packaged in r programming language in the water package version 0 6 olmedo et al 2017 similar to pysebal this water package also adopted an automated hot cold pixel selection procedure in addition it accepts level 2 landsat atmospherically corrected surface reflectance products for landsat 8 imagery 2 1 3 sebs just like pysebal sebs is another commonly used energy balance model for eta estimation based on eq 1 the main equations constituting the sebs algorithm are described below for a detailed description of this method the reader is referred su 2002 the calculations of rn in sebs is similar to pysebal eq 2 except for a slight change in the equation of lai which refer to choudhury 1987 sebs uses the algorithm by su 2002 to calculate the g as a function of fractional canopy cover fc as follows 16 g r n –≥ c –≥ s –≥ c 1 f c Œ≥ g r n where –≥ is the soil heat flux ratio with constants of –≥c 0 05 for full vegetation cover and –≥c 0 315 for bare soil based on prior work by of monteith 1973 and kustas and daughtry 1990 sebs uses monin obukhov similarity theory for pixel by pixel estimation of h using the available energy under dry and wet

more details on the application of the similarity theory in sebs the reader is referred to su 2002 h initially derived in sebs at each pixel is scaled between the sensible heat under dry and wet

of the over 17 4 million hectares are used for agriculture about 40 is cropland and the rest is pasture and rangeland the central valley has a mediterranean climate with winter rainfall and hot summers and high annual evaporative demand ranging from 889 to 1270 mm williams 2001 this study included fields located on two large commercial farms and one experimental farm in the central valley fig 1 from north to south three fields were planted with maize processing tomatoes and almonds respectively as a required input in pysebal soil information of these fields was obtained from usda nrcs s web soil survey wss with soil texture ranging from fine sandy loam to silty clay table 2 maize and processing tomato fields were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation and the almond orchards were irrigated using double line surface drip irrigation with variable rate irrigation vri capabilities for automation the residual of energy balance approach and surface renewal equipment were used for the actual crop water use eta measurements tule technologies systems www tuletechnologies com were installed in these three fields to measure daily eta for almonds may 11th of 2018 to may 13th of 2019 processing tomatoes may 9th to august 18th of 2018 and maize may 24th to september 5th of 2018 the tule surface renewal stations consist of a thin fine wire thermocouple placed about 3 3 feet above the crop canopies to estimate sensible heat h and use spatially distributed rn from the goes satellite in evaluation of the energy balance daily g value is assumed negligible when compared to rn h and Œªe according to the measurement principle of tule sensor the yellow rectangle in fig 1 represents the approximate measurement zone of each monitoring point given what we know about the prevailing wind direction and the wind fetch length at the sensor height the measured et values are more or less representative of this measurement area data is transmitted through telemetry and the farmer access it through the web from this url https www tuletechnologies com 2 2 2 remote sensing based evapotranspiration model inputs 2 2 2 1 remote sensing data with clear sky conditions permitting a total of 27 landsat 8 oli tirs images 20 path 42 row35 images for the almond field 7 path 44 row 33 images for processing tomato and maize fields were obtained from the usgs earth resources observation and science center http eros usgs gov for the 2018 2019 growing season the imagery acquisition dates for almond processing tomato and maize fields are presented in table 3 in which tomato and maize fields were located within the range of one landsat 8 imagery three 90 m high resolution shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem maps for these fields were downloaded from the usgs eros center they were then clipped to the size of the study area to shorten the computation time in pysebal all the preprocessing of images was conducted with qgis and arcgis based on empirical equations dem meteorological and soil data landsat imagery were processed with atmospheric correction automatically performed in pysebal and metric water package version 0 6 sebs model was run in python environment 2 2 2 2 meteorological data three nearest automated weather stations from the california irrigation management information system cimis table 4 provided the hourly and daily meteorological data such as relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and air temperature required for eta estimation in pysebal sebs and metric in this study 2 3 validation of eta simulated by rs based models rs based et models generated spatial eta mm d from instantaneous latent heat flux for each of the input satellite images to reconstruct the time series of daily eta and compare them with daily tule based eta throughout the growing season rs based daily eta values were interpolated between two adjacent satellite overpasses using the et0 from the nearest weather station and the linear interpolated evaporative fraction et0 was estimated using the cimis penman monteith equation doorenbos and pruitt 1977 with hourly data of solar radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity from the nearest cimis weather station for each study field table 4 the estimated eta values from three rs based models were compared with surface renewal generated eta from tule sensors at the three field sites the area of each measurement zone equals to that of several remote sensing pixels one pixel is 30 30 m thus the tule based eta can represent the average eta of whole measurement zone including several pixels fig 1 we took advantage of arcgis to calculate the average of rs based eta within the range of each measurement zone and compared it with tule based eta to see the model performance statistical goodness of fit measures used in this study included the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and correlation coefficient r2 for an overview of goodness of fit measures typically used in hydrology the reader is referred to legates and mccabe 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimates to surface renewal measurements comparison of the estimated and measured daily eta values are shown in fig 2 since the goal of comparing these rs based et models is to estimate daily eta for irrigation scheduling more focus was put on the rmse between the model estimates and tule measurements for almonds the performance of all the three rs based et models pysebal metric and sebal was good with rmse ranging from 0 9 mm d to 1 6 mm d nse ranged from 0 68 to 0 77 and r2 ranged from 0 74 to 0 82 for processing tomatoes sebs performed best rmse 0 6 mm d nse 0 66 and r2 0 86 while pysebal rmse 1 79 mm d nse 0 06 and r2 0 37 and metric rmse 1 78 nse 0 11 and r2 0 41 performed poorly during the growing season due to the underestimation of daily eta for maize overestimations were observed in all three rs based models among which sebs performed better rmse 1 0 mm d nse 0 46 and r2 0 74 than pysebal rmse 1 08 mm d nse 0 43 and r2 0 72 and metric rmse 1 2 mm d nse 0 4 and r2 0 78 fig 3 shows the time series daily eta for the almond orchard vri and control blocks processing tomato and maize fields generated using pysebal metric sebs tule measurements and fao 56 methodology mean daily eta from pysebal metric and sebs were 5 6 6 5 and 4 9 mm d during the almond growing season and 2 1 2 6 and 2 4 mm d during the dormant season compared to the mean tule measurements it was determined that the average values of pysebal metric and sebs s estimates were respectively 26 36 and 11 higher during the almond growing season may 11th 2018 to october 31th 2018 and 4 1 and 7 higher during the dormant season november 1st 2018 to february 28th 2019 and part of the growing season before full coverage march 1st 2019 to may 13th 2019 the overestimations of daily eta were likely from the warmer cold wet pixels selected within the well watered farmland long et al 2011 and lian and huang 2016 reported that a warmer cold pixel selection in the initial stages of the growing season might lead to a decrease in estimated h and an increase in estimated eta because when the vegetation fraction was relatively low at during initial growth stages a cold extreme pixel selected from irrigated farmland rather than from a water body might not meet the potential et requirement they also found that the continuous linearly interpolated daily eta between two clear day eta may be higher than daily eta when cloudy days exist in this period for processing tomatoes mean daily eta from pysebal metric and sebs during the growing season were 4 1 4 3 and 4 9 mm respectively which were 22 19 and 7 respectively less than mean tule measurements the underestimation of pysebal and metric models for the tomato field during the early stage of crop growth from may 9th to june 26th may be attributed to small vegetation cover early in the season as a single source model if a large portion of the soil is exposed and water stress conditions occur early in the season both g and h may be large and errors in the two energy balance components will significantly affect the instantaneous Œªe with full vegetation cover at the medium late growth stages h is usually small and Œªe is not substantially affected by h even if the sensible heat flux is not accurately estimated some researchers also reported underestimations of eta using sebal and metric models for crop s initial growth stages with low vegetation coverage and water stress conditions mcebisi et al 2015 allen et al 2011 with regards to metric using a constant etrf to estimate daily eta may result in underestimation of water stress conditions allen et al 2011a b compared to the tule estimates and sebs the underestimation of daily eta by pysebal and metric may also be attributed to the underestimated daily average net radiation calculated by empirical equations when upscaling instantaneous eta to daily eta the use of empirical formula for daily average net radiation in pysebal when upscaling the instantaneous eta to daily eta may not work on cloudy days applying either measured or modeled daily net radiation for upscaling instantaneous eta could reduce the errors in daily eta estimation olmedo et al 2017 some previous studies also reported the need for calibrating the empirical equation of daily average net radiation to account for local atmospheric conditions to improve the daily eta estimation zhang et al 2013 ramesh and gabriel 2015 for maize most of the rs based et models were above the 1 1 line indicating they overestimated eta the pysebal metric and sebs based mean daily eta were 6 4 5 8 and 5 1 mm d overestimating daily eta by 31 26 and 12 respectively overall when using surface renewal estimates from tule as a reasonable reference although we acknowledge there is level of measurement uncertainty with this method sebs model performed better than both pysebal and metric with lower rmse and higher r2 and nse for the time series eta estimations of almonds processing tomatoes and maize at the field scale this suggests that sebs could improve the spatiotemporal eta estimation over orchards or field crops because the sebs model is more sensitive to the influence of differences in underlying surface characteristics on the resistance to heat transfer gao and long 2008 verhoef et al 1997 many researchers have reported that sebs performance was better than metric and sebal for eta estimation gowda et al 2013 wagle et al 2017 bhattarai et al 2016 paul 2013 in addition as pysebal metric and sebs all used reference et approach to reconstruct time series of daily eta between cloud free days the cloudy day evaporative fraction ef or etrf can be linearly interpolated based on two nearby clear day etrf which is similar to generating seasonal kc with two kc values of two days thus the calculation of instantaneous eta and different approaches embedded in different rs based models used for upscaling instantaneous eta to daily eta were the main cause of bias in time series daily eta estimates 3 2 inter comparison of daily evapotranspiration estimations among three rs based models the inter comparison of interpolated daily eta estimates from pysebal metric and sebs were performed as density plots fig 4 to examine the applicability and limitation of these models the period of comparison was for almonds may 11th of 2018 to may 13th of 2019 processing tomatoes may 9th to august 18th of 2018 and maize may 24th to september 5th of 2018 it is shown that there was some degree of linearity for eta estimates from pysebal and metric and sebs for almond and maize for processing tomato the relationship between daily pysebal and metric based eta was in good agreement while poor linearity existed between pysebal and metric with sebs fig 4b the big variation was caused by the smaller daily eta estimates from pysebal and metric than sebs during the early growth stages of processing tomato to better understand the possible source for variations in the density plot involving three rs based models we presented comparison of modeled fluxes for three rs based models in fig 5 as we mentioned before that rn used by tule is modeled from goes satellite and on a daily time scale g is zero in tule h is the only measured energy balance component from tule sensors thus we also include the comparison of measured h from tule with simulated h from rs based models in fig 5 as there were similar values of energy fluxes between two adjacent almond fields with different irrigation management only simulated energy balance components of the almond field applied with vri are presented in this paper compared to metric and sebs rn was underestimated by pysebal for the whole growing season for all three crops which could be one of the main reasons of the smaller daily eta simulated by pysebal in fig 4a the simulated g were relatively consistent among these three rs based models especially for the almond field fig 5 for the simulation of h sebs performed much better than pysebal and metric when compared to tule measured h pysebal and metric generated greater values than sebs for these three crops on all satellite overpass dates and relatively low tule measured h for three crops indicated that they were almost at the potential evapotranspiration rate during their growing seasons all three crop sites were well irrigated during the growing season in this study which matched with the tule measured h estimation results the biases between estimated and measured h were ranked in the order of processing tomato maize almond simulation results showed similar performances of h estimates for almond among three models while h estimates for processing tomato varied greatly among three models as described above derivation of h in pysebal and metric relies on the presence of extreme ts cold and hot or wet and dry pixels in the imagery especially for small areas for homogeneous land use types or for imagery with low moderate resolutions the assumption that all possible extreme cold and hot endmembers of a landscape are presented within the image might be not valid in other words lack of presence of high water use crops full vegetation or water sufficient vegetation and soil in the imagery may result in considerable errors in the estimation of h in contrast to contextual models single pixel methods sebs estimate et for each pixel independently from all other pixels in the image by solving the surface energy balance equation besides with less simulated rn g pysebal and metric partitioned less available energy into h and Œªe poor performance and underestimation of Œªe by pysebal and metric for processing tomatoes was exactly because of the overestimation of h which can be attributed to the low vegetation coverage and water stress conditions in the early growth stages to improve the definition of the cold and hot anchor pixels in two contextual models pysebal and metric high resolution imagery such as uas tir imagery would be particularly suitable for routine application in contextual rs based et models however due to the restriction of practical considerations including battery life and the need for high imagery overlap as well as the requirement of concerning the visibility of the uas during operation the applicability of high resolution uas tir imagery is under development 4 conclusions the performance of three widely used single source surface energy balance remote sensing et models pysebal metric and sebs were evaluated aganist surface renewal measurements in almonds processing tomatoes and maize in california s central valley during the 2018 2019 growing season based on combined scores from rmse nse and r2 performance of the three rs based et models were ranked in the order of sebs pysebal metric to estimate daily eta our results showed that pysebal metric and sebs could provide resaonable et estimates for almonds processing tomatoes and maize during the growing season except for the underestimation of pysebal and metric based eta estimates during early growth stages of processing tomatoes thus they could be used in precision agriculture decision support tools for simulating daily eta and provide information for optimizing irrigation management using site specific eta estimates from rs based models such as sebs could have a huge impact on water use in agriculture given the large acreage of almonds in california performances of pysebal and metric in early growth stages of processing tomato indicated their limitation in daily eta estimation in the early growth stage under low vegetation coverage and their usefulness after full canopy closure for cropped surfaces such as an orchard or row crop field sebs can provide a better estimation of eta than pysebal and metric throughout the growing season this study provided new information on errors between surface renewal measured eta and remote sensing based estimates of eta this information should provide confindence in potential

10586,evapotranspiration et is a major hydrologic flux in water resources planning and irrigation management while recent advances in remote sensing rs have enabled availability of high spatial and temporal resolution et data a lack of information related to error in the estimations has made it challenging to use this data for on farm irrigation management decision making in this study three commonly used single source rs based et models pysebal a new version of the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebs surface energy balance system algorithm and metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration were used to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration eta for almonds processing tomatoes and maize in the central valley of california model evaluation was conducted by comparing the predicted eta from rs with in situ measured eta using surface renewal results indicated that the rs based eta estimations for all three models were within acceptable levels of uncertainty and agreed well with surface renewal estimates except for the underestimation by pysebal and metric during early season growth stages of processing tomatoes this underestimation was attributed to the lack of accuracy when using single source et models under lower vegetation cover condition when et is dominated by soil evaporation better estimates of eta with pysebal and metric were detected at full cover which explains the applicability of these two models to irrigation management during peak crop water demand sebs performed the best among the three rs based models for daily eta estimation for all crops this suggests that sebs based eta estimates can be adopted in operational irrigation management programs for farms that have not installed in field eta sensors such as tule sensors tule technologies inc in addition rs based et is spatially distributed which can help to identity spatial variability between different irrigation zones keywords

recent multi year drought competition for water from other users urban and environmental and groundwater depletion threaten sustainability of california s irrigated agriculture to remain viable california farmers will need to optimize agricultural water management by increasing water productivity through adoption of advanced management practices such as site specific zone irrigation

anderson et al 2008 allen et al 2011a hu et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 site specific irrigation management requires knowing crop eta for each management zone conventional et estimation techniques such as bowen ratio eddy covariance surface renewal weighing lysimeter soil water balance and scintillometer can provide relatively accurate estimates of eta at field scale but are not spatially explicit and some are expensive and not readily available to growers wang and dickinson 2012 long et al 2014 the ability of remote sensing based models to provide eta at high spatiotemporal resolutions makes them suitable for scaling up and commercialization in precision agricultural water management lian and huang 2016 rango 1994 because of its potential benefits this topic has attracted a lot of attention from researchers over the past several decades bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 jiang and islam 1999 allen et al 2007a senay et al 2016 despite differences in theory and complexity of these models they generate reasonable eta maps for different specific conditions with acceptable error and uncertainty khan et al 2010 tasumi and kimura 2013 most rs based eta estimation models estimate only instantaneous or daily eta on the satellite overpass date while most practical applications in water resources and agricultural managements long require time series of daily eta at the field scale therefore it is essential to obtain long time series estimates of eta landsat 8 provides an opportunity for an 8 day overpass frequency usable images can be impacted by clouds which makes it suitable

relevant bands for agricultural water management over the past two decades rs based et models using landsat imagery have been validated both at the field scale and the regional scale mohamed et al 2004 whitfield et al 2011 bastiaanssen et al 2002 allen et al 2007a evett et al 2012 the most commonly used rs based eta models can be divided into two categories the first is based on semi empirical methods using vegetation indices from surface reflectance data to estimate crop coefficients kc and then calculating eta using the estimated kc and reference evapotranspiration et0 and the second on biophysical processes such as the surface energy balance one major weakness of the semi empirical models is the requirement of prior knowing site specific parameters which limits the application of these models to estimate eta over regional scales with variable surface conditions eta estimation models based on the surface energy balance can be divided into two groups one source and two source models one source models consider soil and vegetation as an integration with a unified surface temperature to do land surface energy exchange bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007b su 2002 carlson 2007 senay et al 2007 two source models simulate evaporation and transpiration separately norman et al 1995 zhang et al 2005 mu et al 2011 long and singh 2012 the most difficult part in using two source et models are that they require the pre knowledge of surface temperature of soil and vegetation which is usually not directly obtainable from satellite images thus single source models are often used among many rs based et estimation models e g surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007b the simplified surface energy balance sseb senay et al 2007 and the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 sebal has long been recognized as the most suitable rs based model to estimate eta without prior knowledge of the field conditions such as crop types soils and management practices bastiaanssen et al 2005 nyolei et al 2019 the sebal model and its variant metric model employ the contextual method in et estimation in which pixel wise sensible heat flux and latent heat flux are calculated under the constraint of selected hot and cold extreme pixels within an area of interest it uses the information of the whole satellite image for the estimation of eta at each pixel sebs based on single pixel method calculates sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux Œªe by solving the surface energy budget for each pixel independently from other pixels which requires the ground observation of vegetation height surface wind speed and air temperature sebal and metric employ the contextual method that requires the user to select anchor pixels with extreme temperature and vegetation conditions which affects the accuracy of these models for eta estimation when where a hot cold pixel cannot be easily selected by the user consequently selecting pixels manually causes bias in eta estimation and the process of manually selecting anchor pixels is time consuming and subjective to overcome the challenges of manual anchor pixel selection semi automated and automated selection procedures to identify cold and hot pixels were developed recently jaafar and ahmad 2019 this work demonstrated that semi automated and automated anchor pixel selection procedures could be used to identify hot and cold pixels based on parameters characterizing extreme conditions in the satellite image such as surface albedo roughness length land surface temperature and ndvi a new python version of sebal model 3 0 pysebal incorporates an automation pixel selection procedure and is currently under development and testing at the ihe delft institute unesco ihe 2018 bhattarai et al 2017 proposed a fully automated procedure and applied it to sebal and metric models based on an exhaustive search algorithm and the comparison of the eta results with manual pixel selection procedures showed good agreement although the automated pixel selection procedure still requires pre defined information of the hot and cold pixels this technique can help in eliminating user subjectivity spatial field scale eta estimation from rs based models are widely used in irrigation management they provide the amount of water that needs to be applied to each irrigation zone to meet crop water needs sanchez et al 2017 validation of eta results from rs based models are usually done using conventional ground based eta measurement techniques such as weighing lysimeters and micrometeorological methods eddy covariance surface renewal bowen ratio energy balance etc allen et al 2011b concluded that considerable accuracy of ground based eta measurements can be obtained once these instruments were correctly installed and operated most of these ground based eta measurement techniques are expensive to implement and need to be installed and operated by experienced technicians snyder et al 2008 however simpler micrometeorological approaches such as surface renewal can significantly reduce cost but require trained technicians to operate properly with the surface renewal crop eta can be determined by calculating it as the residual of the energy balance h derived from the surface renewal techniques obtained by a simpler and less expensive method which uses fine wire thermocouples to measure high frequency air temperatures at the surface atmosphere interface mengistu and savage 2010 hu et al 2018 shapland et al 2012 in general surface renewal measurements costs much less than many other ground based et measurement techniques such as eddy covariance thus it provides a low cost way to measure crop eta but requires measuring or estimating net radiation as early as 1995 kyaw et al 1995 reported that the surface renewal method could be used accurately for stable conditions for canopies of 6 m high or lower and calibration against eddy covariance or other methods may be needed under unstable conditions when the surface renewal errors are greater later the application of surface renewal in eta estimation has been conducted for various crops including processing tomato rosa et al 2013 grapevine spano et al 2000 pecans simmons et al 2007 cotton payero and harris 2010 etc good correction between surface renewal method and other ground based et measurements such as lysimeters and eddy covariance were reported in these researches these results however are preliminary and additional testing with other crops and environments are now underway great potential has been demonstrated for using the surface renewal method as a cheaper alternative to lysimeters and eddy covariance for directly measuring daily et in california the surface renewal approach has been successfully commercialized by tule technologies inc http www tuletechnologies com the farmer pays an annual subscription fee the company processes surface energy fluxes and delivers field specific daily eta to the farmer since 2017 many studies reported the good correlation between the et estimations from the tule technologies surface renewal stations and eddy covariance flux towers fulton et al 2017 rieger 2017 zaccaria et al 2017 montazar et al 2018 there is a need to compare this new technology with existing remote sensing models the objectives of this study were to 1 compare eta from three remote sensing based models pysebal metric and sebs to ground based measurements from surface renewal stations in almonds processing tomatoes and maize and 2 evaluate energy balance components on satellite overpass date from the three models to identify causes of deviation and to quantify sources of uncertainty 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description three single source rs based et models pysebal metric and sebs were selected for evaluation of eta this section describes the specific algorithms for each model all three models are based on the surface energy balance eta is calculated based on the acquisition of satellite imagery containing the radiometric information at the satellite overpass time thus instantaneous eta calculations are first conducted and then converted to daily eta due to the lack of information on the surface resistances related to the evaporative process the instantaneous latent heat flux from these three rs based models are all computed as a residual of the surface energy balance equation kustas et al 1994 boegh et al 2002 1 Œª e r n h g where Œªe is the instantaneous latent heat flux in the atmosphere boundary layer w m2 rn is the instantaneous net radiation flux w m2 h is the instantaneous sensible heat flux w m2 and g is the instantaneous soil heat flux w m2 similarities and differences between these three rs based et models are described in the next sections 2 1 1 pysebal pysebal is a version of the sebal algorithm that has been developed by hessels et al 2017 in python environment which is an open source platform that run sebal by semi automatically processing selected landsat satellite imagery both pysebal and metric use an automated anchor pixel approach in selecting cold and hot pixels the selection of cold and hot pixels involves setting a predefined criterion and then using computer algorithms to identify the pixels in the image that meet those criteria the predefined criteria includes assessing ranges in ndvi ts momentum roughness length zom and Œ± rn is

2017 2 1 2 metric as a variant of the sebal model the calculation method of instantaneous h and g in metric are the same as in pysebal both assume a linear relationship between ts and dt however there are some notable differences 1 metric does not assume that h w e t 0 and that Œª e w e t r n g at the wet pixel instead it uses a soil water balance to track soil water content to confirm that at the hot pixel latent heat approaches zero and at the wet pixel latent equals to 1 05 etr hourly alfalfa et0 estimated using asce penman monteith 2 cold pixel are typically selected in well irrigated agricultural areas where the biophysical characteristics for example crop height and lai are similar to the reference crop alfalfa and 3 the upscaling of instantaneous to daily eta is based on the reference et fraction in metric the automated anchor pixel selection starts by determining the minimum and maximum temperatures for the 5 quantile of the pixel values of the land surface temperature raster then the cold and hot pixel populations are determined by applying conditional selection based on the following surface parameters ts Œ± ndvi lai and zom the two models also use similar approaches in estimation of rn24 the only difference being the term œÑsw in which metric uses air pressure and water content of atmosphere while pysebal uses height above mean sea level based on the calculated rn h and g instantaneous eta at each pixel within the aoi at the satellite overpass time can be computed as 13 e t i n s 3600 r n h g Œª œÅ œâ where etins is the instantaneous eta rate mm h

energy balance model for eta estimation based on eq 1 the main equations constituting the sebs algorithm are described below for a detailed description of this method the reader is referred su 2002 the calculations of rn in sebs is similar to pysebal eq 2 except for a slight change in the equation of lai which refer to choudhury 1987 sebs uses the algorithm by su 2002 to calculate the g as a function of fractional canopy cover fc as follows 16 g r n –≥ c –≥ s –≥ c 1 f c Œ≥ g r n where –≥ is the soil heat flux ratio with constants of –≥c 0 05 for full vegetation cover and –≥c 0 315 for

more details on the application of the similarity theory in sebs the reader is referred to su 2002 h initially derived in sebs at each pixel is scaled between the sensible heat under dry and wet limits this scaling method is performed for each pixel within the image after calculating h based on eq 1 by considering the Œªe at the dry and wet limit conditions at the dry limit latent heat Œªedry

of the over 17 4 million hectares are used for agriculture about 40 is cropland and the rest is pasture and rangeland the central valley has a mediterranean climate with winter rainfall and hot summers and high annual evaporative demand ranging from 889 to 1270 mm williams 2001 this study included fields located on two large commercial farms and one experimental farm in the central valley fig 1 from north to south three fields were planted with maize processing tomatoes and almonds respectively as a required input in pysebal soil information of these fields was obtained from usda nrcs s web soil survey wss with soil texture ranging from fine sandy loam to silty clay table 2 maize and processing tomato fields were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation and the almond orchards were irrigated using double line surface drip irrigation with variable rate irrigation vri capabilities for automation the residual of energy balance approach and surface renewal equipment were used for the actual crop water use eta measurements tule technologies systems www tuletechnologies com were installed in these three fields to measure daily eta for almonds may 11th of 2018 to may 13th of 2019 processing tomatoes may 9th to august 18th of 2018 and maize may 24th to september 5th of 2018 the tule surface renewal stations consist of a thin fine wire thermocouple placed about 3 3 feet above the crop canopies to estimate sensible heat h and use spatially distributed rn from the goes satellite in evaluation of the energy balance daily g value is assumed negligible when compared to rn h and Œªe according to the measurement principle of tule sensor the yellow rectangle in fig 1 represents the approximate measurement zone of each monitoring point given what we know about the prevailing wind direction and the wind fetch length at the sensor height the measured et values are more or less representative of this measurement area data is transmitted through telemetry and the

permitting a total of 27 landsat 8 oli tirs images 20 path 42 row35 images for the almond field 7 path 44 row 33 images for processing tomato and maize fields were obtained from the usgs earth resources observation and science center http eros usgs gov for the 2018 2019 growing season the imagery acquisition dates for almond processing tomato and maize fields are presented in table 3 in which tomato and maize fields were located within the range of one landsat 8 imagery three 90 m high resolution shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem maps for these fields were downloaded from the usgs eros center they were then clipped to the size of the study area to shorten the computation time in pysebal all the preprocessing of images was conducted with qgis and arcgis based on empirical equations dem meteorological and soil data landsat imagery were processed with atmospheric correction automatically performed in pysebal and metric water package version 0 6 sebs model was run in python environment 2 2 2 2 meteorological data three nearest automated weather stations from the california irrigation management information system cimis table 4 provided the hourly and daily meteorological data such as relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and air temperature required for eta estimation in pysebal sebs and metric in this study 2 3 validation of eta simulated by rs based models rs based et models generated spatial eta mm d from instantaneous latent heat flux for each of the input satellite images to reconstruct the time series of daily eta and compare them with daily tule based eta throughout the growing season rs based daily eta values were interpolated between two adjacent satellite overpasses using the et0 from the nearest weather station and the linear interpolated evaporative fraction et0 was estimated using the cimis penman monteith equation doorenbos and pruitt 1977 with hourly data of solar radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity from the nearest cimis weather station for each study field table 4 the estimated eta values from three rs based models were compared with surface renewal generated eta from tule sensors at the three field sites the area of each measurement zone equals to that of several remote sensing pixels one pixel is 30 30 m thus the tule based eta can represent the average eta of whole measurement zone including several pixels fig 1 we took advantage of arcgis to calculate the average of rs based eta within the range of each measurement zone and compared it with tule based eta to see the model performance statistical goodness of fit measures used in this study included the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and correlation coefficient r2 for an overview of goodness of fit measures typically used in hydrology the reader is referred to legates and mccabe 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimates to surface renewal measurements comparison of the estimated and measured daily eta values are shown in fig 2 since the goal of comparing these rs based et models is to estimate daily eta for irrigation scheduling more focus was put on the rmse between the model estimates and tule measurements for almonds the performance of all the three rs based et models pysebal metric and sebal was good with rmse ranging from 0 9 mm d to 1 6 mm d nse ranged from 0 68 to 0 77 and r2 ranged from 0 74 to 0 82 for processing tomatoes sebs performed best rmse 0 6 mm d nse 0 66 and r2 0 86 while pysebal rmse 1 79 mm d nse 0 06 and r2 0 37 and metric rmse 1 78 nse 0 11 and r2 0 41 performed poorly during the growing season due to the underestimation of daily eta for maize overestimations were observed in all three rs based models among which sebs performed better rmse 1 0 mm d nse 0 46 and r2 0 74 than pysebal rmse 1 08 mm d nse 0 43 and r2 0 72 and metric rmse 1 2 mm d nse 0 4 and r2 0 78 fig 3 shows the time series daily eta for the almond orchard vri and control blocks processing tomato and maize fields generated using pysebal metric sebs tule measurements and fao 56 methodology mean daily eta from pysebal metric and sebs were 5 6 6 5 and 4 9 mm d during the almond growing season and 2 1 2 6 and 2 4 mm d during the dormant season compared to the mean tule measurements it was determined that the average values of pysebal metric and sebs s estimates were respectively 26 36 and 11 higher during the almond growing season may 11th 2018 to october 31th 2018 and 4 1 and 7 higher during the dormant season november 1st 2018 to february 28th 2019 and part of the growing season before full coverage march 1st 2019 to may 13th 2019 the overestimations of daily eta were likely from the warmer cold wet pixels selected within the well watered farmland long et al 2011 and lian and huang 2016 reported that a warmer cold pixel selection in the initial stages of the growing season might lead to a decrease in estimated h and an increase in estimated eta because when the vegetation fraction was relatively low at during initial growth stages a cold extreme pixel selected from irrigated farmland rather than from a water body might not meet the potential et requirement they also found that the continuous linearly interpolated daily eta between two clear day eta may be higher than daily eta when cloudy days exist in this period for processing tomatoes mean daily eta from pysebal metric and sebs during the growing season were 4 1 4 3 and 4 9 mm respectively which were 22 19 and 7 respectively less than mean tule measurements the underestimation of pysebal and metric models for the tomato field during the early stage of crop growth from may 9th to june 26th may be attributed to small vegetation cover early in the season as a single source model if a large portion of the soil is exposed and water stress conditions occur early in the season both g and h may be large and errors in the two energy balance components will significantly affect the instantaneous Œªe with full vegetation cover at the medium late growth stages h is usually small and Œªe is not substantially affected by h even if the sensible heat flux is not accurately estimated some researchers also reported underestimations of eta using sebal and metric models for crop s initial growth stages with low vegetation coverage and water stress conditions mcebisi et al 2015 allen et al 2011 with regards to metric using a constant etrf to estimate daily eta may result in underestimation of water stress conditions allen et al 2011a b compared to the tule estimates and sebs the underestimation of daily eta by pysebal and metric may also be attributed to the underestimated daily average net radiation calculated by empirical equations when upscaling instantaneous eta to daily eta the use of empirical formula for daily average net radiation in pysebal when upscaling the instantaneous eta to daily eta may not work on cloudy days applying either measured or modeled daily net radiation for upscaling instantaneous eta could reduce the errors in daily eta estimation olmedo et al 2017 some previous studies also reported the need for calibrating the empirical equation of daily average net radiation to account for local atmospheric conditions to improve the daily eta estimation zhang et al 2013 ramesh and gabriel 2015 for maize most of the rs based et models were above the 1 1 line indicating they overestimated eta the pysebal metric and sebs based mean daily eta were 6 4 5 8 and 5 1 mm d overestimating daily eta by 31 26 and 12 respectively overall when using surface renewal estimates from tule as a reasonable reference although we acknowledge there is level of measurement uncertainty with this method sebs model performed better than both pysebal and metric with lower rmse and higher r2 and nse for the time series eta estimations of almonds processing tomatoes and maize at the field scale this suggests that sebs could improve the spatiotemporal eta estimation over orchards or field crops because the sebs model is more sensitive to the influence of differences in underlying surface characteristics on the resistance to heat transfer gao and long 2008 verhoef et al 1997 many researchers have reported that sebs performance was better than metric and sebal for eta estimation gowda et al 2013 wagle et al 2017 bhattarai et al 2016 paul 2013 in addition as pysebal metric and sebs all used reference et approach to reconstruct time series of daily eta between cloud free days the cloudy day evaporative fraction ef or etrf can be linearly interpolated based on two nearby clear day etrf which is similar to generating seasonal kc with two kc values of two days thus the calculation of instantaneous eta and different approaches embedded in different rs based models used for upscaling instantaneous eta to daily eta were the main cause of bias in time series daily eta estimates 3 2 inter comparison of daily evapotranspiration estimations among three rs based models the inter comparison of interpolated daily eta estimates from pysebal metric and sebs were performed as density plots fig 4 to examine the applicability and limitation of these models the period of comparison was for almonds may 11th of 2018 to may 13th of 2019 processing tomatoes may 9th to august 18th of 2018 and maize may 24th to september 5th of 2018 it is shown that there was some degree of linearity for eta estimates from pysebal and metric and sebs for almond and maize for processing tomato the relationship between daily pysebal and metric based eta was in good agreement while poor linearity existed between pysebal and metric with sebs fig 4b the big variation was caused by the smaller daily eta estimates from pysebal and metric than sebs during the early growth stages of processing tomato to better understand the possible source for variations in the density plot involving three rs based models we presented comparison of modeled fluxes for three rs based models in fig 5 as we mentioned before that rn used by tule is modeled from goes satellite and on a daily time scale g is zero in tule h is the only measured energy balance component from tule sensors thus we also include the comparison of measured h from tule with simulated h from rs based models in fig 5 as there were similar values of energy fluxes between two adjacent almond fields with different irrigation management only simulated energy balance components of the almond field applied with vri are presented in this paper compared to metric and sebs rn was underestimated by pysebal for the whole growing season for all three crops which could be one of the main reasons of the smaller daily eta simulated by pysebal in fig 4a the simulated g were relatively consistent among these three rs based models especially for the almond field fig 5 for the simulation of h sebs performed much better than pysebal and metric when compared to tule measured h pysebal and metric generated greater values than sebs for these three crops on all satellite overpass dates and relatively low tule measured h for three crops indicated that they were almost at the potential evapotranspiration rate during their growing seasons all three crop sites were well irrigated during the growing season in this study which matched with the tule measured h estimation results the biases between estimated and measured h were ranked in the order of processing tomato maize almond simulation results showed similar performances of h estimates for almond among three models while h estimates for processing tomato varied greatly among three models as described above derivation of h in pysebal and metric relies on the presence of extreme ts cold and hot or wet and dry pixels in the imagery especially for small areas for homogeneous land use types or for imagery with low moderate resolutions the assumption that all possible extreme cold and hot endmembers of a landscape are presented within the image might be not valid in other words lack of presence of high water use crops full vegetation or water sufficient vegetation and soil in the imagery may result in considerable errors in the estimation of h in contrast to contextual models single pixel methods sebs estimate et for each pixel independently from all other pixels in the image by solving the surface energy balance equation besides with less simulated rn g pysebal and metric partitioned less available energy into h and Œªe poor performance and underestimation of Œªe by pysebal and metric for processing tomatoes was exactly because of the overestimation of h which can be attributed to the low vegetation coverage and water stress conditions in the early growth stages to improve the definition of the cold and hot anchor pixels in two contextual models pysebal and metric high resolution imagery such as uas tir imagery would be particularly suitable for routine application in contextual rs based et models however due to the restriction of practical considerations including battery life and the need for high imagery overlap as well as the requirement of concerning the visibility of the uas during operation the applicability of high resolution uas tir imagery is under development 4 conclusions the performance of three widely used single source surface energy balance remote sensing et models pysebal metric and sebs were evaluated aganist surface renewal measurements in almonds processing tomatoes and maize in california s central valley during the 2018 2019 growing season based on combined scores from rmse nse and r2 performance of the three rs based et models were ranked in the order of sebs pysebal metric to estimate daily eta our results showed that pysebal metric and sebs could provide resaonable et estimates for almonds processing tomatoes and maize during the growing season except for the underestimation of pysebal and metric based eta estimates during early growth stages of processing tomatoes thus they could be used in precision agriculture decision support tools for simulating daily eta and provide information for optimizing irrigation management using site specific eta estimates from rs based models such as sebs could have a huge impact on water use in agriculture given the large acreage of almonds in california performances of pysebal and metric in early growth stages of processing tomato indicated their limitation in daily eta estimation in the early growth stage under low vegetation coverage and their usefulness after full canopy closure for cropped surfaces such as an orchard or row crop field sebs can provide a better estimation of eta than pysebal and metric throughout the growing season this study provided new information on errors between surface renewal measured eta and remote sensing based estimates of eta this information should provide confindence in potential

10587,the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh planting system has many advantages for improving the use of water during dryland farming in semiarid areas but the optimally matched planting density for maximizing the productivity of foxtail millet is not known therefore field experiments were conducted during 2013 2015 to determine the soil water content with depth evapotranspiration et agronomic traits grain yield and crop water productivity under different planting densities when using rfrh planting width of ridge and furrow is 60 cm three rows were planted in furrow compared with traditional flat planting the results show that a high planting density would lead to soil drought conditions in the late reproductive growth stage with reductions in individual plant traits and the harvest index hi in dry years however we found that rfrh planting could reduce et and improve the soil water content at 0 120 cm soil layers in the jointing and filling stages as well as mitigating the crop water deficit in the reproductive growth stage and the decreased hi caused by a high planting density compared with traditional flat planting rfrh planting decreased the foxtail millet grain yield in the rainy year 2013 due to the relatively lower plant population but it increased the yield in the normal rainfall years of 2014 and 2015 as well as significantly improving the crop water productivity by 7 9 and 14 0 under the optimized planting density respectively a relatively higher optimal planting density was always obtained in the furrows under rfrh planting compared with traditional flat planting in all three experimental years based on these results we recommend increasing the planting density in the furrows to increase the grain yield and crop water productivity under rfrh planting with a moderate planting density for foxtail millet three rows in a 60 cm wide furrow and a plant spacing of 7 5 cm in semiarid regions of china keywords dryland foxtail millet planting density soil water content crop water productivity 1 introduction rainfall is always scarce and unpredictable in arid and semiarid areas and thus drought and water shortages are the main choke points that prevent increases in crop productivity gan et al 2009 in particular in rain fed farming areas where precipitation is the only source of water for agricultural production the only option for increasing agricultural production and sustainable development is increasing the rainwater use efficiency by rainwater harvesting and mulching deng et al 2006 in recent years many field studies have shown that ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system is an effective and simple method for increasing the soil water content swc and improving the rainwater use efficiency in dryland farming ren et al 2008a li et al 2016 in the rfrh system the plastic mulched ridges provide a runoff surface that directs rainwater to the furrows so it can penetrate deeper into the soil li and gong 2002 tian et al 2003 as well as reducing the loss of soil water by evaporation from the ridges and extending the period of moisture availability for crops zhang et al 2007 liu et al 2014 therefore rfrh system has been applied in arid and semiarid rain fed areas as an innovative approach for increasing the crop water availability improving soil productivity and enhancing food security gan et al 2013 another important factor related to a high grain yield is a reasonable crop population structure which is fundamental for coordinating the relationships among the yield components i e the spike number grain number and grain weight as well as for fully exploiting light energy water and fertilizer resources the most suitable planting density is determined by the crop genotype and it is also affected by the water and fertilizer conditions in the environment sangoi et al 2003 liu et al 2012 amelong et al 2017 in dryland agriculture the field water conditions should be considered when optimizing the crop planting density because a high density will increase crop transpiration whereas a low density will increase the bare land area and soil evaporation many studies have shown that a reasonable planting density can improve the water use efficiency by increasing the ratio of crop transpiration relative to evapotranspiration et in addition a reasonable leaf area and crop canopy are very important for fully exploiting the available light heitholt et al 1992 de bruin and pedersen 2008 thereby improving the crop productivity and water use efficiency in dryland farming yang et al 2009 jia et al 2018 in the rfrh system land loss problems occur with densely planted crops when the row spacing is narrower than the ridge width wang et al 2015 lian et al 2017 which has a negative effect on yield increases because a relatively lower plant population is obtained compared with traditional flat planting ultimately the response in terms of the yield under rfrhp is due to a combination of the improved water conditions but a reduced plant population because of the decreased land area and thus the suitability of rfrh system is related to the regional rainfall characteristics crop species and ridge width ren et al 2008b found that the yield increase under rfrh system depended on the amount of precipitation where the effect was weaker with more rainfall and many other studies have also shown that rfrh system is only effective in arid and semiarid areas zhou et al 2009 it is well known that rfrh planting can significantly improve the water and fertilizer conditions in the planting furrow lian et al 2017 where this superior growing environment can support a larger population thus the problem of the reduced planting area can be solved by increasing the crop planting density in the furrow however some studies have shown that planting an excessive density of spring wheat in the furrows leads to intense competition and the death of the tillers in the middle row thereby decreasing the yield under rfrh system cui et al 2009 wang and dong 2011 whereas increasing the planting density is effective for achieving a high yield in maize wang and yin 2011 thus the optimum planting density is determined by many factors such as the crop variety water and fertilizer environment but few studies have considered the most appropriate planting density for rfrh system therefore it is necessary to determine the response in terms of the yield to different planting densities under rfrh system in dryland farming foxtail millet setaria italic l originates from northern china and it is an important annual gramineae cereal food crop with good nutritional value jones and liu 2009 ning et al 2017 due to its superior adaptability to arid and barren lands compared with other crops as well as its stress resistance and good nutritional value foxtail millet plays an important role in agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions throughout the world veeranagamallaiah et al 2008 due to increases in the global population and water shortages it is important to further improve the water use efficiency in order to ensure food security in recent years our research group has investigated the rfrh system with ridge and furrow both at widths of 60 cm since the dryland farming project started in china during 1995 we have demonstrated that yield increases can be obtained under rfrh system which is suitable for most crops i e maize millet and wheat wang et al 2000 ding et al 2007 wei et al 2018 and is also conducive to mechanization in the present study we conducted a field trial with foxtail millet to improve the yield and wue by optimizing the planting density in a semiarid area based on comparisons with the traditional flat planting in this study we investigated that the effect of rfrh system at different planting densities on the soil moisture contents and water consumption in various soil layers individual and population agronomic traits grain yield formation and crop water productivity of foxtail millet compared with traditional flat planting in order to recommend a reasonable planting density for rfrh system in semiarid areas we expect that the results of this study will provide a theoretical basis for improving the application of rfrh system in semiarid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site

mm and an average annual evaporation from a free water surface of about 1000 mm according to the fao unesco soil classification system the soil at the research sit was confirmed as a calcic cambisol 14 sand 26 silt and 60 clay with a ph potentiometric method the ratio of soil water equal to 1 of 8 5 and a mean bulk density cutting ring method of 1 34 g cm 3 as for other soil properties the average gravimetric field water capacity was 22 4 while the permanent wilting point was 8 3 precipitations were collected using an automatic weather station ws std1 delta t cambridge uk close to the experimental field from 2013 to 2015 the precipitations during the growth period were respectively 537 295 and 305 mm and the daily rainfall distributions are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the continuous cropping of foxtail millet can cause many problems such as toxic substances accumulation plant diseases insect pests as well as weeds overgrowth so we respectively selected three adjacent fields in the experimental site in 2013 2015 the key chemical properties of the 0 40 cm soil layer in each year are shown in table 1 the experiment used split plot design with the two planting patterns r rfrh planting t traditional flat planting as the main plot and three replicates were set for each treatment the subplots received three different planting densities comprising d1 with a plant spacing of 10 cm d2 with a plant spacing of 7 5 cm and d3 with a plant spacing of 5 5 cm three rows of millet were planted in each furrow under r and the row spacing was 30 cm under t schematic illustrations of the r and t patterns are shown in fig 2 the corresponding population number per unit area for each treatment is shown in table 2 the length and width of each plot were 5 0 m 3 6 m the ridge and furrow widths were both 60 cm the ridge height was 15 cm with mulched transparent plastic film and the fertilizers were applied in the furrow area the thickness of plastic film was 0 008 mm produced by tianshui tianbao plastic industry ltd gansu china and the fertilizers comprised urea china petroleum ningxia petrochemical production company and diammonium phosphate yunnan three circles sinochem fertilizer co ltd us sheng which respectively contained 46 0 nitrogen and 46 0 p2o5 plus 18 0 nitrogen the plowing of the entire experimental area was performed 20 days before marking out the plots and sowing each year a 60 cm wide border between neighboring plots was set to reduce seepage 10 days before sowing all the nitrogen and phosphorus were evenly spread over the plot the whole area of the plot for t and the furrow area only for r and plowed into the deep soil layer 20 cm with a spade from 2013 2015 the foxtail millet variety datong 29 no tillering was sown on april 23 29 and 24 respectively the plants were thinned at the seedling and the sixth leaf stage according to the specified plant distance the crops were respectively harvested at the end of september in all three tested years irrigation was not supplied throughout this study and weeds were manually controlled when it was required 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture and et a soil ferric auger was used to sample the soil cores to a depth of 200 cm at intervals of 20 cm in the different millet growth stages each year by measuring the wet soil weight and its dried constant weight at 105 c we obtained the gravimetric g g 1 soil water content swc in the 0 200 cm profile if rainfall happened to occur during the due sample period a 2 5 days delay which differed with the amount of rainfall was required until the rainwater leakage reached a balance for the r plots the soil cores were sampled from a furrow the side of a furrow and the middle of a ridge where the mean value of the three different positions was regarded as swc as for the t plots the soil cores were taken from the center of two contiguous rows the soil water storage sws was calculated as the following equation 1 s w s i n c i œÅ i h i 10 where sws represents the amount of stored soil water mm ci œÅi and hi respectively represents the soil gravimetric water content the soil bulk density g cm 3 and the soil depth cm the evapotranspiration et mm from each treatment was determined by the soil water balance equation as follows li et al 2013 2 e t p Œ¥ s w s d r g i where p represents the amount of precipitation mm Œ¥sws represents the fluctuation of the amount of soil water storage in the 0 200 cm layer mm d represents the downward seepage mm r g and i respectively represents the surface runoff mm the groundwater recharge mm and the irrigation mm since the field was flat no irrigation was supplied and the groundwater table was at a depth of about 50 m in the experimental area thus i g and r were beyond our concern in eq 2 field water capacity of loess soil is extremely strong and in our study under normal conditions all of the rainfall could be stored by the upper 200 cm layer therefore little leakage reached below 200 cm but owing to the strong and continuous rainfall 189 mm rainfall from 81 to 89 days after sowing in 2013 the swc at 200 cm exceeded the field water holding capacity and the drainage occurred below 200 cm according to previous study liu et al 1996 the upper 120 cm soil layer distributed over 95 of the foxtail millet root system thus from 95 days after sowing to the harvest in 2013 the change of sws in the 120 200 cm soil depth could be used to estimate the drainage 2 3 2 plant height and biomass from the jointing stage to maturity stage the plant heights were determined by the averaged data of 10 representative plants selected from each plot to calculate the aboveground biomass three rows of millet with a length of 1 m from the middle of each plot were sampled and the aboveground biomass was determined by the method of oven drying first at 105 c for 1 h and then under 70 c until constant weight 2 3 3 yield and harvest index hi during the harvest three rows of millet with a length of 2 m from the middle of each plot were harvested by hand and all data of weight were determined based on a water content of 12 which include the seed the 1000 seed weigh as well as aboveground biomass yields for r the samples from each plot were taken separately for the border row r b and the middle row r m hi was calculated as the proportion of millet grain yield relative to the total above ground biomass 2 3 4 crop water productivity wp the following equation was used for the calculating of crop water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 3 wp y et where y and et represents the grain yield of foxtail millet kg ha 1 and the crop evapotranspiration mm respectively 2 3 5 optimal stand density osd as described by duncan 1958 and amelong et al 2017 osd was estimated as follows 4 osd 1 2 303b 5 lny a bx where osd is the optimal stand density unit is 105 plant ha 1 the parameter b is the slope of the linear regression calculated with eq 4 it is constant in each linear regression x is the actual planting density unit is 105 plant ha 1 y is the actual individual plant yield in corresponding with x unit is g in the three experimental years a linear regression model was fitted for each planting pattern based on the natural logarithm of the individual plant yield lny versus the stand density according to eq 5 the r2 values were above 0 90 caculated by spss 22 0 ibm manufacture usa 6 yosd explny 7 yosd osd yosd individual plant yield yosd unit is g were estimated using the lny values eq 6 the crop yield at the osd yosd unit is t ha 1 was estimated as the product of the individual plant yield at osd yosd unit is g and the estimated osd 105 plant ha 1 eq 7 the optimal plant distance was converted from the osd 2 4 statistical analysis all data obtained from each sampling event were analyzed separately by spss 22 0 ibm manufacture usa the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 if the f tests were significant at a probability level of 0 05 was used for the comparisons of mean values from treatments all figures in this paper were performed using sigmaplot 10 0 3 results 3 1 soil moisture the swc profiles in the 0 200 cm soil layer during the jointing and filling stages are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively due to the rainfall characteristics shown in fig 1 the soil moisture varied among the three experimental years where it was generally higher during 2013 than the other two experimental years in the early vegetative growth stage vgs the rainfall in 2014 was higher than that in 2015 whereas in the late reproductive growth stage rgs the rainfall in 2015 was higher than that in 2014 there were also significant differences among the different planting densities and patterns regardless of the experimental year and growth stage as the planting density increased the soil moisture tended to decrease and the differences in swc were mainly detected in the soil layers above 100 cm during the late jointing stage by contrast in the filling stage the deeper soil water was consumed and thus there were difference among the planting densities in the deeper soil layers especially during 2014 in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 under t the swc in 100 cm soil layers decreased to close to the wilting water content of 8 3 especially with a high planting density as shown in fig 4 d and f however r effectively alleviated the soil drought condition where the average improvements in swc in the 0 120 cm soil layer were 9 2 and 18 0 during 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 2 et in the vgs and rgs et was significantly influenced by the planting pattern and planting density table 3 in 2014 the amount of et in the vgs was clearly lower than that in the other two years r always obtained a significantly lower et than t under the same planting density regardless of the year and growth stage where the total et was reduced by 23 5 mm 26 6 mm 42 0 mm at the three planting densities on average during 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 5 there was a positive correlation between the planting density and et where the high planting density obtained a significantly higher et especially in the vgs however it should be noted that the high planting density did not improve the et in the rgs during the dry year when planting densities increased from d2 to d3 the et in the rgs did not increase significantly during 2014 and it decreased significantly during 2015 3 3 individual and population agronomic traits according to our analyses of the plant height and biomass during the jointing and harvest stages we found that as the planting density increased the plant height tended to increase in the vgs whereas it decreased in the rgs fig 6 the biomass tended to increase regardless of the growth stage where the dry matter accumulated in the jointing stage accounted for 11 2 30 8 of the total and it tended to increase with the planting density fig 7 during 2015 the planting density did not significantly affect the biomass in the rgs in addition compared with t r obtained a slightly higher plant height but a relatively lower biomass especially in the rainy year of 2013 moreover we analyzed the grain weight per ear 1000 seed weight and hi in the border row r b and middle row r m under r as shown in fig 8 we found that r b had a significantly greater effect under r where the grain weight per plant and hi were significantly higher compared with r m but the 1000 seed weight did not differ significantly as the planting density increased the grain weight per ear 1000 seed weight and hi all tended to decrease under both r b and r m but there was a greater reduction under r m from planting densities of d2 to d3 3 4 yield and crop water productivity the grain yield and yield components during 2013 2014 and 2015 are shown in table 4 the planting pattern and density did not have consistent effects on the grain yield in the three experimental years r improved individual traits i e the grain weight per plant 1000 seed weight seed number per ear and hi but increasing the planting density had the opposite effect compared with t r obtained a significantly lower grain yield in the rainy year of 2013 but there were slight non significant increases in the yield in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 in the rainy year of 2013 the individual traits tended to decrease as the planting density increased and the greatest grain yield was obtained under the highest planting density regardless of the planting pattern and it was clearly higher than that in the other two years however the effects of the planting density differed among the years and planting patterns under r during 2014 the highest yield was 6 078 t ha 1 with d3 planting spacing of 5 5 cm and it was slightly higher 2 4 p 0 05 than that with d2 planting spacing of 7 5 cm by contrast during 2015 the highest yield was 5 694 t ha 1 with d2 planting spacing of 7 5 cm but under the higher planting density of d3 there was a significant reduction in the yield of 15 9 under t the highest yields were 5 928 and 5 489 t ha 1 during 2014 and 2015 respectively and both were achieved with d2 we also found that border rows contributed 68 7 76 7 to the total yield under r where the contribution increased with the planting density increasing as shown in fig 9 the osd yosd and optimal planting distance results are shown in table 5 osd generally ranked in the order of 2013 2014 2015 which was related to the water and nutrient conditions in different years compared with t osd was relatively lower under r but the optimal population in the furrow was higher under r with increases of 24 1 13 9 and 6 7 during 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the optimal planting distances under r were determined as 6 05 and 8 71 cm which were consistent with the actual planting distance of 7 5 cm in the rainy year of 2013 the crop water productivity wp was significantly lower under r than t and the wue increased with the planting density however in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 the wp was significantly higher under r compared with t at the same planting density a higher planting density did not increase the wp fig 10 which tended to decrease at the planting densities of d2 and d3 and the maximum wp values of 17 5 and 13 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 were obtained by r combined with d2 during 2014 and 2015 respectively 4 discussion the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting planting r can improve the rainfall use efficiency and swc in dryland farming in semiarid regions our results also indicated that r could improve the soil moisture in soil layers above 120 cm depth to meet the crop water requirements in both the jointing and filling stages regardless of the rainfall pattern employed these benefits can be explained by the effects of rainwater harvesting and plastic film mulching which improved the retention of water in the soil and reduced soil evaporation zhang et al 2017 as well as by the lower population per unit area under r compared with traditional flat planting t at the same planting density which reduced crop transpiration to some extent thus our findings indicate that r could significantly reduce et as also shown by wen et al 2012 and wang et al 2015 although some other studies found that r could increase crop transpiration with a higher total et ren et al 2008b li et al 2013 qin et al 2014 mainly because the latter studies focused on wide row crops such as maize and potato where there is no land loss problem under r high planting density always lead to soil water content decreases due to crop transpiration increasing el hendawy et al 2008 magaia et al 2017 we also found that the soil moisture was affected by different planting densities in addition the et only increased significantly with the planting density increasing when the field water conditions were adequate such as in the rainy year of 2013 and with an early vegetative growth stage vgs in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 but there was no significant effect on et in the late reproductive growth stage rgs where it even tended to decrease according to our results the soil moisture and et were mainly determined by excessive water consumption in the vgs under the high planting population but less rainfall subsequently led to soil drought conditions in the rgs we found that the swc in some layers was close to the wilting coefficient in the filling stage under t fig 4 d and f and the soil moisture was not sufficient to meet the high water consumption demand with a high plant population however due to the relatively lower plant population and better soil water conditions we found that r could alleviate the soil drought conditions in the rgs to some extent water and nutrients are relatively deficient for dryland farming and thus it is important to allocate reasonable resources to different crop growth stages in order to ensure that an adequate yield is obtained we found that the dry matter accumulation in the vgs accounted for no more than 40 of the total biomass but about 50 of the total et occurred thereby leading to a water deficit in the rgs in addition the growth of individual plants was good in the vgs but due to competition for light energy resources the plant height tended to increase with the planting density with adequate water and nutrients but there was a clear decrease trend in the rgs fig 6e and f in addition hi tended to decrease as the planting density increased as shown in some previous studies berenguer and faci 2001 clerget et al 2016 thereby demonstrating that plant growth was restricted in the rgs probably due to intragroup competition insufficient water and nutrient resources poor light and ventilation and other factors in dry years water is the main limiting factor during 2014 and 2015 we found that a lack of water was the main factor that restricted millet growth in the rgs according to the soil moisture and hi level the greatly reduced growth during 2015 was probably related to the lower basal nutrient condition levels as shown in table 1 the individual plant yield and traits were lower with higher plant populations but a higher grain yield was obtained per ground area compared with a lower planting density buxton et al 1977 nichols et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 in rainy years we suggest that a high planting density can achieve the largest grain yield whereas a high plant population would not be suitable in dry years and thus a moderate planting density could obtain a better grain yield this conclusion is similar to that given in another study of the effects of the planting density el hendawy et al 2008 previous studies have shown that r is not appropriate for rainy years and regions ren et al 2008b lian et al 2016 we also found that the yield under r was lower compared with t in the rainy year of 2013 especially with a high planting density and thus r was not a high yield pattern however in dry years r obtained slightly higher grain yields than t under the optimal planting density although the biomass was lower we also found that r significantly improved individual plant growth i e the plant height and grain weight per ear and more assimilates were partitioned to the reproductive organs thus the hi was significantly better compared with t and improved individual plant growth may be an important mechanism responsible for the yield increases with r due to the lower et and higher grain yield r significantly improved the crop water productivity in dry years in addition using broad rows between the plants contributed greatly to the enhanced yield under r due to population and marginal effects ding et al 2006 wei et al 2018 the contribution of broad rows tended to increase with the planting density and thus using broad rows may further increase the yield under r selecting a reasonable planting density is essential for achieving a better yield of millet which depends on the variety water nutrients light and other environmental factors turgut et al 2005 tokatlidis et al 2011 in the present study we found that a low planting density did not obtain a high yield and crop water productivity the yield could be improved by increasing the planting density and r combined with a moderate planting density obtained a better yield and crop water productivity in addition according to the osd results table 5 the optimal planting density in the furrows under r was always higher compared with that under t in all three years we assume that the increased planting density in the furrows could fully exploit the benefits due to broad rows and compensate for the relatively low population due to the lost land area usage under r 5 conclusion the results of our field experiment indicate that r is appropriate for foxtail millet production in semiarid areas of china r could mitigate the water deficit in the reproductive growth stage and the individual growth restrictions under a high planting density to some degree to obtain a better hi and thus increasing the planting density may compensate for the decreased population compared with t therefore we recommended increasing the planting density in the furrows to improve the grain yield and crop water productivity under r where a moderate planting density should be suitable for foxtail millet d2

10587,the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh planting system has many advantages for improving the use of water during dryland farming in semiarid areas but the optimally matched planting density for maximizing the productivity of foxtail millet is not known therefore field experiments were conducted during 2013 2015 to determine the soil water content with depth evapotranspiration et agronomic traits grain yield and crop water productivity under different planting densities when using rfrh planting width of ridge and furrow is 60 cm three rows were planted in furrow compared with traditional flat planting the results show that a high planting density would lead to soil drought conditions in the late reproductive growth stage with reductions in individual plant traits and the harvest index hi in dry years however we found that rfrh planting could reduce et and improve the soil water content at 0 120 cm soil layers in the jointing and filling stages as well as mitigating the crop water deficit in the reproductive growth stage and the decreased hi caused by a high planting density compared with traditional flat planting rfrh planting decreased the foxtail millet grain yield in the rainy year 2013 due to the relatively lower plant population but it increased the yield in the normal rainfall years of 2014 and 2015 as well as significantly improving the crop water productivity by 7 9 and 14 0 under the optimized planting density respectively a relatively higher optimal planting density was always obtained in the furrows under rfrh planting compared with traditional flat planting in all three experimental years based on these results we recommend increasing the planting density in the furrows to increase the grain yield and crop water productivity under rfrh planting with a moderate planting density for foxtail millet three rows in a 60 cm wide furrow and a plant spacing of 7 5 cm in semiarid regions of china keywords dryland foxtail millet planting density soil water content crop water productivity 1 introduction rainfall is always scarce and unpredictable in arid and semiarid areas and thus drought and water shortages are the main choke points that prevent increases in crop productivity gan et al 2009 in particular in rain fed farming areas where precipitation is the only source of water for agricultural production the only option for increasing agricultural production and sustainable development is increasing the rainwater use efficiency by rainwater harvesting and mulching deng et al 2006 in recent years many field studies have shown that ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system is an effective and simple method for increasing the soil water content swc and improving the rainwater use efficiency in dryland farming ren et al 2008a li et al 2016 in the rfrh system the plastic mulched ridges provide a runoff surface that directs rainwater to the furrows so it can penetrate deeper into the soil li and gong 2002 tian et al 2003 as well as reducing the loss of soil water by evaporation from the ridges and extending the period of moisture availability for crops zhang et al 2007 liu et al 2014 therefore rfrh system has been applied in arid and semiarid rain fed areas as an innovative approach for increasing the crop water availability improving soil productivity and enhancing food security gan et al 2013 another important factor related to a high grain yield is a reasonable crop population structure which is fundamental for coordinating the relationships among the yield components i e the spike number grain number and grain weight as well as for fully exploiting light energy water and fertilizer resources the most suitable planting density is determined by the crop genotype and it is also affected by the water and fertilizer conditions in the environment sangoi et al 2003 liu et al 2012 amelong et al 2017 in dryland agriculture the field water conditions should be considered when optimizing the crop planting density because a high density will increase crop transpiration whereas a low density will increase the bare land area and soil evaporation many studies have shown that a reasonable planting density can improve the water use efficiency by increasing the ratio of crop transpiration relative to evapotranspiration et in addition a reasonable leaf area and crop canopy are very important for fully exploiting the available light heitholt et al 1992 de bruin and pedersen 2008 thereby improving the crop productivity and water use efficiency in dryland farming yang et al 2009 jia et al 2018 in the rfrh system land loss problems occur with densely planted crops when the row spacing is narrower than the ridge width wang et al 2015 lian et al 2017 which has a negative effect on yield increases because a relatively lower plant population is obtained compared with traditional flat planting ultimately the response in terms of the yield under rfrhp is due to a combination of the improved water conditions but a reduced plant population because of the decreased land area and thus the suitability of rfrh system is related to the regional rainfall characteristics crop species and ridge width ren et al 2008b found that the yield increase under rfrh system depended on the amount of precipitation where the effect was weaker with more rainfall and many other studies have also shown that rfrh system is only effective in arid and semiarid areas zhou et al 2009 it is well known that rfrh planting can significantly improve the water and fertilizer conditions in the planting furrow lian et al 2017 where this superior growing environment can support a larger population thus the problem of the reduced planting area can be solved by increasing the crop planting density in the furrow however some studies have shown that planting an excessive density of spring wheat in the furrows leads to intense competition and the death of the tillers in the middle row thereby decreasing the yield under rfrh system cui et al 2009 wang and dong 2011 whereas increasing the planting density is effective for achieving a high yield in maize wang and yin 2011 thus the optimum planting density is determined by many factors such as the crop variety water and fertilizer environment but few studies have considered the most appropriate planting density for rfrh system therefore it is necessary to determine the response in terms of the yield to different planting densities under rfrh system in dryland farming foxtail millet setaria italic l originates from northern china and it is an important annual gramineae cereal food crop with good nutritional value jones and liu 2009 ning et al 2017 due to its superior adaptability to arid and barren lands compared with other crops as well as its stress resistance and good nutritional value foxtail millet plays an important role in agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions throughout the world veeranagamallaiah et al 2008 due to increases in the global population and water shortages it is important to further improve the water use efficiency in order to ensure food security in recent years our research group has investigated the rfrh system with ridge and furrow both at widths of 60 cm since the dryland farming project started in china during 1995 we have demonstrated that yield increases can be obtained under rfrh system which is suitable for most crops i e maize millet and wheat wang et al 2000 ding et al 2007 wei et al 2018 and is also conducive to mechanization in the present study we conducted a field trial with foxtail millet to improve the yield and wue by optimizing the planting density in a semiarid area based on comparisons with the traditional flat planting in this study we investigated that the effect of rfrh system at different planting densities on the soil moisture contents and water consumption in various soil layers individual and population agronomic traits grain yield formation and crop water productivity of foxtail millet compared with traditional flat planting in order to recommend a reasonable planting density for rfrh system in semiarid areas we expect that the results of this study will provide a theoretical basis for improving the application of rfrh system in semiarid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were conducted from early april to late september during 2013 2015 the experimental site is situated at the pengyang dryland agricultural research station in ningxia province china 106 45 n 35 79 e 1800 m above sea level which locates in a typical semiarid dryland agriculture region in a hilly and gully area of the loess plateau with an average annual precipitation of 410 mm and an average annual evaporation from a free water surface of about 1000 mm according to the fao unesco soil classification system the soil at the research sit was confirmed as a calcic cambisol 14 sand 26 silt and 60 clay with a ph potentiometric method the ratio of soil water equal to 1 of 8 5 and a mean bulk density cutting ring method of 1 34 g cm 3 as for other soil properties the average gravimetric field water capacity was 22 4 while the permanent wilting point was 8 3 precipitations were collected using an automatic weather station ws std1 delta t cambridge uk close to the experimental field from 2013 to 2015 the precipitations during the growth period were respectively 537 295 and 305 mm and the daily rainfall distributions are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the continuous cropping of foxtail millet can cause many problems such as toxic substances accumulation plant diseases insect pests as well as weeds overgrowth so we respectively selected three adjacent fields in the experimental site in 2013 2015 the key chemical properties of the 0 40 cm soil layer in each year are shown in table 1 the experiment used split plot design with the two planting patterns r rfrh planting t traditional flat planting as the main plot and three replicates were set for each treatment the subplots received three different planting densities comprising d1 with a plant spacing of 10 cm d2 with a plant spacing of 7 5 cm and d3 with a plant spacing of 5 5 cm three rows of millet were planted in each furrow under r and the row spacing was 30 cm under t schematic illustrations of the r and t patterns are shown in fig 2 the corresponding population number per unit area for each treatment is shown in table 2 the length and width of each plot were 5 0 m 3 6 m the ridge and furrow widths were both 60 cm the ridge height was 15 cm with mulched transparent plastic film and the fertilizers were applied in the furrow area the thickness of plastic film was 0 008 mm produced by tianshui tianbao plastic industry ltd gansu china and the fertilizers comprised urea china petroleum ningxia petrochemical production company and diammonium phosphate yunnan three circles sinochem fertilizer co ltd us sheng which respectively contained 46 0 nitrogen and 46 0 p2o5 plus 18 0 nitrogen the plowing of the entire experimental area was performed 20 days before marking out the plots and sowing each year a 60 cm wide border between neighboring plots was set to reduce seepage 10 days before sowing all the nitrogen and phosphorus were evenly spread over the plot the whole area of the plot for t and the furrow area only for r and plowed into the deep soil layer 20 cm with a spade from 2013 2015 the foxtail millet variety datong 29 no tillering was sown on april 23 29 and 24 respectively the plants were thinned at the seedling and the sixth leaf stage according to the specified plant distance the crops were respectively harvested at the end of september in all three tested years irrigation was not supplied throughout this study and weeds were manually controlled when it was required 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture and et a soil ferric auger was used to sample the soil cores to a depth of 200 cm at intervals of 20 cm in the different millet growth stages each year by measuring the wet soil weight and its dried constant weight at 105 c we obtained the gravimetric g g 1 soil water content swc in the 0 200 cm profile if rainfall happened to occur during the due sample period a 2 5 days delay which differed with the amount of rainfall was required until the rainwater leakage reached a balance for the r plots the soil cores were sampled from a furrow the side of a furrow and the middle of a ridge where the mean value of the three different positions was regarded as swc as for the t plots the soil cores were taken from the center of two contiguous rows the soil water storage sws was calculated as the following equation 1 s w s i n c i œÅ i h i 10 where sws represents the amount of stored soil water mm ci œÅi and hi respectively represents the soil gravimetric water content the soil bulk density g cm 3 and the soil depth cm the evapotranspiration et mm from each treatment was determined by the soil water balance equation as follows li et al 2013 2 e t p Œ¥ s w s d r g i where p

represents the surface runoff mm the groundwater recharge mm and the irrigation mm since the field was flat no irrigation was supplied and the groundwater table was at a depth of about 50 m in the experimental area thus i g and r were beyond our concern in eq 2 field water capacity of loess soil is extremely strong and in our study under normal conditions all of the rainfall could be stored by the upper 200 cm layer therefore little leakage reached below 200 cm but owing to the strong and continuous rainfall 189 mm rainfall from 81 to 89 days after sowing in 2013 the swc at 200 cm exceeded the field water holding capacity and the drainage occurred below 200 cm according to previous study liu et al 1996 the upper 120 cm soil layer distributed over 95 of the foxtail millet root system thus from 95 days after sowing to the harvest in 2013 the change of sws in the 120 200 cm soil depth could be used to estimate the drainage 2 3 2 plant height and biomass from the jointing stage to maturity stage the plant heights were determined by the averaged data of 10 representative plants selected from each plot to calculate the aboveground biomass three rows of millet with a length of 1 m from the middle of each plot were sampled and the aboveground biomass was determined by the method of oven drying first at 105 c for 1 h and then under 70 c until constant weight 2 3 3 yield and harvest index hi during the harvest three rows of millet with a length of 2 m from the middle of each plot were harvested by hand and all data of weight were determined based on a water content of 12 which include the seed the 1000 seed weigh as well as aboveground biomass yields for r the samples from each plot were taken separately for the border row r b and the middle row r m hi was calculated as the proportion of millet grain yield relative to the total above ground biomass 2 3 4 crop water productivity wp the following equation was used for the calculating of crop water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 3 wp y et where y and et represents the grain yield of foxtail millet kg ha 1 and the crop evapotranspiration mm respectively 2 3 5 optimal stand density osd as described by duncan 1958 and amelong et al 2017 osd was estimated as follows 4 osd 1 2 303b 5 lny a bx where osd is the optimal stand density unit is 105 plant ha 1 the parameter b is the slope of the linear regression calculated with eq 4 it is constant in each linear regression x is the actual planting density unit is 105 plant ha 1 y is the actual individual plant yield in corresponding with x unit is g in the three experimental years a linear regression model was fitted for each planting pattern based on the natural logarithm of the individual plant yield lny versus the stand density according to eq 5 the r2 values were above 0 90 caculated by spss 22 0 ibm manufacture usa 6 yosd explny 7 yosd osd yosd individual plant yield yosd unit is g were estimated using the lny values eq 6 the crop yield at the osd yosd unit is t ha 1 was estimated as the product of the individual plant yield at osd yosd unit is g and the estimated osd 105 plant ha 1 eq 7 the optimal plant distance was converted from the osd 2 4 statistical analysis all data obtained from each sampling event were analyzed separately by spss 22 0 ibm manufacture usa the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 if the f tests were significant at a probability level of 0 05 was used for the comparisons of mean values from treatments all figures in this paper were performed using sigmaplot 10 0 3 results 3 1 soil moisture the swc profiles in the 0 200 cm soil layer during the jointing and filling stages are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively due to the rainfall characteristics shown in fig 1 the soil moisture varied among the three experimental years where it was generally higher during 2013 than the other two experimental years in the early vegetative growth stage vgs the rainfall in 2014 was higher than that in 2015 whereas in the late reproductive growth stage rgs the rainfall in 2015 was higher than that in 2014 there were also significant differences among the different planting densities and patterns regardless of the experimental year and growth stage as the planting density increased the soil moisture tended to decrease and the differences in swc were mainly detected in the soil layers above 100 cm during the late jointing stage by contrast in the filling stage the deeper soil water was consumed and thus there were difference among the planting densities in the deeper soil layers especially during 2014 in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 under t the swc in 100 cm soil layers decreased to close to the wilting water content of 8 3 especially with a high planting density as shown in fig 4 d and f however r effectively alleviated the soil drought condition where the average improvements in swc in the 0 120 cm soil layer were 9 2 and 18 0 during 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 2 et in the vgs and rgs et was significantly influenced by the planting pattern and planting density table 3 in 2014 the amount of et in the vgs was clearly lower than that in the other two years r always obtained a significantly lower et than t under the same planting density regardless of the year and growth stage where the total et was reduced by 23 5 mm 26 6 mm 42 0 mm at the three planting densities on average during 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 5 there was a positive correlation between the planting density and et where the high planting density obtained a significantly higher et especially in the vgs however it should be noted that the high planting density did not improve the et in the rgs during the dry year when planting densities increased from d2 to d3 the et in the rgs did not increase significantly during 2014 and it decreased significantly during 2015 3 3 individual and population agronomic traits according to our analyses of the plant height and biomass during the jointing and harvest stages we found that as the planting density increased the plant height tended to increase in the vgs whereas it decreased in the rgs fig 6 the biomass tended to increase regardless of the growth stage where the dry matter accumulated in the jointing stage accounted for 11 2 30 8 of the total and it tended to increase with the planting density fig 7 during 2015 the planting density did not significantly affect the biomass in the rgs in addition compared with t r obtained a slightly higher plant height but a relatively lower biomass especially in the rainy year of 2013 moreover we analyzed the grain weight per ear 1000 seed weight and hi in the border row r b and middle row r m under r as shown in fig 8 we found that r b had a significantly greater effect under r where the grain weight per plant and hi were significantly higher compared with r m but the 1000 seed weight did not differ significantly as the planting density increased the grain weight per ear 1000 seed weight and hi all tended to decrease under both r b and r m but there was a greater reduction under r m from planting densities of d2 to d3 3 4 yield and crop water productivity the grain yield and yield components during 2013 2014 and 2015 are shown in table 4 the planting pattern and density did not have consistent effects on the grain yield in the three experimental years r improved individual traits i e the grain weight per plant 1000 seed weight seed number per ear and hi but increasing the planting density had the opposite effect compared with t r obtained a significantly lower grain yield in the rainy year of 2013 but there were slight non significant increases in the yield in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 in the rainy year of 2013 the individual traits tended to decrease as the planting density increased and the greatest grain yield was obtained under the highest planting density regardless of the planting pattern and it was clearly higher than that in the other two years however the effects of the planting density differed among the years and planting patterns under r during 2014 the highest yield was 6 078 t ha 1 with d3 planting spacing of 5 5 cm and it was slightly higher 2 4 p 0 05 than that with d2 planting spacing of 7 5 cm by contrast during 2015 the highest yield was 5 694 t ha 1 with d2 planting spacing of 7 5 cm but under the higher planting density of d3 there was a significant reduction in the yield of 15 9 under t the highest yields were 5 928 and 5 489 t ha 1 during 2014 and 2015 respectively and both were achieved with d2 we also found that border rows contributed 68 7 76 7 to the total yield under r where the contribution increased with the planting density increasing as shown in fig 9 the osd yosd and optimal planting distance results are shown in table 5 osd generally ranked in the order of 2013 2014 2015 which was related to the water and nutrient conditions in different years compared with t osd was relatively lower under r but the optimal population in the furrow was higher under r with increases of 24 1 13 9 and 6 7 during 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the optimal planting distances under r were determined as 6 05 and 8 71 cm which were consistent with the actual planting distance of 7 5 cm in the rainy year of 2013 the crop water productivity wp was significantly lower under r than t and the wue increased with the planting density however in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 the wp was significantly higher under r compared with t at the same planting density a higher planting density did not increase the wp fig 10 which tended to decrease at the planting densities of d2 and d3 and the maximum wp values of 17 5 and 13 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 were obtained by r combined with d2 during 2014 and 2015 respectively 4 discussion the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting planting r can improve the rainfall use efficiency and swc in dryland farming in semiarid regions our results also indicated that r could improve the soil moisture in soil layers above 120 cm depth to meet the crop water requirements in both the jointing and filling stages regardless of the rainfall pattern employed these benefits can be explained by the effects of rainwater harvesting and plastic film mulching which improved the retention of water in the soil and reduced soil evaporation zhang et al 2017 as well as by the lower population per unit area under r compared with traditional flat planting t at the same planting density which reduced crop transpiration to some extent thus our findings indicate that r could significantly reduce et as also shown by wen et al 2012 and wang et al 2015 although some other studies found that r could increase crop transpiration with a higher total et ren et al 2008b li et al 2013 qin et al 2014 mainly because the latter studies focused on wide row crops such as maize and potato where there is no land loss problem under r high planting density always lead to soil water content decreases due to crop transpiration increasing el hendawy et al 2008 magaia et al 2017 we also found that the soil moisture was affected by different planting densities in addition the et only increased significantly with the planting density increasing when the field water conditions were adequate such as in the rainy year of 2013 and with an early vegetative growth stage vgs in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 but there was no significant effect on et in the late reproductive growth stage rgs where it even tended to decrease according to our results the soil moisture and et were mainly determined by excessive water consumption in the vgs under the high planting population but less rainfall subsequently led to soil drought conditions in the rgs we found that the swc in some layers was close to the wilting coefficient in the filling stage under t fig 4 d and f and the soil moisture was not sufficient to meet the high water consumption demand with a high plant population however due to the relatively lower plant population and better soil water conditions we found that r could alleviate the soil drought conditions in the rgs to some extent water and nutrients are relatively deficient for dryland farming and thus it is important to allocate reasonable resources to different crop growth stages in order to ensure that an adequate yield is obtained we found that the dry matter accumulation in the vgs accounted for no more than 40 of the total biomass but about 50 of the total et occurred thereby leading to a water deficit in the rgs in addition the growth of individual plants was good in the vgs but due to competition for light energy resources the plant height tended to increase with the planting density with adequate water and nutrients but there was a clear decrease trend in the rgs fig 6e and f in addition hi tended to decrease as the planting density increased as shown in some previous studies berenguer and faci 2001 clerget et al 2016 thereby demonstrating that plant growth was restricted in the rgs probably due to intragroup competition insufficient water and nutrient resources poor light and ventilation and other factors in dry years water is the main limiting factor during 2014 and 2015 we found that a lack of water was the main factor that restricted millet growth in the rgs according to the soil moisture and hi level the greatly reduced growth during 2015 was probably related to the lower basal nutrient condition levels as shown in table 1 the individual plant yield and traits were lower with higher plant populations but a higher grain yield was obtained per ground area compared with a lower planting density buxton et al 1977 nichols et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 in rainy years we suggest that a high planting density can achieve the largest grain yield whereas a high plant population would not be suitable in dry years and thus a moderate planting density could obtain a better grain yield this conclusion is similar to that given in another study of the effects of the planting density el hendawy et al 2008 previous studies have shown that r is not appropriate for rainy years and regions ren et al 2008b lian et al 2016 we also found that the yield under r was lower compared with t in the rainy year of 2013 especially with a high planting density and thus r was not a high yield pattern however in dry years r obtained slightly higher grain yields than t under the optimal planting density although the biomass was lower we also found that r significantly improved individual plant growth i e the plant height and grain weight per ear and more assimilates were partitioned to the reproductive organs thus the hi was significantly better compared with t and improved individual plant growth may be an important mechanism responsible for the yield increases with r due to the lower et and higher grain yield r significantly improved the crop water productivity in dry years in addition using broad rows between the plants contributed greatly to the enhanced yield under r due to population and marginal effects ding et al 2006 wei et al 2018 the contribution of broad rows tended to increase with the planting density and thus using broad rows may further increase the yield under r selecting a reasonable planting density is essential for achieving a better yield of millet which depends on the variety water nutrients light and other environmental factors turgut et al 2005 tokatlidis et al 2011 in the present study we found that a low planting density did not obtain a high yield and crop water productivity the yield could be improved by increasing the planting density and r combined with a moderate planting density obtained a better yield and crop water productivity in addition according to the osd results table 5 the optimal planting density in the furrows under r was always higher compared with that under t in all three years we assume that the increased planting density in the furrows could fully exploit the benefits due to broad rows and compensate for the relatively low population due to the lost land area usage under r 5 conclusion the results of our field experiment indicate that r is appropriate for foxtail millet production in semiarid areas of china r could mitigate the water deficit in the reproductive growth stage and the individual growth restrictions under a high planting density to some degree to obtain a better hi and thus increasing the planting density may compensate for the decreased population compared with t therefore we recommended increasing the planting density in the furrows to improve the grain yield and crop water productivity under r where a moderate planting density should be suitable for foxtail millet d2

10588,this study was conducted to investigate the effects of plant density planting method and irrigation regime on water productivity and yield of sugar beet for two years during 2017 and 2018 the planted cultivar was shokoofa with three irrigation levels 100 75 and 50 of the full irrigation 1368 mm in 2017 and 1412 mm in 2018 as i100 i75 and i50 respectively two planting methods direct seeding d and transplanting t and four planting densities 180 000 135 000 90 000 and 45 000 plants ha 1 as p180 p135 p90 and p45 respectively transplanting reduced applied water by about 24 and evapotranspiration about 25 as compared with direct seeding decreasing irrigation level the root yield decreased about 7 4 in i75 to 26 4 in i50 as compared with i100 the difference between white sugar yield in i100 and i75 were not significant but decreased significantly 17 in i50 as compared to i100 and i75 the root yield and white sugar yield in p90 treatment were higher than other treatments the values of irrigation water productivity wpirrig and white sugar yield water productivity wpwsy increased by 21 7 in i75 to 35 2 in i50 and 26 3 in i75 to 41 7 in i50 respectively as compared to i100 the difference between wpc in i75 and i50 were not significant and increased about 16 1 as compared to i100 transplanting increased the root yield 7 7 and wpc wpirrig and wpwsy 45 7 44 7 and 47 7 as compared with direct seeding the mean highest values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were 9 32 9 95 and 1 39 kg m 3 respectively in p3 treatment therefore in regions with scarce water resources combination of transplanting method and plant density of 90 000 plant ha 1 under deficit irrigation in the level of 75 of full irrigation is suggested to obtain optimum sugar beet yield keywords root yield deficit irrigation planting method white sugar yield sugar concentration 1 introduction sugar is one of the important food products in iranian diet and sugar beet is one of the most important sources of sugar sugar beet production has a history of one century in iran and grown mostly under irrigated conditions due to the arid and semi arid climate of iran the water shortage has become a key challenge in irrigated agriculture to address this problem the development and adoption of new water saving agricultural practices are necessary for providing high yields with low water application the ideal irrigation should signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce water application without reduction in crop yield yang et al 2015 a recently adopted water saving practice in arid areas is deÔ¨Åcit irrigation unl√º et al 2011 yang et al 2015 which is deÔ¨Åned as the application of water below full crop requirement for evapotranspiration oweis et al 2011 deÔ¨Åcit irrigation causes to decrease the excessive vegetation growth and therefore leads to higher water saving fernandez et al 2013 hernandez santana et al 2017 padilla d√≠az et al 2016 pereira et al 2012 the quantity and quality of sugar beet yield are affected by deficit irrigation depending upon different irrigation regimes and methods sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 1997 reported that every other furrow irrigation eofi at l0 day irrigation intervals used a smaller amount of irrigation water with some yield reduction in sugar beet however frequent eofi at 6 day intervals produced a similar root yield to that of every furrow irrigation efi at 10 day interval and saved an average of 23 of irrigation water under water stress condition sugar beet is able to develop the root system to absorb water from deeper soil layers the sugar beet internal reaction to water stress other than reduced growth is increased root sugar concentration in this regard abyaneh et al 2017 reported that the white sugar yield of sugar beet in partial root drying treatments is higher than that in regulated deficit irrigation treatments however sahin et al 2014 showed that the water stress lead to lower root and white sugar yield sugar beet yield can be affected by other factors such as planting method and plant population in sugar beet cultivation the direct seeding method due to higher plant susceptibility in early growth stage to frost has a negative effect on yields transplanting method is defined as germinating seeds and growing seedlings in a controlled environment like a greenhouse and transplanting seedlings in the farm draycott 2006 in transplanting method the environmental factors and protection from predators wind and birds are controlled better than direct seeding method brown et al 2015 wang et al 2012 also transplanting is an effective method under late planting condition and therefore the yield reduction in this condition is lower as compared with direct seeding method dehqani et al 2015 haghighikhah et al 2017 safi et al 2018 investigated the effect of transplanting and direct seeding method on canola yield under deficit irrigation the results showed that the planting method had significant effect on grain and oil yield in addition due to sugar beet susceptibility to salinity at early growth stage using transplanting method is useful to produce sugar beet under salinity condition transplanting method is one way to save more water to increase water productivity wp in sugar beet cultivation due to the fact that in direct seeding method sugar beet seeds require a lot of irrigation water to germinate while by transplanting method the early irrigations are eliminated and water productivity is improved optimizing plant density is a key factor influencing many aspects of cultural practices including susceptibility to pathogens water and fertilizer requirements jin et al 2017 dai et al 2014 when the plant population increased over the optimal level competition between the plants becomes intense and therefore the plant growth becomes slow and the yield is decreased chaudhary et al 2015 haghverdi et al 2017 reported that the population rates of 104 000 plants ha 1 resulted in higher sugar beet yield plant density per unit area of cultivated land is a major factor in determining the quality and quantity of the sugar beet roots for example the optimum plant density causes a larger leaf area that increases transpiration and receives higher sunlight and therefore enhances the performance of photosynthesis and increase the root dry matter proportion marchiori et al 2014 optimal plant populations of 130 000 150 000 plants ha 1 khaiti 2012 and 90 000 plants ha 1 jafarnia et al 2013 have been observed to achieve maximum recoverable white sugar and sugar beet root yield the effects of deÔ¨Åcit irrigation on sugar beet yield and quality of yield component can be determined by a number of agronomic factors interaction effects of deÔ¨Åcit irrigation and planting date nassar 2006 deÔ¨Åcit irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer abyaneh et al 2017 and the interaction effect of irrigation surface residue cover and plant population haghverdi et al 2017 on sugar beet growth and quality of yield component have been investigated however almost few studies have been done for the interaction effect of plant density and planting method direct seeding and transplanting under different irrigation regimes on quantity and quality of sugar beet yield and the advantages of using transplanting method under deÔ¨Åcit irrigation for sugar beet production the aim of this research was to investigate the effects of planting method transplanting and direct seeding methods and plant density under different irrigation regimes on root yield and water productivity of sugar beet in bajgah fars province a semi arid region of iran 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental sites to evaluate the effect of plant density and planting method direct seeding and transplanting under different irrigation regimes on the yield yield components and quality of sugar beet a two years Ô¨Åeld experiment was conducted during the growing season 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 at the research station of agricultural school shiraz university shiraz iran located 16 km north of shiraz 29¬∫ 36 n 52¬∫ 32 e 1810 m above the mean sea level the climate of the area is semi arid with a mean annual rainfall of about 386 mm averaged soil physical properties of the experimental site are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the experimental design was split split plot arrangement in complete randomized blocks with three irrigation regimes of 100 i100 75 i75 and 50 i50 of full irrigation as the main plot two planting methods including direct seeding d and transplanting t as subplot and four plant densities including 180 000 plant ha 1 p180 135 000 plant ha 1 p135 90 000 plant ha 1 p90 and 45 000 plant ha 1 p45 as sub subplot with three replications each plot area had 2 m length and 2 m width with Ô¨Åve rows of planting plots were separated by 1 0 m to avoid the interference of irrigation water of the adjacent treatment in direct seeding planting the sugar beet seeds shokoofa cultivar were hand sown at 1 5 2 cm depths on april 11 2017 and april 4 2018 and irrigated sufficiently two time with amounts of 500 l for germination and establishment of plants with 6 8 leaves to withstand against the adverse effects of wind and frost in transplanting method the sugar beet seeds shokoofa cultivar were sown in japanese paper pots at april 15 2017 and april 8 2018 in the greenhouse and seedlings were ready to transplant when they had 4 6 true leaves on may 30 2017 and may 24 2018 for the first and second year of the experiment respectively when the plants were fixed well 6 8 true leaves after two times of full irrigation with amounts of 200 l the i100 treatment was irrigated with 100 of the crop water requirement based on increasing the soil water content to the soil field capacity in the root zone while i75 and i50 treatments were irrigated at 75 and 50 of the i100 treatment respectively the water was applied to each plot via pipe and measured by digital water flow meter for two years of experiment phosphorus as triple superphosphate at the rate of 150 kg ha 1 was applied uniformly to each plot before sowing the seeds at soil depth of 0 0 0 3 m nitrogen at a rate of 250 kg ha 1 as urea was applied when plants had 8 9 leaves after three weeks from last irrigation sugar beets from the three center rows of each plot were harvested on october 29 2017 and october 22 2018 for the first and second year of experiment respectively 2 3 soil water content and crop evapotranspiration before each irrigation soil water content at different depths 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 were measured by neutron probe apparatus model cpn 503 dr positioned in each plot with 7 days interval soil water content balance in the root zone was used to estimate the amount of net irrigation water for i100 100 full irrigation as follows 1 d 1000 f c i Œ∏ i Œ¥ z where d is the irrigation water depth mm fci and Œ∏vi are the field capacity and volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 before irrigation at ith soil layer respectively and Œ¥z is the thickness of ith soil layer m depth of root is estimated using the following equation raes et al 2016 2 z z i n i z x z i n i t t 0 2 t x t 0 2 n where z is the root depth m z i n i and z x is the minimum 0 3 m and maximum 1 8 m of root depth draycott 2006 respectively t is the cumulative growing degree day gdd for each day after planting t0 is the gdd from planting to seeds germination tx is the cumulative gdd from planting to maximum root depth and n is the shape factor 1 8 crop evapotranspiration was estimated using soil water balance method pradhan et al 2014 as follows 3 e t a i r r 0 d p d s where eta is the actual sugar beet evapotranspiration mm i is theirrigation water depth mm r is the precipitation mm and ro is the runoff mm which is assumed zero in this study dp is the deep percolation mm ds is the soil water content change mm between two irrigations in the plant root zone daily precipitation was obtained from the weather station located close to the experimental site if soil water content in the root zone were higher than the Ô¨Åeld capacity then any water movement to deeper soil layers can be considered as deep percolation ertek et al 2006a because the soil water content after each irrigation was reached fc level or lower than it for deficit irrigation treatments no deep percolation was considered in the field parvizi et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 2 4 yield yield components and quality at harvest by removing the shoots and leaves from the roots the weights of roots in each plot were measured using a digital balance and then five roots were randomly selected from each plot to measure root length root diameter and mean weight of one root the sugar concentration sc sodium concentration na and potassium concentration k and alpha amino nitrogen concentration Œ± n were measured using betalyser device model d 3016 sugar of molasses ms was calculated as follows reinefeld et al 1974 4 m s 0 343 k n a 0 094 Œ± n 0 31 where ms is the sugar concentration of molasses k is the potassium concentration mmol 100 g 1 root na is the sodium concentration mmol 100 g 1 root and Œ± n is the alpha amino nitrogen concentration mmol 100 g 1 root the white sugar concentration wsc and white sugar yield wsy kg ha 1 were calculated as follows 5 w s c s c m s 6 w s y w s c y where y is the root yield kg ha 1 the value of wuey usually used in older studies or wpc crop water productivity according to recent studies such as fernandez et al 2020 which both can be expressed as the total crop yield divided by the total water consumed total evapotranspiration over the crop growing season was determined for each treatment however in current study the second terminology wpc was used to present this term eq 7 in addition the values of irrigation water productivity wpirrig and white sugar yield water productivity wpwsy were calculated for each treatment as follows fernandez et al 2020 7 w p c y e t a 8 w p i r r i g y i 9 w p w s y w s y e t a where y is the root yield kg ha 1 eta is the actual sugar beet evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 obtained from water balance method and i is the irrigation depth m3 ha 1 and wsy is the white sugar yield in sugar beet kg ha 1 2 5 yield response factor ky the value of ky was estimated as advised by smith et al 2012 therefore using eq 10 the relative yield decrease per unit relative evapotranspiration deÔ¨Åcit can be estimated 10 k y 1 y a y m 1 e t a e t m where ya is the actual root yield in each treatment ym is the maximum root yield in control treatment i100 respectively eta is the actual evapotranspiration and etm is the maximum no stressed evapotranspiration in control i100 treatment respectively generally when the ky value is greater than 1 0 it represents that the crop is sensitive to water deficit and when its value is less than 1 0 it represents that crop reaction is not sensitive to water deficit and when ky value is equal to 1 0 it presents that the value of reduction in yield is directly proportional to the reduction of evapotranspiration smith et al 2012 2 6 stress tolerance index sti in order to compare the water stress tolerance in two planting methods direct seeding and transplanting the stress tolerance index sti was calculated as follows mahmoud et al 2018 11 s t i y n y s y n 2 where ys and yn are the sugar beet yields in water stress treatments and control respectively for direct seeding or transplanting methods yn is the mean yield of two planting methods under control condition according to fernandez 1992 planting method with high sti values is tolerant to water stress 2 7 data analysis mstatc plant and soil science department michigan state university software was used for analysis of variance and the mean comparison of the parameters was done using the least significant difference lsd test at significance level of 5 in addition the regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between root yield as well as white sugar yield versus the irrigation water and plant density using excel software version 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 water use total amount of rainfall during the growing period was 22 5 mm in 2017 that occurred in the first week and 55 mm in 2018 that occurred in the first and second week after planting the variation of mean maximum and minimum temperature and also mean relative humidity that were collected from a weather station close to the experimental site for the two experimental years are shown in fig 1 the total amounts of irrigation water and crop evapotranspiration for different irrigation water levels plant densities and planting methods are presented in table 2 the results showed that the transplanting method reduced the applied water by 25 and 23 in comparison with that obtained in the direct seeding method at the first and second growing season respectively the averaged eta for two years of experiment in i75 and i50 irrigation regimes decreased by 21 and 40 in the direct seeding method while 19 and 41 in transplanting method as compared with eta obtained in i100 irrigation level table 2 the average value of eta for all irrigation regimes and planting densities in the transplanting method decreased about 25 as compared with that obtained in the direct seeding method in general transplanting method reduced mean sugar beet evapotranspiration over all planting densities by 25 24 and 26 in i100 i75 and i50 irrigation regimes respectively as compared with those obtained in the direct seeding method table 2 3 2 soil water content the volumetric soil water content in root zone during the two growing seasons in p180 and p45 planting densities for i100 and i50 irrigation levels in the direct seeding and transplanting methods are shown in table 3 soil water content had almost the same value in all treatments at early growing season as a result of rainfall occurrence in winter and early spring it showed significant different due to applying different irrigation regimes and plant densities with regards to table 3 soil water content in i100 was higher than that obtained in i50 due to applying higher irrigation water in the two growing seasons in i100 irrigation level similar results were observed by shirahatti et al 2007 that the water stress condition depending on amount of water applied decreased soil water content soil water content in low planting density treatment p45 at all irrigation treatments and planting methods were almost significantly lower than those obtained in higher planting density treatment p180 from early to middle of the growing season as a result of lower canopy cover and therefore higher soil evaporation the soil water content was almost significantly increased from the middle to the end of the growing season in the density of p45 as a result of increasing canopy cover size and decreasing soil evaporation and also lower transpiration in low density treatment p45 as compared with that obtained in high density treatment p180 table 3 the value of soil water content in the transplanting method was higher than that obtained in the direct seeding method but these differences in some cases were not significant 3 3 root yield the differences between sugar beet yields were not significant over the two years of the study therefore the average values of root yield over two years of experiment were compared table 4 the effects of different irrigation water levels plant densities planting method and also the interaction effects of all treatments were significant table 4 by reduction in irrigation water level the sugar beet yield was decreased significantly by 7 4 and 26 4 in i75 and i50 respectively as compared with that obtained in i100 table 5 reduction in the root yield under low water level was due to decrease in the plant leaf area leaf photosynthesis and accordingly decreased storage materials in sugar beet root baigy et al 2012 reported the maximum root yield of 119 2 103 kg ha 1 in full irrigation level and the minimum root yield of 74 8 103 kg ha 1 in 50 deficit irrigation topak et al 2011 indicated that the sugar beet yield varied between 77 300 kg ha 1 for full irrigation and 28 100 kg ha 1 for 25 of full irrigation in semiarid climate of turkey abyaneh et al 2012 found that the highest and the lowest root yield was obtained as 116 8 mg ha 1 and 52 2 103 kg ha 1 under full and deficit irrigation respectively the sugar beet yield was increased by increasing the plant density from 68 73 103 kg ha 1 in 45 000 plant ha 1 p45 to 89 47 103 kg ha 1 in 90 000 plant ha 1 p90 and further increase in plant density was significantly decreased the sugar beet yield table 5 therefore among plant densities the minimum sugar beet yield was obtained in p180 180 000 plant ha 1 treatment in this regard the plant populations of 90 000 plants ha 1 was reported by jafarnia et al 2013 to obtain maximum recoverable white sucrose and root yield which is similar to the results obtained in this study as it is shown in table 5 the sugar beet yield in transplanting method was significantly higher 7 7 than that obtained in the direct seeding method the maximum and minimum values of sugar beet yield were obtained in i100p90 t 98 8 103 kg ha 1 and i50p180d 46 8 103 kg ha 1 while the differences between i100p90t and i100p90d were not significant comparing the interaction effects of plant density planting method and irrigation regimes on sugar beet yield indicated that in full irrigation level i100 there were no significant differences between sugar beet yield under transplanting and direct seeding methods in different plant densities while under irrigation level of i75 and i50 the sugar beet yield in the transplanting method was significantly higher than that obtained in the direct seeding method table 5 these results indicated that under water shortage condition the transplanting method is more efficient than direct seeding method in obtaining higher sugar beet yield the relationship between the root yield and irrigation water rainfall as well as plant density were fitted to the second order polynomial equations for each planting method and were shown in fig 2 a d the coefficient of determination for the regression models r2 ranged from 0 97 to 0 70 and all of the coefficients of equations were significant by p value 0 05 these results showed that there was a statistically significant relationship between root yield and irrigation water rainfall as well as between root yield and plant density the second order polynomial equations indicated that the root yield at first was increased by increasing irrigation rainfall and plant density up to a maximum potential yield after which it is decreased by increasing irrigation rainfall and also by increasing plant density due to the strong competition between plants at high planting density as it was mentioned before the fig 2a and c indicated that the maximum root yield was obtained in p90 plant density followed by p135 p45 and p180 in the direct seeding method fig 2a and followed by p135 p180 p45 in the transplanting method fig 2b and d showed that the root yield was decreased by decreasing the irrigation water by deriving the equations related to relationship between the root yield and density equations which are presented in fig 2b and c it can be concluded that in i100 treatment the maximum root yield was obtained in plant density of 107 plant ha 1 as 99 71 103 kg ha 1 in the direct seeding and in 109 plant ha 1 as 99 35 103 kg ha 1 in the transplanting method while in i75 and i50 it was obtained at plant density of 101 and 98 plant ha 1 as 90 103 kg ha 1 and 66 103 kg ha 1 respectively in the direct seeding method and at plant density of 104 and 101 plant ha 1 as 91 103 kg ha 1 and 77 103 kg ha 1 at the transplanting method 3 4 yield quality the differences between quality parameters were not significant over the two years of the study table 4 the results showed that the effects of different irrigation levels and plant densities on all quality parameters of sugar beet were significant the effects of planting methods were significant on root na concentration and white sugar yield at 5 level of probability while on other quality parameters it was not significant the interaction effect of irrigation regime planting method plant density planting method irrigation regime plant density and irrigation regime plant density planting method on k concentration Œ± amino n concentration molasses sugar concentration and white sugar yield was significant while on other quality parameters it was not significant table 4 the sugar concentration and white sugar concentration increased significantly by decreasing irrigation water level from 15 88 in i100 to 18 35 in i50 and 13 03 in i100 to 14 67 in i50 respectively increasing in sugar and white sugar concentration was due to the occurrence of osmotic adjustment under deficit irrigation condition topak et al 2011 observed an increase in sugar concentration as affected by deficit irrigation which increased from 18 81 to 21 42 ghamarnia et al 2012 indicated that under full and deficit irrigation the sugar concentration increased from 12 62 to 23 53 respectively the difference between white sugar yields in i100 11 08 103 kg ha 1 and i75 11 03 103 kg ha 1 irrigation levels were not significant while it decreased significantly by 17 in i50 irrigation level as compared with that obtained in i75 and i100 some studies also showed that increasing in water stress caused to decrease in white sugar yield ghamarnia et al 2012 topak et al 2016 2011 these results showed that a mild water stress i75 irrigation level due to slight decrease in root yield as well as no significant decrease in white sugar yield as compared to that obtained in full irrigation level i100 can be considered for irrigation scheduling under water shortage condition the value of k na Œ± amino n concentrations mmol 100 g 1 root and molasses sugar concentration also increased significantly by decreasing the amount of irrigation water level due to the fact that by increasing water stress sugar beet root accumulates higher impurities like na k and Œ± amino n which causes an increase in molasses sugar concentration the average value of na concentration for the two growing seasons increased significantly from 1 2 in i100 to 1 98 mmol 100 g 1 root in i50 level kiymaz and ertek 2015b reported that the value of na concentration is changed between 1 76 to 1 98 mmol 100 g 1 root in the irrigation level from i100 to i50 the average value of k concentration increased from 5 73 to 7 16 mmol 100 g 1 root in water level from i100 to i50 respectively kiymaz and ertek 2015a found that average value of k concentration was ranged from 4 19 to 5 10 mmol 100 g 1 root in mild deficit irrigation treatment tsialtas and maslaris 2013 reported that the k concentration increased from 7 86 to 9 25 mg g 1 and the alpha amino n concentration increased from 1 17 to 2 82 mmol 100 g 1 beet from low to full irrigation level in clay soil under semi arid condition the effect of different plant densities on sugar concentration white sugar concentration and white sugar yield was almost similar to its effect on sugar beet yield so that the maximum values of sugar concentration 18 20 white sugar concentration 14 82 and white sugar yield 13 26 103 kg ha 1 were obtained in p90 treatment however the minimum values of sugar concentration 16 66 and white sugar concentration 13 1 were attained in p45 treatment and the minimum value of white sugar yield 8 86 103 kg ha 1 was obtained in p180 treatment bhullar et al 2010 studied the effect of three planting populations on root and sugar yield and indicated that the plant density of 100 000 plants ha 1 resulted in highest root and sugar yield sadre et al 2012 indicated that by increasing plant density the root yield and white sugar yield increased and the maximum values of them were achieved in 120 000 plants ha 1 masri et al 2015 observed a positive effect of increasing the sugar beet plant density from 87 500 to 100 000 plants ha 1 as well as significant increase in sucrose concentration purity extractable sucrose and sugar yield it is noted that the results of the current study are almost in accordance with jafarnia et al 2013 and bhullar et al 2010 research findings overall as the plant population was decreased from p180 to p45 the values of Œ± amino n k and na concentrations mmol 100 g 1 root and molasses sugar concentration were increased table 5 due to an increase in the size of sugar beet root and resulting in increased the sugar impurity table 6 as it is shown in table 5 the value of k concentration in transplanting method was decreased and the value of na concentration white sugar concentration and white sugar yield were increased as compared with that obtained in the direct seeding method the values of na concentration mmol 100 gr 1 root and white sugar yield kg ha 1 in the transplanting method increased significantly by 5 and 9 respectively as compared with that obtained in the direct seeding method the differences between the values of other parameters were not significant in two planting methods the maximum values of sugar concentration and white sugar concentration were obtained in i50p90t 19 42 and i50p90d 15 58 respectively while the minimum values of sugar concentration and white sugar concentration obtained in i100p45t as 15 18 and 12 11 respectively the maximum and minimum values of white sugar yield were obtained in i75p90 t 14 12 103 kg ha 1 and i50p180d 6 6 103 kg ha 1 respectively the highest and lowest mean value of white sugar yield in all plant densities were obtained in i75 irrigation level under the transplanting method as 11 52 103 kg ha 1 and i50 irrigation level under the direct seeding method as 8 32 103 kg ha 1 table 5 although the maximum value of white sugar yield was obtained in optimum plant density p90 but the adverse effect of high plant density p180 and p135 on white sugar yield in the transplanting method was less than obtained in the direct seeding method therefore as it is shown in table 5 the values of white sugar yield in the plant density of 180 000 and 135 000 plant ha 1 under the transplanting method in the most of cases were significantly higher than that obtained in the direct seeding method especially in i75 and i50 treatments the relationship between the sugar yield and irrigation water rainfall as well as plant density for each planting method was shown in fig 3 a d the second order polynomial equations were fitted to their relationship the values of r2 for these equations were in range of 0 96 0 60 and all of the coefficients of determination were significant at 0 05 of probability p value 0 05 which indicated that there was a statistically significant relationship between the sugar yield and irrigation water rainfall as well as between sugar yield and plant density similar to that observed for root yield the maximum values of white sugar yield in both planting methods were obtained in p90 density treatment followed by p135 p180 and p45 fig 3a and c the results from fig 3b and d show that the optimum level of plant density which leads to obtain the maximum white sugar yield were similar to that were obtained to achieve the maximum root yield under different irrigation levels therefore the maximum values of white sugar yield in the direct seeding method in i100 i75 and i50 irrigation treatments were obtained in 107 plant ha 1 as 13 31 103 kg ha 1 101 plant ha 1 as 12 24 103 kg ha 1 and 98 plant ha 1 as 9 4 103 kg ha 1 respectively while in the transplanting method the maximum values of white sugar yield in i100 i75 and i50 irrigation treatments were obtained in 109 plant ha 1 as 13 13 103 kg ha 1 104 plant ha 1 as 12 88 103 kg ha 1 and 101 plant ha 1 as 11 86 103 kg ha 1 respectively 3 5 root shape specifications the irrigation level and plant density had significant effect on root specifications such as length and diameter and the mean weight of one root of sugar beet the planting method had no significant effect on mean weight of one root while its effect on root length and diameter was significant table 4 the interaction effect between irrigation regime planting method and plant density planting method on root length was significant however on root diameter and the mean weight of one root was not significant table 4 there was significant interaction effect between irrigation regime plant density on root length root diameter and the mean weight of one root while the interaction effect of irrigation regime planting method plant density on root length was significant however on root diameter and the mean weight of one root it was not significant table 4 the results from table 6 show that by decreasing plant density from p180 to p45 the root length was decreased by about 34 5 while the root diameter and the mean weight of one root were increased by 106 and 140 respectively due to the less competition on growing space and nutrient absorption between sugar beet roots reduction in irrigation water level decreased significantly the root length by 23 and 36 the root diameter by 23 and 44 and the mean weights of one root by 20 and 45 in i75 and i50 treatments respectively as compared with those obtained in i100 treatment in transplanting method the root length was smaller and its diameter was larger than that obtained in the direct seeding method significantly as it is shown in table 6 the root length was decreased by 5 and the root diameter was increased by 9 5 in the transplanting method as compared with that obtained in the direct seeding method the maximum and minimum root length was obtained in i100p180d 30 3 cm and i50p45t 12 09 cm respectively the highest values of root diameter and the mean weight of one root were obtained in 1100p45t as 16 02 cm and 1 98 kg respectively and the lowest one were obtained in i50p180d as 3 86 cm and 0 43 kg respectively hozayn et al 2013 reported that root length was ranged from 30 5 to 41 0 cm the maximum mean weight of one root between 0 26 to 0 28 kg and root perimeter was changed from 30 5 cm and 39 2 cm the differences between these traits in current study and hozayn et al 2013 were due to the differences in sugar beet cultivar and different growing conditions such as weather irrigation regimes and plant density 3 6 wpc wp irrig and wpwsy the effect of year and the interaction effect of year irrigation regime year planting method and year plant density on wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were not significant table 4 therefore the mean values of these parameters over two years of experiment were investigated the influences of irrigation regimes planting methods and plant densities and also the interaction effects of these factors except the interaction effects of irrigation regime planting method plant density were significant on wpc wpirrig and wpwsy the values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy increased by 15 6 21 7 and 26 3 in the irrigation level of i75 and 16 6 35 2 and 41 7 in the irrigation level of i50 respectively as compared with those obtained in i100 due to the increase in yield per unit water table 7 increase in wpc and wpirrig under deficit irrigation also reported by leufen et al 2016 in the other study li et al 2019 showed that the highest value of wpc and wpirrig in sugar beet cultivation were observed in 50 of full irrigation treatment which is in agreement with the results of current study haghverdi et al 2017 reported that the value of wpirrig was equal to1 43 kg m 3 in full irrigation treatment while applying 75 and 50 eta and imposing higher stress in growing season its value increased to 1 64 and 1 80 kg m 3 respectively barzegari et al 2017 showed that the water productivity of root and sugar yield in deficit irrigation increased 12 and 17 respectively as compared with that obtained in full irrigation treatment the values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy in the transplanting method increased by 45 7 44 7 and 47 7 respectively in comparison with those obtained in the direct seeding method due to elimination of early season irrigation in the transplanting method which is essential for germinating sugar beet seeds in the direct seeding method the mean highest values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy as 9 32 9 95 and 1 39 kg m 3 were obtained in p90 plant density respectively followed by p135 p45 and p180 with minimum average values of 6 95 7 15 and 0 96 kg m 3 for wpc wpirrig and wpwsy respectively table 7 considering the combined impacts of irrigation regimes planting method and plant density the maximum values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were obtained in i50p90t as 13 14 14 6 and 2 05 kg m 3 followed by i75p90t and i50p135t the minimum value of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were obtained in i100p180d as 5 09 5 2 and 0 65 kg m 3 respectively table 7 3 7 yield response factor ky the yield response factor ky for direct seeding and transplanting methods were 1 1 and 0 8 respectively based on the two years data fig 4 the ky value obtained from the direct seeding method in this study is close to the reported average ky value of 1 0 for sugar beet smith et al 2012 tarkalson et al 2019 reported the ky value of 1 13 and 1 16 for root yield and recoverable sucrose for irrigated sugar beet in an arid climate the ky value of 0 8 that obtained from the transplanting method is almost similar to the value of 0 8 that reported by kassam and smith 2001 and also 0 73 by ucan and gencoglan 2004 for sugar beet under drip irrigation the results indicated that under the direct seeding method sugar beet is neither tolerant nor excessively sensitive to water stress while under transplanting method it is tolerant to water stress due to fact that the yield reduction is proportionately less than the relative evapotranspiration deficit in this method ky 0 8 than direct seeding method ky 1 1 3 8 stress tolerance index sti the average stress tolerance index sti over two years data was calculated for two planting methods under i75 and i50 it is worth noting that the transplanting method was more tolerant to water stress than the direct seeding method according to the values of sti which in the transplanting method it is higher than that obtained in the direct seeding in both levels of deficit irrigation the values of sti in transplanting method were 0 95 for i75 and 0 80 for i50 irrigation levels whereas in the direct seeding method they were 0 88 in i75 and 0 67 in i50 irrigation levels these results obtained due to higher root yield in the transplanting method under water stress condition as previously mentioned table 5 the similar study was conducted by farshdfar et al 2012 and hesadi et al 2015 as they found differences between sugar beet cultivars according to stress tolerance indices 4 conclusion the overall results of two years experiment showed that the sugar beet root yield and the quality of yield as well as wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were affected by irrigation regimes plant density and planting method it was found that the transplanting method for sugar beet cultivation could be used as an effective way to increase wpc wpirrig and wpwsy for irrigated agricultural land in arid and semi arid regions this beneficial effect is due to elimination of the large amounts of irrigation water which is normally used in early growing season for seed germination and crop establishment comparison of the values of ky and sti between the two planting methods indicated that transplanting method could tolerate water stress much better than direct seeding a well managed deficit irrigation method increased water conservation and produced marketable sugar beet yield applying irrigation in 75 full irrigation i75 and 50 full irrigation i50 yielded 7 4 and 26 4 less than full irrigation respectively while they increased wpirrig and wpwsy by 21 7 in i75 to 35 2 in i50 and 26 3 in i75 to 41 7 in i50 respectively as compared with those obtained in full irrigation i100 the difference between wpc in i75 and i50 were not significant and increased by 16 1 as compared with that obtained in i100 irrigation level 90 000 plants ha 1 was found to be the optimum plant density in the study region hence in the regions with water deficiency combination of transplanting method and optimum plant density of 90 000 plant ha 1 under deficit irrigation in the level 75 of full irrigation due to low decrease in root yield as well as no significant decrease in white sugar yield as compared with that obtained in full irrigation level could be suggested to obtain optimum sugar beet yield with possibility of conserving water

10588,this study was conducted to investigate the effects of plant density planting method and irrigation regime on water productivity and yield of sugar beet for two years during 2017 and 2018 the planted cultivar was shokoofa with three irrigation levels 100 75 and 50 of the full irrigation 1368 mm in 2017 and 1412 mm in 2018 as i100 i75 and i50 respectively two planting methods direct seeding d and transplanting t and four planting densities 180 000 135 000 90 000 and 45 000 plants ha 1 as p180 p135 p90 and p45 respectively transplanting reduced applied water by about 24 and evapotranspiration about 25 as compared with direct seeding decreasing irrigation level the root yield decreased about 7 4 in i75 to 26 4 in i50 as compared with i100 the difference between white sugar yield in i100 and i75 were not significant but decreased significantly 17 in i50 as compared to i100 and i75 the root yield and white sugar yield in p90 treatment were higher than other treatments the values of irrigation water productivity wpirrig and white sugar yield water productivity wpwsy increased by 21 7 in i75 to 35 2 in i50 and 26 3 in i75 to 41 7 in i50 respectively as compared to i100 the difference between wpc in i75 and i50 were not significant and increased about 16 1 as compared to i100 transplanting increased the root yield 7 7 and wpc wpirrig and wpwsy 45 7 44 7 and 47 7 as compared with direct seeding the mean highest values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were 9 32 9 95 and 1 39 kg m 3 respectively in p3 treatment therefore in regions with scarce water resources combination of transplanting method and plant density of 90 000 plant ha 1 under deficit irrigation in the level of 75 of full irrigation is suggested to obtain optimum sugar beet yield keywords root yield deficit irrigation planting method white sugar yield sugar concentration 1 introduction sugar is one of the important food products in iranian diet and sugar beet is one of the most important sources of sugar sugar beet production has a history of one century in iran and grown mostly under irrigated conditions due to the arid and semi arid climate of iran the water shortage has become a key challenge in irrigated agriculture to address this problem the development and adoption of new water saving agricultural practices are necessary for providing high yields with low water application the ideal irrigation should signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce water application without reduction in crop yield yang et al 2015 a recently adopted water saving practice in arid areas is deÔ¨Åcit irrigation unl√º et al 2011 yang et al 2015 which is deÔ¨Åned as the application of water below full crop requirement for evapotranspiration oweis et al 2011 deÔ¨Åcit irrigation causes to decrease the excessive vegetation growth and therefore leads to higher water saving fernandez et al 2013 hernandez santana et al 2017 padilla d√≠az et al 2016 pereira et al 2012 the quantity and quality of sugar beet yield are affected by deficit irrigation depending upon different irrigation regimes and methods sepaskhah and kamgar haghighi 1997 reported that every other furrow irrigation eofi at l0 day irrigation intervals used a smaller amount of irrigation water with some yield reduction in sugar beet however frequent eofi at 6 day intervals produced a similar root yield to that of every furrow irrigation efi at 10 day interval and saved an average of 23 of irrigation water under water stress condition sugar beet is able to develop the root system to absorb water from deeper soil layers the sugar beet internal reaction to water stress other than reduced growth is increased root sugar concentration in this regard abyaneh et al 2017 reported that the white sugar yield of sugar beet in partial root drying treatments is higher than that in regulated deficit irrigation treatments however sahin et al 2014 showed that the water stress lead to lower root and white sugar yield sugar beet yield can be affected by other factors such as planting method and plant population in sugar beet cultivation the direct seeding method due to higher plant susceptibility in early growth stage to frost has a negative effect on yields transplanting method is defined as germinating seeds and growing seedlings in a controlled environment like a greenhouse and transplanting seedlings in the farm draycott 2006 in transplanting method the environmental factors and protection from predators wind and birds are controlled better than direct seeding method brown et al 2015 wang et al 2012 also transplanting is an effective method under late planting condition and therefore the yield reduction in this condition is lower as compared with direct seeding method dehqani et al 2015 haghighikhah et al 2017 safi et al 2018 investigated the effect of transplanting and direct seeding method on canola yield under deficit irrigation the results showed that the planting method had significant effect on grain and oil yield in addition due to sugar beet susceptibility to salinity at early growth stage using transplanting method is useful to produce sugar beet under salinity condition transplanting method is one way to save more water to increase water productivity wp in sugar beet cultivation due to the fact that in direct seeding method sugar beet seeds require a lot of irrigation water to germinate while by transplanting method the early irrigations are eliminated and water productivity is improved optimizing plant density is a key factor influencing many aspects of cultural practices including susceptibility to pathogens water and fertilizer requirements jin et al 2017 dai et al 2014 when the plant population increased over the optimal level competition between the plants becomes intense and therefore the plant growth becomes slow and the yield is decreased chaudhary et al 2015 haghverdi et al 2017 reported that the population rates of 104 000 plants ha 1 resulted in higher sugar beet yield plant density per unit area of cultivated land is a major factor in determining the quality and quantity of the sugar beet roots for example the optimum plant density causes a larger leaf area that increases transpiration and receives higher sunlight and therefore enhances the performance of photosynthesis and increase the root dry matter proportion marchiori et al 2014 optimal plant populations of 130 000 150 000 plants ha 1 khaiti 2012 and 90 000 plants ha 1 jafarnia et al 2013 have been observed to achieve maximum recoverable white sugar and sugar beet root yield the effects of deÔ¨Åcit irrigation on sugar beet yield and quality of yield component can be determined by a number of agronomic factors interaction effects of deÔ¨Åcit irrigation and planting date nassar 2006 deÔ¨Åcit irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer abyaneh et al 2017 and the interaction effect of irrigation surface residue cover and plant population haghverdi et al 2017 on sugar beet growth and quality of yield component have been investigated however almost few studies have been done for the interaction effect of plant density and planting method direct seeding and transplanting under different irrigation regimes on quantity and quality of sugar beet yield and the advantages of using transplanting method under deÔ¨Åcit irrigation for sugar beet production the aim of this research was to investigate the effects of planting method transplanting and direct seeding methods and plant density under different irrigation regimes on root yield and water productivity of sugar beet in bajgah fars province a semi arid region of iran 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental sites to evaluate the effect of plant density and planting method direct seeding and transplanting under different irrigation regimes on the yield yield components and quality of sugar beet a two years Ô¨Åeld experiment was conducted during the growing season 2017 2018 and

replications each plot area had 2 m length and 2 m width with Ô¨Åve rows of planting plots were separated by 1 0 m to avoid the interference of irrigation water of the adjacent treatment in direct seeding planting the sugar beet seeds shokoofa cultivar were hand sown at 1 5 2 cm depths on april 11 2017 and april 4 2018 and irrigated sufficiently two time with amounts of 500 l for germination and establishment of plants with 6 8 leaves to withstand against the adverse effects of wind and frost in transplanting method the sugar beet seeds shokoofa cultivar were sown in japanese paper pots at april 15 2017 and april 8 2018 in the greenhouse and seedlings were ready to transplant when they had 4 6 true leaves on may 30 2017 and may 24 2018 for the first and second year of the experiment respectively when the plants were fixed well 6 8 true leaves after two times of full irrigation with amounts of 200 l the i100 treatment was irrigated with 100 of the crop water requirement based on increasing the soil water content to the soil field capacity in the root zone while i75 and i50 treatments were irrigated at 75 and 50 of the i100 treatment respectively the water was applied to each plot via pipe and measured by digital water flow meter for two years of experiment phosphorus as triple superphosphate at the rate of 150 kg ha 1 was applied uniformly to each plot before sowing the seeds at soil depth of 0 0 0 3 m nitrogen at a rate of 250 kg ha 1 as urea was applied when plants had 8 9 leaves after three weeks from last irrigation sugar beets from the three center rows of each plot were harvested on october 29 2017 and october 22 2018 for the first and second year of experiment respectively 2 3 soil water content and crop evapotranspiration before each irrigation soil water content at different depths 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 were measured by neutron probe apparatus model cpn 503 dr positioned in each plot with 7 days interval soil water content balance in the root zone was used to estimate the amount of net irrigation water for i100 100 full irrigation as follows 1 d 1000 f c i Œ∏ i Œ¥ z where d is the irrigation water depth mm fci and Œ∏vi are the field capacity and volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 before irrigation at ith soil layer respectively and Œ¥z is the thickness of ith soil layer m depth of root is estimated using the following equation raes et al 2016 2 z z i n i z x z i n i t t 0 2 t x t 0 2 n where z is the root depth m z i n i and z x is the minimum 0 3 m and maximum 1 8 m of root depth draycott 2006 respectively t is the cumulative growing degree day gdd for each day after planting t0 is the gdd from planting to seeds germination tx is the cumulative gdd from planting to maximum root depth and n is the shape factor 1 8 crop evapotranspiration was estimated using soil water balance method pradhan et al 2014 as follows 3 e t a i r r 0 d p d s where eta is the actual sugar beet evapotranspiration mm i is theirrigation water depth mm r is the precipitation mm and ro is the runoff mm which is assumed zero in this study dp is the deep percolation mm ds is the soil water content change mm between two irrigations in the plant root zone daily precipitation was obtained from the weather station located close to the experimental site if soil water content in the root zone were higher than the Ô¨Åeld capacity then any water movement to deeper soil layers can be considered as deep percolation ertek et al 2006a because the soil water content after each irrigation was reached fc level or lower than it for deficit irrigation treatments no deep percolation was considered in the field parvizi et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 2 4 yield yield components and quality at harvest by removing the shoots and leaves from the roots the weights of roots in each plot were measured using a digital balance and then five roots were randomly selected from each plot to measure root length root diameter and mean weight of one root the sugar concentration sc sodium concentration na and potassium concentration k and alpha amino nitrogen concentration Œ± n were measured using betalyser device model d 3016 sugar of molasses ms was calculated as follows reinefeld et al 1974 4 m s 0 343 k n a 0 094 Œ± n 0 31 where ms is the sugar concentration of molasses k is the potassium concentration mmol 100 g 1 root na is the sodium concentration mmol 100 g 1 root and Œ± n is the alpha amino nitrogen concentration mmol 100 g 1 root the white sugar concentration wsc and white sugar yield wsy kg ha 1 were calculated as follows 5 w s c s c m s 6 w s y w s c y where y is the root yield kg ha 1 the value of wuey usually used in older studies or wpc crop water productivity according to recent studies such as fernandez et al 2020 which both can be expressed as the total crop yield divided by the total water consumed total evapotranspiration over the crop growing season was determined for each treatment however in current study the second terminology wpc was used to present this term eq 7 in addition the values of irrigation water productivity wpirrig and white sugar yield water productivity wpwsy were calculated for each treatment as follows fernandez et al 2020 7 w p c y e t a 8 w p i r r i g y i 9 w p w s y w s y e t a where y is the root yield kg ha 1 eta is the actual sugar beet evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 obtained from water balance method and i is the irrigation depth m3 ha 1 and wsy is the white sugar yield in sugar beet kg ha 1 2 5 yield response factor ky the value of ky was estimated as advised by smith et al 2012 therefore using eq 10 the relative yield decrease per unit relative evapotranspiration deÔ¨Åcit can be estimated 10 k y 1 y a y m 1 e t a e t m where ya is the actual root yield in each treatment ym is the maximum root yield in control treatment i100 respectively eta is the actual evapotranspiration and etm is the maximum no stressed evapotranspiration in control i100 treatment respectively generally when the ky value is greater than 1 0 it represents that the crop is sensitive to water deficit and when its value is less than 1 0 it represents that crop reaction is not sensitive to water deficit and when ky value is equal to 1 0 it presents that the value of reduction in yield is directly proportional to the reduction of evapotranspiration smith et al 2012 2 6 stress tolerance index sti in order to compare the water stress tolerance in two planting methods direct seeding and transplanting the stress tolerance index sti was calculated as follows mahmoud et al 2018 11 s t i y n y s y n 2 where ys and yn are the sugar beet yields in water stress treatments and control respectively for direct seeding or transplanting methods yn is the mean yield of two planting methods under control condition according to fernandez 1992 planting method with high sti values is tolerant to water stress 2 7 data analysis mstatc plant and soil science department michigan state university software was used for analysis of variance and the mean comparison of the parameters was done using the least significant difference lsd test at significance level of 5 in addition the regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between root yield as well as white sugar yield versus the irrigation water and plant density using excel software version 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 water use total amount of rainfall during the growing period was 22 5 mm in 2017 that occurred in the first week and 55 mm in 2018 that occurred in the first and second week after planting the variation of mean maximum and minimum temperature and also mean relative humidity that were collected from a weather station close to the experimental site for the two experimental years are shown in fig 1 the total amounts of irrigation water and crop evapotranspiration for different irrigation water levels plant densities and planting methods are presented in table 2 the results showed that the transplanting method reduced the applied water by 25 and 23 in comparison with that obtained in the direct seeding method at the first and second growing season respectively the averaged eta for two years of experiment in i75 and i50 irrigation regimes decreased by 21 and 40 in the direct seeding method while 19 and 41 in transplanting method as compared with eta obtained in i100 irrigation level table 2 the average value of eta for all irrigation regimes and planting densities in the transplanting method decreased about 25 as compared with that obtained in the direct seeding method in general transplanting method reduced mean sugar beet evapotranspiration over all planting densities by 25 24 and 26 in i100 i75 and i50 irrigation regimes respectively as compared with those obtained in the direct seeding method table 2 3 2 soil water content the volumetric soil water content in root zone during the two growing seasons in p180 and p45 planting densities for i100 and i50 irrigation levels in the direct seeding and transplanting methods are shown in table 3 soil water content had almost the same value in all treatments at early growing season as a result of rainfall occurrence in winter and early spring it showed significant different due to applying different irrigation regimes and plant densities with regards to table 3 soil water content in i100 was higher than that obtained in i50 due to applying higher irrigation water in the two growing seasons in i100 irrigation level similar results were observed by shirahatti et al 2007 that the water stress condition depending on amount of water applied decreased soil water content soil water content in low planting density treatment p45 at all irrigation treatments and planting methods were almost significantly lower than those obtained in higher planting density treatment p180 from early to middle of the growing season as a result of lower canopy cover and therefore higher soil evaporation the soil water content was almost significantly increased from the middle to the end of the growing season in the density of p45 as a result of increasing canopy cover size and decreasing soil evaporation and also lower transpiration in low density treatment p45 as compared with that obtained in high density treatment p180 table 3 the value of soil water content in the transplanting method was higher than that obtained in the direct seeding method but these differences in some cases were not significant 3 3 root yield the differences between sugar beet yields were not significant over the two years of the study therefore the average values of root yield over two years of experiment were compared table 4 the effects of different irrigation water levels plant densities planting method and also the interaction effects of all treatments were significant table 4 by reduction in irrigation water level the sugar beet yield was decreased significantly by 7 4 and 26 4 in i75 and i50 respectively as compared with that obtained in i100 table 5 reduction in the root yield under low water level was due to decrease in the plant leaf area leaf photosynthesis and accordingly decreased storage materials in sugar beet root baigy et al 2012 reported the maximum root yield of 119 2 103 kg ha 1 in full irrigation level and the minimum root yield of 74 8 103 kg ha 1 in 50 deficit irrigation topak et al 2011 indicated that the sugar beet yield varied between 77 300 kg ha 1 for full irrigation and 28 100 kg ha 1 for 25 of full irrigation in semiarid climate of turkey abyaneh et al 2012 found that the highest and the lowest root yield was obtained as 116 8 mg ha 1 and 52 2 103 kg ha 1 under full and deficit irrigation respectively the sugar beet yield was increased by increasing the plant density from 68 73 103 kg ha 1 in 45 000 plant ha 1 p45 to 89 47 103 kg ha 1 in 90 000 plant ha 1 p90 and further increase in plant density was significantly decreased the sugar beet yield table 5 therefore among plant densities the minimum sugar beet yield was obtained in p180 180 000 plant ha 1 treatment in this regard the plant populations of 90 000 plants ha 1 was reported by jafarnia et al 2013 to obtain maximum recoverable white sucrose and root yield which is similar to the results obtained in this study as it is shown in table 5 the sugar beet yield in transplanting method was significantly higher 7 7 than that obtained in the direct seeding method the maximum and minimum values of sugar beet yield were obtained in i100p90 t 98 8 103 kg ha 1 and i50p180d 46 8 103 kg ha 1 while the differences between i100p90t and i100p90d were not significant comparing the interaction effects of plant density planting method and irrigation regimes on sugar beet yield indicated that in full irrigation level i100 there were no significant differences between sugar beet yield under transplanting and direct seeding methods in different plant densities while under irrigation level of i75 and i50 the sugar beet yield in the transplanting method was significantly higher than that obtained in the direct seeding method table 5 these results indicated that under water shortage condition the transplanting method is more efficient than direct seeding method in obtaining higher sugar beet yield the relationship between the root yield and irrigation water rainfall as well as plant density were fitted to the second order polynomial equations for each planting method and were shown in fig 2 a d the coefficient of determination for the regression models r2 ranged from 0 97 to 0 70 and all of the coefficients of equations were significant by p value 0 05 these results showed that there was a statistically significant relationship between root yield and irrigation water rainfall as well as between root yield and plant density the second order polynomial equations indicated that the root yield at first was increased by increasing irrigation rainfall and plant density up to a maximum potential yield after which it is decreased by increasing irrigation rainfall and also by increasing plant density due to the strong competition between plants at high planting density as it was mentioned before the fig 2a and c indicated that the maximum root yield was obtained in p90 plant density followed by p135 p45 and p180 in the direct seeding method fig 2a and followed by p135 p180 p45 in the transplanting method fig 2b and d showed that the root yield was decreased by decreasing the irrigation water by deriving the equations related to relationship between the root yield and density equations which are presented in fig 2b and c it can be concluded that in i100 treatment the maximum root yield was obtained in plant density of 107 plant ha 1 as 99 71 103 kg ha 1 in the direct seeding and in 109 plant ha 1 as 99 35 103 kg ha 1 in the transplanting method while in i75 and i50 it was obtained at plant density of 101 and 98 plant ha 1 as 90 103 kg ha 1 and 66 103 kg ha 1 respectively in the direct seeding method and at plant density of 104 and 101 plant ha 1 as 91 103 kg ha 1 and 77 103 kg ha 1 at the transplanting method 3 4 yield quality the differences between quality parameters were not significant over the two years of the study table 4 the results showed that the effects of different irrigation levels and plant densities on all quality parameters of sugar beet were significant the effects of planting methods were significant on root na concentration and white sugar yield at 5 level of probability while on other quality parameters it was not significant the interaction effect of irrigation regime planting method plant density planting method irrigation regime plant density and irrigation regime plant density planting method on k concentration Œ± amino n concentration molasses sugar concentration and white sugar yield was significant while on other quality parameters it was not significant table 4 the sugar concentration and white sugar concentration increased significantly by decreasing irrigation water level from 15 88 in i100 to 18 35 in i50 and 13 03 in i100 to 14 67 in i50 respectively increasing in sugar and white sugar concentration was due to the occurrence of osmotic adjustment under deficit irrigation condition topak et al 2011 observed an increase in sugar concentration as affected by deficit irrigation which increased from 18 81 to 21 42 ghamarnia et al 2012 indicated that under full and deficit irrigation the sugar concentration increased from 12 62 to 23 53 respectively the difference between white sugar yields in i100 11 08 103 kg ha 1 and i75 11 03 103 kg ha 1 irrigation levels were not significant while it decreased significantly by 17 in i50 irrigation level as compared with that obtained in i75 and i100 some studies also showed that increasing in water stress caused to decrease in white sugar yield ghamarnia et al 2012 topak et al 2016 2011 these results showed that a mild water stress i75 irrigation level due to slight decrease in root yield as well as no significant decrease in white sugar yield as compared to that obtained in full irrigation level i100 can be considered for irrigation scheduling under water shortage condition the value of k na Œ± amino n concentrations mmol 100 g 1 root and molasses sugar concentration also increased significantly by decreasing the amount of irrigation water level due to the fact that by increasing water stress sugar beet root accumulates higher impurities like na k and Œ± amino n which causes an increase in molasses sugar concentration the average value of na concentration for the two growing seasons increased significantly from 1 2 in i100 to 1 98 mmol 100 g 1 root in i50 level kiymaz and ertek 2015b reported that the value of na concentration is changed between 1 76 to 1 98 mmol 100 g 1 root in the irrigation level from i100 to i50 the average value of k concentration increased from 5 73 to 7 16 mmol 100 g 1 root in water level from i100 to i50 respectively kiymaz and ertek 2015a found that average value of k concentration was ranged from 4 19 to 5 10 mmol 100 g 1 root in mild deficit irrigation treatment tsialtas and maslaris 2013 reported that the k concentration increased from 7 86 to 9 25 mg g 1 and the alpha amino n concentration increased from 1 17 to 2 82 mmol 100 g 1 beet from low to full irrigation level in clay soil under semi arid condition the effect of different plant densities on sugar concentration white sugar concentration and white sugar yield was almost similar to its effect on sugar beet yield so that the maximum values of sugar concentration 18 20 white sugar concentration 14 82 and white sugar yield 13 26 103 kg ha 1 were obtained in p90 treatment however the minimum values of sugar concentration 16 66 and white sugar concentration 13 1 were attained in p45 treatment and the minimum value of white sugar yield 8 86 103 kg ha 1 was obtained in p180 treatment bhullar et al 2010 studied the effect of three planting populations on root and sugar yield and indicated that the plant density of 100 000 plants ha 1 resulted in highest root and sugar yield sadre et al 2012 indicated that by increasing plant density the root yield and white sugar yield increased and the maximum values of them were achieved in 120 000 plants ha 1 masri et al 2015 observed a positive effect of increasing the sugar beet plant density from 87 500 to 100 000 plants ha 1 as well as significant increase in sucrose concentration purity extractable sucrose and sugar yield it is noted that the results of the current study are almost in accordance with jafarnia et al 2013 and bhullar et al 2010 research findings overall as the plant population was decreased from p180 to p45 the values of Œ± amino n k and na concentrations mmol 100 g 1 root and molasses sugar concentration were increased table 5 due to an increase in the size of sugar beet root and resulting in increased the sugar impurity table 6 as it is shown in table 5 the value of k concentration in transplanting method was decreased and the value of na concentration white sugar concentration and white sugar yield were increased as compared with that obtained in the direct seeding method the values of na concentration mmol 100 gr 1 root and white sugar yield kg ha 1 in the transplanting method increased significantly by 5 and 9 respectively as compared with that obtained in the direct seeding method the differences between the values of other parameters were not significant in two planting methods the maximum values of sugar concentration and white sugar concentration were obtained in i50p90t 19 42 and i50p90d 15 58 respectively while the minimum values of sugar concentration and white sugar concentration obtained in i100p45t as 15 18 and 12 11 respectively the maximum and minimum values of white sugar yield were obtained in i75p90 t 14 12 103 kg ha 1 and i50p180d 6 6 103 kg ha 1 respectively the highest and lowest mean value of white sugar yield in all plant densities were obtained in i75 irrigation level under the transplanting method as 11 52 103 kg ha 1 and i50 irrigation level under the direct seeding method as 8 32 103 kg ha 1 table 5 although the maximum value of white sugar yield was obtained in optimum plant density p90 but the adverse effect of high plant density p180 and p135 on white sugar yield in the transplanting method was less than obtained in the direct seeding method therefore as it is shown in table 5 the values of white sugar yield in the plant density of 180 000 and 135 000 plant ha 1 under the transplanting method in the most of cases were significantly higher than that obtained in the direct seeding method especially in i75 and i50 treatments the relationship between the sugar yield and irrigation water rainfall as well as plant density for each planting method was shown in fig 3 a d the second order polynomial equations were fitted to their relationship the values of r2 for these equations were in range of 0 96 0 60 and all of the coefficients of determination were significant at 0 05 of probability p value 0 05 which indicated that there was a statistically significant relationship between the sugar yield and irrigation water rainfall as well as between sugar yield and plant density similar to that observed for root yield the maximum values of white sugar yield in both planting methods were obtained in p90 density treatment followed by p135 p180 and p45 fig 3a and c the results from fig 3b and d show that the optimum level of plant density which leads to obtain the maximum white sugar yield were similar to that were obtained to achieve the maximum root yield under different irrigation levels therefore the maximum values of white sugar yield in the direct seeding method in i100 i75 and i50 irrigation treatments were obtained in 107 plant ha 1 as 13 31 103 kg ha 1 101 plant ha 1 as 12 24 103 kg ha 1 and 98 plant ha 1 as 9 4 103 kg ha 1 respectively while in the transplanting method the maximum values of white sugar yield in i100 i75 and i50 irrigation treatments were obtained in 109 plant ha 1 as 13 13 103 kg ha 1 104 plant ha 1 as 12 88 103 kg ha 1 and 101 plant ha 1 as 11 86 103 kg ha 1 respectively 3 5 root shape specifications the irrigation level and plant density had significant effect on root specifications such as length and diameter and the mean weight of one root of sugar beet the planting method had no significant effect on mean weight of one root while its effect on root length and diameter was significant table 4 the interaction effect between irrigation regime planting method and plant density planting method on root length was significant however on root diameter and the mean weight of one root was not significant table 4 there was significant interaction effect between irrigation regime plant density on root length root diameter and the mean weight of one root while the interaction effect of irrigation regime planting method plant density on root length was significant however on root diameter and the mean weight of one root it was not significant table 4 the results from table 6 show that by decreasing plant density from p180 to p45 the root length was decreased by about 34 5 while the root diameter and the mean weight of one root were increased by 106 and 140 respectively due to the less competition on growing space and nutrient absorption between sugar beet roots reduction in irrigation water level decreased significantly the root length by 23 and 36 the root diameter by 23 and 44 and the mean weights of one root by 20 and 45 in i75 and i50 treatments respectively as compared with those obtained in i100 treatment in transplanting method the root length was smaller and its diameter was larger than that obtained in the direct seeding method significantly as it is shown in table 6 the root length was decreased by 5 and the root diameter was increased by 9 5 in the transplanting method as compared with that obtained in the direct seeding method the maximum and minimum root length was obtained in i100p180d 30 3 cm and i50p45t 12 09 cm respectively the highest values of root diameter and the mean weight of one root were obtained in 1100p45t as 16 02 cm and 1 98 kg respectively and the lowest one were obtained in i50p180d as 3 86 cm and 0 43 kg respectively hozayn et al 2013 reported that root length was ranged from 30 5 to 41 0 cm the maximum mean weight of one root between 0 26 to 0 28 kg and root perimeter was changed from 30 5 cm and 39 2 cm the differences between these traits in current study and hozayn et al 2013 were due to the differences in sugar beet cultivar and different growing conditions such as weather irrigation regimes and plant density 3 6 wpc wp irrig and wpwsy the effect of year and the interaction effect of year irrigation regime year planting method and year plant density on wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were not significant table 4 therefore the mean values of these parameters over two years of experiment were investigated the influences of irrigation regimes planting methods and plant densities and also the interaction effects of these factors except the interaction effects of irrigation regime planting method plant density were significant on wpc wpirrig and wpwsy the values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy increased by 15 6 21 7 and 26 3 in the irrigation level of i75 and 16 6 35 2 and 41 7 in the irrigation level of i50 respectively as compared with those obtained in i100 due to the increase in yield per unit water table 7 increase in wpc and wpirrig under deficit irrigation also reported by leufen et al 2016 in the other study li et al 2019 showed that the highest value of wpc and wpirrig in sugar beet cultivation were observed in 50 of full irrigation treatment which is in agreement with the results of current study haghverdi et al 2017 reported that the value of wpirrig was equal to1 43 kg m 3 in full irrigation treatment while applying 75 and 50 eta and imposing higher stress in growing season its value increased to 1 64 and 1 80 kg m 3 respectively barzegari et al 2017 showed that the water productivity of root and sugar yield in deficit irrigation increased 12 and 17 respectively as compared with that obtained in full irrigation treatment the values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy in the transplanting method increased by 45 7 44 7 and 47 7 respectively in comparison with those obtained in the direct seeding method due to elimination of early season irrigation in the transplanting method which is essential for germinating sugar beet seeds in the direct seeding method the mean highest values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy as 9 32 9 95 and 1 39 kg m 3 were obtained in p90 plant density respectively followed by p135 p45 and p180 with minimum average values of 6 95 7 15 and 0 96 kg m 3 for wpc wpirrig and wpwsy respectively table 7 considering the combined impacts of irrigation regimes planting method and plant density the maximum values of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were obtained in i50p90t as 13 14 14 6 and 2 05 kg m 3 followed by i75p90t and i50p135t the minimum value of wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were obtained in i100p180d as 5 09 5 2 and 0 65 kg m 3 respectively table 7 3 7 yield response factor ky the yield response factor ky for direct seeding and transplanting methods were 1 1 and 0 8 respectively based on the two years data fig 4 the ky value obtained from the direct seeding method in this study is close to the reported average ky value of 1 0 for sugar beet smith et al 2012 tarkalson et al 2019 reported the ky value of 1 13 and 1 16 for root yield and recoverable sucrose for irrigated sugar beet in an arid climate the ky value of 0 8 that obtained from the transplanting method is almost similar to the value of 0 8 that reported by kassam and smith 2001 and also 0 73 by ucan and gencoglan 2004 for sugar beet under drip irrigation the results indicated that under the direct seeding method sugar beet is neither tolerant nor excessively sensitive to water stress while under transplanting method it is tolerant to water stress due to fact that the yield reduction is proportionately less than the relative evapotranspiration deficit in this method ky 0 8 than direct seeding method ky 1 1 3 8 stress tolerance index sti the average stress tolerance index sti over two years data was calculated for two planting methods under i75 and i50 it is worth noting that the transplanting method was more tolerant to water stress than the direct seeding method according to the values of sti which in the transplanting method it is higher than that obtained in the direct seeding in both levels of deficit irrigation the values of sti in transplanting method were 0 95 for i75 and 0 80 for i50 irrigation levels whereas in the direct seeding method they were 0 88 in i75 and 0 67 in i50 irrigation levels these results obtained due to higher root yield in the transplanting method under water stress condition as previously mentioned table 5 the similar study was conducted by farshdfar et al 2012 and hesadi et al 2015 as they found differences between sugar beet cultivars according to stress tolerance indices 4 conclusion the overall results of two years experiment showed that the sugar beet root yield and the quality of yield as well as wpc wpirrig and wpwsy were affected by irrigation regimes plant density and planting method it was found that the transplanting method for sugar beet cultivation could be used as an effective way to increase wpc wpirrig and wpwsy for irrigated agricultural land in arid and semi arid regions this beneficial effect is due to elimination of the large amounts of irrigation water which is normally used in early growing season for seed germination and crop establishment comparison of the values of ky and sti between the two planting methods indicated that transplanting method could tolerate water stress much better than direct seeding a well managed deficit irrigation method increased water conservation and produced marketable sugar beet yield applying irrigation in 75 full irrigation i75 and 50 full irrigation i50 yielded 7 4 and 26 4 less than full irrigation respectively while they increased wpirrig and wpwsy by 21 7 in i75 to 35 2 in i50 and 26 3 in i75 to 41 7 in i50 respectively as compared with those obtained in full irrigation i100 the difference between wpc in i75 and i50 were not significant and increased by 16 1 as compared with that obtained in i100 irrigation level 90 000 plants ha 1 was found to be the optimum plant density in the study region hence in the regions with water deficiency combination of transplanting method and optimum plant density of 90 000 plant ha 1 under deficit irrigation in the level 75 of full irrigation due to low decrease in root yield as well as no significant decrease in white sugar yield as compared with that obtained in full irrigation level could be suggested to obtain optimum sugar beet yield with possibility of conserving water

from irrigation against the long term aquifer longevity needs risk based deficit irrigation is proposed to tackle this trade off a tiered risk assessment approach is developed to evaluate crop yield loss risks as a function of crop water supply cws from irrigation and precipitation risk is defined as the probability of obtaining a crop yield below a pre specified threshold logistic regression is used to quantify risks as a function of cws if the producer can specify a fixed minimum yield threshold distribution regression is used to develop the cumulative distribution function of the crop yield assuming heterogeneous model parameter and is useful when the producer can estimate cws but cannot specify a minimum yield threshold finally the cws is also modeled as a stochastic variable and the crop yield risk conditioned on cws risk is computed using the kolmogorov axiom the methodology is illustrated using a cotton production case study in the southern high plains of texas logistic regression indicated that crop yield risk was a nonlinear function of cws cws corresponding to 80 of the total crop water demand was enough to reach negligible crop yield risks heterogeneous cotton yield distribution was modeled using box cox cole green function with location and scale parameters being nonlinear and linear functions of cws respectively and a stationary shape parameter irrigation at lower cws reduced the risks substantially but the risk reductions were marginal at higher cws the conditional distribution of crop yield risk indicated that cws corresponding to 80 85 of crop water demand was enough to bring down risks the tiered risk assessment provides a rational risk based approach to evaluate the impacts of crop water supply reductions and promote deficit irrigation practices keywords droughts aquifer depletion deficit irrigation distribution regression kernel density estimation crop yield risks climate change probabilistic risk assessment 1 introduction water is a critical limiting resource in arid and semi arid environments such as the southern high plains shp region of texas therefore these regions are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious impacts of climate change swain and hayhoe 2015 in particular intensification of droughts is anticipated in these areas fereres and soriano 2006 huang et al 2016 ragab and prudhomme 2002 global crop production has already been affected by water scarcity and heat stresses caused by droughts lesk et al 2016 agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions are projected to exhibit increased sensitivity to future climate change pe√±a gallardo et al 2019 steiner et al 2018 irrigation provides resilience against droughts and helps buffer crop yield losses in agricultural systems in arid and semi arid regions groundwater is often the only reliable water source and has been extensively used for irrigated agriculture siebert et al 2010 in agriculturally intensive areas groundwater extraction often increases to overcome the additional demands placed by droughts russo and lall 2017 historically there has been limited governance and management of groundwater resources which has led to its inefficient use uddameri 2005 over exploitation of groundwater has severely depleted many aquifers in agriculturally intensive areas gleeson et al 2012 scanlon et al 2012 this depletion has greatly threatened the viability of groundwater reliant agriculture dominant environments grades uddameri and reible 2018 water table declines in unconfined aquifers create many negative consequences such declines threaten long term water availability in the region also water table declines reduce transmissivity of unconfined aquifers and affect the rate of water flow to a well this reduction in transmissivity manifests as reduced well yields and threatens the ability of farmers to provide water to crops at critical crop growth stages therefore even when management policies that restrict groundwater production are not in place aquifer depletion naturally limits the availability of water supplies during the growing season when water levels in aquifers start to drop appreciably farmers need to rely more heavily on natural precipitation water to overcome their ability to irrigate and use their dwindling water resources judiciously irrigation has the short term benefit of generating higher crop yields but accelerates the path toward groundwater resource exhaustion on the other hand complete or higher reliance on precipitation can affect crop yields and revenues in the short term but prolongs the useful life of the aquifer therefore in water scarce regions balancing short term water needs against long term resource availability is a challenge that farmers face deficit irrigation refers to the situation where farmers do not supply all of the crop water demand but seek to balance the loss of short term yield against long term benefits of water conservation fereres and soriano 2006 geerts and raes 2009 however deficit irrigation and increased reliance on natural precipitation water make agricultural systems susceptible to crop yield losses or reductions and the risk of insufficient crop yields is often a primary concern that limits farmers from implementing deficit irrigation practices risk is generally defined as the probability of failure bahr 2018 in the context of an agricultural system failure can be defined as the likelihood of not obtaining an anticipated or de minimis crop yield naylor et al 2007 this definition as an extreme case subsumes complete loss of the crop i e zero yield therefore the probability distribution function of the crop yield can be used in conjunction with a minimum acceptable yield threshold to define crop yield loss risk while agricultural production is influenced by many factors such as climate soil fertility pest management and technology adoption water is a primary resource constraint especially in arid and semi arid regions therefore it is assumed that the probability distribution of the crop yield is conditioned on the amount of water applied to the crop at a given farm the amount of water supplies from precipitation and irrigation vary across seasons thus crop yield risks must be assessed using a stochastic framework there is a growing recognition that climate change can have deleterious impacts on crop yields campbell et al 2016 and that risks of crop yield losses due to changing climate need to be understood to ensure food security tito et al 2018 there has been an increased emphasis on using stochastic approaches to understand crop yield loss risks under drought conditions in particular copula based approaches have been used to understand crop yield losses under various drought conditions leng and hall 2019 feng et al 2019 on global and national scales understanding crop yield risk losses at farm scale is also an important endeavor but has not received much attention in the literature therefore the primary goal of this study is to develop a stochastic risk assessment framework to evaluate crop yield loss risks due to water scarcity caused by droughts a natural hazard and groundwater depletion hazard which limits the farmer s ability to irrigate the novelty of the proposed approach is five fold first the proposed approach integrates stochastic modeling approaches proposed in probabilistic risk assessment literature with field data and phenologically based crop modeling methods of agricultural sciences to develop an innovative interdisciplinary framework to assess crop yield loss risks under climate change and groundwater depletion second the risk assessment process is tiered which in this context implies that the risk assessment can be carried out in a sequential manner with progressively increasing complexity this tiered approach allows for flexibility in risk characterization and allows risk assessors to adapt their evaluation depending upon how much information is available during the decision making process and how much insights a farmer or a decision maker is able to provide to support the assessment third by using multiple approaches the uncertainty bounds around risk estimates can be quantified fourth the tiered approach also makes the developed risk assessment framework suitable for use at farm scale and as such fills an important research gap in using stochastic approaches for farm level risks assessments finally the methodologies proposed in the study can also be extended to larger spatial scales by evaluating risks at different farms or groups of similar farms within a region the developed methodology is illustrated by applying it to assess irrigated cotton production in the southern high plains of texas a large cotton producing area in the us 2 methodology as water is the critical limiting resource in arid and semi arid regions crop yields are assumed to be primarily controlled by water no other nutrient limitations are assumed to significantly affect the plant growth i e the farmer supplies adequate amounts of other required nutrients let y be the crop yield kg ha and cws be the water supplied to the crop mm if yc is a minimum acceptable yield then the crop yield risk cyr 1 c y r p y y c c w s f y c c w s where p is the probability and f the cumulative probability water is supplied to the crop through net precipitation prcp and net irrigation irr application eq 2 therefore 2 c w s p r c p i r r the response between the crop yield and water and other limiting nutrients is often modeled as a smooth concave quadratic function e g hexem and heady 1978 berck and helfand 1990 demonstrate that the smooth quadratic function is applicable at larger spatial scales e g field farm when the individual plant may follow the von liebig limiting model which states that the crop growth is not limited by the available resources but by the scarcest resource assumed to be water in this study due to aridity conditions of the study area paris 1992 therefore the conditional probabilistic relationship between crop yield and water is assumed to follow a quadratic relationship 2 1 logistic regression lr model if the minimum threshold yc is known then the conditional cumulative probability as defined in eq 1 can be computed using logistic regression lr in this case the logarithm of the odds ratio is assumed to be a quadratic function of the independent variable cws 3 l n f y c c w s 1 f y c c w s a o a 1 c w s a 2 c w s 2 a parsimonious linear model can also be obtained by neglecting the quadratic term in eq 3 the lr approach presented above is pragmatic and software packages r core team 2005 are available to perform the parameter estimation using the maximum likelihood approach hamilton 1991 the coefficient ao is the intercept and a1 and a2 can be interpreted as regression weights that condition the crop water supply terms in the eq 3 the results of the regression analysis critically depend upon the value of the defined yield cut off value yc and therefore it must be carefully selected the cut off value yc can be ascertained in at least two different ways first the minimum yield threshold can be interpreted as the lower bound of the farmer s anticipated yield this bound represents the minimum yield that the farmer is willing to accept as such the minimum value could represent the yield necessary for the farmer to break even or meet the required financial obligations this approach allows for the greatest customization of the results to an individual farmer as his her risk preferences are directly included in the assessment process in some instances a farmer may be unable to or unwilling to provide a specific threshold also when risk assessment is being carried out as part of regional scale planning endeavors a generic threshold suitable for the region becomes necessary when a crop can be grown under dryland and irrigated conditions it is of interest to know how irrigation reduces the crop yield risk in other words irrigation is unnecessary if the yields obtained under irrigation are the same as those expected under dryland farming conditions therefore the expected yield from dryland farming no irrigation presents a reasonable threshold to understand how the risk of crop yield loss is reduced by different levels of irrigation as dryland farming yields can vary from year to year due to differences in precipitation temperature and other agricultural practices such as nutrient and pest management it is best to view it as a stochastic variable if observed yields under dryland farming are known for a crop within a given region then the expected yield under dryland irrigation can be obtained as 4 y c 0 y d f y d d y d where yd denotes the dryland yields and f yd the corresponding probability density function agricultural production surveys such as those conducted by the u s department of agriculture usda nass 2018 provide the data required to solve eq 4 while cut offs based on break even yield or expected yield under dryland conditions offer practical approaches to assess risks it is also likely that a farmer may not be willing to accept or specify a single threshold in planning scenarios evaluating risks at different thresholds could be of interest in this case a separate lr model needs to be developed for different thresholds parameter estimation of the lr model becomes highly biased with unbalanced datasets and this situation arises when the cut off is chosen close to the extremes of the plausible yield values firth 1993 therefore developing the entire conditional probability distribution eq 1 represents a better option as it yields complete information about the potential crop yield 2 1 1 distribution regression dr model distribution regression foresi and peracchi 1995 provides a convenient approach to model distributions that are conditioned on other independent variables in this approach a theoretical distribution is specified for the random variable and the model parameters i e location shape and scale are assumed to be functions of other covariates such models are referred to as heterogeneous parameter distribution regression models in statistical literature e g rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 distribution regression dr has been used in hydrology and water resources fields to model nonstationary flooding distributions l√≥pez and franc√©s 2013 machado et al 2015 shrestha et al 2017 stedinger and griffis 2011 steirou et al 2019 villarini et al 2009 however to the best of our knowledge it has not been used to assess crop yield risks and this study is the first to do so maximum likelihood and quantile matching approaches have been proposed to fit distribution regression models uddameri et al 2019 mathematically a generic dr model for crop yield risk can be written as 5 c y r f y c Œº œÉ Œ∂ 6 Œº g c w s œÉ j c w s a n d Œ∂ h c w s where f is a specified theoretical distribution model and Œº œÉ Œ∂ are model parameters location shape and scale in eq 5 eq 6 states that these model parameters are not constant but vary as a function of total water supplied to the crops g j h are used to represent these functions in the above equations in practical applications a candidate set of theoretical distributions and relationships between model parameters and cws must be empirically constructed and tested to identify a suitable distribution regression model for cyr model discrimination methods such as the akaike information criterion aic that provide a suitable trade off between model fit and parameter parsimony can be used to identify a suitable model kim et al 2017 sakamoto et al 1986 2 2 joint probability jp model the two models developed so far assume that the estimates for cws are known a priori farmers often rely on seasonal forecasts to estimate a likely amount of precipitation during the growing season fraisse et al 2006 kolachian and saghafian 2019 seasonal forecasts however tend to be highly uncertain and can vary widely across various prediction tools yun et al 2003 therefore the amount of water from precipitation that is available during the growing season can be considered a random variable if the precipitation is a random variable then the amount of water supplied to the crop cws also becomes a random variable even when the amount of irrigation is fixed for a specified level of irrigation that the farmer chooses to apply the goal then is to estimate the probability of failure under precipitation uncertainty using eq 2 the cumulative distribution function cdf of cws can be ascertained from the cdf of seasonal precipitation benjamin and cornell 1970 7 f c w s w f p r c p w i r r where fcws is the cdf of the total water supplied to the crop cws from precipitation and irrigation irr is the maximum irrigation amount a farmer is willing to provide and w is any value that cws can assume fprcp is the cdf of the seasonal precipitation the cdf eq 7 can be developed from historical data if both irrigation amount and precipitation data are available or from future projections and farmer irrigation preferences in case for future risk assessments the crop yield risk given a threshold of cws can then be written using the kolmogorov axiom of conditional probability as follows 8 f y y y c c w s w f y c w s y c w f c w s w where f denotes the cumulative distribution function and the subscripts y and cws correspond to random variables crop yield and crop water supply the variable fy cws in the numerator in eq 8 denotes the joint cdf of crop yield and crop water supply while fcws denotes the marginal distribution of the crop water supply an appropriate marginal distribution for use with eq 7 can be ascertained by fitting several candidate theoretical distributions using parametric e g maximum likelihood or non parametric kernel density estimation methods benjamin and cornell 1970 theoretical models for joint probability distributions eq 8 can be obtained using copula theory genest and favre 2007 or using nonparametric kernel density estimation kde methods silverman 1986 both copula theory and kde have been widely used in water resources engineering and management studies borgomeo et al 2015 li et al 2019 santhosh and srinivas 2013 wang et al 2001 using eq 8 the conditional cumulative distribution of crop yield risk can be developed as the risk determination here is based on the joint probability distribution this approach is named jp model for brevity the lr dr and jp models presented above provide three tiered approaches to compute crop yield loss risks in terms of mathematical complexity jp dr lr however lr model is most restrictive in that requires an exact specification of crop water supply precipitation and irrigation and minimum yield threshold both dr and jp models provide the entire cdf for the crop yield risk but jp model provides the greatest flexibility as crop water supply cws is treated as a stochastic variable the specification uncertainty is lowest with lr model and progressively increases in dr and jp models thus the proposed framework allows flexibility in assessing crop yield risks based on the type of information a farmer decision maker is willing to specify during the risk assessment process the use of tiered approach is advantageous to place uncertainty bounds of the assessed risks if all three methods yield similar value then there can be greater confidence in the estimated risks on the other hand if models given different estimates then the uncertainty bounds can be determined when multiple methods are used the tiered theoretical risk assessment framework proposed above is schematically depicted in fig 1 and illustrated next by applying it to study risks to cotton production in the southern high plains shp region of texas 3 illustrative case study 3 1 study area the southern high plains shp region in texas also referred to as the texas high plains or thp is an agriculture intensive region that relies extensively on the ogallala formation of the high plains aquifer commonly referred to as the ogallala aquifer for irrigation fig 2 the climate in this region is erratic and has been punctuated with several periods of prolonged droughts shp is expected to become warmer and the interannual variability of precipitation is expected to increase further over the 21st century swain and hayhoe 2015 as groundwater is the only reliable source of water it has been used extensively since the 1950s predominantly for irrigated agriculture colaizzi et al 2009 over exploitation of groundwater in the region has caused severe declines of the groundwater table mcguire 2017 the groundwater table is very deep in many parts of the aquifer within shp and travel times through the vadose zone are estimated to be more than hundred years uddameri et al 2017 therefore diffuse recharge to the aquifer is minimal if any and the aquifer can be considered as an exhaustible resource for all practical purposes cotton is a major crop in the central and southern portions of the thp over 20 of the nation s cotton is grown in thp usda nass 2018 cotton in this region can be grown under both irrigated and dryland conditions however cotton yields improve with irrigation the mean yield under irrigated conditions is about two times that under dryland conditions usda nass 2018 while irrigation adds economic value in the short term it also threatens the long term viability of irrigated agriculture in the region therefore groundwater conservation districts gcds in this region have adopted the managed depletion paradigm and devised production rules that only allow 50 of the water to be depleted over the next 50 years hpwd 2019 deficit irrigation is a highly recommended water conservation strategy for cotton production in this region bronson et al 2006 howell et al 2004 modala et al 2015 the risk assessment modeling framework allows farmers to assess risks associated with cotton production under varying levels of deficit irrigation to make informed decisions aimed at balancing short term economic gains and long term water availability goals therefore the developed framework is illustrated by applying it to cotton production at a field located in the southern high plains of texas 3 2 risk assessment approach the first step of the risk assessment framework is to develop a database comprising of crop yields under varying levels of precipitation and irrigation while county level average yields are reported annually usda nass 2018 they do not fully capture the variability in irrigation practices and preferences of the farmers and as such not suitable for the risk assessment methodology developed here crop growth simulation models calibrated using field measurements provide a convenient approach to quantify crop yields under different weather conditions and irrigation strategies kisekka et al 2015 and the proposed risk assessment approach utilizes one such phenological crop growth model to estimate crop yields under different levels of crop water supply i e precipitation and irrigation the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model is a phenology based crop growth model that simulates crop yield as a function of soil plant atmospheric dynamics jones et al 2003 the model simulates crop growth and soil water dynamics at a daily time step irrigation fertilizer applications as well as other management options e g no till can be incorporated into the model to simulate realistic field situations the dssat has been widely used worldwide to model more than 40 varieties of crops the dssat model has been calibrated to simulate cotton growth in the shp region using lysimeter data and region specific cultivars adhikari et al 2017 this calibrated model was adopted in this study to establish relationships between crop yield precipitation and irrigation strategies a farmland located near levelland tx was chosen as a test site for this study as it lies in an intensive cotton growing region area that is also undergoing significant water scarcity due to depletion of the ogallala aquifer the local weather data from 1981 through 2017 from the levelland tx weather station and prism prism climate group 2019 were used in the simulations the site is underlain by amarillo sandy clay loam scl and the required soil properties for dssat model at the selected location were ascertained from usda ssurgo database nrcs usda 2018 crop yields were estimated for a variety of irrigation applications each year to capture variable water application practices of farmers in the region and the results from the simulations were compared to reported county wide annual yield statistics to further ensure the reasonableness of the calibrated models to predict cotton yields in the shp region see fig a 1 in supplementary information 1800 different model simulations were made at the selected location by changing weather conditions and irrigation practices by differing the frequency of application the threshold soil moisture to trigger irrigation events and using auto irrigate option to account for variations in irrigation scheduling with climate in addition to the yield at harvest seasonal water inputs precipitation and irrigation as well as crop water demands evapotranspiration were extracted for further analysis while the developed framework is based on total applied water over the entire season and does not explicitly take into account the patterns of irrigation the use of a large set of simulations with historical data different irrigation triggers and scheduling patterns arising from using auto irrigation option allowed for at least some of the scheduling effects to be implicitly included within the analysis a kernel density function kdf was constructed for reported dryland cotton yield from the region usda nass 2018 using the optimization approach suggested by sheather and jones 1991 and used to solve eq 4 which resulted in an expected value of cotton yield of approximately 450 kg ha in the absence of other information if a farmer were to cultivate cotton without irrigation then it is reasonable to expect this value irrigation should improve upon this yield the kernel density estimation was also used to estimate the joint probability distribution between yield y and crop water supply cws to solveeq 8 custom scripts were developed in r statistical programming environment r development core team 2019 and made use of appropriate packages for numerical integration tuszynski 2008 bivariate kernel density estimation duong 2007 to fit nonstationary models using the maximum likelihood approach stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 and to perform logistic regressions r core team 2005 4 results and discussion 4 1 crop yield risk assessment using logistic regression lr models logistic regression models corresponding to various cut offs yc ranging from 450 kg ha 850 kg ha were developed considering both linear and nonlinear quadratic relationship eq 3 using crop water supply cws as the independent variable the model coefficients are summarized in table 1 wald test indicated that all model coefficients were statistically different from zero p 0 05 while the fits for linear and nonlinear models were close for a given cut off the nonlinear model with the quadratic term provided a better fit to the data as measured using the akaike information criteria aic the likelihood ratio test also confirmed that the quadratic model gave better fits than the linear model using the absolute t value of each model parameter the cws terms was deemed to be more important than the quadratic cws term in the nonlinear model but retention of the quadratic term was necessary to improve the fit the crop yield risk corresponding to various levels of total water supplied to the crop from precipitation and irrigation for various acceptable yield cutoff are depicted in fig 3 as to be expected higher cutoffs which denote higher acceptable yields increase the crop yield risk at any given level of water supply the risk estimate is slightly higher for the nonlinear model fig 3a compared to the linear model fig 3b for a given level of crop water supply therefore the nonlinear model not only provided a better model as ascertained using aic and likelihood ratio tests but also resulted in slightly conservative estimates of risks the slope of the crop yield risk curve drops precipitously to a crop water supply value of about 550 mm and then the marginal change in risk per increase in irrigation amount is small unless a very high cutoff value 750 kg ha is selected this result indicates that providing a total water of about 550 mm is sufficient to reduce the crop yield risks down to a practical minimum level supplying water in excess of this value however does little to mitigate the risks further thus the 550 mm threshold denotes a generic risk based threshold for deficit irrigation practice this value corresponds to about 80 of the typical crop water demand in the region fig 3 can also be used to obtain risk based deficit irrigation levels corresponding to other levels of acceptable risk for example if 10 risk is acceptable the crop water supply can be in the range of 400 mm 500 mm 60 75 of the crop water demand if the acceptable yield is less than 650 kg ha based on the historical meteorological records the probability of precipitation in the growing season being greater than 550 mm is approximately 4 which indicates that some amount of irrigation will likely be required each growing season to keep the crop yield risks down to practically minimal values the median precipitation during the growing season is approximately 290 mm in the region which suggests a median irrigation level of at least 250 mm or 10 local groundwater production rules typically allow withdrawals of up to 450 mm 18 of water annually in this region hpwd 2019 understanding crop yield risks to guide irrigation decisions has the potential to reduce groundwater production in the region and prolong the useful life of the aquifer 4 2 crop risk assessment using distribution regression dr models distribution regression was carried out using six different candidate distributions 1 exponential 2 gamma 3 gumbel 4 lognormal 5 weibull and 6 box cox cole green bccg the exponential is a single parameter location only distribution and bccg is a three parameter location scale and shape distribution while the others are all two parameter distributions location and scale these distributions are commonly used in risk assessment studies haas 1997 and cover a range of models in terms of their mathematical complexity and required number of model parameters model fitting was carried out for a total of six combinations the shape parameter is often treated as a stationary parameter to avoid computational difficulties reduce the chances of obtaining unrealistic parameter estimates and maintain model parsimony cheng et al 2014 uddameri et al 2019 van ogtrop et al 2011 the candidate distributions were fit by considering the location parameter to be a linear or quadratic nonlinear function of crop water supply cws the scale parameter was assumed to be either stationary linear or nonlinear quadratic function of cws in addition the most parsimonious model with location scale and shape all treated as constants stationary was also constructed model coefficients for all fitted models are provided in supplementary information table a 1 based on the evaluation of the goodness of fit tests and aic the bccg model was noted to be the best among the candidate models and table 2 provides the model fits for the bccg model the truncated bccg distribution is developed by first applying the box cox transformation to the random variable y to create a transformed random variable z which is assumed to follow the normal distribution with the density adjusted to correct for the truncation of y 0 cole and green 1992 rigby and stasinopoulos 2004 mathematically the untransformed bccg can be written as eq 9 and eq 10 9 f y Œº œÉ ŒΩ 1 2 œÄ œÉ y œÖ 1 Œº v e x p z 2 2 where 10 z y Œº ŒΩ 1 ŒΩ œÉ œÖ 0 a n d z log y Œº œÉ i f œÖ 0 the density function is adjusted for truncation to ensure that the probability under the curve is equal to one the inclusion of the scale parameter adds greater flexibility to the bccg model and allows a better fit of the data the heterogeneous models where location and scale were modeled as functions of cws performed better than stationary constant values for model parameters models as measured using aic indicating the crop yield distribution is affected by water supplied to the plants during the growing season the relatively low standard errors of estimation also indicated that the estimated parameters were significant for the bccg model in addition to the aic the goodness of fit of the bccg models were assessed by performing residual analysis the normality of the residuals was assessed by comparing the q q plot presented in fig 4 which indicated that the residuals largely followed normal distributions except perhaps at the tails the detrended q q plot also referred to as the worm plot buuren van and fredriks 2001 presented in the supplementary information fig a 2 also indicated similar behavior for the residuals the first four statistical moments for the standardized model residuals are presented in table 3 for the best fit bccg model as can be seen the mean of the residuals is close to zero and the standard deviation is unity white noise again the skewness is close to zero and the kurtosis close to 3 which are the theoretical values for the normal distribution visual inspection of the residuals did not indicate autocorrelation of residuals or heteroskedasticity which added further confidence to the model fitting process the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc filliben 1975 is greater than 0 995 for all nonstationary bccg model residuals again indicating the nonstationary models are able to model the observed crop yields with a high degree of accuracy in addition the noted high ppcc values also add credence to the estimation of the shape parameter of the bccg model bccg models where the location parameter is modeled using a quadratic cws relationship generally have lower aic values than their linear counterparts see table 3 when the location parameter is modeled as a nonlinear function of cws the relationship used for the scale parameter has little influence both linear and nonlinear models for the scale parameter when the location is considered nonlinear have the same aic values and yielded similar residuals therefore the nonlinear location and linear scale bccg model could be selected as the final model based on parsimony considerations for illustrative purposes the cumulative distribution for crop yield i e crop yield risk functions for all six models are presented here fig 5 once a distribution regression model is developed and identified the cumulative distribution functions for crop yield for various levels of crop water supply cws can be developed fig 5 shows the cdf functions corresponding to various cws values for the six models identified in table 3 the crop yield risk functions in fig 5 indicates the risk of obtaining a yield lower than or equal to a selected value on the x axis this selected value would represent the cut off threshold a farmer may choose to evaluate the higher the threshold the greater the risk the risk is also a function of the cws for a selected crop yield cutoff threshold the risk decreases with increasing cws notice that the risk profiles are plotted at cws values that vary from 300 mm to 800 mm in intervals of 100 mm for smaller values of cws the risk profiles are further apart and they get closer to each other as the cws values increase this result indicates that increasing cws at lower values via irrigation is beneficial but the benefits of irrigation start diminishing at higher levels in other words irrigation is useful to reduce the risks at lower levels of crop water supply but the marginal improvements in risk decrease with increased amount of irrigation the spacing between the risk profiles corresponding to different cws critically depend upon how the scale parameter is being modeled somewhat counter intuitive results i e greater risk reductions at higher levels of irrigation as compared to lower levels of irrigation can arise if a higher degree of nonlinearity is induced in the scale parameter especially in comparison to the location parameter for example see fig 5e this result arises because the scale parameters are small at lower cws but increase nonlinearly at higher values of cws therefore in addition to statistical comparisons the physical basis of the derived risk distributions must also be borne in mind when selecting the right model and interpreting the results the results here indicate that introducing a high degree of nonlinearity in the scale parameter especially without concomitant nonlinearity in the location parameter can lead to physically unrealistic results it is therefore recommended that the parameterization for the scale parameter be as parsimonious as possible nonlinear heterogeneous model should be only used for the scale parameter if it provides a much better fit than a model which assumes a linear scale heterogeneity at lower crop water supplies cws dr models that use a linear model for the location parameter provide a lower level of risk compared to their nonlinear counterparts on the other hand at higher water applications the linear location models estimate a slightly higher level of risk as seen in table 2 the coefficient for the quadratic cws term is always negative at higher cws values this term assumes greater importance and does not cause the location parameter to shift as significantly compared to the linear models where the scale shifts are in proportion to the cws the result of the interplay between the linear and quadratic cws term in the location is the straightening of the risk profiles increases in cws cause smaller changes in crop yield risks similarly adding a higher degree of nonlinearity stationary linear nonlinear in the scale parameter also sharpens the slope of the risk profile especially at higher levels of water application for drought contingency planning realistic yield thresholds and water application rates tend to be on the lower end therefore modeling the location parameter using a nonlinear cws parameter is recommended to obtain conservative values for risk 4 3 bivariate risk assessment modeling using joint probability jp models the nonparametric kernel density estimation kde was used to construct the bivariate joint distribution between crop yield and crop water supply the joint cumulative distribution function joint cdf was directly estimated using gaussian kernels and through minimization of the integrated mean square error mise the gaussian kernel was adopted here because the joint cdf is a smooth function without discontinuities and is known to be suitable for constructing multivariate models otneim and tj√∏stheim 2017 as irrigation levels can vary for a given precipitation the joint distribution between the crop yield and crop water supply can have probability mass oriented away from the coordinate directions unconstrainted optimization of the bandwidth assuming cross diagonal terms is recommended in such cases wand and jones 1994 and as such adopted here also as the cdf is of interest here it was directly estimated using procedures outlined by duong 2007 this approach eliminates the need for numerical integration of the pdf and therefore minimizes errors in computation of the cdf lall et al 1993 the bivariate cdf obtained using the kde were compared against the bivariate gringorten plotting position formula hao and aghakouchak 2014 yue et al 1999 the evaluation metrics summarized in table 4 point to the reasonableness of the kde joint distribution as it has a near zero mean square error a very small bias pbias and kge bias and a high correlation coefficient coefficient of determination r2 and kge correlation the model also performs well when evaluated using overall efficiency metrics such as the nash sutcliff efficiency metric and the kling gupta efficiency measure therefore the joint distribution was deemed sufficient for this illustrative study the joint distribution between crop water supply and crop yield is shown in fig 6 again for a specified cumulative crop yield cutoff the risk decreases with increasing water supply and for a given threshold of water supply the crop yield risk increases with increasing crop yield cutoff values the marginal distribution of the crop water supply is also needed for the crop yield risk conditioned upon a maximum threshold of crop water supply eq 8 the kde approach with gaussian kernels and mean integrated square error mise bandwidth estimate was used to construct the cdf of the crop water supply this kde based cdf was compared to the empirical gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 to evaluate its adequacy the metrics presented in table 4 for marginal cws distribution show the fit to be excellent across a suite of metrics and therefore the kde based cdf was used to define the marginal distribution of crop water supply cws and is depicted in fig 7 the conditional probability distribution of crop yield given a threshold crop water supply is depicted in fig 8 it is again evident from the distribution that for an assumed threshold of crop water supply the crop risk probability value of the cdf increases with higher crop yield thresholds the conditional distribution also helps farmers evaluate the level of crop yield risk for an upper limit of water supply for example if a farmer chooses to supply no more than 600 mm of water through precipitation and irrigation then there is a 97 5 chance that the crop yield is going to be greater than 150 kg ha but there is only a 40 chance that the crop yield will be greater than 1000 kg ha the conditional probability plot is also useful to identify minimum risk associated with a selected threshold regardless of the amount of water supplied for example if a farmer chooses 500 kg ha as the minimum crop yield threshold then there is at least a 15 risk that the yield could be less than that value regardless of the amount of water supplied to the crop the marginal increases in risks due to the curtailment of the water supply can be ascertained from the conditional probability distribution presented in fig 8 the flattening of the probability contours can be seen around 550 mm 600 mm of crop water supply 80 85 of the crop water demand this result implies that for a given risk level probability the crop yield threshold increases rapidly when the crop water applied is below 550 mm 600 mm in other words for a given crop yield threshold the risk decreases fairly rapidly as crop water supply is increased to a value of 550 mm 600 mm however after this threshold the slope of the contour changes more slowly implying that additional water additions only alter the risk marginally a similar cut off was also noted in the risk profiles calculated using logistic regression see fig 3 once again confirming the need for some irrigation to mitigate the risks of lower crop yield but the utility of irrigation diminishes past the 550 mm 600 mm 80 85 of crop water demand threshold indicating the feasibility of deficit irrigation practices 5 summary and conclusions the vulnerability associated with droughts is projected to increase in many arid and semi arid regions such as the southern high plains of texas the increased propensity of this climate hazard coupled with declines in groundwater levels threaten the viability of groundwater reliant irrigated agriculture in these areas when water is constrained farmers must weigh the short term benefit of irrigating their crops against the long term goal of prolonging the availability of their secure water supplies i e groundwater resources decision support tools that provide pertinent information to farmers to weigh the trade offs of irrigation are therefore useful crop yield risk is defined as the probability of obtaining a yield below a pre specified acceptable threshold as water is a major resource constraint for agriculture in arid and semi arid regions the crop yield risk is assumed to be a function of the amount of water supplied to the crop i e crop water supply this water supply typically comes from precipitation and irrigation the primary focus of this study was to develop a comprehensive risk assessment framework to assess crop yield risks its utility is illustrated to study cotton production at a farm in the southern high plains of texas the developed methodology provides a generic interdisciplinary approach that integrates concepts of probability and statistics with field data and crop growth modeling to assess crop yield loss risks in a progressively complex fashion while this generic approach can be adopted to any crop in any region the elements of the proposed methodology i e the lr dr and jp models must be customized to capture constraints on the crop growth for example it might be necessary to add both nutrient and water limitations when extending this framework to corn in a similar vein crop growth models must be recalibrated to specific climate and soil conditions as well as management practices at the site the relationship between crop yield and water supply the critical limiting resource provides the necessary foundation for the proposed risk assessment methods such relationships are developed using calibrated phenological crop growth models with site specific climate soils and management irrigation data logistic regression lr is used to estimate the probability of crop yield risk i e probability of obtaining yields below a pre specified threshold as a function of crop water supply i e irrigation precipitation water both linear and nonlinear models were developed at the illustrative study area with the nonlinear formulations exhibiting better fits the results indicated that some amount of irrigation was necessary to reduce the crop yield risks a threshold crop water supply of about 550 mm 80 of crop water demand was seen to be necessary to reduce risks down to practically negligible levels further additions of water beyond this threshold yielded marginal reductions in risks while the lr approach is pragmatic it requires a minimum acceptable crop yield to be specified a priori the construction of the entire cumulative distribution function cdf of the crop yield allows one to estimate crop yield risks corresponding to various crop water supply or irrigation levels as crop yields critically depend upon the amount of water supplied its cdf is assumed to be non stationary dr approach the model parameters of the theoretical crop yield cdf were modeled as both linear and nonlinear functions of crop water supply for the illustrative case study six different distributions with linear and nonlinear quadratic functions of cws for the location parameter as well as stationary linear and quadratic functions for the scale parameters were fit using the maximum likelihood method and evaluated using goodness of fit and residual analysis the results indicated that the three parameter box cox cole green bccg distribution provided the best fit when the location parameter was modeled as a nonlinear quadratic function of cws scale as a linear function of cws and the shape parameter considered as stationary the study also highlighted that modeling the scale parameter using nonlinear relationships may lead to physically unrealistic results the dr approach is useful to construct the entire cdf of the crop yield as a function of crop water supply cws and evaluate how changes in crop water supply will alter the risks of crop yields being below a specified threshold the lr and dr models assume that the crop water supply cws is known a priori in reality cws depends upon precipitation which is a stochastic variable and may not be known with complete certainty therefore modeling cws as a stochastic variable offers the most realistic approach to assess crop yield risks the kolmogorov axiom was used to compute the conditional probability of crop yields being below a specified threshold for an assumed maximum amount of water supply jp approach the illustrative case study used kernel density estimation kde to construct the joint probability distribution between crop yield and crop water supply and also the marginal distribution of crop water supply the conditional probability distribution is useful to assess the minimum risk regardless of the amount of total water applied associated with obtaining a threshold minimum crop yield in addition the conditional distribution also helps evaluate how increases in crop water yields reduce crop yield risks again a threshold crop water supply around 550 mm 600 mm 80 85 of the crop water demand was noted in the illustrative case study increasing crop water up to this threshold was seen to reduce the crop yield risks significantly but further increases in water supply had a marginal impact on risk reduction the study shows how to estimate crop yield risks under varying levels and assumptions of crop water supply from irrigation and precipitation yield risks directly translate to economic risks and therefore assessment of crop yield risks help farmers understand how their water supply irrigation decisions affect anticipated productivity revenues the proposed framework is useful to help farmers assess deficit irrigation practices using risk metrics the developed methodology is generic and can be used with any crop as long as the relationship between the yield and limiting resources i

10589,agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions is threatened by increased droughts climate change and groundwater depletion farmers increasingly must weigh the short term economic gains from irrigation against the long term aquifer longevity needs risk based deficit irrigation is proposed to tackle this trade off a tiered risk assessment approach is developed to evaluate crop yield loss risks as a function of crop water supply cws from irrigation and precipitation risk is defined as the probability of obtaining a crop yield below a pre specified threshold logistic regression is used to quantify risks as a function of cws if the producer can specify a fixed minimum yield threshold distribution regression is used to develop the cumulative distribution function of the crop yield assuming heterogeneous model parameter and is useful when the producer can estimate cws but cannot specify a minimum yield threshold finally the cws is also modeled as a stochastic variable and the crop yield risk conditioned on cws risk is computed using the kolmogorov axiom the methodology is illustrated using a cotton production case study in the southern high plains of texas logistic regression indicated that crop yield risk was a nonlinear function of cws cws corresponding to 80 of the total crop water demand was enough to reach negligible crop yield risks heterogeneous cotton yield distribution was modeled using box cox cole green function with location and scale parameters being nonlinear and linear functions of cws respectively and a stationary shape parameter irrigation at lower cws reduced the risks substantially but the risk reductions were marginal at higher cws the conditional distribution of crop yield risk indicated that cws corresponding to 80 85 of crop water demand was enough to bring down risks the tiered risk assessment provides a rational risk based approach to evaluate the impacts of crop water supply reductions and promote deficit irrigation practices keywords droughts aquifer depletion deficit irrigation distribution regression kernel density estimation crop yield risks climate change probabilistic risk assessment 1 introduction water is a critical limiting resource in arid and semi arid environments such as the southern high plains shp region of texas therefore these regions are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious impacts of climate change swain and hayhoe 2015 in particular intensification of droughts is anticipated in these areas fereres and soriano 2006 huang et al 2016 ragab and prudhomme 2002 global crop production has already been affected by water scarcity and heat stresses caused by droughts lesk et al 2016 agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions are projected to exhibit increased sensitivity to future climate change pe√±a gallardo et al 2019 steiner et al 2018 irrigation provides resilience against droughts and helps buffer crop yield losses in agricultural systems in arid and semi arid regions groundwater is often the only reliable water source and has been extensively used for irrigated agriculture siebert et al 2010 in agriculturally intensive areas groundwater extraction often increases to overcome the additional demands placed by droughts russo and lall 2017 historically there has been limited governance and management of groundwater resources which has led to its inefficient use uddameri 2005 over exploitation of groundwater has severely depleted many aquifers in agriculturally intensive areas gleeson et al 2012 scanlon et al 2012 this depletion has greatly threatened the viability of groundwater reliant agriculture dominant environments grades uddameri and reible 2018 water table declines in unconfined aquifers create many negative consequences such declines threaten long term water availability in the region also water table declines reduce transmissivity of unconfined aquifers and affect the rate of water flow to a well this reduction in transmissivity manifests as reduced well yields and threatens the ability of farmers to provide water to crops at critical crop growth stages therefore even when management policies that restrict groundwater production are not in place aquifer depletion naturally limits the availability of water supplies during the growing season when water levels in aquifers start to drop appreciably farmers need to rely more heavily on natural precipitation water to overcome their ability to irrigate and use their dwindling water resources judiciously irrigation has the short term benefit of generating higher crop yields but accelerates the path toward groundwater resource exhaustion on the other hand complete or higher reliance on precipitation can affect crop yields and revenues in the short term but prolongs the useful life of the aquifer therefore in water scarce regions balancing short term water needs against long term resource availability is a challenge that farmers face deficit irrigation refers to the situation where farmers do not supply all of the crop water demand but seek to balance the loss of short term yield against long term benefits of water conservation fereres and soriano 2006 geerts and raes 2009 however deficit irrigation and increased reliance on natural precipitation water make agricultural systems susceptible to crop yield losses or reductions and the risk of insufficient crop yields is often a primary concern that limits farmers from implementing deficit irrigation practices risk is generally defined as the probability of failure bahr 2018 in the context of an agricultural system failure can be defined as the likelihood of not obtaining an anticipated or de minimis crop yield naylor et al 2007 this definition as an extreme case subsumes complete loss of the crop i e zero yield therefore the probability distribution function of the crop yield can be used in conjunction with a minimum acceptable yield threshold to define crop yield loss risk while agricultural production is influenced by many factors such as climate soil fertility pest management and technology adoption water is a primary resource constraint especially in arid and semi arid regions therefore it is assumed that the probability distribution of the crop yield is conditioned on the amount of water applied to the crop at a given farm the amount of water supplies from precipitation and irrigation vary across seasons thus crop yield risks must be assessed using a stochastic framework there is a growing recognition that climate change can have deleterious impacts on crop yields campbell et al 2016 and that risks of crop yield losses due to changing climate need to be understood to ensure food security tito et al 2018 there has been an increased emphasis on using stochastic approaches to understand crop yield loss risks under drought conditions in particular copula based approaches have been used to understand crop yield losses under various drought conditions leng and hall 2019 feng et al 2019 on global and national scales understanding crop yield risk losses at farm scale is also an important endeavor but has not received much attention in the literature therefore the primary goal of this study is to develop a stochastic risk assessment framework to evaluate crop yield loss risks due to water scarcity caused by droughts a natural hazard and groundwater depletion hazard which limits the farmer s ability to irrigate the novelty of the proposed approach is five fold first the proposed approach integrates stochastic modeling approaches proposed in probabilistic risk assessment literature with field data and phenologically based crop modeling methods of agricultural sciences to develop an innovative interdisciplinary framework to assess crop yield loss risks under climate change and groundwater depletion second the risk assessment process is tiered which in this context implies that the risk assessment can be carried out in a sequential manner with progressively increasing complexity this tiered approach allows for flexibility in risk characterization and allows risk assessors to adapt their evaluation depending upon how much information is available during the decision making process and how much insights a farmer or a decision maker is able to provide to support the assessment third by using multiple approaches the uncertainty bounds around risk estimates can be quantified fourth the tiered approach also makes the developed risk assessment framework suitable for use at farm scale and as such fills an important research gap in using stochastic approaches for farm level risks assessments finally the methodologies proposed in the study can also be extended to larger spatial scales by evaluating risks at different farms or groups of similar farms within a region the developed methodology is illustrated by applying it to assess irrigated cotton production in the southern high plains of texas a large cotton producing area in the us 2 methodology as water is the critical limiting resource in arid and semi arid regions crop yields are assumed to be primarily controlled by water no other nutrient limitations are assumed to significantly affect the plant growth i e the farmer supplies adequate amounts of other required nutrients let y be the crop yield kg ha and cws be the water supplied to the crop mm if yc is a minimum acceptable yield then the crop yield risk cyr 1 c y r p y y c c w s f y c c w s where p is the probability and f the cumulative probability water is supplied to the crop through net precipitation prcp and net irrigation irr application eq 2 therefore 2 c w s p r c p i r r the response between the crop yield and water and other limiting nutrients is often modeled as a smooth concave quadratic function e g hexem and heady 1978 berck and helfand 1990 demonstrate that the smooth quadratic function is applicable at larger spatial scales e g field farm when the individual plant may follow the von liebig limiting model which states that the crop growth is not limited by the available resources but by the scarcest resource assumed to be water in this study due to aridity conditions of the study area paris 1992 therefore the conditional probabilistic relationship between crop yield and water is assumed to follow a quadratic relationship 2 1 logistic regression lr model if the minimum threshold yc is known then the conditional cumulative probability as defined in eq 1 can be computed using logistic regression lr in this case the logarithm of the odds ratio is assumed to be a quadratic function of the independent variable cws 3 l n f y c c w s 1 f y c c w s a o a 1 c w s a 2 c w s 2 a parsimonious linear model can also be obtained by neglecting the quadratic term in eq 3 the lr approach presented above is pragmatic and software packages r core team 2005 are available to perform the parameter estimation using the maximum likelihood approach hamilton 1991 the coefficient ao is the intercept and a1 and a2 can be interpreted as regression weights that condition the crop water supply terms in the eq 3 the results of the regression analysis critically depend upon the value of the defined yield cut off value yc and therefore it must be carefully selected the cut off value yc can be ascertained in at least two different ways first the minimum yield threshold can be interpreted as the lower bound of the farmer s anticipated yield this bound represents the minimum yield that the farmer is willing to accept as such the minimum value could represent the yield necessary for the farmer to break even or meet the required financial obligations this approach allows for the greatest customization of the results to an individual farmer as his her risk preferences are directly included in the assessment process in some instances a farmer may be unable to or unwilling to provide a specific threshold also when risk assessment is being carried out as part of regional scale planning endeavors a generic threshold suitable for the region becomes necessary when a crop can be grown under dryland and irrigated conditions it is of interest to know how irrigation reduces the crop yield risk in other words irrigation is unnecessary if the yields obtained under irrigation are the same as those expected under dryland farming conditions therefore the expected yield from dryland farming no irrigation presents a reasonable threshold to understand how the risk of crop yield loss is reduced by different levels of irrigation as dryland farming yields can vary from year to year due to differences in precipitation temperature and other agricultural practices such as nutrient and pest management it is best to view it as a stochastic variable if observed yields under dryland farming are known for a crop within a given region then the expected yield under dryland irrigation can be obtained as 4 y c 0 y d f y d d y d where yd denotes the dryland yields and f yd the corresponding probability density function agricultural production surveys such as those conducted by the u s department of agriculture usda nass 2018 provide the data required to solve eq 4 while cut offs based on break even yield or expected yield under dryland conditions offer practical approaches to assess risks it is also likely that a farmer may not be willing to accept or specify a single threshold in planning scenarios evaluating risks at different thresholds could be of interest in this case a separate lr model needs to be developed for different thresholds parameter estimation of the lr model becomes highly biased with unbalanced datasets and this situation arises when the cut off is chosen close to the extremes of the plausible yield values firth 1993 therefore developing the entire conditional probability distribution eq 1 represents a better option as it yields complete information about the potential crop yield 2 1 1 distribution regression dr model distribution regression foresi and peracchi 1995 provides a convenient approach to model distributions that are conditioned on other independent variables in this approach a theoretical distribution is specified for the random variable and the model parameters i e location shape and scale are assumed to be functions of other covariates such models are referred to as heterogeneous parameter distribution regression models in statistical literature e g rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 distribution regression dr has been used in hydrology and water resources fields to model nonstationary flooding distributions l√≥pez and franc√©s 2013 machado et al 2015 shrestha et al 2017 stedinger and griffis 2011 steirou et al 2019 villarini et al 2009 however to the best of our knowledge it has not been used to assess crop yield risks and this study is the first to do so maximum likelihood and quantile matching approaches have been proposed to fit distribution regression models uddameri et al 2019 mathematically a generic dr model for crop yield risk can be written as 5 c y r f y c Œº œÉ Œ∂ 6 Œº g c w s œÉ j c w s a n d Œ∂ h c w s where f is a specified theoretical distribution model and Œº œÉ Œ∂ are model parameters location shape and scale in eq 5 eq 6 states that these model parameters are not constant but vary as a function of total water supplied to the crops g j h are used to represent these functions in the above equations in practical applications a candidate set of theoretical distributions and relationships between model parameters and cws must be empirically constructed and tested to identify a suitable distribution regression model for cyr model discrimination methods such as the akaike information criterion aic that provide a suitable trade off between model fit and parameter parsimony can be used to identify a suitable model kim et al 2017 sakamoto et al 1986 2 2 joint probability jp model the two models developed so far assume that the estimates for cws are known a priori farmers often rely on seasonal forecasts to estimate a likely amount of precipitation during the growing season fraisse et al 2006 kolachian and saghafian 2019 seasonal forecasts however tend to be highly uncertain and can vary widely across various prediction tools yun et al 2003 therefore the amount of water from precipitation that is available during the growing season can be considered a random variable if the precipitation is a random variable then the amount of water supplied to the crop cws also becomes a random variable even when the amount of irrigation is fixed for a specified level of irrigation that the farmer chooses to apply the goal then is to estimate the probability of failure under precipitation uncertainty using eq 2 the cumulative distribution function cdf of cws can be ascertained from the cdf of seasonal precipitation benjamin and cornell 1970 7 f c w s w f p r c p w i r r where fcws is the cdf of the total water supplied to the crop cws from precipitation and irrigation irr is the maximum irrigation amount a farmer is willing to provide and w is any value that cws can assume fprcp is the cdf of the seasonal precipitation the cdf eq 7 can be developed from historical data if both irrigation amount and precipitation data are available or from future projections and farmer irrigation preferences in case for future risk assessments the crop yield risk given a threshold of cws can then be written using the kolmogorov axiom of conditional probability as follows 8 f y y y c c w s w f y c w s y c w f c w s w where f denotes the cumulative distribution function and the subscripts y and cws correspond to random variables crop yield and crop water supply the variable fy cws in the numerator in eq 8 denotes the joint cdf of crop yield and crop water supply while fcws denotes the marginal distribution of the crop water supply an appropriate marginal distribution for use with eq 7 can be ascertained by fitting several candidate theoretical distributions using parametric e g maximum likelihood or non parametric kernel density estimation methods benjamin and cornell 1970 theoretical models for joint probability distributions eq 8 can be obtained using copula theory genest and favre 2007 or using nonparametric kernel density estimation kde methods silverman 1986 both copula theory and kde have been widely used in water resources engineering and management studies borgomeo et al 2015 li et al 2019 santhosh and srinivas 2013 wang et al 2001 using eq 8 the conditional cumulative distribution of crop yield risk can be developed as the risk determination here is based on the joint probability distribution this approach is named jp model for brevity the lr dr and jp models presented above provide three tiered approaches to compute crop yield loss risks in terms of mathematical complexity jp dr lr however lr model is most restrictive in that requires an exact specification of crop water supply precipitation and irrigation and minimum yield threshold both dr and jp models provide the entire cdf for the crop yield risk but jp model provides the greatest flexibility as crop water supply cws is treated as a stochastic variable the specification uncertainty is lowest with lr model and progressively increases in dr and jp models thus the proposed framework allows flexibility in assessing crop yield risks based on the type of information a farmer decision maker is willing to specify during the risk assessment process the use of tiered approach is advantageous to place uncertainty bounds of the assessed risks if all three methods yield similar value then there can be greater confidence in the estimated risks on the other hand if models given different estimates then the uncertainty bounds can be determined when multiple methods are used the tiered theoretical risk assessment framework proposed above is schematically depicted in fig 1 and illustrated next by applying it to study risks to cotton production in the southern high plains shp region of texas 3 illustrative case study 3 1 study area the southern high plains shp region in texas also referred to as the texas high plains or thp is an agriculture intensive region that relies extensively on the ogallala formation of the high plains aquifer commonly referred to as the ogallala aquifer for irrigation fig 2 the climate in this region is erratic and has been punctuated with several periods of prolonged droughts shp is expected to become warmer and the interannual variability of precipitation is expected to increase further over the 21st century swain and hayhoe 2015 as groundwater is the only reliable source of water it has been used extensively since the 1950s predominantly for irrigated agriculture colaizzi et al 2009 over exploitation of groundwater in the region has caused severe declines of the groundwater table mcguire 2017 the groundwater table is very deep in many parts of the aquifer within shp and travel times through the vadose zone are estimated to be more than hundred years uddameri et al 2017 therefore diffuse recharge to the aquifer is minimal if any and the aquifer can be considered as an exhaustible resource for all practical purposes cotton is a major crop in the central and southern portions of the thp over 20 of the nation s cotton is grown in thp usda nass 2018 cotton in this region can be grown under both irrigated and dryland conditions however cotton yields improve with irrigation the mean yield under irrigated conditions is about two times that under dryland conditions usda nass 2018 while irrigation adds economic value in the short term it also threatens the long term viability of irrigated agriculture in the region therefore groundwater conservation districts gcds in this region have adopted the managed depletion paradigm and devised production rules that only allow 50 of the water to be depleted over the next 50 years hpwd 2019 deficit irrigation is a highly recommended water conservation strategy for cotton production in this region bronson et al 2006 howell et al 2004 modala et al 2015 the risk assessment modeling framework allows farmers to assess risks associated with cotton production under varying levels of deficit irrigation to make informed decisions aimed at balancing short term economic gains and long term water availability goals therefore the developed framework is illustrated by applying it to cotton production at a field located in the southern high plains of texas 3 2 risk assessment approach the first step of the risk assessment framework is to develop a database comprising of crop yields under varying levels of precipitation and irrigation while county level average yields are reported annually usda nass 2018 they do not fully capture the variability in irrigation practices and preferences of the farmers and as such not suitable for the risk assessment methodology developed here crop growth simulation models calibrated using field measurements provide a convenient approach to quantify crop yields under different weather conditions and irrigation strategies kisekka et al 2015 and the proposed risk assessment approach utilizes one such phenological crop growth model to estimate crop yields under different levels of crop water supply i e precipitation and irrigation the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model is a phenology based crop growth model that simulates crop yield as a function of soil plant atmospheric dynamics jones et al 2003 the model simulates crop growth and soil water dynamics at a daily time step irrigation fertilizer applications as well as other management options e g no till can be incorporated into the model to simulate realistic field situations the dssat has been widely used worldwide to model more than 40 varieties of crops the dssat model has been calibrated to simulate cotton growth in the shp region using lysimeter data and region specific cultivars adhikari et al 2017 this calibrated model was adopted in this study to establish relationships between crop yield precipitation and irrigation strategies a farmland located near levelland tx was chosen as a test site for this study as it lies in an intensive cotton growing region area that is also undergoing significant water scarcity due to depletion of the ogallala aquifer the local weather data from 1981 through 2017 from the levelland tx weather station and prism prism climate group 2019 were used in the simulations the site is underlain by amarillo sandy clay loam scl and the required soil properties for dssat model at the selected location were ascertained from usda ssurgo database nrcs usda 2018 crop yields were estimated for a variety of irrigation applications each year to capture variable water application practices of farmers in the region and the results from the simulations were compared to reported county wide annual yield statistics to further ensure the reasonableness of the calibrated models to predict cotton yields in the shp region see fig a 1 in supplementary information 1800 different model simulations were made at the selected location by changing weather conditions and irrigation practices by differing the frequency of application the threshold soil moisture to trigger irrigation events and using auto irrigate option to account for variations in irrigation scheduling with climate in addition to the yield at harvest seasonal water inputs precipitation and irrigation as well as crop water demands evapotranspiration were extracted for further analysis while the developed framework is based on total applied water over the entire season and does not explicitly take into account the patterns of irrigation the use of a large set of simulations with historical data different irrigation triggers and scheduling patterns arising from using auto irrigation option allowed for at least some of the scheduling effects to be implicitly included within the analysis a kernel density function kdf was constructed for reported dryland cotton yield from the region usda nass 2018 using the optimization approach suggested by sheather and jones 1991 and used to solve eq 4 which resulted in an expected value of cotton yield of approximately 450 kg ha in the absence of other information if a farmer were to cultivate cotton without irrigation then it is reasonable to expect this value irrigation should improve upon this yield the kernel density estimation was also used to estimate the joint probability distribution between yield y and crop water supply cws to solveeq 8 custom scripts were developed in r statistical programming environment r development core team 2019 and made use of appropriate packages for numerical integration tuszynski 2008 bivariate kernel density estimation duong 2007 to fit nonstationary models using the maximum likelihood approach stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 and to perform logistic regressions r core team 2005 4 results and discussion 4 1 crop yield risk assessment using logistic regression lr models logistic regression models corresponding to various cut offs yc ranging from 450 kg ha 850 kg ha were developed considering both linear and nonlinear quadratic relationship eq 3 using crop water supply cws as the independent variable the model coefficients are summarized in table 1 wald test indicated that all model coefficients were statistically different from zero p 0 05 while the fits for linear and nonlinear models were close for a given cut off the nonlinear model with the quadratic term provided a better fit to the data as measured using the akaike information criteria aic the likelihood ratio test also confirmed that the quadratic model gave better fits than the linear model using the absolute t value of each model parameter the cws terms was deemed to be more important than the quadratic cws term in the nonlinear model but retention of the quadratic term was necessary to improve the fit the crop yield risk corresponding to various levels of total water supplied to the crop from precipitation and irrigation for various acceptable yield cutoff are depicted in fig 3 as to be expected higher cutoffs which denote higher acceptable yields increase the crop yield risk at any given level of water supply the risk estimate is slightly higher for the nonlinear model fig 3a compared to the linear model fig 3b for a given level of crop water supply therefore the nonlinear model not only provided a better model as ascertained using aic and likelihood ratio tests but also resulted in slightly conservative estimates of risks the slope of the crop yield risk curve drops precipitously to a crop water supply value of about 550 mm and then the marginal change in risk per increase in irrigation amount is small unless a very high cutoff value 750 kg ha is selected this result indicates that providing a total water of about 550 mm is sufficient to reduce the crop yield risks down to a practical minimum level supplying water in excess of this value however does little to mitigate the risks further thus the 550 mm threshold denotes a generic risk based threshold for deficit irrigation practice this value corresponds to about 80 of the typical crop water demand in the region fig 3 can also be used to obtain risk based deficit irrigation levels corresponding to other levels of acceptable risk for example if 10 risk is acceptable the crop water supply can be in the range of 400 mm 500 mm 60 75 of the crop water demand if the acceptable yield is less than 650 kg ha based on the historical meteorological records the probability of precipitation in the growing season being greater than 550 mm is approximately 4 which indicates that some amount of irrigation will likely be required each growing season to keep the crop yield risks down to practically minimal values the median precipitation during the growing season is approximately 290 mm in the region which suggests a median irrigation level of at least 250 mm or 10 local groundwater production rules typically allow withdrawals of up to 450 mm 18 of water annually in this region hpwd 2019 understanding crop yield risks to guide irrigation decisions has the potential to reduce groundwater production in the region and prolong the useful life of the aquifer 4 2 crop risk assessment using distribution regression dr models distribution regression was carried out using six different candidate distributions 1 exponential 2 gamma 3 gumbel 4 lognormal 5 weibull and 6 box cox cole green bccg the exponential is a single parameter location only distribution and bccg is a three parameter location scale and shape distribution while the others are all two parameter distributions location and scale these distributions are commonly used in risk assessment studies haas 1997 and cover a range of models in terms of their mathematical complexity and required number of model parameters model fitting was carried out for a total of six combinations the shape parameter is often treated as a stationary parameter to avoid computational difficulties reduce the chances of obtaining unrealistic parameter estimates and maintain model parsimony cheng et al 2014 uddameri et al 2019 van ogtrop et al 2011 the candidate distributions were fit by considering the location parameter to be a linear or quadratic nonlinear function of crop water supply cws the scale parameter was assumed to be either stationary linear or nonlinear quadratic function of cws in addition the most parsimonious model with location scale and shape all treated as constants stationary was also constructed model coefficients for all fitted models are provided in supplementary information table a 1 based on the evaluation of the goodness of fit tests and aic the bccg model was noted to be the best among the candidate models and table 2 provides the model fits for the bccg model the truncated bccg distribution is developed by first applying the box cox transformation to the random variable y to create a transformed random variable z which is assumed to follow the normal distribution with the density adjusted to correct for the truncation of y 0 cole and green 1992 rigby and stasinopoulos 2004 mathematically the untransformed bccg can be written as eq 9 and eq 10 9 f y Œº œÉ ŒΩ 1 2 œÄ œÉ y œÖ 1 Œº v e x p z 2 2 where 10 z y Œº ŒΩ 1 ŒΩ œÉ œÖ 0 a n d z log y Œº œÉ i f œÖ 0 the density function is adjusted for truncation to ensure that the probability under the curve is equal to one the inclusion of the scale parameter adds greater flexibility to the bccg model and allows a better fit of the data the heterogeneous models where location and scale were modeled as functions of cws performed better than stationary constant values for model parameters models as measured using aic indicating the crop yield distribution is affected by water supplied to the plants during the growing season the relatively low standard errors of estimation also indicated that the estimated parameters were significant for the bccg model in addition to the aic the goodness of fit of the bccg models were assessed by performing residual analysis the normality of the residuals was assessed by comparing the q q plot presented in fig 4 which indicated that the residuals largely followed normal distributions except perhaps at the tails the detrended q q plot also referred to as the worm plot buuren van and fredriks 2001 presented in the supplementary information fig a 2 also indicated similar behavior for the residuals the first four statistical moments for the standardized model residuals are presented in table 3 for the best fit bccg model as can be seen the mean of the residuals is close to zero and the standard deviation is unity white noise again the skewness is close to zero and the kurtosis close to 3 which are the theoretical values for the normal distribution visual inspection of the residuals did not indicate autocorrelation of residuals or heteroskedasticity which added further confidence to the model fitting process the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc filliben 1975 is greater than 0 995 for all nonstationary bccg model residuals again indicating the nonstationary models are able to model the observed crop yields with a high degree of accuracy in addition the noted high ppcc values also add credence to the estimation of the shape parameter of the bccg model bccg models where the location parameter is modeled using a quadratic cws relationship generally have lower aic values than their linear counterparts see table 3 when the location parameter is modeled as a nonlinear function of cws the relationship used for the scale parameter has little influence both linear and nonlinear models for the scale parameter when the location is considered nonlinear have the same aic values and yielded similar residuals therefore the nonlinear location and linear scale bccg model could be selected as the final model based on parsimony considerations for illustrative purposes the cumulative distribution for crop yield i e crop yield risk functions for all six models are presented here fig 5 once a distribution regression model is developed and identified the cumulative distribution functions for crop yield for various levels of crop water supply cws can be developed fig 5 shows the cdf functions corresponding to various cws values for the six models identified in table 3 the crop yield risk functions in fig 5 indicates the risk of obtaining a yield lower than or equal to a selected value on the x axis this selected value would represent the cut off threshold a farmer may choose to evaluate the higher the threshold the greater the risk the risk is also a function of the cws for a selected crop yield cutoff threshold the risk decreases with increasing cws notice that the risk profiles are plotted at cws values that vary from 300 mm to 800 mm in intervals of 100 mm for smaller values of cws the risk profiles are further apart and they get closer to each other as the cws values increase this result indicates that increasing cws at lower values via irrigation is beneficial but the benefits of irrigation start diminishing at higher levels in other words irrigation is useful to reduce the risks at lower levels of crop water supply but the marginal improvements in risk decrease with increased amount of irrigation the spacing between the risk profiles corresponding to different cws critically depend upon how the scale parameter is being modeled somewhat counter intuitive results i e greater risk reductions at higher levels of irrigation as compared to lower levels of irrigation can arise if a higher degree of nonlinearity is induced in the scale parameter especially in comparison to the location parameter for example see fig 5e this result arises because the scale parameters are small at lower cws but increase nonlinearly at higher values of cws therefore in addition to statistical comparisons the physical basis of the derived risk distributions must also be borne in mind when selecting the right model and interpreting the results the results here indicate that introducing a high degree of nonlinearity in the scale parameter especially without concomitant nonlinearity in the location parameter can lead to physically unrealistic results it is therefore recommended that the parameterization for the scale parameter be as parsimonious as possible nonlinear heterogeneous model should be only used for the scale parameter if it provides a much better fit than a model which assumes a linear scale heterogeneity at lower crop water supplies cws dr models that use a linear model for the location parameter provide a lower level of risk compared to their nonlinear counterparts on the other hand at higher water applications the linear location models estimate a slightly higher level of risk as seen in table 2 the coefficient for the quadratic cws term is always negative at higher cws values this term assumes greater importance and does not cause the location parameter to shift as significantly compared to the linear models where the scale shifts are in proportion to the cws the result of the interplay between the linear and quadratic cws term in the location is the straightening of the risk profiles increases in cws cause smaller changes in crop yield risks similarly adding a higher degree of nonlinearity stationary linear nonlinear in the scale parameter also sharpens the slope of the risk profile especially at higher levels of water application for drought contingency planning realistic yield thresholds and water application rates tend to be on the lower end therefore modeling the location parameter using a nonlinear cws parameter is recommended to obtain conservative values for risk 4 3 bivariate risk assessment modeling using joint probability jp models the nonparametric kernel density estimation kde was used to construct the bivariate joint distribution between crop yield and crop water supply the joint cumulative distribution function joint cdf was directly estimated using gaussian kernels and through minimization of the integrated mean square error mise the gaussian kernel was adopted here because the joint cdf is a smooth function without discontinuities and is known to be suitable for constructing multivariate models otneim and tj√∏stheim 2017 as irrigation levels can vary for a given precipitation the joint distribution between the crop yield and crop water supply can have probability mass oriented away from the coordinate directions unconstrainted optimization of the bandwidth assuming cross diagonal terms is recommended in such cases wand and jones 1994 and as such adopted here also as the cdf is of interest here it was directly estimated using procedures outlined by duong 2007 this approach eliminates the need for numerical integration of the pdf and therefore minimizes errors in computation of the cdf lall et al 1993 the bivariate cdf obtained using the kde were compared against the bivariate gringorten plotting position formula hao and aghakouchak 2014 yue et al 1999 the evaluation metrics summarized in table 4 point to the reasonableness of the kde joint distribution as it has a near zero mean square error a very small bias pbias and kge bias and a high correlation coefficient coefficient of determination r2 and kge correlation the model also performs well when evaluated using overall efficiency metrics such as the nash sutcliff efficiency metric and the kling gupta efficiency measure therefore the joint distribution was deemed sufficient for this illustrative study the joint distribution between crop water supply and crop yield is shown in fig 6 again for a specified cumulative crop yield cutoff the risk decreases with increasing water supply and for a given threshold of water supply the crop yield risk increases with increasing crop yield cutoff values the marginal distribution of the crop water supply is also needed for the crop yield risk conditioned upon a maximum threshold of crop water supply eq 8 the kde approach with gaussian kernels and mean integrated square error mise bandwidth estimate was used to construct the cdf of the crop water supply this kde based cdf was compared to the empirical gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 to evaluate its adequacy the metrics presented in table 4 for marginal cws distribution show the fit to be excellent across a suite of metrics and therefore the kde based cdf was used to define the marginal distribution of crop water supply cws and is depicted in fig 7 the conditional probability distribution of crop yield given a threshold crop water supply is depicted in fig 8 it is again evident from the distribution that for an assumed threshold of crop water supply the crop risk probability value of the cdf increases with higher crop yield thresholds the conditional distribution also helps farmers evaluate the level of crop yield risk for an upper limit of water supply for example if a farmer chooses to supply no more than 600 mm of water through precipitation and irrigation then there is a 97 5 chance that the crop yield is going to be greater than 150 kg ha but there is only a 40 chance that the crop yield will be greater than 1000 kg ha the conditional probability plot is also useful to identify minimum risk associated with a selected threshold regardless of the amount of water supplied for example if a farmer chooses 500 kg ha as the minimum crop yield threshold then there is at least a 15 risk that the yield could be less than that value regardless of the amount of water supplied to the crop the marginal increases in risks due to the curtailment of the water supply can be ascertained from the conditional probability distribution presented in fig 8 the flattening of the probability contours can be seen around 550 mm 600 mm of crop water supply 80 85 of the crop water demand this result implies that for a given risk level probability the crop yield threshold increases rapidly when the crop water applied is below 550 mm 600 mm in other words for a given crop yield threshold the risk decreases fairly rapidly as crop water supply is increased to a value of 550 mm 600 mm however after this threshold the slope of the contour changes more slowly implying that additional water additions only alter the risk marginally a similar cut off was also noted in the risk profiles calculated using logistic regression see fig 3 once again confirming the need for some irrigation to mitigate the risks of lower crop yield but the utility of irrigation diminishes past the 550 mm 600 mm 80 85 of crop water demand threshold indicating the feasibility of deficit irrigation practices 5 summary and conclusions the vulnerability associated with droughts is projected to increase in many arid and semi arid regions such as the southern high plains of texas the increased propensity of this climate hazard coupled with declines in groundwater levels threaten the viability of groundwater reliant irrigated agriculture in these areas when water is constrained farmers must weigh the short term benefit of irrigating their crops against the long term goal of prolonging the availability of their secure water supplies i e groundwater resources decision support tools that provide pertinent information to farmers to weigh the trade offs of irrigation are therefore useful crop yield risk is defined as the probability of obtaining a yield below a pre specified acceptable threshold as water is a major resource constraint for agriculture in arid and semi arid regions the crop yield risk is assumed to be a function of the amount of water supplied to the crop i e crop water supply this water supply typically comes from precipitation and irrigation the primary focus of this study was to develop a comprehensive risk assessment framework to assess crop yield risks its utility is illustrated to study cotton production at a farm in the southern high plains of texas the developed methodology provides a generic interdisciplinary approach that integrates concepts of probability and statistics with field data and crop growth modeling to assess crop yield loss risks in a progressively complex fashion while this generic approach can be adopted to any crop in any region the elements of the proposed methodology i e the lr dr and jp models must be customized to capture constraints on the crop growth for example it might be necessary to add both nutrient and water limitations when extending this framework to corn in a similar vein crop growth models must be recalibrated to specific climate and soil conditions as well as management practices at the site the relationship between crop yield and water supply the critical limiting resource provides the necessary foundation for the proposed risk assessment methods such relationships are developed using calibrated phenological crop growth models with site specific climate soils and management irrigation data logistic regression lr is used to estimate the probability of crop yield risk i e probability of obtaining yields below a pre specified threshold as a function of crop water supply i e irrigation precipitation water both linear and nonlinear models were developed at the illustrative study area with the nonlinear formulations exhibiting better fits the results indicated that some amount of irrigation was necessary to reduce the crop yield risks a threshold crop water supply of about 550 mm 80 of crop water demand was seen to be necessary to reduce risks down to practically negligible levels further additions of water beyond this threshold yielded marginal reductions in risks while the lr approach is pragmatic it requires a minimum acceptable crop yield to be specified a priori the construction of the entire cumulative distribution function cdf of the crop yield allows one to estimate crop yield risks corresponding to various crop water supply or irrigation levels as crop yields critically depend upon the amount of water supplied its cdf is assumed to be non stationary dr approach the model parameters of the theoretical crop yield cdf were modeled as both linear and nonlinear functions of crop water supply for the illustrative case study six different distributions with linear and nonlinear quadratic functions of cws for the location parameter as well as stationary linear and quadratic functions for the scale parameters were fit using the maximum likelihood method and evaluated using goodness of fit and residual analysis the results indicated that the three parameter box cox cole green bccg distribution provided the best fit when the location parameter was modeled as a nonlinear quadratic function of cws scale as a linear function of cws and the shape parameter considered as stationary the study also highlighted that modeling the scale parameter using nonlinear relationships may lead to physically unrealistic results the dr approach is useful to construct the entire cdf of the crop yield as a function of crop water supply cws and evaluate how changes in crop water supply will alter the risks of crop yields being below a specified threshold the lr and dr models assume that the crop water supply cws is known a priori in reality cws depends upon precipitation which is a stochastic variable and may not be known with complete certainty therefore modeling cws as a stochastic variable offers the most realistic approach to assess crop yield risks the kolmogorov axiom was used to compute the conditional probability of crop yields being below a specified threshold for an assumed maximum amount of water supply jp approach the illustrative case study used kernel density estimation kde to construct the joint probability distribution between crop yield and crop water supply and also the marginal distribution of crop water supply the conditional probability distribution is useful to assess the minimum risk regardless of the amount of total water applied associated with obtaining a threshold minimum crop yield in addition the conditional distribution also helps evaluate how increases in crop water yields reduce crop yield risks again a threshold crop water supply around 550 mm 600 mm 80 85 of the crop water demand was noted in the illustrative case study increasing crop water up to this threshold was seen to reduce the crop yield risks significantly but further increases in water supply had a marginal impact on risk reduction the study shows how to estimate crop yield risks under varying levels and assumptions of crop water supply from irrigation and precipitation yield risks directly translate to economic risks and therefore assessment of crop yield risks help farmers understand how their water supply irrigation decisions affect anticipated productivity revenues the proposed framework is useful to help farmers assess deficit irrigation practices using risk metrics the developed methodology is generic and can be used with any crop as long as the relationship between the yield and limiting resources i
