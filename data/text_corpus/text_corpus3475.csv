materials identical to those used for simulated aquifer i e biotic column while inoculum was absent for the other i e abiotic column physicochemical properties of both columns were listed in table s2 supporting information fixed flow rate 1 5 ml min was maintained by the peristaltic pump both columns were all equipped with four sampling ports that located at distances of 5 10 15 and 20 cm from the bottom liquid samples were taken from the effluent and the four sampling ports every 3 pore volume pv i e 6 h to monitor the fluctuation of v v concentration 2 3 analytical methods all aqueous samples

was monitored using a gas chromatograph agilent 4890 j w scientific usa equipped with a flame ionization detector 3 results and discussion 3 1 v v removal performance efficient v v elimination was observed in the constructed aquifer during 150 d operation fig 1 in stage 1 day 0 40 v v was completely removed with initial concentration at 10 mg l and flow rate at 0 125 ml min the corresponding v v removal capacity was 10 g m3 d however v v removal efficiency rapidly decreased to 84 4 1 13 with improved flow rate 0 250 ml min in stage 2 day 41 60 corresponding to the increase of v v removal capacity to 16 9 1 33 g m3 d although initial v v concentration remained at 10 mg l v v removal efficiency and capacity increased to 89 6 1 26 and 45 0 1 14 g m3 d in stage 3 day 61 90 under higher initial v v concentration at 50 mg l with flow rate at 0 125 ml min indicating gradual adaptation of functional microorganisms to v v loading lai et al 2018 shi et al 2020b when co existing no3 was introduced in stage 4 day 91 120 v v removal efficiency and capacity rapidly dropped to 55 6 1 04 and 27 9 1 03 g m3 d the results clearly showed that no3 partly inhibited v v reduction as no3 might be preferentially consumed as electron acceptor with higher no3 n2 redox potential eθ 1 24 v compared to that for vo2 vo2 eθ 0 991 v no3 is a kind of nutrient and microbes prefer to utilize it for metabolism this result was in harmony with that found in other v v and no3 co existing biosystems jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a batch experiment results showed that the inhibition of no3 on v v reduction was more significant with the increase in initial no3 n concentration fig s1 supporting information in stage 5 day 121 150 v v removal efficiency and capacity was recovered to 89 8 1 24 and 44 9 0 98 g m3 d respectively with operating conditions identical to stage 3 which confirmed the robust v v removal performance of proposed mackinawite driven biosystem 3 2 biotic and abiotic contributions v v removal reached complete breakthrough i e c co 1 at 144 pv and 30 pv in biotic and abiotic column respectively fig 2 a approximately 4 7 times longer life span was obtained in biotic column compared with abiotic column fig s2 supporting information the migration rate of the v v front was calculated from fig 2b to be 0 69 0 12 cm pv in biotic column which was much lower than that in abiotic column 2 78 0 04 cm pv lower migration rate with longer longevity was also found in biological fe 0 column for cr vi and nitrobenzene removal compared to abiotic fe 0 column yin et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 chemical v v reduction in abiotic column was easily blocked and ceased by the aged reaction layer grown progressively on the mackinawite surface however new reactive sites might be regenerated in biotic column via microbial activities huang and zhang 2006 van nooten et al 2008 the biotic and abiotic contributions to v v removal were 76 4 1 01 and 23 5 1 25 in biotic column which was derived by taking integral of the breakthrough curves in addition except for the 5 cm port 5 cm vertical distance from the inlet where rapid breakthrough occurred it was observed from the fig 2a that breakthrough time extended from 72 pv to 124 pv in response to changes in column height from 10 cm to 20 cm a similar trend had also been reported that increased height of column facilitated a longer contact time and column longevity for complete phosphate removal rout et al 2017 3 3 bioprocess description the concentration of total dissolved v in the effluent almost equaled to that of v v during the simulated aquifer operation fig s3a supporting information indicating the precipitation of products from v v reduction in fig 3 a the sem image showed the microbial cells in contact with produced precipitates the presence of v in precipitates was confirmed by the eds pattern with corresponding peak fig 3b the microstructure of the precipitates was examined by the xrd pattern fig 4 c and distinctive reflection of vo oh 2 was featured chen et al 2018 suggesting that the v iv component existed in the precipitates and vo oh 2 was the finial products from v v reduction furthermore there were ca2 and po4 3 in the synthetic groundwater which could react with produced v iv to form sincosite cav2 po4 2 oh 4 3h2o ortiz bernad et al 2004 in addition the v 2p high solution xps spectrum of precipitates in fig 3d displayed a characteristic peak at 515 8 ev pointing to v iv zhang et al 2018 which provided further evidence that solid v iv was the major product from v v reduction soluble fe species in the effluent were not detected during operation of simulated aquifer eds pattern showed that elemental fe also existed in the produced precipitates fig 3b xrd analysis suggested the characteristic peaks corresponding to green rust and feo oh fig 3c chmielewská et al 2017 halevy et al 2017 possibly derived from mackinawite oxidation the peak of fe 2p high solution xps spectrum at 711 2 ev was related to fe ii and the other peak at 724 6 ev was assigned to fe iii shen et al 2016 further suggesting the oxidation of fe ii in mackinawite to fe iii in another aspect soluble so4 2 accumulated in the effluent due to the oxidation of s ii in mackinawite meanwhile the element s was also detected in the solid precipitates by eds pattern fig 3b and the peak at 163 2 ev in s 2p high solution xps spectrum was typically attributed to s 0 fig 3e wei et al 1998 s 0 might be the product during incomplete oxidation of s ii in mackinawite lu et al 2020 in fig 3f xrd analysis confirmed that mackinawite was still the main mineralogical phase after reaction besides newly regenerated green rust and feo oh notably green rust and s 0 could also be further utilized as electron donor to drive v v removal wander et al 2007 shi et al 2019 serving to prolong availability of mackinawite for v v removal the solution ph slightly increased in the effluent fig s3b supporting information hardly any no2 and nh4 were accumulated in stage 4 during no3 addition fig s3c supporting information suggesting the complete denitrification the mackinawite dependent v v reduction and denitrification could thereby be described by following reactions 1 9 h v o 4 2 f e s 14 h 2 o f e 3 9 v o o h 2 s o 4 2 19 o h 2 9 n o 3 5 f e s 7 h 2 o 5 f e 3 5 s o 4 2 4 5 n 2 14 o h election balance was evaluated in stage 5 in a typical day 154 2 2 24 μmol v v was removed which would produce 17 1 0 25 μmol so4 2 theoretically according to eq 1 in fact accumulation of 29 4 0 83 μmol so4 2 was observed suggesting the over consumption of mackinawite besides v v reduction electrons released from mackinawite oxidation might sink in microbial growth and metabolism lu et al 2020 3 4 microbial community evolution fig 4a showed the evolution of microbial communities at class level during the experiment betaproteobacteria and clostridia were enriched in all stages with relative abundance in the range of 5 0 15 5 and 6 3 12 1 respectively anaerolineae and alphaproteobacteria gradually increased during the first three stages but rapidly declined to 5 0 and 3 8 when no3 was introduced in stage 4 and recovered through stage 5 suggesting that they might prefer to respire v v than no3 the relative abundance of key genera changed remarkably during operation fig 4b thiobacillus accounted for 1 0 in stage 1 and increased dramatically to 5 2 in stage 2 even though a drop in relative abundance to about 1 5 when the highest v v loading was applied in stage 3 pronounced enrichment was again observed for stage 4 and stage 5 where its relative abundance boosted to 4 3 and 7 9 respectively thiobacillus was a chemoautotrophic genus that could survive by using fes as substrate wen et al 2019 some species of thiobacillus were denitrifiers with ability to oxidize fe ii to fe iii s ii to so4 2 and s 0 for no3 reduction ma et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 thiobacillus could also achieve mo vi and cr vi bioreduction with s 0 as electron donor sugio et al 1988 quiintana et al 2001 therefore thiobacillus was presumably to oxidize mackinawite and reduce v v independently by using v v as alternative electron acceptor this v v reduction coupled to autotrophic fe ii and s ii oxidations by a single genus was unraveled for the first time pseudomonas and spirochaeta were heterotrophic v v reducing genera liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 2019a wang et al 2020a with their abundance in a gradual up trend throughout the experiment besides thiobacillus sulfuricurvum was also able to proceed s ii oxidation autotrophically saia et al 2016 which appeared in most stages and participated in mackinawite oxidation simplicispira 1 8 was reported as a denitrifier dominating in denitrifying reactors where fe 0 and feco3 were fed as electron donors wang et al 2019 si et al 2020 which was enriched in stage 4 and contributed to no3 removal in addition fe iii and sulfate reducing bacteria such as petrimonas and desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium were also detected during operation which might be involved in v v reduction and iron sulfur cycling qian et al 2015 ye et al 2016 sun et al 2018 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 3 5 metabolic pathway interpretation the presence of functional genes for v v reduction and s ii oxidation was further confirmed by qpcr fig 5 a the abundance of nitrate reductase gene napa increased in simulated aquifer compared with that in the inoculum increases of other denitrification genes were insignificant data not shown functions of genes encoding nitrate nitrite reductases in v v bioreduction had been established xu et al 2015 while the predominant nitrate nitrate reductase genes were different based on employed electron donors in heterotrophic biosystems more nitrite reductase gene nirs was harbored for v v reduction zhang et al 2019a by comparison nitrate reductase gene napa predominated in this mackinawite driven autotrophic biosystem to achieve v v reduction which was a new discovery that had been unrevealed previously upregulation of nirs gene in heterotrophic denitrification and prominence of napa gene in autotrophic denitrification had also been reported doan et al 2013 wang et al 2020b the napa gene was highly conserved in chemolithoautotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria vetriani et al 2014 the periplasmic nitrate reductase napa was sensitive to redox reactions which were more intense under autotrophic condition li et al 2012 furthermore less amount of electrons could be donated in autotrophic bioprocess compared with heterotrophic one thereby temporary repression of nitrite reductase occurred because of excessive competition with nitrate reductase for electrons ge et al 2012 the abundance of omcb increased significantly while mtrc exhibited little change both genes were key electron transfer protein closely related to extracellular v v bioreduction and fe ii biooxidation shi et al 2016 indicating the co occurrence of the above two bioprocesses the s ii oxidation gene soxb was not detected in the inoculum while the simulated aquifer harbored soxb gene significantly which promoted s ii oxidation in mackinawite lu et al 2020 sun et al 2020 the nr enzymatic activity was improved dramatically in the constructed aquifer while insignificant increase in nir activity was observed fig 5b these trends were consistent with those obtained for nitrate nitrite reductase genes i e napa and nirs further illustrating that the nitrate reductase regulated by napa gene contributed crucially in autotrophic mackinawite supported v v reducing biosystems cyt c and nadh in aquifer as electron mediators between electron carriers zhang et al 2019a lu et al 2020 were considerably higher than those in inoculum contributing to v v reduction via electron transfer residual vfas were also detected in the constructed aquifer with acetate as the main component fig 5c which were probably derived from the assimilations of autotrophs with energy from mackinawite oxidation zhang et al 2020b these metabolic intermediates could serve as substrate for heterotrophic v v reducers building synergic microbial interactions shi et al 2020a 3 6 mechanisms and implications in conclusion mackinawite based v v bioreduction in aquifer could occur through multiple pathways chemoautotrophic genera e g thiobacillus could oxidize fes coupled to direct v v reduction besides v v could also be reduced through cooperation between autotrophs and heterotrophs in this pathway metabolic intermediates e g vfas were synthesized by autotrophic fe ii oxidizers e g thiobacillus and s ii oxidizing genera e g sulfuricurvum which were utilized by heterotrophic v v reducers e g pseudomonas and spirochaeta for v v detoxification the nitrate reductase regulated by napa gene played a vital role which was confirmed by gene abundance and nr activity v v was reduced to insoluble v iv while mackinawite was oxidized to fe iii and so4 2 a single genus e g thiobacillus performing v v reduction and autotrophic mackinawite oxidation concomitantly is the main scientific finding in this study which has been unrecognized previously the first evidence for nitrate reductase gene napa in autotrophic v v reduction with fe ii and s ii donating electrons is also raised this study provides the insight into biogeochemical processes between v v bioreduction with natural mackinawite biooxidization it also suggests that mackinawite is an efficient and sustainable material for effective remediation of v v contaminated aquifer the widely distributed fe iii reducing bacteria and so4 2 reducing bacteria in aquifer benefit the regeneration of reactive sites of mackinawite to achieve persistent efficacy ma et al 2019 thiobacillus is widely distributed in environmental media such as water mud and soil fjerdingstad 1969 zhai et al 2016 therefore it can be used for in situ bioremediation with high microbiological safety several application routes can be employed to incorporate mackinawite into remediation design such as biological permeable reactive barrier or in situ biostimulation lu et al 2020 shi et al 2020b geochemical and hydrodynamic conditions should be evaluated and optimized during its practical applications lv et al 2020 generated v iv can be re oxidized to v v by oxygen jiang et al 2018 thereby anaerobic condition should be maintained in filed remediation 4 conclusions in our study chemoautotrophic transformation of v v with natural mackinawite as electron donor in the simulated aquifer was explored with following major conclusions the optimized 100 v v removal efficiency occurred at flow rate of 0 125 ml min with the initial concentration of 10 mg l biotic column had operation duration 4 7 times longer than that in abiotic column to reach breakthrough 76 4 1 01 and 23 5 1 25 of v v removals were calculated corresponding to biotic and abiotic contributions respectively dynamics in bacterial community supported both independent and synergistic mechanisms of v v bioreduction by fe ii and s ii donating electron nitrate reductase

microscope sem jeol jax840 hitachi limited japan with energy dispersive x ray eds operated at 20 kv x ray diffraction xrd analysis of the precipitated substances and mackinawite was carried out by cu kα λ 1 5405 as a radiation source operating at 40 kv and 200 ma rigaku d max pc 2500 rigaku japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was performed by a kratos xsam 800 spectrometer uk with a mg kα radiator to analyze the valence of related elements in the precipitated substances 2 4 bioinformatic analysis the inoculum and biomass from each stage were pretreated as previously described liu et al

purified amplifiers were sent to majorbio shanghai china for high throughput sequencing using the illumina miseq sequencing platform information on microbial communities obtained from sequencing data was analyzed by following the previously described pipeline zhang et al 2018 functional genes possibly involved in v v reduction napa s ii oxidation soxb and electron transfer omcb and mtrc were quantified by qpcr detection system abi 7500 applied biosystems usa with primers listed in table s1 supporting information bru et al 2007 meyer et al 2007 pirbadian et al 2014 steidl et al 2016 activities of enzymes including nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir were monitored by commercial kits solarbio beijing china both cytochrome c cyt c on extracellular membrane and intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh for biocatalytic reduction were extracted and quantified as previous description he et al 2021 concentration of residual volatile fatty acids vfas was monitored using a gas chromatograph agilent 4890 j w scientific usa equipped with a flame ionization detector 3 results and discussion 3 1 v v removal performance efficient v v elimination was observed in the constructed aquifer during 150 d operation fig 1 in stage 1 day 0 40 v v was completely removed with initial concentration at 10 mg l and flow rate at 0 125 ml min the corresponding v v removal capacity was 10 g m3 d however v v removal efficiency rapidly decreased to 84 4 1 13 with improved flow rate 0 250 ml min in stage 2 day 41 60 corresponding to the increase of v v removal capacity to 16 9 1 33 g m3 d although initial v v concentration remained at 10 mg l v v removal efficiency and capacity increased to 89 6 1 26 and 45 0 1 14 g m3 d in stage 3 day 61 90 under higher initial v v concentration at 50 mg l with flow rate at 0 125 ml min indicating gradual adaptation of functional microorganisms to v v loading lai et al 2018 shi et al 2020b when co existing no3 was introduced in stage 4 day 91 120 v v removal efficiency and capacity rapidly dropped to 55 6 1 04 and 27 9 1 03 g m3 d the results clearly showed that no3 partly inhibited v v reduction as no3 might be preferentially consumed as electron acceptor with higher no3 n2 redox potential eθ 1 24 v compared to that for vo2 vo2 eθ 0 991 v no3 is a kind of nutrient and microbes prefer to utilize it for metabolism this result was in harmony with that found in other v v and no3 co existing biosystems jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a batch experiment results showed that the inhibition of no3 on v v reduction was more significant with the increase in initial no3 n concentration fig s1 supporting information in stage 5 day 121 150 v v removal efficiency and capacity was recovered to 89 8 1 24 and 44 9 0 98 g m3 d respectively with operating conditions identical to stage 3 which confirmed the robust v v removal performance of proposed mackinawite driven biosystem 3 2 biotic and abiotic contributions v v removal reached complete breakthrough i e c co 1 at 144 pv and 30 pv in biotic and abiotic column respectively fig 2 a approximately 4 7 times longer life span was obtained in biotic column compared with abiotic column fig s2 supporting information the migration rate of the v v front was calculated from fig 2b to be 0 69 0 12 cm pv in biotic column which was much lower than that in abiotic column 2 78 0 04 cm pv lower migration rate with longer longevity was also found in biological fe 0 column for cr vi and nitrobenzene removal compared to abiotic fe 0 column yin et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 chemical v v reduction in abiotic column was easily blocked and ceased by the aged reaction layer grown progressively on the mackinawite surface however new reactive sites might be regenerated in biotic column via microbial activities huang and zhang 2006 van nooten et al 2008 the biotic and abiotic contributions to v v removal were 76 4 1 01 and 23 5 1 25 in biotic column which was derived by taking integral of the breakthrough curves in addition except for the 5 cm port 5 cm vertical distance from the inlet where rapid breakthrough occurred it was observed from the fig 2a that breakthrough time extended from 72 pv to 124 pv in response to changes in column height from 10 cm to 20 cm a similar trend had also been reported that increased height of column facilitated a longer contact time and column longevity for complete phosphate removal rout et al 2017 3 3 bioprocess description the concentration of total dissolved v in the effluent almost equaled to that of v v during the simulated aquifer operation fig s3a supporting information indicating the precipitation of products from v v reduction in fig 3 a the sem image showed the microbial cells in contact with produced precipitates the presence of v in precipitates was confirmed by the eds pattern with corresponding peak fig 3b the microstructure of the precipitates was examined by the xrd pattern fig 4 c and distinctive reflection of vo oh 2 was featured chen et al 2018 suggesting that the v iv component existed in the precipitates and vo oh 2 was the finial products from v v reduction furthermore there were ca2 and po4 3 in the synthetic groundwater which could react with produced v iv to form sincosite cav2 po4 2 oh 4 3h2o ortiz bernad et al 2004 in addition the v 2p high solution xps spectrum of precipitates in fig 3d displayed a characteristic peak at 515 8 ev pointing to v iv zhang et al 2018 which provided further evidence that solid v iv was the major product from v v reduction soluble fe species in the effluent were not detected during operation of simulated aquifer eds pattern showed that elemental fe also existed in the produced precipitates fig 3b xrd analysis suggested the characteristic peaks corresponding to green rust and feo oh fig 3c chmielewská et al 2017 halevy et al 2017 possibly derived from mackinawite oxidation the peak of fe 2p high solution xps spectrum at 711 2 ev was related to fe ii and the other peak at 724 6 ev was assigned to fe iii shen et al 2016 further suggesting the oxidation of fe ii in mackinawite to fe iii in another aspect soluble so4 2 accumulated in the effluent due to the oxidation of s ii in mackinawite meanwhile the element s was also detected in the solid precipitates by eds pattern fig 3b and the peak at 163 2 ev in s 2p high solution xps spectrum was typically attributed to s 0 fig 3e wei et al 1998 s 0 might be the product during incomplete oxidation of s ii in mackinawite lu et al 2020 in fig 3f xrd analysis confirmed that mackinawite was still the main mineralogical phase after reaction besides newly regenerated green rust and feo oh notably green rust and s 0 could also be further utilized as electron donor to drive v v removal wander et al 2007 shi et al 2019 serving to prolong availability of mackinawite for v v removal the solution ph slightly increased in the effluent fig s3b supporting information hardly any no2 and nh4 were accumulated in stage 4 during no3 addition fig s3c supporting information suggesting the complete denitrification the mackinawite dependent v v reduction and denitrification could thereby be described by following reactions 1 9 h v o 4 2 f e s 14 h 2 o f e 3 9 v o o h 2 s o 4 2 19 o h 2 9 n o 3 5 f e s 7 h 2 o 5 f e 3 5 s o 4 2 4 5 n 2 14 o h election balance was evaluated in stage 5 in a typical day 154 2 2 24 μmol v v was removed which would produce 17 1 0 25 μmol so4 2 theoretically according to eq 1 in fact accumulation of 29 4 0 83 μmol so4 2 was observed suggesting the over consumption of mackinawite besides v v reduction electrons released from mackinawite oxidation might sink in microbial growth and metabolism lu et al 2020 3 4 microbial community evolution fig 4a showed the evolution of microbial communities at class level during the experiment betaproteobacteria and clostridia were enriched in all stages with relative abundance in the range of 5 0 15 5 and 6 3 12 1 respectively anaerolineae and alphaproteobacteria gradually increased during the first three stages but rapidly declined to 5 0 and 3 8 when no3 was introduced in stage 4 and recovered through stage 5 suggesting that they might prefer to respire v v than no3 the relative abundance of key genera changed remarkably during operation fig 4b thiobacillus accounted for 1 0 in stage 1 and increased dramatically to 5 2 in stage 2 even though a drop in relative abundance to about 1 5 when the highest v v loading was applied in stage 3 pronounced enrichment was again observed for stage 4 and stage 5 where its relative abundance boosted to 4 3 and 7 9 respectively thiobacillus was a chemoautotrophic genus that could survive by using fes as substrate wen et al 2019 some species of thiobacillus were denitrifiers with ability to oxidize fe ii to fe iii s ii to so4 2 and s 0 for no3 reduction ma et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 thiobacillus could also achieve mo vi and cr vi bioreduction with s 0 as electron donor sugio et al 1988 quiintana et al 2001 therefore thiobacillus was presumably to oxidize mackinawite and reduce v v independently by using v v as alternative electron acceptor this v v reduction coupled to autotrophic fe ii and s ii oxidations by a single genus was unraveled for the first time pseudomonas and spirochaeta were heterotrophic v v reducing genera liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 2019a wang et al 2020a with their abundance in a gradual up trend throughout the experiment besides thiobacillus sulfuricurvum was also able to proceed s ii oxidation autotrophically saia et al 2016 which appeared in most stages and participated in mackinawite oxidation simplicispira 1 8 was reported as a denitrifier dominating in denitrifying reactors where fe 0 and feco3 were fed as electron donors wang et al 2019 si et al 2020 which was enriched in stage 4 and contributed to no3 removal in addition fe iii and sulfate reducing bacteria such as petrimonas and desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium were also detected during operation which might be involved in v v reduction and iron sulfur cycling qian et al 2015 ye et al 2016 sun et al 2018 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 3 5 metabolic pathway interpretation the presence of functional genes for v v reduction and s ii oxidation was further confirmed by qpcr fig 5 a the abundance of nitrate reductase gene napa increased in simulated aquifer compared with that in the inoculum increases of other denitrification genes were insignificant data not shown functions of genes encoding nitrate nitrite reductases in v v bioreduction had been established xu et al 2015 while the predominant nitrate nitrate reductase genes were different based on employed electron donors in heterotrophic biosystems more nitrite reductase gene nirs was harbored for v v reduction zhang et al 2019a by comparison nitrate reductase gene napa predominated in this mackinawite driven autotrophic biosystem to achieve v v reduction which was a new discovery that had been unrevealed previously upregulation of nirs gene in heterotrophic denitrification and prominence of napa gene in autotrophic denitrification had also been reported doan et al 2013 wang et al 2020b the napa gene was highly conserved in chemolithoautotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria vetriani et al 2014 the periplasmic nitrate reductase napa was sensitive to redox reactions which were more intense under autotrophic condition li et al 2012 furthermore less amount of electrons could be donated in autotrophic bioprocess compared with heterotrophic one thereby temporary repression of nitrite reductase occurred because of excessive competition with nitrate reductase for electrons ge et al 2012 the abundance of omcb increased significantly while mtrc exhibited little change both genes were key electron transfer protein closely related to extracellular v v bioreduction and fe ii biooxidation shi et al 2016 indicating the co occurrence of the above two bioprocesses the s ii oxidation gene soxb was not detected in the inoculum while the simulated aquifer harbored soxb gene significantly which promoted s ii oxidation in mackinawite lu et al 2020 sun et al 2020 the nr enzymatic activity was improved dramatically in the constructed aquifer while insignificant increase in nir activity was observed fig 5b these trends were consistent with those obtained for nitrate nitrite reductase genes i e napa and nirs further illustrating that the nitrate reductase regulated by napa gene contributed crucially in autotrophic mackinawite supported v v reducing biosystems cyt c and nadh in aquifer as electron mediators between electron carriers zhang et al 2019a lu et al 2020 were considerably higher than those in inoculum contributing to v v reduction via electron transfer residual vfas were also detected in the constructed aquifer with acetate as the main component fig 5c which were probably derived from the assimilations of autotrophs with energy from mackinawite oxidation zhang et al 2020b these metabolic intermediates could serve as substrate for heterotrophic v v reducers building synergic microbial interactions shi et al 2020a 3 6 mechanisms and implications in conclusion mackinawite based v v bioreduction in aquifer could occur through multiple pathways chemoautotrophic genera e g thiobacillus could oxidize fes coupled to direct v v reduction besides v v could also be reduced through cooperation between autotrophs and heterotrophs in this pathway metabolic intermediates e g vfas were synthesized by autotrophic fe ii oxidizers e g thiobacillus and s ii oxidizing genera e g sulfuricurvum which were utilized by heterotrophic v v reducers e g pseudomonas and spirochaeta for v v detoxification the nitrate reductase regulated by napa gene played a vital role which was confirmed by gene abundance and nr activity v v was reduced to insoluble v iv while mackinawite was oxidized to fe iii and so4 2 a single genus e g thiobacillus performing v v reduction and autotrophic mackinawite oxidation concomitantly is the main scientific finding in this study which has been unrecognized previously the first evidence for nitrate reductase gene napa in autotrophic v v reduction with fe ii and s ii donating electrons is also raised this study provides the insight into biogeochemical processes between v v bioreduction with natural mackinawite biooxidization it also suggests that mackinawite is an efficient and sustainable material for effective remediation of v v contaminated aquifer the widely distributed fe iii reducing bacteria and so4 2 reducing bacteria in aquifer benefit the regeneration of reactive sites of mackinawite to achieve persistent efficacy ma et al 2019 thiobacillus is widely distributed in environmental media such as water mud and soil fjerdingstad 1969 zhai et al 2016 therefore it can be used for in situ bioremediation with high microbiological safety several application routes can be employed to incorporate mackinawite into remediation design such as biological permeable reactive barrier or in situ biostimulation lu et al 2020 shi et al 2020b geochemical and hydrodynamic conditions should be evaluated and optimized during its practical applications lv et al 2020 generated v iv can be re oxidized to v v by oxygen jiang et al 2018 thereby anaerobic condition should be maintained in filed remediation 4 conclusions in our study chemoautotrophic transformation of v v with natural mackinawite as electron donor in the simulated aquifer was explored with following major conclusions the optimized 100 v v removal efficiency occurred at flow rate of 0 125 ml min with the initial concentration of 10 mg l biotic column had operation duration 4 7 times longer than that in abiotic column to reach breakthrough 76 4 1 01 and 23 5 1 25 of v v removals were calculated corresponding to biotic and abiotic contributions respectively dynamics in bacterial community supported both independent and synergistic mechanisms of v v bioreduction by fe ii and s ii donating electron nitrate reductase

exchange biex for the process of continuous dom removal by ion exchange without the need for chemical regeneration that results in brine waste surface water with moderate dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations 4 6 mg l and high sulfate concentrations 80 120 mg l was fed to two regenerated and two non regenerated columns for 12 500 bed volumes 9 months with the goal of investigating the effects of chemical and possibly biological regeneration on long term iex operation chemically regenerated columns achieved between 60 and 80 doc removal for the entirety of the experiment while non regenerated columns achieved steady doc removal of 50 inorganic ion analysis showed that biological activity had minimal impact on doc removal and the main mechanism of removal was secondary iex between sulfate so4 2 and fractions of doc with high affinities for ion exchange fluorescence and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva 254 data showed that fractions of doc with higher suva 254 values terrestrial like fractions were better removed by secondary iex than those with lower suva 254 values aquatic microbial like fractions scanning electron microscopy showed that biofilms on non regenerated resins covered 5 15 of the resin surface and are composed of numerous species of bacteria with varying functions with some protozoa present graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biex biofilm ion exchange doc dom 1 introduction biological activity and ion exchange iex materials have been combined in various manners to achieve long term operation one strategy for combining biological activity and iex materials is biological regeneration of brine wastes for reuse bioregeneration of perchlorate clo4 nitrate no3 and bromate bro3 saturated iex brines has been successful in reactors separate from the iex materials resulting in up to 95 reduced brine use mcadam and judd 2008 van der hoek et al 1988 biological regeneration on the surface of iex materials has been successful using microbial cultures as regenerants for clo4 saturated iex resins sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 and ammonium nh4 saturated zeolites semmens et al 1977 biological regeneration of brine waste and regeneration using microbial cultures in the mobile phase have been successful but require batch treatment or multiple cycles of regeneration resulting in non continuous treatment it is desirable to maintain a continuous treatment process while still minimizing brine waste biological activity is typically suppressed in ion exchangers because it is associated with fouling which increases the required chemical cleaning frequency of downstream processes such as micro ultrafiltration membranes howe and clark 2002 because bacteria carry a slight negative charge they are likely to adsorb to iex materials showing potential for beneficial biological activity on the surface of ion exchangers daniels 1980 this type of continuous bioregeneration has been attempted using algal growth on the surface of nh4 saturated zeolites wang et al 2018 iex resins in particular are suitable for microbial attachment and growth due to their macroporous structures and high surface areas flemming 1987 biofilms have been used on the surface of non regenerated anion exchange resins for the removal of dissolved organic matter dom from surface waters amini et al 2018 schulz et al 2017 barbeau bérubé 2017 winter et al 2018 biex or biological ion exchange is hypothesized to occur when iex resins are not chemically regenerated allowing a biofilm to form that could biologically degrades organic matter that has adsorbed to the resin freeing up more active sites schulz et al 2017 first tested abiotic and biotic anion exchange resins under various regeneration strategies and found that biotic columns saw continuous removal of dom regardless of regeneration strategy winter et al 2018 and amini et al 2018 conducted long term non regenerated iex column tests and concluded that iex columns could be continuously operated in biological mode to achieve up to 60 continuous removal of dom with no brine waste more recent experiments that monitor inorganic ion concentrations have shown that biological activity in non regenerated iex columns has little impact on column operation and that secondary iex with sulfate is the dominant mechanism behind continuous dom removal liu et al 2020 while biex operation for dom removal was successful in the experiments by amini et al 2018 winter et al 2018 and schulz et al 2017 little is known about the mechanism of regeneration in these long term experiments dom is complex and varies widely structurally and functionally based on the origin and age of the material aiken 1985 characterization of dom can be challenging often characterized using specific uv absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm suva 254 fluorescence or size exclusion chromatography but is essential to understanding the process of continuous regeneration on iex materials matilainen et al 2011 dom characterization is not only important for understanding its interactions with iex materials but also for understanding its potential to form disinfection byproducts hua et al 2015 many characteristics of organic matter have been recognized as important factors for its interaction with iex materials including diffusion coefficients charge density and aromaticity bazri and mohseni 2016 boyer et al 2008 fluorescence spectroscopy is another tool that is widely used to characterize dom in fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence intensities are given as a function of excitation and emission wavelengths as three dimensional images that can be interpreted visually ishii and boyer 2012 peaks seen in fluorescence matrices can be aligned with those from

method astm d4012 astm 2015 when atp was measured 250 ml from columns 1 and 2 was combined and 250 ml from columns 3 and 4 was combined resulting in two 500 ml samples that could be used this was done because samples must be fresh for atp measurements and the column flow rates were too slow to generate enough sample in a single workday liquid concentrations of phosphate po4 3 no3 sulfate so4 2 nitrite no2 and chloride cl anions and sodium na nh4 potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 cations were measured using ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 sunnyvale california the anion analysis

analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem sem images were obtained using a jeol 6300 sem samples were prepared for sem using primary fixation 2 buffered glutaraldehyde soak for 2 h secondary fixation 1 buffered osmium tetroxide soak for 2 h rinsing 5 di rinses for 10 min each and dehydration graded ethanol soaks in 20 increments until the sample is immersed in anhydrous ethanol dehydrated samples were then dried using a balzers union cpd 020 critical point dryer and sputter coated with platinum using a technics sputter coater surface area of biofilm coverage was estimated by overlaying sem images of full iex beads with a transparent grid system containing 1228 square grid boxes each box that contained 50 biofilm was marked and the number of marked boxes divided by the total number of boxes was determined as the amount of resin surface covered by biofilm solid media samples taken at depths of 100 and 300 cm were first subjected to sonication to detach biofilm from iex resins the biofilm samples were sent to the ked genomics core at arizona state university for dna extraction library preparation using 16s rrna primers and illumina sequencing 3 results and discussion 3 1 doc removal fig 2 shows percentage doc removal for chemically regenerated columns 1 and 2 and non regenerated columns 3 and 4 iex columns with each condition run in duplicate samples were taken weekly every 340 bv regeneration occurred monthly every 1450 bv for columns 1 and 2 and never occurred for columns 3 and 4 backwashing was conducted monthly on all columns initial doc removal was similar across all columns because they all started with fresh resin the first chemical regeneration occurred on day 31 starting in mid september after 2000 bv 40d the chemically regenerated columns followed a steady state pattern achieving highest doc removal 80 after regeneration and lowest doc removal 70 prior to regeneration similar trends were observed in both chemically regenerated columns the non regenerated columns showed decreasing doc removal over the first 40 d of operation reaching a minimum removal of 42 after 2000 bv doc removal then increased over the next 50 d until reaching approximately steady state removal after 4000 bv 80 d the most striking results in fig 2 is the consistent 50 doc removal achieved by the non regenerated columns from mid october through the end of the study in mid april this removal corresponds to a total mass of about 980 mg doc removed throughout the experiment by assuming a charge density of 11 meq g c based on work by boyer et al 2008 this equates to a total doc removal of 10 8 meq in both biological columns only 42 of the total iex capacity of the column which was approximately 25 meq this indicates that many active sites on the resin are not occupied by doc and could be available active sites it is also possible that these sites are unavailable due to blockage by biofilm growth or higher molecular weight dom fractions or are occupied by competing inorganic ions such as bicarbonate no3 or so4 2 these factors contribute to the reduction of effective iex capacity bazri and mohseni 2016 the results presented here for doc removal are consistent with the approximately 60 removal found in similar long term experiments amini et al 2018 schulz et al 2017 winter et al 2018 doc removal was consistent after 2000 bv similar to the doc removal experiments conducted by winter et al that used real water with a broad range of dom fractions but in contrast to experiments by amini et al that showed gradually decreasing removal over time in experiments that used water with a narrow range of dom fractions amini et al 2018 winter et al 2018 the observed removal trends in experiments with different water sources with varying dom characteristics indicates that dom fractionation likely has an influence on long term doc removal in non regenerated iex columns 3 2 dom characterization doc was characterized in this work using specific uv absorbance suva and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems suva 254 is a measure of a samples uv absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm divided by its doc concentration and describes the nature of dom in water in terms of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity high suva 254 values are associated with hydrophobic aromatic materials while low suva 254 values are associated with hydrophilic materials edzwald and tobiason 1999 matilainen et al 2011 fluorescence eems capture emitted radiation from molecules at various wavelengths which are characteristics of particular molecular conformations called fluorophores and can be used to describe structural compositions of humic substances matilainen et al 2011 the peaks shown in eems are represented by green yellow or red areas in the eem where color corresponds to the intensity of the peak at any given excitation and emission ex em peak locations can then be compared to those from literature to gain insight on the type of doc in each sample fig 3 shows eems for filtered influent water and filtered effluents of each column at 1000 and 12 000 bv days 21 and 245 respectively all data was normalized to 1 based on the highest peak value across all eems it can be seen that early in the experiment 1000 bv all columns removed a majority of the doc and smaller peaks are present in all eems towards the end of the experiment 12 000 bv the regenerated columns continued removing doc as expected and non regenerated columns had larger eem peaks than regenerated columns due to lower removals the large peak seen in fig 3 encompasses areas of two main peaks previously identified in literature a peak at 312 380 420 the red area in the bottom left of the eem in fig 3 a f i and j was identified as marine humic like fluorophore coble 1996 yamashita et al 2013 the second peak encompassed in these eems is one seen at 350 420 480 ex em the green blue expanse towards the top right of the red marks which has been previously identified as terrestrial humic like fluorophore coble 1996 yamashita et al 2013 the peak identified as marine humic like fluorophore is larger suggesting that the influent water in these experiments is more microbially derived than terrestrially derived but both microbial and terrestrial fractions of doc are present because of the overlap in peaks it is difficult to determine which fluorophore is removed more from the eems but it can be observed that both peaks are greatly reduced early in the experiment fig 3b e continue to be greatly removed in regenerated columns later in the experiment fig 3g h and are both partially removed later in the experiment for non regenerated columns fig 3i j this indicates that in non regenerated columns some fractions of marine humic like fluorophore are being removed in addition to terrestrial humic like fluorophore but the resulting doc composition is still mostly marine humic like fluorophore these results align with size exclusion chromatography sec results by winter et al 2018 that showed large humic substance removal in non regenerated iex columns but add useful information on the quantities and types of doc removed in regenerated and non regenerated columns fig 4 shows suva 254 data for all columns throughout the experiment calculated by dividing uv absorbance values at 254 nm by the doc concentration suva values were then normalized based on the influent suva to evaluate how suva was changing over time and include the impacts of changes in inlet water composition due to long term water storage initial suva 254 was 2 1 l mg m suva suva0 values for the regenerated columns fluctuated consistently between 0 9 and 1 2 for the entirety of the experiment indicating little change in the doc composition between influent and effluent suva suvao for non regenerated columns initially increased from 1 1 to 1 8 in the first 2400 bv then decreased to 0 6 at 12 500 bv hence showing a very different trend than the regenerated columns suva is known to be directly proportional to molecular weight and aromatic carbon content of dom and provides a great deal of information about its origin and chemistry chin et al 1994 weishaar et al 2003 higher suva 254 values are associated with terrestrial and higher plant sources while lower suva values are typically associated with microbial sources boyer et al 2008 the relatively low influent suva value indicates that it is likely that a large fraction of the organic matter is of microbial origin and this is verified by eem peaks centered largely around a marine humic acid throughout the experiment the influent suva value decreased slightly indicating some doc conversion in the storage tanks potentially microbial this slight decrease is reflected in the effluent suva values of the regenerated columns the non regenerated column effluent saw even greater decreases in suva as the experiment progressed indicating that doc is either being converted into microbial organic matter in the column or terrestrial doc is more effectively removed by iex than microbial doc leaving higher fractions of microbial doc in the effluent this is supported by the eem data in fig 3 that shows effluent doc compositions dominated by microbial doc although both microbial and terrestrial doc fractions were removed previous work using similar source waters has shown that doc fractions with higher suva values are more readily removed by iex compared to fractions with lower suva values indicating that the suva change in non regenerated columns may be partly due to increased removal of high suva doc fractions humbert et al 2005 there are experiments that show higher removal of lower suva doc fractions croué et al 1999 legube 1999 but these experiments use source waters with much higher initial suva values 2 7 5 0 l mg m than the source water used here 2 1 l mg m although higher removal of high suva fractions likely contributes to the large decreases in suva seen in non regenerated columns it is expected to be a small contributor because the same decrease is not seen in regenerated columns and there are other indicators of microbial activity that could also contribute to this decrease in suva adenosine triphosphate atp is found in all living organisms and can be easily extracted and measured from living cells making it an ideal indicator for biological activity takano et al 1983 fig 5 shows effluent atp concentrations in regenerated and non regenerated columns influent atp concentrations were 122 pg atp ml and regenerated columns stayed around this value throughout the experiment non regenerated columns had much higher effluent atp concentrations nearing 1800 pg ml towards the end of the experiment the large atp concentrations in non regenerated column effluent shows there is significant biological activity in the columns that could be impacting doc removal and decreases in suva 3 3 evaluation of secondary ion exchange secondary iex occurs when primary iex is exhausted and ions mainly doc displace other ions such as so4 2 and no3 to adsorb to the resin the effects of secondary iex were quantified in this work using an ion balance on doc cl no3 and so4 2 po4 3 no2 and br were also measured but were negligible 0 5 mg l bicarbonate was not measured due to 1 its low affinity for iex resins boyer et al 2008 and 2 easy displacement by nom moral et al 2020 making it unlikely that it would accumulate in this system fig 6 plots the ratio of meq removed ions to meq released ions versus time for regenerated 1 and 2 and non regenerated 3 and 4 columns a ratio 1 is indicative of iex a ratio 1 is indicative of adsorption or biological degradation and a ratio 1 is indicative of excess ion releases effluent concentrations of any inorganic ions above their influent concentrations regenerated columns maintained a consistent ratio of 1 for the entirety of the experiment indicating that primary iex was the mechanism of removal as expected non regenerated columns had a ratio of 1 until 2000 bv 40 d after which the value was 1 most frequently between values of 0 2 and 0 6 the ratio less than 1 shown in non regenerated columns indicates that more ions are being released than retained in the column and because inorganic anion analysis shows the released ions are primarily sulfate 98 so4 2 2 cl it can be concluded that the primary mechanism of doc removal in these columns is secondary iex between so4 and doc it is clear that primary iex is exhausted in the non regenerated columns after 2400 bv shown by a sharp decrease in total removal and chloride release with primary iex exhausted it is very unlikely that ions with lower selectivities ions that are more weakly adsorbed to the resin than so4 2 for the resin are retained in the column as they would need to displace ions with higher selectivities ions with higher affinity for the resin than so4 2 while it was expected for the ratio to be 1 due to adsorption or biological activity or 1 due to an equal amount of meq secondary released ions and meq doc removed the ratio is very sensitive to small compounded measurement errors ion chromatography measurements for inorganic ions has an error of 2 and doc measurement by toc has an error of 5 because the values of meq removed and retained are very small in the ion balances on non regenerated columns small changes have large impacts on the final ratio and this has potential to result in the negative values seen in the figure the largest factor is the value of doc charge which is assumed to be 11 in all mass balance calculations based on literature values for similar water types boyer et al 2008 previous experiments have shown that competition between doc and inorganic ions has a significant impact on doc removal particularly sulfate a majority of doc fractions are selective over sulfate and data shows that doc adsorption increases with decreasing sulfate concentrations and fractions of doc that are more selective than sulfate can range from 67 to over 90 boyer et al 2008 tan and kilduff 2007 experiments with iex resins in so4 2 form have also shown high doc removal indicating that sulfate is readily displaced by doc moral et al 2020 to determine the quantity of active sites occupied by each ion a mass balance was conducted on the influent and effluent ion concentrations the results of this mass balance are presented in fig 7 as of active sites occupied versus bed volumes if effluent concentrations were lower than influent concentrations ions were assumed to be retained in active sites while if effluent concentrations were above influent concentrations ions were assumed to be released from active sites ions with concentrations lower than 2 mg l were included in the mass balance but are not depicted in the figure in regenerated columns 1 and 2 the dominating effects of so4 2 are observed as 50 of active sites are rapidly occupied by so4 2 and then replaced by cl during regeneration it can be noted that regeneration efficiency was not 100 and slowly decreased over time in non regenerated columns 3 and 4 active sites are again dominated by so4 2 which occupies almost 80 of active sites after 2500 bv in these columns so4 2 is gradually released from the column and the number of active sites occupied by doc slowly increases to 15 indicating displacement of so4 2 by doc as previously proposed while doc removal in these experiments aligns with removals seen in previous literature by amini and winter a fraction of this removal has previously been speculated to be from biological degradation amini et al 2018 winter et al 2018 the inorganic analysis in this work adds clarity to the mechanism of removal in non regenerated columns by quantifying the impacts of secondary ion exchange the mass balance on regenerated columns added to over 97 in both regenerated columns while the mass balance on non regenerated columns did not always add up to 100 increasing fractions of active sites were unaccounted for in non regenerated columns as the experiment progressed resulting in 20 unaccounted active sites in column 3 and 32 unaccounted active sites in column 4 at the end of the experiment the number of active sites occupied by cl also never reached 0 in non regenerated columns indicating that these active sites may have been blocked by biofilm growth or the initial capacity of the resin was lower than expected column 3 cl data shows little to no continuous release of cl while column 4 showed some release indicating that there is potential for diffusion of cl through the active site blockage liu et al 2020 presented a similar mass balance that showed complete release of cl from the resin at the start of experiment followed by a gradual increase in cl and doc on active sites as so4 2 was displaced although there are many indicators of biological activity in this work including atp measurements and decreasing suva values much of this can be explained by doc selectivity it is likely that microbial and aquatic doc fractions are less selective than terrestrial fractions allowing them to pass through the columns while terrestrial fractions participate in secondary iex with so4 2 or other less selective doc fractions at the time of breakthrough 2500 bv 50 d the columns primary iex capacity 25 6 meq had been exhausted due to high influent sulfate concentrations 40 60 mg l at this point 71 of the active sites were occupied by so4 2 9 3 of active sites were occupied by doc and 3 2 was occupied by other ions such as no3 these results are similar to those obtained in the secondary ion exchange mass balance conducted by liu et al 2020 the remainder of active sites 16 5 was still in chloride form but may have been blocked by biological growth as secondary iex occurred it was most likely to occur between more selective doc fractions terrestrial and so4 2 or less selective doc fractions microbial resulting in an effluent doc composition with lower suva 254 3 4 resin surface morphology resins were examined under a scanning electron microscope sem to assess the impacts of chemical and biological regeneration on surface morphology and active site blockage purolite a860 is a type i macroporous strong base anion exchange resin with an acrylic matrix and quaternary ammonium functional group figs 8 and 9 show sem images at various magnifications for chemically regenerated and non regenerated columns respectively both regenerated and non regenerated resins have similar surface morphologies as small ridges approximately 2 μm wide and 10 μm long cover the surface of both resins regenerated resins show minimal amounts of bacteria present and the bacteria seen at high magnifications are spread apart 10 μm particulates seen on regenerated resins are most often filamentous and 20 μm in length small amounts of bacteria on regenerated resins are likely present due to electrostatic interactions between slightly negatively charged bacteria and the resin daniels 1980 filamentous materials attached to regenerated resin surfaces are likely retained due to friction forces greater than the shear forces from fluid flow although some research has shown that repeated regeneration of iex resins can have impacts on surface morphology walker and boyer 2011 no change was seen in the surface morphology of regenerated and non regenerated resins in this experiment however the surface morphology of iex resins under various regeneration drying and imaging techniques is poorly understood and varies widely between resin types non regenerated resins had very clear biofilm formations covering an estimated 12 36 of the resin surface although the assessment of secondary iex showed that biofilm presence had little effect on doc removal its presence likely has some implications for the blockage of active sites and the limitation of flow to parts of the resin sem imaging revealed that biofilms are not in direct contact of the resin surface but 2 20 μm away from the resin surface range observed in 6 different sem images where this was visible connected by filaments to allow for water flow on the resin side of the biofilm fig 9c although biofilms are known to form channels and keep small spaces between the attachment surface to promote nutrient and substrate flow to cells it is possible that the resin may have shrunk during the osmium tetroxide soaking step and pulled the resin away from the biofilms resulting in the observed effect in fig 9c lewandowski and evans 2000 while multi step pretreatment involving critical point drying is intended to minimize changes in biological samples it has not been confirmed to have no impact on iex resins because the biofilms are not contributing to the removal of organic matter but are hindering flow and diffusion of water to the resin surface it is likely that they are decreasing the effectiveness of the resin although further studies are required to estimate the magnitude of this effect biological samples for dna sequencing were taken from the non regenerated columns at depths of 100 cm and 300 cm fig 10 shows the bacterial orders for each of the samples where any order with 2 relative abundance was lumped into a single category there was a total of 124 total orders identified across all non regenerated columns with unclassified fractions ranging from 10 to 46 the database used for classification included bacteria and archaea and was able to identify many types of bacteria commonly found in water as well as some protozoa although sem images showed organisms that resembled algae the database used for this classification did not include the kingdom plantae and could not verify the presence of algae so future dna sequencing would be necessary to confirm this fig 10 provides valuable information about the bacteria present in non regenerated columns one of the most dominant orders of bacteria present in these columns was burkholderiales which utilize hydrocarbons and various types of organic carbons and have been found to be more abundant in areas with higher concentrations of organic carbon feng et al 2011 tong et al 2015 the presence of burkholderiales shows that bacteria that utilize organic carbon are abundant in non regenerated columns with most of the organic carbon in this system adsorbed to the iex resin it is possible these bacteria are utilizing adsorbed organic matter rhizobiales was another order of bacteria found in these columns these bacteria have been shown to be metabolically versatile in their choice of carbon substrate and can survive under both aerobic and anoxic conditions meng et al 2014 which again indicates the possibility of adsorbed organic matter utilization from the iex resins rhodobacterales are one of the most common primary surface colonizing bacterial groups in temperate coastal marine waters dang et al 2008 and are likely abundant in this system due to their ability to facilitate surface adsorption and colonization two abundant orders of bacteria chloroflexales and chlorobiales have been found to contain chlorophyll and assimilate carbon dioxide using solar energy grouzdev et al 2015 imhoff 1995 their presence and high relative abundance indicates conditions favorable for algal growth so although presence of algae could not be verified by dna sequencing their presence is possible under these conditions allen 1956 another relatively abundant bacterial order is desulfobacterales which are sulfate utilizing bacteria typically found under anoxic conditions they are known to utilize various carbon sources including simple organic acids boschker et al 1998 and their presence indicates that portions of the columns maintained anoxic conditions fig 11 shows the bacterial species for each of the samples where any species with 0 1 relative abundance was lumped into a single category there was a total of 70 species classified across both non regenerated columns with unclassified fractions ranging from 93 to 94 column 3 yielded more species counts than column 4 at both depths 33 more counts on average and the number of bacterial counts increased with depth 20 more counts at 300 cm than at 100 cm depth the difference in counts between columns indicates that in long term experiments bacteria may grow at different rates the difference in counts between samples at different depths could be due to different growth rates under varying aerobic anoxic conditions throughout the column or due to growth inhibition from cell waste products at different depths but additional research is necessary to further investigate these trends one interesting observation that can be seen in fig 11 is the increase of desulfococcus biacutus with increasing depth in the column desulfococcus biacutus is a strictly anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria janssen and schnik 1995 and its increasing presence at depth indicates that dissolved oxygen concentrations decrease with depth in the column fig 11 also shows that species that account for 0 1 relative abundance are much more common earlier in the column and this fraction decreases with depth indicating lower bacterial diversity deep in the column despite increasing bacterial counts this suggests that there may be species of bacteria that survive in the oxic shallow parts of the column but they may not survive deeper in the column where conditions may be more anoxic the most common species of bacteria found in the columns was woodsholea maritima found only to grow with salts present abraham et al 2004 other members of this genus caulobacter are ubiquitous in aquatic and marine ecosystems and are presumed to be responsible for mineralization of dissolved organic material when nutrient concentrations are low abraham et al 2004 staley et al 1987 4 conclusions this work was a comparative evaluation of the impacts of chemical and biological regeneration on the removal of dom by iex regenerated and non regenerated iex columns were operated for over 12 500 bv 9 months and monitored for doc suva 254 atp inorganic ion concentrations and resin morphology the major conclusions of this work are as follows while chemically regenerated columns achieved between 60 and 80 removal of doc for the entirety of the experiment non regenerated columns achieved consistent 50 doc removal even after cl release stopped despite biofilm growth on non regenerated resins and various factors indicating gradual increases in biological activity atp concentrations decreasing suva 254 a balance on inorganic ions attributed the continuous doc removal to secondary iex between adsorbed so4 2 and the fractions of doc with higher affinities for iex resins while this mechanism has been suggested by previous researchers this work presents results that quantify the effects of secondary iex and elaborate on this mechanism with appropriate doc characterization doc composition plays an important role in the continuous doc removal in non regenerated iex columns in the surface water used in this experiment terrestrial fractions of doc had higher affinities for the resin resulting in steadily decreasing effluent suva 254 values in non regenerated columns repeated chemical regeneration and biological growth had little effect on resin bead physical characteristics but biofilms covered 12 36 of resin surfaces in non regenerated columns and speculated to result in decreased fluid flow and diffusion to resin active sites dna sequencing revealed that various orders and species of bacteria that utilize organic matter are present in non regenerated columns indicating a strong possibility for biological organic matter degradation sequencing results also indicate that anoxic conditions were present deeper in the column due to the presence of anoxic bacteria while organisms that resembled algae were observed in sem images algal presence was not verified with dna sequencing but the presence of some phototrophic co2 utilizing bacteria indicates that conditions were favorable for algal

effects of chemical and possibly biological regeneration on long term iex operation chemically regenerated columns achieved between 60 and 80 doc removal for the entirety of the experiment while non regenerated columns achieved steady doc removal of 50 inorganic ion analysis showed that biological activity had minimal impact on doc removal and the main mechanism of removal was secondary iex between sulfate so4 2 and fractions of doc with high affinities for ion exchange fluorescence and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva 254 data showed that fractions of doc with higher suva 254

keywords biex biofilm ion exchange doc dom 1 introduction biological activity and ion exchange iex materials have been combined in various manners to achieve long term operation one strategy for combining biological activity and iex materials is biological regeneration of brine wastes for reuse bioregeneration of perchlorate clo4 nitrate no3 and bromate bro3 saturated iex brines has been successful in reactors separate from the iex materials resulting in up to 95 reduced brine use mcadam and judd 2008 van der hoek et al 1988 biological regeneration on the surface of iex materials has been successful using microbial cultures as regenerants for clo4 saturated iex resins sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 and ammonium nh4 saturated zeolites semmens et al 1977 biological regeneration of brine waste and regeneration using microbial cultures in the mobile phase have been successful but require batch treatment or multiple cycles of regeneration resulting in non continuous treatment it is desirable to maintain a continuous treatment process while still minimizing brine waste biological activity is typically suppressed in ion exchangers because it is associated with fouling which increases the required chemical cleaning frequency of downstream processes such as micro ultrafiltration membranes howe and clark 2002 because bacteria carry a slight negative charge they are likely to adsorb to iex materials showing potential for beneficial biological activity on the surface of ion exchangers daniels 1980 this type of continuous bioregeneration has been attempted using algal growth on the surface of nh4 saturated zeolites wang et al 2018 iex resins in particular are suitable for microbial attachment and growth due to their macroporous structures and high surface areas flemming 1987 biofilms have been used on the surface of non regenerated anion exchange resins for the removal of dissolved organic matter dom from surface waters amini et al 2018 schulz et al 2017 barbeau bérubé 2017 winter et al 2018 biex or biological ion exchange is hypothesized to occur when iex resins are not chemically regenerated allowing a biofilm to form that could biologically degrades organic matter that has adsorbed to the resin freeing up more active sites schulz et al 2017 first tested abiotic and biotic anion exchange resins under various regeneration strategies and found that biotic columns saw continuous removal of dom regardless of regeneration strategy winter et al 2018 and amini et al 2018 conducted long term non regenerated iex column tests and concluded that iex columns could be continuously operated in biological mode to achieve up to 60 continuous removal of dom with no brine waste more recent experiments that monitor inorganic ion concentrations

et al 2020 while biex operation for dom removal was successful in the experiments by amini et al 2018 winter et al 2018 and schulz et al 2017 little is known about the mechanism of regeneration in

characterized using specific uv absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm suva 254 fluorescence or size exclusion chromatography but is essential to understanding the process of continuous regeneration on iex materials matilainen et al 2011 dom characterization is not only important for understanding its interactions with iex materials but also for understanding its potential to form disinfection

a steady state pattern achieving highest doc removal 80 after regeneration and lowest doc removal 70 prior to regeneration similar trends were observed in both chemically regenerated columns the non regenerated columns showed decreasing doc removal over the first 40 d of operation reaching a minimum removal of 42 after 2000 bv doc removal then increased over the next 50 d until reaching approximately steady state removal after 4000 bv 80 d the most striking results in fig 2 is the consistent 50 doc removal achieved by the non regenerated columns from mid october through the end of the study in mid april this removal corresponds to a total mass of about 980 mg doc removed throughout the experiment by assuming a charge density of 11 meq g c based on work by boyer et al 2008 this equates to a total doc removal of 10 8 meq in both biological columns only 42 of the total iex capacity of the column which was approximately 25 meq this indicates that many active sites on the resin are not occupied by doc and could be available active sites it is also possible that these sites are unavailable due to blockage by biofilm growth or higher molecular weight dom fractions or are occupied by competing inorganic ions such as bicarbonate no3 or so4 2 these factors contribute to the reduction of effective iex capacity bazri and mohseni 2016 the results presented here for doc removal are consistent with the approximately 60 removal found in similar long term experiments amini et al 2018 schulz et al 2017 winter et al 2018 doc removal was consistent after 2000 bv similar to the doc removal experiments conducted by winter et al that used real water with a broad range of dom fractions but in contrast to experiments by amini et al that showed gradually decreasing removal over time in experiments that used water with a narrow range of dom fractions amini et al 2018 winter et al 2018 the observed removal trends in experiments with different water sources with varying dom characteristics indicates that dom fractionation likely has an influence on long term doc removal in non regenerated iex columns 3 2 dom characterization doc was characterized in this work using specific uv absorbance suva and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems suva 254 is a measure of a samples uv absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm divided by its doc concentration and describes the nature of dom in water in terms of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity high suva 254 values are associated with hydrophobic aromatic materials while low suva 254 values are associated with hydrophilic materials edzwald and tobiason 1999 matilainen et al 2011 fluorescence eems capture emitted radiation from molecules at various wavelengths which are characteristics of particular molecular conformations called fluorophores and can be used to describe structural compositions of humic substances matilainen et al 2011 the peaks shown in eems are represented by green yellow or red areas in the eem where color corresponds to the intensity of the peak at any given excitation and emission ex em peak locations can then be compared to those from literature to gain insight on the type of doc in each sample fig 3 shows eems for filtered influent water and filtered effluents of each column at 1000 and 12 000 bv days 21 and 245 respectively all data was normalized to 1 based on the highest peak value across all eems it can be seen that early in the experiment 1000 bv all columns removed a majority of the doc and smaller peaks are present in all eems towards the end of the experiment 12 000 bv the regenerated columns continued removing doc as expected and non regenerated columns had larger eem peaks than regenerated columns due to lower removals the large peak seen in fig 3 encompasses areas of two main peaks previously identified in literature a peak at 312 380 420 the red area in the bottom left of the eem in fig 3 a f i and j was identified as marine humic like fluorophore coble 1996 yamashita et al 2013 the second peak encompassed in these eems is one seen at 350 420 480 ex em the green blue expanse towards the top right of the red marks which has been previously identified as terrestrial humic like fluorophore coble 1996 yamashita et al 2013 the peak identified as marine humic like fluorophore is larger suggesting that the influent water in these experiments is more microbially derived than terrestrially derived but both microbial and terrestrial fractions of doc are present because of the overlap in peaks it is difficult to determine which fluorophore is removed more from the eems but it can be observed that both peaks are greatly reduced early in the experiment fig 3b e continue to be greatly removed in regenerated columns later in the experiment fig 3g h and are both partially removed later in the experiment for non regenerated columns fig 3i j this indicates that in non regenerated columns some fractions of marine humic like fluorophore are being removed in addition to terrestrial humic like fluorophore but the resulting doc composition is still mostly marine humic like fluorophore these results align with size exclusion chromatography sec results by winter et al 2018 that showed large humic substance removal in non regenerated iex columns but add useful information on the quantities and types of doc removed in regenerated and non regenerated columns fig 4 shows suva 254 data for all columns throughout the experiment calculated by dividing uv absorbance values at 254 nm by the doc concentration suva values were then normalized based on the influent suva to evaluate how suva was changing over time and include the impacts of changes in inlet water composition due to long term water storage initial suva 254 was 2 1 l mg m suva suva0 values for the regenerated columns fluctuated consistently between 0 9 and 1 2 for the entirety of the experiment indicating little change in the doc composition between influent and effluent suva suvao for non regenerated columns initially increased from 1 1 to 1 8 in the first 2400 bv then decreased to 0 6 at 12 500 bv hence showing a very different trend than the regenerated columns suva is known to be directly proportional to molecular weight and aromatic carbon content of dom and provides a great deal of information about its origin and chemistry chin et al 1994 weishaar et al 2003 higher suva 254 values are associated with terrestrial and higher plant sources while lower suva values are typically associated with microbial sources boyer et al 2008 the relatively low influent suva value indicates that it is likely that a large fraction of the organic matter is of microbial origin and this is verified by eem peaks centered largely around a marine humic acid throughout the experiment the influent suva value decreased slightly indicating some doc conversion in the storage tanks potentially microbial this slight decrease is reflected in the effluent suva values of the regenerated columns the non regenerated column effluent saw even greater decreases in suva as the experiment progressed indicating that doc is either being converted into microbial organic matter in the column or terrestrial doc is more effectively removed by iex than microbial doc leaving higher fractions of microbial doc in the effluent this is supported by the eem data in fig 3 that shows effluent doc compositions dominated by microbial doc although both microbial and terrestrial doc fractions were removed previous work using similar source waters has shown that doc fractions with higher suva values are more readily removed by iex compared to fractions with lower suva values indicating that the suva change in non regenerated columns may be partly due to increased removal of high suva doc fractions humbert et al 2005 there are experiments that show higher removal of lower suva doc fractions croué et al 1999 legube 1999 but these experiments use source waters with much higher initial suva values 2 7 5 0 l mg m than the source water used here 2 1 l mg m although higher removal of high suva fractions likely contributes to the large decreases in suva seen in non regenerated columns it is expected to be a small contributor because the same decrease is not seen in regenerated columns and there are other indicators of microbial activity that could also contribute to this decrease in suva adenosine triphosphate atp is found in all living organisms and can be easily extracted and measured from living cells making it an ideal indicator for biological activity takano et al 1983 fig 5 shows effluent atp concentrations in regenerated and non regenerated columns influent atp concentrations were 122 pg atp ml and regenerated columns stayed around this value throughout the experiment non regenerated columns had much higher effluent atp concentrations nearing 1800 pg ml towards the end of the experiment the large atp concentrations in non regenerated column effluent shows there is significant biological activity in the columns that could be impacting doc removal and decreases in suva 3 3 evaluation of secondary ion exchange secondary iex occurs when primary iex is exhausted and ions mainly doc displace other ions such as so4 2 and no3 to adsorb to the resin the effects of secondary iex were quantified in this work using an ion balance on doc cl no3 and so4 2 po4 3 no2 and br were also measured but were negligible 0 5 mg l bicarbonate was not measured due to 1 its low affinity for iex resins boyer et al 2008 and 2 easy displacement by nom moral et al 2020 making it unlikely that it would accumulate in this system fig 6 plots the ratio of meq removed ions to meq released ions versus time for regenerated 1 and 2 and non regenerated 3 and 4 columns a ratio 1 is indicative of iex a ratio 1 is indicative of adsorption or biological degradation and a ratio 1 is indicative of excess ion releases effluent concentrations of any inorganic ions above their influent concentrations regenerated columns maintained a consistent ratio of 1 for the entirety of the experiment indicating that primary iex was the mechanism of removal as expected non regenerated columns had a ratio of 1 until 2000 bv 40 d after which the value was 1 most frequently between values of 0 2 and 0 6 the ratio less than 1 shown in non regenerated columns indicates that more ions are being released than retained in the column and because inorganic anion analysis shows the released ions are primarily sulfate 98 so4 2 2 cl it can be concluded that the primary mechanism of doc removal in these columns is secondary iex between so4 and doc it is clear that primary iex is exhausted in the non regenerated columns after 2400 bv shown by a sharp decrease in total removal and chloride release with primary iex exhausted it is very unlikely that ions with lower selectivities ions that are more weakly adsorbed to the resin than so4 2 for the resin are retained in the column as they would need to displace ions with higher selectivities ions with higher affinity for the resin than so4 2 while it was expected for the ratio to be 1 due to adsorption or biological activity or 1 due to an equal amount of meq secondary released ions and meq doc removed the ratio is very sensitive to small compounded measurement errors ion chromatography measurements for inorganic ions has an error of 2 and doc measurement by toc has an error of 5 because the values of meq removed and retained are very small in the ion balances on non regenerated columns small changes have large impacts on the final ratio and this has potential to result in the negative values seen in the figure the largest factor is the value of doc charge which is assumed to be 11 in all mass balance calculations based on literature values for similar water types boyer et al 2008 previous experiments have shown that competition between doc and inorganic ions has a significant impact on doc removal particularly sulfate a majority of doc fractions are selective over sulfate and data shows that doc adsorption increases with decreasing sulfate concentrations and fractions of doc that are more selective than sulfate can range from 67 to over 90 boyer et al 2008 tan and kilduff 2007 experiments with iex resins in so4 2 form have also shown high doc removal indicating that sulfate is readily displaced by doc moral et al 2020 to determine the quantity of active sites occupied by each ion a mass balance was conducted on the influent and effluent ion concentrations the results of this mass balance are presented in fig 7 as of active sites occupied versus bed volumes if effluent concentrations were lower than influent concentrations ions were assumed to be retained in active sites while if effluent concentrations were above influent concentrations ions were assumed to be released from active sites ions with concentrations lower than 2 mg l were included in the mass balance but are not depicted in the figure in regenerated columns 1 and 2 the dominating effects of so4 2 are observed as 50 of active sites are rapidly occupied by so4 2 and then replaced by cl during regeneration it can be noted that regeneration efficiency was not 100 and slowly decreased over time in non regenerated columns 3 and 4 active sites are again dominated by so4 2 which occupies almost 80 of active sites after 2500 bv in these columns so4 2 is gradually released from the column and the number of active sites occupied by doc slowly increases to 15 indicating displacement of so4 2 by doc as previously proposed while doc removal in these experiments aligns with removals seen in previous literature by amini and winter a fraction of this removal has previously been speculated to be from biological degradation amini et al 2018 winter et al 2018 the inorganic analysis in this work adds clarity to the mechanism of removal in non regenerated columns by quantifying the impacts of secondary ion exchange the mass balance on regenerated columns added to over 97 in both regenerated columns while the mass balance on non regenerated columns did not always add up to 100 increasing fractions of active sites were unaccounted for in non regenerated columns as the experiment progressed resulting in 20 unaccounted active sites in column 3 and 32 unaccounted active sites in column 4 at the end of the experiment the number of active sites occupied by cl also never reached 0 in non regenerated columns indicating that these active sites may have been blocked by biofilm growth or the initial capacity of the resin was lower than expected column 3 cl data shows little to no continuous release of cl while column 4 showed some release indicating that there is potential for diffusion of cl through the active site blockage liu et al 2020 presented a similar mass balance that showed complete release of cl from the resin at the start of experiment followed by a gradual increase in cl and doc on active sites as so4 2 was displaced although there are many indicators of biological activity in this work including atp measurements and decreasing suva values much of this can be explained by doc selectivity it is likely that microbial and aquatic doc fractions are less selective than terrestrial fractions allowing them to pass through the columns while terrestrial fractions participate in secondary iex with so4 2 or other less selective doc fractions at the time of breakthrough 2500 bv 50 d the columns primary iex capacity 25 6 meq had been exhausted due to high influent sulfate concentrations 40 60 mg l at this point 71 of the active sites were occupied by so4 2 9 3 of active sites were occupied by doc and 3 2 was occupied by other ions such as no3 these results are similar to those obtained in the secondary ion exchange mass balance conducted by liu et al 2020 the remainder of active sites 16 5 was still in chloride form but may have been blocked by biological growth as secondary iex occurred it was most likely to occur between more selective doc fractions terrestrial and so4 2 or less selective doc fractions microbial resulting in an effluent doc composition with lower suva 254 3 4 resin surface morphology resins were examined under a scanning electron microscope sem to assess the impacts of chemical and biological regeneration on surface morphology and active site blockage purolite a860 is a type i macroporous strong base anion exchange resin with an acrylic matrix and quaternary ammonium functional group figs 8 and 9 show sem images at various magnifications for chemically regenerated and non regenerated columns respectively both regenerated and non regenerated resins have similar surface morphologies as small ridges approximately 2 μm wide and 10 μm long cover the surface of both resins regenerated resins show minimal amounts of bacteria present and the bacteria seen at high magnifications are spread apart 10 μm particulates seen on regenerated resins are most often filamentous and 20 μm in length small amounts of bacteria on regenerated resins are likely present due to electrostatic interactions between slightly negatively charged bacteria and the resin daniels 1980 filamentous materials attached to regenerated resin surfaces are likely retained due to friction forces greater than the shear forces from fluid flow although some research has shown that repeated regeneration of iex resins can have impacts on surface morphology walker and boyer 2011 no change was seen in the surface morphology of regenerated and non regenerated resins in this experiment however the surface morphology of iex resins under various regeneration drying and imaging techniques is poorly understood and varies widely between resin types non regenerated resins had very clear biofilm formations covering an estimated 12 36 of the resin surface although the assessment of secondary iex showed that biofilm presence had little effect on doc removal its presence likely has some implications for the blockage of active sites and the limitation of flow to parts of the resin sem imaging revealed that biofilms are not in direct contact of the resin surface but 2 20 μm away from the resin surface range observed in 6 different sem images where this was visible connected by filaments to allow for water flow on the resin side of the biofilm fig 9c although biofilms are known to form channels and keep small spaces between the attachment surface to promote nutrient and substrate flow to cells it is possible that the resin may have shrunk during the osmium tetroxide soaking step and pulled the resin away from the biofilms resulting in the observed effect in fig 9c lewandowski and evans 2000 while multi step pretreatment involving critical point drying is intended to minimize changes in biological samples it has not been confirmed to have no impact on iex resins because the biofilms are not contributing to the removal of organic matter but are hindering flow and diffusion of water to the resin surface it is likely that they are decreasing the effectiveness of the resin although further studies are required to estimate the magnitude of this effect biological samples for dna sequencing were taken from the non regenerated columns at depths of 100 cm and 300 cm fig 10 shows the bacterial orders for each of the samples where any order with 2 relative abundance was lumped into a single category there was a total of 124 total orders identified across all non regenerated columns with unclassified fractions ranging from 10 to 46 the database used for classification included bacteria and archaea and was able to identify many types of bacteria commonly found in water as well as some protozoa although sem images showed organisms that resembled algae the database used for this classification did not include the kingdom plantae and could not verify the presence of algae so future dna sequencing would be necessary to confirm this fig 10 provides valuable information about the bacteria present in non regenerated columns one of the most dominant orders of bacteria present in these columns was burkholderiales which utilize hydrocarbons and various types of organic carbons and have been found to be more abundant in areas with higher concentrations of organic carbon feng et al 2011 tong et al 2015 the presence of burkholderiales shows that bacteria that utilize organic carbon are abundant in non regenerated columns with most of the organic carbon in this system adsorbed to the iex resin it is possible these bacteria are utilizing adsorbed organic matter rhizobiales was another order of bacteria found in these columns these bacteria have been shown to be metabolically versatile in their choice of carbon substrate and can survive under both aerobic and anoxic conditions meng et al 2014 which again indicates the possibility of adsorbed organic matter utilization from the iex resins rhodobacterales are one of the most common primary surface colonizing bacterial groups in temperate coastal marine waters dang et al 2008 and are likely abundant in this system due to their ability to facilitate surface adsorption and colonization two abundant orders of bacteria chloroflexales and chlorobiales have been found to contain chlorophyll and assimilate carbon dioxide using solar energy grouzdev et al 2015 imhoff 1995 their presence and high relative abundance indicates conditions favorable for algal growth so although presence of algae could not be verified by dna sequencing their presence is possible under these conditions allen 1956 another relatively abundant bacterial order is desulfobacterales which are sulfate utilizing bacteria typically found under anoxic conditions they are known to utilize various carbon sources including simple organic acids boschker et al 1998 and their presence indicates that portions of the columns maintained anoxic conditions fig 11 shows the bacterial species for each of the samples where any species with 0 1 relative abundance was lumped into a single category there was a total of 70 species classified across both non regenerated columns with unclassified fractions ranging from 93 to 94 column 3 yielded more species counts than column 4 at both depths 33 more counts on average and the number of bacterial counts increased with depth 20 more counts at 300 cm than at 100 cm depth the difference in counts between columns indicates that in long term experiments bacteria may grow at different rates the difference in counts between samples at different depths could be due to different growth rates under varying aerobic anoxic conditions throughout the column or due to growth inhibition from cell waste products at different depths but additional research is necessary to further investigate these trends one interesting observation that can be seen in fig 11 is the increase of desulfococcus biacutus with increasing depth in the column desulfococcus biacutus is a strictly anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria janssen and schnik 1995 and its increasing presence at depth indicates that dissolved oxygen concentrations decrease with depth in the column fig 11 also shows that species that account for 0 1 relative abundance are much more common earlier in the column and this fraction decreases with depth indicating lower bacterial diversity deep in the column despite increasing bacterial counts this suggests that there may be species of bacteria that survive in the oxic shallow parts of the column but they may not survive deeper in the column where conditions may be more anoxic the most common species of bacteria found in the columns was woodsholea maritima found only to grow with salts present abraham et al 2004 other members of this genus caulobacter are ubiquitous in aquatic and marine ecosystems and are presumed to be responsible for mineralization of dissolved organic material when nutrient concentrations are low abraham et al 2004 staley et al 1987 4 conclusions this work was a comparative evaluation of the impacts of chemical and biological regeneration on the removal of dom by iex regenerated and non regenerated iex columns were operated for over 12 500 bv 9 months and monitored for doc suva 254 atp inorganic ion concentrations and resin morphology the major conclusions of this work are as follows while chemically regenerated columns achieved between 60 and 80 removal of doc for the entirety of the experiment non regenerated columns achieved consistent 50 doc removal even after cl release stopped despite biofilm growth on non regenerated resins and various factors indicating gradual increases in biological activity atp concentrations decreasing suva 254 a balance on inorganic ions attributed the continuous doc removal to secondary iex between adsorbed so4 2 and the fractions of doc with higher affinities for iex resins while this mechanism has been suggested by previous researchers this work presents results that quantify the effects of secondary iex and elaborate on this mechanism with appropriate doc characterization doc composition plays an important role in the continuous doc removal in non regenerated iex columns in the surface water used in this experiment terrestrial fractions of doc had higher affinities for the resin resulting in steadily decreasing effluent suva 254 values in non regenerated columns repeated chemical regeneration and biological growth had little effect on resin bead physical characteristics but biofilms covered 12 36 of resin surfaces in non regenerated columns and speculated to result in decreased fluid flow and diffusion to resin active sites dna sequencing revealed that various orders and species of bacteria that utilize organic matter are present in non regenerated columns indicating a strong possibility for biological organic matter degradation sequencing results also indicate that anoxic conditions were present deeper in the column due to the presence of anoxic bacteria while organisms that resembled algae were observed in sem images algal presence was not verified with dna sequencing but the presence of some phototrophic co2 utilizing bacteria indicates that conditions were favorable for algal

17377,effects of calcium ions and polyaluminum chloride pacl on membrane fouling in coagulation ultrafiltration uf process were investigated in this study filtration tests demonstrated three interesting filtration behaviors 1 high specific filtration resistance sfr of alginate solution with low cacl2 or pacl addition e g 3 51 1015 m kg 1 under the condition of 1 5 mm cacl2 addition 2 unimodal pattern of alginate sfr with pacl or cacl2 addition alone 3 synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr it was found that the foulant morphological changes driven by the thermodynamic mechanisms based on flory huggins lattice theory take the critical roles in these filtration behaviors density functional theory dft calculations showed that initial coordination of ca2 and al3 ions with alginates tended to form tetrahedron geometry and geometry of coordinating three terminal carboxyl groups respectively which facilitated to elongate the alginate chains without clustering the flocs and form more stable gel increasing sfr improving ca2 and al3 dosages triggered transition to other geometries for clustering polymeric network and flocculation reducing sfr due to the higher binding affinity of ca2 over al3 ca2 and al3 sequentially take roles of enlarging polymeric network and clustering the coordination compounds and then facilitate to form large size flocs and reduce sfr causing the synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl additions the proposed thermodynamic mechanisms satisfactorily explained these interesting fouling behaviors allowing to further optimize coagulation uf process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane fouling calcium ion coagulation ultrafiltration process synergistic effects thermodynamic mechanisms 1 introduction owing to permitting to efficiently remove the particles colloids and other pollutants in water bodies ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf process has been extensively applied for surface water treatment fabris et al 2007 chen et al 2011 he et al 2019 however the presence of natural organic matter nom together with other solutes in the surface water will cause membrane fouling problem limiting the promotion and popularization of membrane technology drews 2010 chen et al 2020a long et al 2020 meanwhile the property of small molecular weight leads to easy penetration of nom through uf mf membranes causing public health security problem when water reuse is of interest zhu et al 2005 choi et al 2008 chen et al 2020b it is generally accepted that uf mf process integrated with chemical coagulation provides a sound solution to these two practical problems feng et al 2015 xu et al 2015 teng et al 2020 as a pretreatment prior to membrane filtration coagulation takes roles to absorb nom and cluster foulant flocs and thus simultaneously improve rejection of nom and reduce membrane fouling yu et al 2016 ding et al 2018 modarresi and benjamin 2019 yu et al 2019 up to date coagulation uf mf process has drawn considerable attention in surface water treatment certain ions and organic matters are originally presented in surface water it was reported that tap water typically contains calcium ions at level of 0 5 3 0 mm park et al 2006 meanwhile aluminum and ferric salts are two of most commonly used coagulants and polyaluminum chloride pacl is a typical aluminum coagulant used for uf mf process deng et al 2019 wu et al 2019 it was reported that pacl can remove nom effectively and pacl coagulation uf mf integrated process corresponded to higher removal of organic matter than ferric coagulation uf mf integrated process konieczny et al 2009 some studies have examined effects of calcium or aluminum ions on membrane fouling listiarini et al 2009 chen et al 2011 mahlangu et al 2015 meng et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 for instance zhang et al 2013 found that additions of al3 and ca2 alone can effectively reduce membrane fouling rate and fluxes of pacl uf process were significantly improved in the presence of calcium literature studies have frequently shown that addition of al3 or ca2 can reduce membrane fouling van den brink et al 2009 meng et al 2015 xu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 however it is still unknown whether synergistic effect of al3 and ca2 in coagulation uf mf integrated process exists furthermore previous studies simply attributed the alleviated membrane fouling to flocculation or charge neutralization by addition of al3 or ca2 ohno et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 feng et al 2015 there is obviously lack of more essential membrane fouling mechanisms revealed for their performance the answers to these phenomena issues are not clear and have not been investigated previously this research situation absolutely limits further optimization of coagulation uf mf process this research situation can be mainly attributed to two facts firstly previous studies simply transferred mechanisms of coagulation to coagulation uf mf process dong et al 2012 ma et al 2015 ding et al 2018 yu et al 2019 however integrating uf mf process with coagulation involves interactions among coagulants various foulants in water and membranes which have not been sufficiently took into account the current coagulation and fouling mechanisms secondly various water bodies contain complicated nom in components which makes it difficult to explore the universal fouling mechanisms owing to the similar fouling behaviors of sodium alginate sa to those of nom for example both are macromolecular organic matters and eay to form gel layer during filtration the strategy regarding using sa to simulate nom has been generally considered as a solution to above mentioned difficulty lee and elimelech 2006 van den brink et al 2009 long et al 2020 teng et al 2020 meanwhile it is evident that coagulation uf mf process involves formation of flocs cake layer and gel layer in the process zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2019 integrating the mechanisms underlying filtration of the foulants in different forms with the mechanisms involved into coagulation may provide exact and in depth fouling insights into coagulation uf mf process related with effects of al3 and ca2 addition meanwhile studies motsa et al 2014 motsa et al 2015 have been carried out to investigated the effect solution total ionic strength divalent ion concentration and colloids on membrane fouling in forward osmosis fo process there is a lack of study on synergistic effect exists between al3 and ca2 in coagulation uf mf integrated process therefore the main purpose of this paper is to examine effects of calcium and aluminum ions on membrane fouling and the related fouling mechanisms a series of sa solutions with different amounts of calcium and aluminum additions were prepared and dead end filtration tests were performed experimental characterizations including ftir spectrometer optical observation scanning electron microscope sem and zeta potential were carried out to determine the physicochemical properties of alginate complexes based on the lattice theory of flory huggins the potential mechanisms responsible for these effects were proposed 2 material and methods 2 1 sample preparation chemical pacl was purchased from sigma both cacl2 and sa were supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd in this study 1 0 g sa powder was dissolved in 500 ml deionized water and continuously stirred for 2 h to prepare the alginate solution a cacl2 stock solution was added to the prepared sodium alginate solution and continuously stirred for 12 h to be completely mixed to prepare alginate solution at three ca2 concentration levels 0 mm 1 5 mm and 5 0 mm similarly pacl stock solution with different volume was transferred to volumetric flask and then diluted to 1000 ml and kept stirring for 5 h to prepare sa solutions with different al3 concentration a series of solutions with the composition shown in table 1 were prepared such a setting corresponded to 18 sample solutions table 1 which is enough for an experimental study to get reliable results in the present study all solutions were prepared at room temperature 25 c and stored for no more than 24 h to prevent microorganism growth 2 2 filtration resistance tests a batch filtration test using dead end filtration set up consisting of a nitrogen cylinder ultrafiltration cup 300 ml msc 300 shanghai sinap co ltd china and a digital balance was used to determine specific filtration resistance sfr of alginate solutions because the foulant layer especially gel layer formation is the dominated cause of membrane fouling in this study this study focused on the fouling layer formation filtration behaviors and the underlying thermodynamic mechanisms the contribution of the membrane surface properties and operational conditions is beyond research scope of this study during the filtration process 200 ml alginate solution was firstly added to the ultrafiltration cup and the weight change of the permeate under a constant pressure of 60 kpa was recorded by the digital balance the pvdf flat membrane with about 0 10 μm normalized pore size used in this study was supplied by shanghai sinap co ltd china all the membranes were immersed in deionized water for 24 h before use and then subjected to ultrasonic pretreatment for 30 min followed by pre compaction with a pressure of 60 kpa for 20 min to stabilize the membrane flux the total filtration resistance talari et al 2017 during filtration process can be expressed by darcy s law 1 r t r f r p r m δ p σ j where δp is the transmembrane pressure tmp kpa σ represents the dynamic viscosity of the permeate pa s j is the filtration flux m3 h 1 m 2 rm rp and rf represent membrane resistance pore blockage resistance and foulant layer resistance m 1 respectively sfr of the alginate suspension during filtration can be calculated according to the following formula 2 s f r 2000 k a 2 δ p σ c s a where a is the effective membrane area m2 k represents the time filtration ratio which is numerically equal to the slope of the filtration curve csa represents the concentration of alginate soil kg m 3 it is generally accepted that the blocking filtration model eq 3 and the cake filtration model eq 4 control the filtration process in sequence huisman et al 1997 3 j j 0 exp k p t 4 j 2 j 0 2 1 j 0 2 k c t where j and j 0 are flux and initial filtration flux m3 h 1 m 2 respectively k p and k c represent pore blocking model constant and cake filtration model constant respectively including eq 1 the following equations can be drawn liu et al 2014 5 ln r p ln r m k p t 6 r f 2 r m 2 k f δ p 2 μ 2 t accordingly by exploring the dependence of filtration resistance on filtration time the exact model controlling the filtration process can be supposed in this study filtration of samples with each component concentration level was carried out in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir is mainly used for analysis and identification of the functional groups of samples in this study gel layer which formed on the surface of the membrane after dead end filtration was scraped off the operation process can refer to the literature meng et al 2007 chu et al 2014 the primed gel layer was then placed into a freeze dryer freezone 2 5 labconco usa for 24 h and stored in a desiccator before atr ftir analysis in order to obtain the functional group characteristics the alginate gel sample was measured by a nexus 670 ft ir spectrometer within wavenumber range of 4000 500 cm 1 ftir analysis can refer to the literature li et al 2021 xu et al 2021 the microstructure of the alginate gel at different ion concentrations was observed by sem s 4800 hitachi japan the gel layers formed by the dead end filtration were also freeze dried to prepare samples and stored in a desiccator prior to sem observation in a vacuum atmosphere the samples were sprayed by a gold layer zeta potential is an important indicator to characterizing the stability of colloidal dispersions the zeta potential of each sample was determined by a malvern zetasizer nano zs instrument each sample was measured in triplicate 2 4 dft simulations density functional theory dft method implemented in gaussian 09 software was used for the quantum chemical calculations two computational complexes including one calcium ion two alginate chains and one aluminum three alginate chains were constructed to calculate their interactions at the molecular level geometry optimizations of these two complexes were executed with the hybrid b3lyp functional approximation becke 1988 becke 1993 by setting 6 31g d p basis for all atoms once the optimized geometries were obtained calculations at the b3lyp 6 31 g d p level with improved single point mode were conducted to derive energy at higher precision the related aqueous phase environment was simulated by using solvation model density smd model marenich et al 2009 herein the calculated energy is actually the single point energy corrected for solvation effects 2 5 flory huggins lattice theory flory huggins lattice theory was introduced to explain the fouling behaviors of gel layer in this study this theory is a mathematical method commonly used to describe the thermodynamics of polymer solutions flory 1941 huggins 1942 correlated with aluminum ions and calcium ions nom molecules in solution tend to crosslink each other to form a gel layer which involves thermodynamic process of polymer solution gibbs free energy change δ g m of a gel formation process can be given as follows 7 δ g m δ h m t δ s m r t n 1 ln φ 1 n 2 ln φ 2 χ n 1 φ 2 where r is the general gas constant j k 1 mol 1 t is the absolute temperature k n1 and n2 are the moles of solvent and polymer respectively φ1 and φ2 are the volume fraction of solvent and polymer respectively χ represents the flory huggins interaction parameter reflecting the change in the interaction energy of the polymer when mixed with solvent molecules the change in the mixing chemical potential is given by obtaining the partial derivative of gm 8 δ μ δ g m n 1 t p n 2 r t ln 1 φ 2 1 n 1 φ 2 χ φ 2 2 wherein n is the degree of polymerization which is generally assumed to be infinite for a crosslinked polymer during filtration process this chemical potential change can be offset by applying an additional pressure δp on the gel layer chen et al 2016 corresponding to the equation as follows 9 δ μ m v b δ p where vb is the molar volume of the solvent m3 mol 1 for dilute solutions vb is close to the solution molar volume v m3 mol 1 combining eq 1 eq 8 and eq 9 sfr of a gel layer due to the thermodynamic change is given as 10 s f r r t ln 1 φ 2 1 n 1 φ 2 χ φ 2 2 m g v j μ where mg is the dry weight of a gel layer kg flory huggins lattice theory expressed by eq 10 should be feasible to calculate the sfr of homogeneous layers like gel layer but unfeasible to calculate the sfr of inhomogeneous layers such as cake layer because large size pores may connect it 3 results and discussion 3 1 filtration behaviors associated with different dosages of pacl and cacl2 fig 1 shows the effects of pacl concentration on sfr of the alginate solution at three different calcium ion additions 0 mm 1 5 mm 5 0 mm it can be seen that without cacl2 addition the sfr of alginate shows a slight increase and then gradual decrease trend with the increase in pacl concentration the maximum sfr in this curve is 2 77 1014 m kg 1 at 1 1 mm pacl addition which is 14 8 higher than the initial sfr without pacl and cacl2 additions this indicates that initial addition of pacl to alginate solution increases sfr further addition of pacl gradually decreases sfr to a rather low value similarly without pacl addition the sfr of alginate shows a similar trend initial addition of cacl2 significantly improves the sfr from 2 36 1014 m 1 kg 1 to 3 51 1015 m 1 kg 1 at cacl2 dosage of 1 5 mm which then decreases to a relatively low level of 1 73 1014 m 1 kg 1 at cacl2 dosage of 5 mm it is therefore concluded that the change profile of sfr of alginate with pacl or cacl2 addition alone shows a unimodal pattern it is generally reported that sfr for normal sludge suspension is at level from magnitude of 109 1012 m kg 1 zarragoitia gonzález et al 2008 gao et al 2011 the maximum sfr 3 51 1015 m 1 kg 1 in this study is at least three order of magnitude higher than that of the sludge suspension suggesting that cacl2 addition can cause extremely high sfr when cacl2 addition maintains 1 5 mm sfr of alginate decreases sharply with the gradual increase in pacl addition for pacl addition of 2 2 mm sfr decreases to 1 78 1013 m kg 1 which is only 0 5 and 7 5 of the initial value without pacl addition and the concerned value with same pacl addition and without cacl2 addition similarly when cacl2 addition maintains 5 0 mm sfr of alginate firstly suddenly decreases to 1 05 1013 m kg 1 at pacl addition of 1 1 mm and then stabilizes at level of 1012 m kg 1 these results strongly suggest that cacl2 and pacl concentration have considerable impacts on the filtration behaviors of sa solutions and more importantly there are synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on sfr revealing the synergistic effects also allows to develop efficient strategies for mitigation of membrane fouling in summary the filtration tests demonstrated three interesting phenomena 1 high alginate sfr with certain cacl2 or pacl addition 2 unimodal pattern of alginate sfr with pacl or cacl2 addition alone 3 synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr these filtration behaviors regarding effects of cacl2 and pacl additions have not been comprehensively reported and the underlying causes deserve further exploration membrane fouling causes during filtration process were explored by analyzing dependence of filtration resistance on filtration time of filtration processes for typical cacl2 concentration 1 5 mm 5 0 mm and pacl concentration 1 1 mm 5 6 mm according to eqs 6 and 7 and the results are shown in fig 2 clearly the filtration processes for all the selected ions dosages show two stage profiles the initial filtration stage phase i within 40 s well fits the blocking filtration model r 2 0 9999 fig 2a1 r 2 0 9654 fig 2b1 r 2 0 9647 fig 2c1 and r 2 0 9676 fig 2d1 in contrast it is better for phase ii to fit cake filtration model than blocking filtration model for all the selected ions dosages fig 2a2 a3 fig 2b2 b3 fig 2c2 c3 and fig 2 d2 d3 these filtration phenomena should be reasonable because membrane will be blocked by small particles and then be covered by a cake or gel layer during a normal filtration process it should be noted that phase i only lasts for less than 40 s and contribution of even the maximum filtration resistance during this phase to the one during the whole filtration process is less than 3 indicating that pore blocking takes a marginal role in whole filtration process fig 2 demonstrates the dominate role of cake or gel layer formation in the filtration process therefore exploring the essential mechanisms related with these filtration phenomena affected by cacl2 and pacl additions should focus on cake or gel layer formation accordingly ftir spectrum zeta potential and microstructure of alginate or alginate mixtures were characterized to propose the potential mechanisms 3 2 characteristics of alginate solution with different dosages of pacl and cacl2 3 2 1 ftir spectra analysis fig 3 shows the ftir spectrum of anhydrous alginate mixtures with different pacl and cacl2 dosages for all the samples a broad region of absorption between 3200 and 3650 cm 1 is due to the stretching of oh bond in hydroxyl functional groups chen et al 2019 the two absorption peaks around 1600 cm 1 and 1410 cm 1 represent the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the coo associated with the carboxylate respectively guo et al 2020 the peak at 1030 cm 1 can be attributed to co bond wang et al 2020 it can be observed that the spectra for all the anhydrous alginate mixtures with different dosages of pacl and cacl2 are substantially similar indicating that the functional groups are not changed by pacl and cacl2 additions therefore the three interesting filtration phenomena mentioned above should be caused by other factors 3 2 2 zeta potential fig 4 illustrates change trend of zeta potential of alginate mixtures with different cacl2 and pacl additions basically the original alginate solution without cacl2 and pacl addition has relatively high negative zeta potential value due to abundant carboxyl groups presented on alginate chains initial additions of cacl2 or pacl alone with low dosage 1 5 mm and 1 1 mm respectively slightly increases the negative zeta potential this phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that initial coordination of multivalent cations could bring alginate molecules close to each other and increase the charge density thereafter the negative zeta potential continuously decreases with increase of cacl2 and or pacl dosages this should be due to the charge neutralization by multivalent cations the changes of zeta potential indicate involvement of coordination and charge neutralization during the coagulation and filtration process however the change trend of zeta potential is not consistent with the sfr change trend in fig 1 suggesting that zeta potential change cannot solely interpret the sfr change trend in fig 1 further studies are needed to explore the exact mechanisms responsible for the interesting filtration phenomena 3 2 3 settle ability and morphology analysis fig 5 demonstrates optical images of alginate solutions with different cacl2 and pacl dosages after natural precipitation for 12 h as shown in fig 5a1 the alginate solution without cacl2 and pacl additions is relatively clear and transparent the solution becomes a little bit opaque and seems rather slime for 1 5 mm cacl2 and no pacl addition fig 5b1 indicating gelatination properties of the solution further increase in cacl2 dosage corresponds to flocculation effect as indicated by the significant sedimentation and more transparent supernatant fig 5c1 similar morphological change trend can be observed for the alginate solution with different pacl addition alone fig 5a1 a3 moreover simultaneous additions of cacl2 and pacl strengthen the flocculation effect as compared with that for addition of cacl2 or pacl alone fig 5 these images reflect the morphological changes of alginate mixtures these changes well consist with the sfr changes caused by different cacl2 and or pacl additions in fig 1 suggesting that morphological change of alginate mixtures can provide the critical clue to explore the mechanisms of above interesting filtration phenomena these solutions with different cacl2 and pacl dosages were subjected to dead end filtration to form foulant layers on membrane surface and the optical images of the formed foulant layers are shown in fig 6 the original alginate solution without pacl and cacl2 addition corresponds to a viscous homogeneous and hydrate gel layer fig 6a1 it has been frequently reported that homogeneous and hydrate gel layer would cause extremely high sfr wang and waite 2008a b wu et al 2020 and flory huggins lattice theory has been introduced as the underlying mechanisms zhang et al 2018b teng et al 2019 the relationship between sfr and flory huggins lattice theory has been well described in section 2 4 with addition of 1 5 mm cacl2 alone the hydrate gel layer becomes denser and more compact fig 6b1 corresponding to higher sfr further addition of cacl2 alone to 5 0 mm results into a foulant layer containing larger flocs with more defects fig 6c1 corresponding to reduced sfr for pacl addition alone similar morphological changes of the foulant layer can be recorded fig 6a1 a3 it can be also found that simultaneous additions of cacl2 and pacl corresponds to more significant flocculation effect and tends to form foulant layers containing larger flocs with more defects fig 6 the morphological changes of foulant layers are also consistent with the sfr changes caused by different cacl2 and or pacl additions in fig 1 structure of the dried foulant layer samples was further characterized by sem observation and the images are shown in fig 7 the foulant layer for the original alginate solution without cacl2 and pacl addition is relatively uniform with small size pores fig 7a1 in contrast after addition of 1 1 mm cacl2 alone the foulant layer becomes rather uniform without obvious porous structure fig 7b1 it is normal that such a structure corresponds to rather high sfr continuous increase in cacl2 addition alone to 5 0 mm leads to form a heterogeneous foulant layer with large size pores and structure defects fig 7b1 for pacl addition alone similar structure change trend of foulant layer is also evident fig 7a1 a3 though the significance is lower than that for cacl2 addition alone combining additions of cacl2 and pacl generally correspond to foulant layers with more pores or defects fig 7 suggesting reduced sfr in summary the morphological change trends of alginate solution and foulant layer are rather consistent with the sfr change trend of alginate solutions with different cacl2 and pacl additions and morphological transition from gel to flocculation always corresponds to reduced sfr suggesting that morphological change should be the exact causes of sfr change however more essential mechanism driving the morphological change caused by cacl2 and pacl additions is still an open question 3 3 fouling mechanism of filtration behaviors caused by cacl2 and pacl additions filtration tests presented three interesting filtration behaviors associated with cacl2 and pacl additions 1 high alginate sfr with certain cacl2 or pacl addition 2 unimodal pattern of alginate sfr with pacl or cacl2 addition alone 3 synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr based on a series of characterizations and theoretical derivation the following fouling mechanisms were proposed to explain above three interesting filtration behaviors for the above mentioned filtration behaviors thermodynamic chemical potential change was proposed to drive the morphological change responsible for them the mechanism underlying the extremely high alginate sfr with certain cacl2 or pacl addition is illustrated in fig 8 it is evident that there are viscous homogeneous and hydrate gel layers formed for original alginate solution and alginate solution with 1 5 mm cacl2 or 1 1 mm pacl addition fig 6a1 b1 and a2 according to thermodynamic principles gel formation is a spontaneous process because there is a chemical potential decrease and entropy increase during it basically the chemical potential decrease and entropy increase during the gel formation process can be depicted by flory huggins lattice theory chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a teng et al 2019 as shown in section 2 5 filtration of alginate solution with certain cacl2 addition results into a gel layer formed on membrane surface fig 5a1 b1 a homogeneous gel layer obviously lacks of real physical pores from thermodynamic viewpoint filtration through a gel layer is somewhat of an inverse process of gel formation process because the former drags bound water out from gel system while the later absorbs free water to become bound water in order to sustain the filtration process an extra pressure δp should be exerted to offset the chemical potential gap between the gel system and free water fig 8 a rough simulation of agar gel by using eq 10 showed that most of experimental determined filtration resistance stemmed from the chemical potential gap chen et al 2016 therefore it is evident that chemical potential mechanism is responsible for the high sfr of a gel layer it is general accepted that the more stable the gel layer is the higher the chemical potential gap becomes corresponding to higher extra pressure or filtration resistance chen et al 2016 teng et al 2019 table 2 lists the potential geometrical configurations of calcium cation alginate chain and aluminum cation alginate chain coordination compounds and their calculated relative energies by density functional theory dft calculation at low cacl2 or pacl dosage when ca2 or al3 ions are limited calcium cation alginate chain and aluminum cation alginate chain coordination compounds tend to be in forms of tetrahedron geometry four alginate chain branches stretch at orientations of a tetrahedron fig 8 and geometry of coordinating three terminal carboxyl groups respectively due to they are more energetically stable table 2 these two geometries facilitate to elongate the alginate chains and extend the polymeric network and render the gel layer denser and more compact fig 6b1 leading to the improved sfr when more ca2 or al3 ions dosages were applied coordination would occur in other geometrical configurations or even intramolecular coordination would occur such coordination modes caused clustering rather than extending the polymeric network as a result a morphology transition from gel to flocculation occurs the foulant layer formed by flocs is not a homogeneous system and has many structural defects water can easily go through the defects when filtration corresponding to the reduced sfr as a whole alginate sfr shows a unimodal pattern with increase of pacl or cacl2 addition alone fig 1 therefore the thermodynamic mechanism drives the morphological change of alginate ca2 or al3 coordination compounds and well interprets the above mentioned first two filtration behaviors fig 9 illustrates the schematic diagram of the mechanism responsible for the above mentioned third filtration behavior synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr table 3 lists the parameter values regarding binding ability of ca2 and al3 cations to alginate according to the literature it can be seen that calcium ion has a much higher binding affinity in terms of the product of n and k than that of aluminum this means that calcium ions will preferentially coordinate to alginate molecules when ca2 and al3 cations are simultaneously presented in alginate solution due to that both ca2 and al3 cations are initially limited as compared with number of carboxyl groups in alginate molecules coordination of ca2 with tetrahedron geometry is preferential such a geometry facilitates to elongate alginate chains and enlarge polymeric network size thereafter al3 cations will coordinate to alginate molecules considering the rather low proportion less than 1 50 of terminal carboxyl groups in total number of carboxyl groups in alginate chains and even less residue of terminal carboxyl groups after binding of ca2 in this study coordination of al3 with geometry of coordinating non terminal carboxyl groups is predominated this geometry will cause clustering and flocculation of the coordination compounds to form flocs generally the larger size the flocs are the lower filtration resistance the alginate solution is in summary ca2 and al3 sequentially take roles of enlarging polymeric network and clustering the coordination compounds in this study sfr change trend showed a unimodal pattern with ca2 and al3 additions the first process elongating the alginate chains corresponded to the upward phase while the second process clustering to form flocs corresponded to the downward phase of sfr change trend the two processes together facilitate to form large size flocs reducing sfr therefore the thermodynamic mechanism can also satisfactorily explain the synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr the findings of the synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl also allow to develop efficient strategies for membrane fouling mitigation as all this study reported the synergistic effect between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr it was revealed that alginate geometry change due to different ca2 and al3 ions induced different foulant morphology ca2 and al3 sequentially take roles of enlarging alginate polymeric network and clustering the coordination compounds and then facilitate to form large size flocs and reduce sfr the mechanism responsible for the synergistic effect was well revealed according to dft calculation and affinity data the newly revealed mechanism was rather deep and resonable it is therefore argued that the overall contribution of the study is significant 4 conclusions in this study coagulation ultrafiltration uf process regarding additions of calcium ions and polyaluminum chloride pacl in alginate solutions showed three interesting filtration phenomena 1 high specific filtration resistance sfr of alginate solution with certain cacl2 or pacl addition 2 unimodal pattern of alginate sfr with pacl or cacl2 addition alone 3 synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr it was revealed that high alginate gel sfr was caused by the chemical potential gap depicted by flory huggins lattice theory morphological changes of the related foulants driven by the thermodynamic mechanisms were found to be related with these phenomena coordination with ca2 and al3 ions preferentially forms tetrahedron geometry and geometry of coordinating three terminal carboxyl groups respectively which facilitated to elongate the alginate chains and form more stable gel increasing sfr by density functional theory dft calculations improving ca2 and al3 dosages triggered transition to forming other geometries for clustering polymeric network and flocculation reducing sfr due to the higher binding affinity of ca2 than al3 ca2 and al3 sequentially take roles of enlarging polymeric network and clustering the coordination compounds and therefore facilitate to form large size flocs reducing

unimodal pattern of alginate sfr with pacl or cacl2 addition alone 3 synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr it was found that the foulant morphological changes driven by the thermodynamic mechanisms based on flory huggins lattice theory take the critical roles in these filtration behaviors density functional theory dft calculations showed that initial coordination of ca2 and al3 ions with alginates tended to form tetrahedron geometry and geometry of coordinating three terminal carboxyl groups respectively which facilitated to elongate the alginate chains without clustering the flocs and form more stable gel increasing sfr improving ca2 and al3 dosages triggered transition to other geometries for clustering polymeric network and flocculation reducing sfr due to the higher binding affinity of ca2 over al3 ca2 and al3 sequentially take roles of enlarging polymeric network and clustering the coordination compounds and then facilitate to form large size flocs and reduce sfr causing the synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl additions the proposed thermodynamic mechanisms satisfactorily explained these interesting fouling behaviors allowing to further optimize coagulation uf process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane fouling calcium ion coagulation ultrafiltration process synergistic effects thermodynamic mechanisms 1 introduction owing to permitting to efficiently remove the particles colloids and other pollutants in water bodies ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf process has been extensively applied for surface water treatment fabris et al 2007 chen et al 2011 he et al 2019 however the presence of natural organic matter nom together with other solutes in the surface water will cause membrane fouling problem limiting the promotion and popularization of membrane technology drews 2010 chen et al 2020a long et al 2020 meanwhile the property of small molecular weight leads to easy penetration of nom through uf mf membranes causing public health security problem when water reuse is of interest zhu et al 2005 choi et al 2008 chen et al 2020b it is generally accepted that uf mf process integrated with chemical coagulation provides a sound solution to these two practical problems feng et al 2015 xu et al 2015 teng et al 2020 as a pretreatment prior to membrane filtration coagulation takes roles to absorb nom and cluster foulant flocs and thus simultaneously improve rejection of nom and reduce membrane fouling yu et al 2016 ding et al 2018 modarresi and benjamin 2019 yu et al 2019 up to date coagulation uf mf process has drawn considerable attention in surface water treatment certain ions and organic matters are originally presented in surface water it was reported that tap water typically contains calcium ions at level of 0 5 3 0 mm park et al 2006 meanwhile aluminum and ferric salts are two of most commonly used coagulants and polyaluminum chloride pacl is a typical aluminum coagulant used for uf mf process deng et al 2019 wu et al 2019 it was reported that pacl can remove nom effectively and pacl coagulation uf mf integrated process corresponded to higher removal of organic matter than ferric coagulation uf mf integrated process konieczny et al 2009 some studies have examined effects of calcium or aluminum ions on membrane fouling listiarini et al 2009 chen et al 2011 mahlangu et al 2015 meng et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 for instance zhang et al 2013 found that additions of al3 and ca2 alone can effectively reduce membrane fouling rate and fluxes of pacl uf process were significantly improved in the presence of calcium literature studies have frequently shown that addition of al3 or ca2 can reduce membrane fouling van den brink et al 2009 meng et al 2015 xu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 however it is still unknown whether synergistic effect of al3 and ca2 in coagulation uf mf integrated process exists furthermore previous studies simply attributed the alleviated membrane fouling to flocculation or charge neutralization by addition of al3 or ca2 ohno et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 feng et al 2015 there is obviously lack of more essential membrane fouling mechanisms revealed for their performance the answers to these phenomena issues are not clear and have not been investigated previously this research situation absolutely limits further optimization of coagulation uf mf process this research situation can be mainly attributed to two facts firstly previous studies simply transferred mechanisms of coagulation to coagulation uf mf process dong et al 2012 ma et al 2015 ding et al 2018 yu et al 2019 however integrating uf mf process with coagulation involves interactions among coagulants various foulants in water and membranes which have not been sufficiently took into account the current coagulation and fouling mechanisms secondly various water bodies contain complicated nom in components which makes it difficult to explore the universal fouling mechanisms owing to the similar fouling behaviors of sodium alginate sa to those of nom for example both are macromolecular organic matters and eay to form gel layer during filtration the strategy regarding using sa to simulate nom has been generally considered as a solution to above mentioned difficulty lee and elimelech 2006 van den brink et al 2009 long et al 2020 teng et al 2020 meanwhile it is evident that coagulation uf mf process involves formation of flocs cake layer and gel layer in the process zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2019 integrating the mechanisms underlying filtration of the foulants in different forms with the mechanisms involved into coagulation may provide exact and in depth fouling insights into coagulation uf mf process related with effects of al3 and ca2 addition meanwhile studies motsa et al 2014 motsa et al 2015 have been carried out to investigated the effect solution total ionic strength divalent ion concentration and colloids on membrane fouling in forward osmosis fo process there is a lack of study on synergistic effect exists between al3 and ca2 in coagulation uf mf integrated process therefore the main purpose of this paper is to examine effects of calcium and aluminum ions on membrane fouling and the related fouling mechanisms a series of sa solutions with different amounts of calcium and aluminum additions were prepared and dead end filtration tests were performed experimental characterizations including ftir spectrometer optical observation scanning electron microscope sem and zeta potential were carried out to determine the physicochemical properties of alginate complexes based on the lattice theory of flory huggins the potential mechanisms responsible for these effects were proposed 2 material and methods 2 1 sample preparation chemical pacl was purchased from sigma both cacl2 and sa were supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd in this study 1 0 g sa powder was dissolved in 500 ml deionized water and continuously stirred for 2 h to prepare the alginate solution a cacl2 stock solution was added to the prepared sodium alginate solution and continuously stirred for 12 h to be completely mixed to prepare alginate solution at three ca2 concentration levels 0 mm 1 5 mm and 5 0 mm similarly pacl stock solution with different volume was transferred to volumetric flask and then diluted to 1000 ml and kept stirring for 5 h to prepare sa solutions with different al3 concentration a series of solutions with the composition shown in table 1 were prepared such a setting corresponded to 18 sample solutions table 1 which is enough for an experimental study to get reliable results in the present study all solutions were prepared at room temperature 25 c and stored for no more than 24 h to prevent microorganism growth 2 2 filtration resistance tests a batch filtration test using dead end filtration set up consisting of a nitrogen cylinder ultrafiltration cup 300 ml msc 300 shanghai sinap co ltd china and a digital balance was used to determine specific filtration resistance sfr of alginate solutions because the foulant layer especially gel layer formation is the dominated cause of membrane fouling in this study this study focused on the fouling layer formation filtration behaviors and the underlying thermodynamic mechanisms the contribution of the membrane surface properties and operational conditions is beyond research scope of this study during the filtration process 200 ml alginate solution was firstly added to the ultrafiltration cup and the weight change of the permeate under a constant pressure of 60 kpa was recorded by the digital balance the pvdf flat membrane with about 0 10 μm normalized pore size used in this study was supplied by shanghai sinap co ltd china all the membranes were immersed in deionized water for 24 h before use and then subjected to ultrasonic pretreatment for 30 min followed by pre compaction with a pressure of 60 kpa for 20 min to stabilize the membrane flux the total filtration resistance talari et al 2017 during filtration process can be expressed by darcy s law 1 r t r f r p r m δ p σ j where δp is the transmembrane pressure tmp kpa σ represents the dynamic viscosity of the permeate pa s j is the filtration flux m3 h 1 m 2 rm rp and rf represent membrane resistance pore blockage resistance and foulant layer resistance m 1 respectively sfr of the alginate suspension during filtration can be calculated according to the following formula 2 s f r 2000 k a 2 δ p σ c s a where a is the effective membrane area m2 k represents the time filtration ratio which is numerically equal to the slope of the filtration curve csa represents the concentration of alginate soil kg m 3 it is generally accepted that the blocking filtration model eq 3 and the cake filtration model eq 4 control the filtration process in sequence huisman et al 1997 3 j j 0 exp k p t 4 j 2 j 0 2 1 j 0 2 k c t where j and j 0 are flux and initial filtration flux m3 h 1 m 2 respectively k p and k c represent pore blocking model constant and cake filtration model constant respectively including eq 1 the following equations can be drawn liu et al 2014 5 ln r p ln r m k p t 6 r f 2 r m 2 k f δ p 2 μ 2 t accordingly by exploring the dependence of filtration resistance on filtration time the exact model controlling the filtration process can be supposed in this study filtration of samples with each component concentration level was carried out in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir is mainly used for analysis and identification of the functional groups of samples in this study gel layer which formed on the surface of the membrane after dead end filtration was scraped off the operation process can refer to the literature meng et al 2007 chu et al 2014 the primed gel layer was then placed into a freeze dryer freezone 2 5 labconco usa for 24 h and stored in a desiccator before atr ftir analysis in order to obtain the functional group characteristics the alginate gel sample was measured by a nexus 670 ft ir spectrometer within wavenumber range of 4000 500 cm 1 ftir analysis can refer to the literature li et al 2021 xu et al 2021 the microstructure of the alginate gel at different ion concentrations was observed by sem s 4800 hitachi japan the gel layers formed by the dead end filtration were also freeze dried to prepare samples and stored in a desiccator prior to sem observation in a vacuum atmosphere the samples were sprayed by a gold layer zeta potential is an important indicator to characterizing the stability of colloidal dispersions the zeta potential of each sample was determined by a malvern zetasizer nano zs instrument each sample was measured in triplicate 2 4 dft simulations density functional theory dft method implemented in gaussian 09 software was used for the quantum chemical calculations two computational complexes including one calcium ion two alginate chains and one aluminum three alginate chains were constructed to calculate their interactions at the molecular level geometry optimizations of these two complexes were executed with the hybrid b3lyp functional approximation becke 1988 becke 1993 by setting 6 31g d p basis for all atoms once the optimized geometries were obtained calculations at the b3lyp 6 31 g d p level with improved single point mode were conducted to derive energy at higher precision the related aqueous phase environment was simulated by using solvation model density smd model marenich et al 2009 herein the calculated energy is actually the single point energy corrected for solvation effects 2 5 flory huggins lattice theory flory huggins lattice theory was introduced to explain the fouling behaviors of gel layer in this study this theory is a mathematical method commonly used to describe the thermodynamics of polymer solutions flory 1941 huggins 1942 correlated with aluminum ions and calcium ions nom molecules in solution tend to crosslink each other to form a gel layer which involves thermodynamic process

1 mol 1 t is the absolute temperature k n1 and n2 are the moles of solvent and polymer respectively φ1 and φ2 are the volume fraction of solvent and polymer respectively χ represents the flory huggins interaction parameter reflecting the change in the interaction energy of the polymer when mixed with solvent molecules the change in the mixing chemical potential is given by obtaining the partial derivative of gm 8 δ μ δ g m n 1 t p n 2 r t ln 1 φ 2 1 n 1 φ 2 χ φ 2 2 wherein n is the degree of polymerization which is generally assumed to be infinite for a crosslinked polymer during filtration process this chemical potential change can be offset by applying an additional pressure δp on the gel layer chen et al 2016 corresponding to the equation as follows 9 δ μ m v b δ p where vb is the molar volume of the solvent m3 mol 1 for dilute solutions vb is close to the solution molar volume v m3 mol 1 combining eq 1 eq 8 and eq 9 sfr of a gel layer due to the thermodynamic change is given as 10 s f r r t ln 1 φ 2 1 n 1 φ 2 χ φ 2 2 m g v j μ where mg is the dry weight of a gel layer kg flory huggins lattice theory expressed by eq 10 should be feasible to calculate the sfr of homogeneous layers like gel layer but unfeasible to calculate the sfr of inhomogeneous layers such as cake layer because large size pores may connect it 3 results and discussion 3 1 filtration behaviors associated with different dosages of pacl and cacl2 fig 1 shows the effects of pacl concentration on sfr of the alginate solution at three different calcium ion additions 0 mm 1 5 mm 5 0 mm it can be seen that without cacl2 addition the sfr of alginate shows a slight increase and then gradual decrease trend with the increase in pacl concentration the maximum sfr in this curve is 2 77 1014 m kg 1 at 1 1 mm pacl addition which is 14 8 higher than the initial sfr without pacl and cacl2 additions this indicates that initial addition of pacl to alginate solution increases sfr further addition of pacl gradually decreases sfr to a rather low value similarly without pacl addition the sfr of alginate shows a similar trend initial addition of cacl2 significantly improves the sfr from 2 36 1014 m 1 kg 1 to 3 51 1015 m 1 kg 1 at cacl2 dosage of 1 5 mm which then decreases to a relatively low level of 1 73 1014 m 1 kg 1 at cacl2 dosage of 5 mm it is therefore concluded that the change profile of sfr of alginate with pacl or cacl2 addition alone shows a unimodal pattern it is generally reported that sfr for normal sludge suspension is at level from magnitude of 109 1012 m kg 1 zarragoitia gonzález et al 2008 gao et al 2011 the maximum sfr 3 51 1015 m 1 kg 1 in this study is at least three order of magnitude higher than that of the sludge suspension suggesting that cacl2 addition can cause extremely high sfr when cacl2 addition maintains 1 5 mm sfr of alginate decreases sharply with the gradual increase in pacl addition for pacl addition of 2 2 mm sfr decreases to 1 78 1013 m kg 1 which is only 0 5 and 7 5 of the initial value without pacl addition and the concerned value with same pacl addition and without cacl2 addition similarly when cacl2 addition maintains 5 0 mm sfr of alginate firstly suddenly decreases to 1 05 1013 m kg 1 at pacl addition of 1 1 mm and then stabilizes at level of 1012 m kg 1 these results strongly suggest that cacl2 and pacl concentration have considerable impacts on the filtration behaviors of sa solutions and more importantly there are synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on sfr revealing the synergistic effects also allows to develop efficient strategies for mitigation of membrane fouling in summary the filtration tests demonstrated three interesting phenomena 1 high alginate sfr with certain cacl2 or pacl addition 2 unimodal pattern of alginate sfr with pacl or cacl2 addition alone 3 synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr these filtration behaviors regarding effects of cacl2 and pacl additions have not been comprehensively reported and the underlying causes deserve further exploration membrane fouling causes during filtration process were explored by analyzing dependence of filtration resistance on filtration time of filtration processes for typical cacl2 concentration 1 5 mm 5 0 mm and pacl concentration 1 1 mm 5 6 mm according to eqs 6 and 7 and the results are shown in fig 2 clearly the filtration processes for all the selected ions dosages show two stage profiles the initial filtration stage phase i within 40 s well fits the blocking filtration model r 2 0 9999 fig 2a1 r 2 0 9654 fig 2b1 r 2 0 9647 fig 2c1 and r 2 0 9676 fig 2d1 in contrast it is better for phase ii to fit cake filtration model than blocking filtration model for all the selected ions dosages fig 2a2 a3 fig 2b2 b3 fig 2c2 c3 and fig 2 d2 d3 these filtration phenomena should be reasonable because membrane will be blocked by small particles and then be covered by a cake or gel layer during a normal filtration process it should be noted that phase i only lasts for less than 40 s and contribution of even the maximum filtration resistance during this phase to the one during the whole filtration process is less than 3 indicating that pore blocking takes a marginal role in whole filtration process fig 2 demonstrates the dominate role of cake or gel layer formation in the filtration process therefore exploring the essential mechanisms related with these filtration phenomena affected by cacl2 and pacl additions should focus on cake or gel layer formation accordingly ftir spectrum zeta potential and microstructure of alginate or alginate mixtures were characterized to propose the potential mechanisms 3 2 characteristics of alginate solution with different dosages of pacl and cacl2 3 2 1 ftir spectra analysis fig 3 shows the ftir spectrum of anhydrous alginate mixtures with different pacl and cacl2 dosages for all the samples a broad region of absorption between 3200 and 3650 cm 1 is due to the stretching of oh bond in hydroxyl functional groups chen et al 2019 the two absorption peaks around 1600 cm 1 and 1410 cm 1 represent the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the coo associated with the carboxylate respectively guo et al 2020 the peak at 1030 cm 1 can be attributed to co bond wang et al 2020 it can be observed that the spectra for all the anhydrous alginate mixtures with different dosages of pacl and cacl2 are substantially similar indicating that the functional groups are not changed by pacl and cacl2 additions therefore the three interesting filtration phenomena mentioned above should be caused by other factors 3 2 2 zeta potential fig 4 illustrates change trend of zeta potential of alginate mixtures with different cacl2 and pacl additions basically the original alginate solution without cacl2 and pacl addition has relatively high negative zeta potential value due to abundant carboxyl groups presented on alginate chains initial additions of cacl2 or pacl alone with low dosage 1 5 mm and 1 1 mm respectively slightly increases the negative zeta potential this phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that initial coordination of multivalent cations could bring alginate molecules close to each other and increase the charge density thereafter the negative zeta potential continuously decreases with increase of cacl2 and or pacl dosages this should be due to the charge neutralization by multivalent cations the changes of zeta potential indicate involvement of coordination and charge neutralization during the coagulation and filtration process however the change trend of zeta potential is not consistent with the sfr change trend in fig 1 suggesting that zeta potential change cannot solely interpret the sfr change trend in fig 1 further studies are needed to explore the exact mechanisms responsible for the interesting filtration phenomena 3 2 3 settle ability and morphology analysis fig 5 demonstrates optical images of alginate solutions with different cacl2 and pacl dosages after natural precipitation for 12 h as shown in fig 5a1 the alginate solution without cacl2 and pacl additions is relatively clear and transparent the solution becomes a little bit opaque and seems rather slime for 1 5 mm cacl2 and no pacl addition fig 5b1 indicating gelatination properties of the solution further increase in cacl2 dosage corresponds to flocculation effect as indicated by the significant sedimentation and more transparent supernatant fig 5c1 similar morphological change trend can be observed for the alginate solution with different pacl addition alone fig 5a1 a3 moreover simultaneous additions of cacl2 and pacl strengthen the flocculation effect as compared with that for addition of cacl2 or pacl alone fig 5 these images reflect the morphological changes of alginate mixtures these changes well consist with the sfr changes caused by different cacl2 and or pacl additions in fig 1 suggesting that morphological change of alginate mixtures can provide the critical clue to explore the mechanisms of above interesting filtration phenomena these solutions with different cacl2 and pacl dosages were subjected to dead end filtration to form foulant layers on membrane surface and the optical images of the formed foulant layers are shown in fig 6 the original alginate solution without pacl and cacl2 addition corresponds to a viscous homogeneous and hydrate gel layer fig 6a1 it has been frequently reported that homogeneous and hydrate gel layer would cause extremely high sfr wang and waite 2008a b wu et al 2020 and flory huggins lattice theory has been introduced as the underlying mechanisms zhang et al 2018b teng et al 2019 the relationship between sfr and flory huggins lattice theory has been well described in section 2 4 with addition of 1 5 mm cacl2 alone the hydrate gel layer becomes denser and more compact fig 6b1 corresponding to higher sfr further addition of cacl2 alone to 5 0 mm results into a foulant layer containing larger flocs with more defects fig 6c1 corresponding to reduced sfr for pacl addition alone similar morphological changes of the foulant layer can be recorded fig 6a1 a3 it can be also found that simultaneous additions of cacl2 and pacl corresponds to more significant flocculation effect and tends to form foulant layers containing larger flocs with more defects fig 6 the morphological changes of foulant layers are also consistent with the sfr changes caused by different cacl2 and or pacl additions in fig 1 structure of the dried foulant layer samples was further characterized by sem observation and the images are shown in fig 7 the foulant layer for the original alginate solution without cacl2 and pacl addition is relatively uniform with small size pores fig 7a1 in contrast after addition of 1 1 mm cacl2 alone the foulant layer becomes rather uniform without obvious porous structure fig 7b1 it is normal that such a structure corresponds to rather high sfr continuous increase in cacl2 addition alone to 5 0 mm leads to form a heterogeneous foulant layer with large size pores and structure defects fig 7b1 for pacl addition alone similar structure change trend of foulant layer is also evident fig 7a1 a3 though the significance is lower than that for cacl2 addition alone combining additions of cacl2 and pacl generally correspond to foulant layers with more pores or defects fig 7 suggesting reduced sfr in summary the morphological change trends of alginate solution and foulant layer are rather consistent with the sfr change trend of alginate solutions with different cacl2 and pacl additions and morphological transition from gel to flocculation always corresponds to reduced sfr suggesting that morphological change should be the exact causes of sfr change however more essential mechanism driving the morphological change caused by cacl2 and pacl additions is still an open question 3 3 fouling mechanism of filtration behaviors caused by cacl2 and pacl additions filtration tests presented three interesting filtration behaviors associated with cacl2 and pacl additions 1 high alginate sfr with certain cacl2 or pacl addition 2 unimodal pattern of alginate sfr with pacl or cacl2 addition alone 3 synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr based on a series of characterizations and theoretical derivation the following fouling mechanisms were proposed to explain above three interesting filtration behaviors for the above mentioned filtration behaviors thermodynamic chemical potential change was proposed to drive the morphological change responsible for them the mechanism underlying the extremely high alginate sfr with certain cacl2 or pacl addition is illustrated in fig 8 it is evident that there are viscous homogeneous and hydrate gel layers formed for original alginate solution and alginate solution with 1 5 mm cacl2 or 1 1 mm pacl addition fig 6a1 b1 and a2 according to thermodynamic principles gel formation is a spontaneous process because there is a chemical potential decrease and entropy increase during it basically the chemical potential decrease and entropy increase during the gel formation process can be depicted by flory huggins lattice theory chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a teng et al 2019 as shown in section 2 5 filtration of alginate solution with certain cacl2 addition results into a gel layer formed on membrane surface fig 5a1 b1 a homogeneous gel layer obviously lacks of real physical pores from thermodynamic viewpoint filtration through a gel layer is somewhat of an inverse process of gel formation process because the former drags bound water out from gel system while the later absorbs free water to become bound water in order to sustain the filtration process an extra pressure δp should be exerted to offset the chemical potential gap between the gel system and free water fig 8 a rough simulation of agar gel by using eq 10 showed that most of experimental determined filtration resistance stemmed from the chemical potential gap chen et al 2016 therefore it is evident that chemical potential mechanism is responsible for the high sfr of a gel layer it is general accepted that the more stable the gel layer is the higher the chemical potential gap becomes corresponding to higher extra pressure or filtration resistance chen et al 2016 teng et al 2019 table 2 lists the potential geometrical configurations of calcium cation alginate chain and aluminum cation alginate chain coordination compounds and their calculated relative energies by density functional theory dft calculation at low cacl2 or pacl dosage when ca2 or al3 ions are limited calcium cation alginate chain and aluminum cation alginate chain coordination compounds tend to be in forms of tetrahedron geometry four alginate chain branches stretch at orientations of a tetrahedron fig 8 and geometry of coordinating three terminal carboxyl groups respectively due to they are more energetically stable table 2 these two geometries facilitate to elongate the alginate chains and extend the polymeric network and render the gel layer denser and more compact fig 6b1 leading to the improved sfr when more ca2 or al3 ions dosages were applied coordination would occur in other geometrical configurations or even intramolecular coordination would occur such coordination modes caused clustering rather than extending the polymeric network as a result a morphology transition from gel to flocculation occurs the foulant layer formed by flocs is not a homogeneous system and has many structural defects water can easily go through the defects when filtration corresponding to the reduced sfr as a whole alginate sfr shows a unimodal pattern with increase of pacl or cacl2 addition alone fig 1 therefore the thermodynamic mechanism drives the morphological change of alginate ca2 or al3 coordination compounds and well interprets the above mentioned first two filtration behaviors fig 9 illustrates the schematic diagram of the mechanism responsible for the above mentioned third filtration behavior synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr table 3 lists the parameter values regarding binding ability of ca2 and al3 cations to alginate according to the literature it can be seen that calcium ion has a much higher binding affinity in terms of the product of n and k than that of aluminum this means that calcium ions will preferentially coordinate to alginate molecules when ca2 and al3 cations are simultaneously presented in alginate solution due to that both ca2 and al3 cations are initially limited as compared with number of carboxyl groups in alginate molecules coordination of ca2 with tetrahedron geometry is preferential such a geometry facilitates to elongate alginate chains and enlarge polymeric network size thereafter al3 cations will coordinate to alginate molecules considering the rather low proportion less than 1 50 of terminal carboxyl groups in total number of carboxyl groups in alginate chains and even less residue of terminal carboxyl groups after binding of ca2 in this study coordination of al3 with geometry of coordinating non terminal carboxyl groups is predominated this geometry will cause clustering and flocculation of the coordination compounds to form flocs generally the larger size the flocs are the lower filtration resistance the alginate solution is in summary ca2 and al3 sequentially take roles of enlarging polymeric network and clustering the coordination compounds in this study sfr change trend showed a unimodal pattern with ca2 and al3 additions the first process elongating the alginate chains corresponded to the upward phase while the second process clustering to form flocs corresponded to the downward phase of sfr change trend the two processes together facilitate to form large size flocs reducing sfr therefore the thermodynamic mechanism can also satisfactorily explain the synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr the findings of the synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl also allow to develop efficient strategies for membrane fouling mitigation as all this study reported the synergistic effect between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr it was revealed that alginate geometry change due to different ca2 and al3 ions induced different foulant morphology ca2 and al3 sequentially take roles of enlarging alginate polymeric network and clustering the coordination compounds and then facilitate to form large size flocs and reduce sfr the mechanism responsible for the synergistic effect was well revealed according to dft calculation and affinity data the newly revealed mechanism was rather deep and resonable it is therefore argued that the overall contribution of the study is significant 4 conclusions in this study coagulation ultrafiltration uf process regarding additions of calcium ions and polyaluminum chloride pacl in alginate solutions showed three interesting filtration phenomena 1 high specific filtration resistance sfr of alginate solution with certain cacl2 or pacl addition 2 unimodal pattern of alginate sfr with pacl or cacl2 addition alone 3 synergistic effects between cacl2 and pacl on alginate sfr it was revealed that high alginate gel sfr was caused by the chemical potential gap depicted by flory huggins lattice theory morphological changes of the related foulants driven by the thermodynamic mechanisms were found to be related with these phenomena coordination with ca2 and al3 ions preferentially forms tetrahedron geometry and geometry of coordinating three terminal carboxyl groups respectively which facilitated to elongate the alginate chains and form more stable gel increasing sfr by density functional theory dft calculations improving ca2 and al3 dosages triggered transition to forming other geometries for clustering polymeric network and flocculation reducing sfr due to the higher binding affinity of ca2 than al3 ca2 and al3 sequentially take roles of enlarging polymeric network and clustering the coordination compounds and therefore facilitate to form large size flocs reducing sfr the newly proposed thermodynamic mechanisms satisfactorily explained these interesting fouling phenomena allowing to further optimize coagulation uf process declaration of competing interest the

primarily composed of o1 14 n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 had a higher average molecular weight mw and double bond equivalent dbe relative to dom after incubation regardless of disinfects and cu2 this result suggests assigned features with larger mw and more double bonds rings as preferable dbp precursors we observed a larger number of disappeared assigned features with low dbe of 1 10 in control without cu2 addition possibly explaining lower dom chlorine reactivity in forming carbonaceous and oxygenated dbps relative to the treatments with cu2 addition we found a larger number of o1 14 and n1o1 14 with dbe 5 16 in the treatments potentially explaining higher dom chloramine reactivity in forming n nitrosodimethylamine ndma compared to the control our study suggests removing oxygen and nitrogen

and phosphorus in the downstream waters will be elevated through the exports of sediments and dissolved organic matter dom from the burned area bladon et al 2014 smith et al 2011 excessive nutrient inputs plus the increased water temperatures after the wildfires increase the eutrophication risks and cause the algae growth in downstream waters bladon et al 2014 odhiambo and routh 2016 for example klose et al 2015 reported the increased algae biomass up to 5 times for chlorophyll a and 20 times for macroalgal mass after the fire and subsequent floods at the basins with burned riparian vegetation relative to unburned basins on the other hand since source water from forested land is generally of high quality and requires inexpensive treatments before consumption more than half of the water supply in the contiguous us originates on forested lands brown et al 2008 murphy et al 2015 the dom in the source waters will form carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps in water facilities via the reaction with oxidants disinfectants the amount of formed dbps depends not only on dom content but also on dom composition tsai and chow 2016 found the increased chlorine reactivity of fire derived dom in dbp formation after the postfire algal blooms though both of wildfire ash derived dom and algae produced organic matter aom are known as dbp precursors tsai et al 2017 wang et al 2015b zhou et al 2014 the postfire algae growing alters the properties of dom derived from wildfire ashes along with their reactivity in dbp formation tsai and chow 2016 cultivated freshwater green algae of pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and blue green algae of microcystis aeruginosa using the mixture of cultural medium and water extracts of burned pine pinus palustris ash at 50 250 and 400 they found that the optical properties of suva254 an indicator for dom aromaticity and humification index hix increased at 50 and 250 but decreased at 400 moreover the chlorine reactivities in forming trihalomethanes thms haloacetonitriles hans chloral hydrate chd and haloketones htks generally increased after algae growing until now the copper based algaecides such as copper sulfate cuso4 have been extensively applied for controlling the algae bloom in drinking water sources hoko and makado 2011 mcknight et al 1983 resulting in the further alternation of the dom quantity and quality and thus the dbp formation tsai et al 2019 recently drinking water facilities increasingly use chloramination to replace chlorination for reducing the regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as thms and haloacetic acids haas this replacement potentially increases the formation of nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which have more significant health risks compared with current regulated dbps bond et al 2011b zhu et al 2015 therefore characterizing the post fire algae bloom and cuso4 algaecide influence on dom quality at the molecular levels is particularly important for identifying the potential c and n dbp precursors which provides information for stakeholders to take the appropriate strategies for ensuring the post fire drinking water safety in the past years high

liu and kujawinski 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular characteristics on dom before versus after incubation the numbers of assigned features increased after the 4 d incubation and these increases depend on both cu2 concentrations and wildfire ash types during incubation there were 935 2033 assigned features disappeared 2597 4191 assigned features produced and 5557 6302 assigned features persistent resulting in a total 107 138 of the initial numbers before incubation fig 1 and table s2 after incubation with we the numbers of assigned features decreased with increasing cu2 concentrations and this tendency was not observed in the be incubation our previous study tsai et al 2019 reported that doc concentrations increased after incubation and increments reduced with increasing cu2 concentrations while algal populations decreased when treated with cu2 regardless of wildfire ash types changes in the pools of assigned features by incubation potentially affected dom reactivity in forming dbps we observed higher dom chlorine reactivity in forming haas in control than the initial for both be and we tsai et al 2019 hua et al 2017 reported higher reactivity in forming haas than thms for both extra and intra cellular aom and higher reactivity for intra than extra cellular aom in forming both haas and thms from a green alga chlorella sp they attributed it to the primary component of aromatic and aliphatic compounds with high hydroxyl and amide contents in intra cellular aom and humic and fulvic like compounds with high carboxylic contents in extra cellular aom in general the carboxylic group as an electron receiving ligand is unfavorable for dbp formation relative to aliphatic if bond to electron donating ligands such as hydroxyl amine and sulfide groups aromatic and keto functional groups hua et al 2017 we observed the new assigned features during incubation considered as aom and the molecular characteristics of produced aom depended on wildfire ash types there were 2597 4191 new assigned features produced considered aom accounting for a large percentage of 34 2 55 2 in the initial numbers before incubation relative to dom before incubation the produced aom had higher average carbon number mw dbe dbe o and dbe o lower average oxygen number and o c and similar dbe c this result suggests that aom had higher degrees of unsaturation π bonds and rings even excluding all the possible c o bonds higher numbers of c o bonds keto carbon and a similar number of c c double bonds roth et al 2013 molecules with lower h c or higher dbe likely highly aromatic compounds and o c ratios are more reactive toward chlorine harris et al 2015 zhang et al 2012a lavonen et al 2013 found cl containing compounds after disinfection had greatly lower h c dbe c and o c ratios relative to cl containing compounds before disinfection wang et al 2017 reported the significant correlation of molecules with high o c ratio and low h c ratio with the formation potentials of thms and haas during chlorination the wildfire ash type affected the molecular characteristics of incubation produced aom the be incubated aom contained lower average values of carbon and oxygen numbers mw and h c but higher average values of o c more hydrophobic n c nosc dbe c dbe o and aimod compared to we incubated aom table s3 this result suggests that the be incubated aom contained more unsaturated oxidized nitrogen containing and aromatic and less reduced compounds with lower mw schmidt et al 2017 wen et al 2018 compared to the we incubated dom tsai et al 2019 found more promotive effect of cu2 addition on dbp formation in the be incubated dom they attributed it to the presence of more carboxylic groups partially confirmed by higher o c and aimod and lower h c in our study among dom before and after incubation we observed the same shapes and centers but different numbers of assigned features at peaks in the distribution of properties including mw o c h c nosc dbe and aimod fig 2 the peaks were found in 300 400 m z for mw 0 3 0 4 for o c 1 3 1 5 for h c 1 0 for nosc 8 12 for dbe and 0 2 0 4 for aimod respectively indicating the dominance of less oxidized highly unsaturated reduced and less aromatic molecules wang et al 2020 the number of assigned features at the distribution peaks increased after incubation and these increases depended on the cu2 concentrations and wildfire ash types specifically the number of assigned features at peaks did not vary greatly among different cu2 concentrations after incubated by be indicating no influence of cu2 concentrations however after incubated by we the treatments of 0 and 0 5 mg cu l had similar peak numbers higher than these treated with 1 0 mg cu l this result suggests that the increased tendency in the number of assigned features was neutralized to a certain extent when treated with 1 0 mg cu l using aimod and h c the assigned features were divided into four groups with the order of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds 42 3 47 4 group 3 aliphatic compounds 23 5 29 6 group 4 combustion derived condensed polycyclic aromatics 13 0 17 6 group 1 vascular plant derived polyphenols 12 5 15 8 group 2 figure s1 this result suggests the dominance of highly unsaturated phenolic and aliphatic compounds in dom before and after incubation and the phenolic and aliphatic dbp precursors could an important fraction of dbp precursors wang et al 2016 interestingly in group 1 there was a larger number percentage of assigned features with n atoms 8 49 15 6 relative to these without n atom 2 67 5 68 table s4 the heteroatom and biochemical classes of dom were not changed greatly after incubation and differences were observed between be and we related dom the heteroatom classes were dominated by cho and chon with 41 1 41 2 43 5 and 35 4 36 9 38 9 in be and 46 9 47 4 53 8 and 26 3 25 7 28 5 in we before after incubation figures s1 s2 this result indicates that be related dom had less cho but more chon formulas than these in we related dom both of which were not significantly influenced by both incubation and cu2 concentrations don represented by chon in our study favors the formation of n dpbs lee et al 2007 specifically be related dom had a larger number of black nitrogen assigned features aimod 0 67 and n 0 than we related dom table s4 no hydrocarbons ch were identified possibly due to their low water solubilities chen et al 2018 and the negative modes we used in ft icr ms he et al 2018 hemmler et al 2018 the major biochemical class was phytochemical oxygenated aromatic compounds phyoxyaroms followed with liquids phyoxyaroms were contributed by oxy condensed aromatic compounds in ash from incomplete combustion of biomass and polyphenolic compounds in algae s living system rivas ubach et al 2018 compounds in phyoxyaroms could be active dbp precursors due to the possible presence of aromatic and oxygen containing e g hydroxyl functional groups lavonen et al 2013 algae s lipid content depends on the nitrogen limitations and trophic conditions bono et al 2013 feng et al 2011 shen et al 2015 higher lipid content in we incubated samples could be because of the lower chon percentage in we other biochemical classes were minor classes such as amino sugars of 1 01 1 43 as one of the important dbp precursors leenheer 2004 and protein of 3 88 9 24 as the precursors of n dbps due to the presence of nitrogen in protein 3 2 disappeared assigned features after disinfections both disinfectants effectively removed assigned features from dom after incubation with 5 906 9 041 and 3 080 6 015 assigned features disappeared by chlorine and chloramine table s2 respectively the disappeared assigned features during disinfections were considered potential dbp precursors in our study this result indicates that a higher number of assigned features acted as the potential dbp precursors when using chlorine compared to chloramine this result possibly explained the traditional view that chlorine produces more c dbps and oxygenated dbps o dbps compared to chloramine chuang et al 2013 the average nosc negative by chlorine was higher than these negative by chloramine table s3 indicating that potential dbp precursors by chloramine were more reduced the nocs was negatively related to the gibbs energy of the oxidation half reaction of organic compounds δ g c o x o kj mol e and removing an electron from an organic compound with lower nosc was less thermodynamically favorable larowe and van cappellen 2011 boye et al 2017 further suggested that organic compounds with nosc 0 6 provided insufficient energy for microbial growth and were thermodynamically preserved in anaerobic soils sediments under the standard conditions 1 atm and 25 chlorine e h o 1 36 v had a higher half reaction potential than monochloramine basic condition e h o 0 75 v copeland and lytle 2014 however free chlorine hocl formed through the monochloramine hydrolysis had a higher half reaction potential of e h o 1 49 v copeland and lytle 2014 and likely provided a more important contribution to dbp formation relative to a direct halogenation of dom by monochloramine zhang et al 2020 compared to assigned features after incubation the disappeared assigned features had similar dominated heteroatom and biochemical classes figure s3 but higher average values of carbon number oxygen number mw and dbe table s3 suggesting compounds with high mw and more double bonds rings as preferable dbp precursors the increases in dbe are correlated to the increase in not only aromaticity i e additional aromatic rings increase by 3 dbe but also double bonds i e c o and c c jarvis et al 2018 niu et al 2018 found a strong correlation between weight averaged dbe and suva254 and suggested dbe as the indicator of the unsaturation or aromaticity degree hua et al 2015 suggested the hydrophobic dom with high mw 500 m z and more aromatic structures as primary dbp precursors however aimod as a traditional indicator of aromaticity in ft icr ms data in disappeared assigned features was not higher than that in assigned features after incubation gonsior et al 2019 found no evidence for aromatic dbp precursors from known metabolites of microcystis aeruginosa with regular culture medium these results indicate a high fraction of dbp precursors in our study with potentially unsaturated and aliphatic structures and a relatively less important role of the aromatic structure during disinfection studies gonsior et al 2014 li and mitch 2018 found that products with high o c ratio and dbe were generated through targeting polyphenolic structures during chlorination zhang et al 2012b revealed the prevalent presence of unknown chlorinated products with a possible abundance of the carboxylic and phenolic functional groups in drinking water the influence of cu2 on dbp formations is due to the complexation of cu2 with dom acidic and aromatic functional groups such as carboxylic phenolic and aminopolycarboxylate moistures liu et al 2007 tsai et al 2019 compared to the control the treatments of either 0 5 or 1 0 mg cu l had less disappeared assigned features using chlorine 0 65 0 82 but more disappeared assigned features using chloramine 1 11 1 76 indicating the distinct roles of cu2 during chlorination and chloramination table s2 specifically relative to the control without cu2 addition the numbers of unique disappeared assigned features in the treatments with cu2 addition were slightly higher using chlorine 1 07 1 10 but greatly higher using chloramine 4 51 5 56 fig 3 this result suggests that more compounds acted as potential chloramine dbp precursors after the addition of cu2 which could partially explain higher dom chloramine reactivity in forming ndma in the treatments compared to the control tsai et al 2019 the distributions of mw o c h c nosc dbe and aimod for disappeared assigned features had the same shape among the control and two treatments figure s4 generally the peaks were found in 300 400 m z for mw 0 3 0 4 for o c 1 3 1 5 for h c 1 0 for nosc 8 12 for dbe and 0 2 0 4 for aimod respectively compared to the control the number of assigned features at peaks decreased by chlorine but increased by chloramine in the treatments moreover related to 0 5 mg cu l these numbers of assigned features under 1 0 mg cu l were similar when using be but slightly lower when using we in addition two studies attributed the generation of hydroxyl radical in the presence of cu2 to the catalytic effect of cu2 on dbp formation however this mechanism still requires further researches fu et al 2009 liu et al 2012 while fu et al 2009 reported a positive effect of cu2 on the thms formation during chlorination and monochloramination liu et al 2012 found the presence of cu2 inhibited thms formation and promoted haas formation during chlorination 3 3 o1 14 n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 in disappeared assigned features the most abundant species in disappeared assigned features after adding disinfectants were oxygen containing compounds of o1 14 species cho1 14 36 7 53 5 followed by oxygen and nitrogen containing compounds of n1o1 14 cho1 14n1 12 0 23 0 and n2o1 14 cho1 14n2 5 26 12 7 figs 4 s3 s5 the cho1 14 class may include carboxylic acids hydroxybenzoic acids and phenols which are the active precursors for thms chang et al 2006 the cho1 14n1 2 classes were possibly composed of amino acids containing amine nh2 and carboxyl cooh groups and phenolic amine containing amine nh2 and phenol c6h5oh groups which are considered as the important precursors of both c i e chloroform and n dbps i e dichloroacetonitrile bond et al 2014 chu et al 2012 the assigned features in the cho1 14n1 and cho1 14n2 classes formed two crescent regions in the n c versus mw plots figure s6 and the assigned features on the righter side of each horizontal dots could more saturated and have a larger number of oxygen containing e g hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups li et al 2019 the number percentages of disappeared o1 14 n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 features followed a good tendency of increasing and then decreasing with oxygen number figure s5 and their average oxygen numbers had the order of o1 14 7 30 8 50 n1o1 14 7 21 8 19 n2o1 14 5 61 7 26 table s5 this result suggests the rich of carbonyl carboxyl groups in these three species especially the o1 14 species besides we observed the increase of nosc dbe and aimod with the order of o1 14 n1o1 14 n2o1 14 figure s7 the nosc values were negative for the o1 14 species but positive for the n2o1 14 species indicating more reduced compounds in the ox species but more oxidized compounds in the n2ox species the average dbe values were in an order of 8 42 9 32 o1 14 9 02 10 1 n1o1 14 9 97 13 2 n2o1 14 table s5 the compounds with dbe 4 could be aromatic because a benzene ring has a dbe value of 4 jarvis et al 2018 this result indicates possibly higher carbonyl carboxyl groups in the o1 14 species and more aromatic structures in the n2o1 14 species the increases in carbon number for any particular dbe value can be associated with increasing alkylation of a core structure or several different core structures jarvis et al 2018 some exemplary core structures for the o6 11 species contain the aromatic ring s and hydroxyl and carboxyl groups which are reactive in dbp formation chang et al 2006 for example compounds c9 30 with dbe 8 in the o6 species could be 5 carboxyisophthalate c9h4o6 dbe 8 with the alkyl groups tables s6 s7 s8 besides the carboxyl group the oxygen containing functional groups in the ox species could be hydroxyl and carbonyl co groups all of which are hydrophilic oxygenated moieties wang et al 2015a the n1o6 11 and n2o4 9 species could be nitro substituted compounds and organonitrates because the nitro no2 or nitrooxy ono2 group has the high o n ratios 2 zhang et al 2018 the structures of the n1 and n2 species being part of chn which were not identified in our study proposed by the previous studies fang et al 2017 pan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 could be the potential structures of no species when oxygen does not appear in the c o bond zhang et al 2018 suggested the n1 species with dbe 3 may be six membered heterocyclic compounds containing one nitrogen heteroatom such as pyridine c5h5n dbe 4 the core structures of the n1 compounds with dbe of 6 9 10 12 and 15 could be indole c8h7n dbe 6 carbazoles c12h9n dbe 9 phenylindoles c14h11n dbe 10 or carbazoles with a naphthenic ring benzocarbazole c16h11n dbe 12 and dibenzocarbazoles c20h13n dbe 15 respectively the n2 classes with the dbe of 12 and 17 could be bi indole compounds and compounds with two fused carbazole cores han et al 2018 mazur et al 2016 all of those suggested compounds contain the aromatic carbon and nitrogen which are considered as the reactive dbp precursors le roux et al 2016 especially the n1o6 11 and n2o4 9 species could contain the carboxyl group and the aromatic amino acids i e tyrosine l aspartic acid and l asparagine have been considered as the important precursors of dbps i e thms bond et al 2011a hong et al 2009 relative to the control the treatments with either 0 5 or 1 0 mg cu l induced slightly smaller numbers of disappeared o1 14 n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 features when using chlorine but higher numbers of disappeared o1 14 and n1o1 14 features when using chloramine fig 4 our previous study tsai et al 2019 reported higher dom reactivity mmol mol c in forming c dbps of thms and haas and o dbps of chd and htks using chlorine and n dbps of ndma using chloramine in the treatments compared to the control regardless of wildfire ash types relative to the control the larger numbers of disappeared o1 14 and n1o1 14 features partially explained higher dom reactivity of ndma in the treatments when using chloramine the compounds with dbe 15 possibly contain more than five aromatic rings in their chemical structures djokic et al 2018 the disappeared assigned features after disinfections primarily had dbe 20 fig 5 indicating the potential existence of both small and large aromatic rings in the molecular structures xiao et al 2019 using chlorine we observed larger numbers of disappeared assigned features with low dbe 1 10 in control partially explaining lower dom reactivity in forming c and o dbps relative to the treatments in contrast using chloramine the treatments had larger numbers of disappeared assigned features with high dbe 5 16 partially explaining higher dom reactivity in forming ndma relative to the control 4 conclusions and environmental implications due to global warming severe wildfires could happen more frequently the harmful algae bloom could be initialized by the elevated nutrient levels after transporting the ash derived dom from the forest floor to steam waters in post fire rainstorms using ft icr ms in characterizing dom after cu2 controlled post fire algae bloom our study presents the increase of 7 38 on the number of assigned features after the 4 d incubation depending on both cu2 concentrations and wildfire ash types the produced aom accounted for 34 2 55 2 in the initial numbers and had a higher average carbon number mw dbe dbe o and dbe o lower average oxygen number and similar dbe c relative to dom before incubation this result possibly explained higher dom chlorine reactivity in forming haas in control compared to the initial disinfectants effectively removed the assigned features from incubated dom with 5906 9041 and 3080 6015 assigned features disappeared by chlorine and chloramine respectively the disappeared assigned features had negative nosc under both chlorine and chloramine but lower under chloramine possibly suggesting more reduced a higher number of disappeared assigned features as potential dbp precursors possibly explained the traditional view of more c and o dbps produced using chlorine relative to chloramine relative to dom after incubation the disappeared dom had higher average values of mw and dbe indicating assigned features with high mw and more double bonds rings as preferable dbp precursors the most abundant species in disappeared assigned features after adding disinfectants were o1 14 followed by n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 lower dom chlorine reactivity in forming c and o dbps in control without cu2 addition could attribute to a larger number of disappeared assigned features with low dbe of 1 10 relative to the treatments with cu2 addition on the other hand higher dom chloramine reactivity in forming ndma could be explained by a larger number of o1 14 and n1o1 14 and dbe 5 16 in disappeared assigned features in the treatments compared to the control our study suggests the oxygen and nitrogen containing organic compounds with more double bonds aromatic rings as the primary remediation target for reducing the dom reactivity in forming dbps as a selective oxidant ozone attacks the electron rich functional groups of c c double bonds activated aromatic systems and non protonated amines liu et al 2014 von gunten 2003 and could be an option for removing these potential dbp precursors besides coagulation can neutralize the negatively charged functional groups e g phenolic and carboxylic chen et al 2020 and selectively remove organic compounds with oxidized carbon low h c ratio and high o c lavonen et al 2015 overall the analytic technique of ft icr ms was effective in characterizing dbp precursors during disinfection and the next possible step forward is to further separate the assigned features and identify their structures by connecting ft icr ms with other analytic techniques supporting information seven tables and

17378,copper based algaecides are usually used for controlling algae bloom triggered by the elevated levels of nutrients after wildfires resulting in the promoted reactivity of dissolved organic matter dom in forming disinfectant byproducts dbps to identify the best strategy for handling this source water we employed fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to characterize the dbps precursors after 4 d microcystis aeruginosa bloom cultured with black be and white we ash water extracts under 0 0 5 and 1 0 mg cu l the disappeared dom during disinfections primarily composed of o1 14 n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 had a higher average molecular weight mw and double bond equivalent dbe relative to dom after incubation regardless of disinfects and cu2 this result suggests assigned features with larger mw and more double bonds rings as preferable dbp precursors we observed a larger number of disappeared assigned features with low dbe of 1 10 in control without cu2 addition possibly explaining lower dom chlorine reactivity in forming carbonaceous and oxygenated dbps relative to the treatments with cu2 addition we found a larger number of o1 14 and n1o1 14 with dbe 5 16 in the treatments potentially explaining higher dom chloramine reactivity in forming n nitrosodimethylamine ndma compared to the control our study suggests removing oxygen and nitrogen containing organic compounds with more double bonds aromatic rings as a preferable strategy for handling source water after controlling post fire algae blooms with copper sulfate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ft icr ms wildfire ash algae bloom copper sulfate disinfectant byproducts 1 introduction due to warming climate forest wildfire activities have been increased across the western us in past decades not only in number but also in total burned area holden et al 2018 schoennagel et al 2017 during the post fire precipitations the levels of nutrients i e carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the downstream waters will be elevated through the exports of sediments and dissolved organic matter dom from the burned area bladon et al 2014 smith et al 2011 excessive nutrient inputs plus the increased water temperatures after the wildfires increase the eutrophication risks and cause the algae growth in downstream waters bladon et al 2014 odhiambo and routh 2016 for example klose et al 2015 reported the increased algae biomass up to 5 times for chlorophyll a and 20 times for macroalgal mass after the fire and subsequent floods at the basins with burned riparian vegetation relative to unburned basins on the other hand since source water from forested land is generally of high quality and requires inexpensive treatments before consumption more than half of the water supply in the contiguous us originates on forested lands brown et al 2008 murphy et al 2015 the dom in the source waters will form carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps in water facilities via the reaction with oxidants disinfectants the amount of formed dbps depends not only on dom content but also on dom composition tsai and chow 2016 found the increased chlorine reactivity of fire derived dom in dbp formation after the postfire algal blooms though both of wildfire ash derived dom and algae produced organic matter aom are known as dbp precursors tsai et al 2017 wang et al 2015b zhou et al 2014 the postfire algae growing alters the properties of dom derived from wildfire ashes along with their reactivity in dbp formation tsai and chow 2016 cultivated freshwater green algae of pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and blue green algae of microcystis aeruginosa using the mixture of cultural medium and water extracts of burned pine pinus palustris ash at 50 250 and 400 they found that the optical properties of suva254 an indicator for dom aromaticity and humification index hix increased at 50 and 250 but decreased at 400 moreover the chlorine reactivities in forming trihalomethanes thms haloacetonitriles hans chloral hydrate chd and haloketones htks generally increased after algae growing until now the copper based algaecides such as copper sulfate cuso4 have been extensively applied for controlling the algae bloom in drinking water sources hoko and makado 2011 mcknight et al 1983 resulting in the further alternation of the dom quantity and quality and thus the dbp formation tsai et al 2019 recently drinking water facilities increasingly use chloramination to replace chlorination for reducing the regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as thms and haloacetic acids haas this replacement potentially increases the formation of nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which have more significant health risks compared with current regulated dbps bond et al 2011b zhu et al 2015 therefore characterizing the post fire algae bloom and cuso4 algaecide influence on dom quality at the molecular levels is particularly important for identifying the potential c and n dbp precursors which provides information for stakeholders to take the appropriate strategies for ensuring the post fire drinking water safety in the past years high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has emerged as a reliable analytic tool for the in depth molecular characterization of the complex organic matrix

the 4 d algal m aeruginosa incubation experiments using water extracts of black be or white we ash as nutrients and the concentrations of 0 0 5 and 1 0 mg cu l were applied during incubations the data on dom quantity and optical properties and specific formation potential of dbps i e thms haas chd htks hans and ndma was presented in tsai et al 2019 here we performed the negative mode of both esi

such as hohner et al 2016 the concentrations of 0 the control 0 5 and 1 0 mg cu l were applied for investigating the effect of copper on the dom characterization the algae were cultured non axenically at 24 2 c for 4 d with the photoperiod of 12 h light and 12 h dark they were illuminated by cool white fluorescent lighting at an intensity of 2100 lux for further chemical analysis the samples were collected at the beginning only from the control after mixing as the initial and end of the experiment 0 d and 4 d containing both aom and ash derived dom and thus passed through millipore 0 45 µm

especially acidifying the samples to ph 2 3 before spe could generate a small amount of chlorinated organic compounds by the reaction of hcl with dom 2 3 data analyses the assigned features were categorized into six biochemical classes of amino sugars carbohydrates phytochemical oxygenated aromatic compounds phyoxyarom proteins lipids and nucleotides by the boundary limits in the van krevelen vk diagram the boundary limits were adopted from rivas ubach et al 2018 using a script in github https github com pnnl comp mass spec mscc the adopted boundary limits categorized most of the assigned

positive values stand for the oxidized compounds with great polarity cao et al 2015 schmidt et al 2017 here we only analyzed the peaks with assigned formulas 800 m z to consider assignment accuracy we did not consider the peak abundance because it cannot be directly equated to concentration and may be affected by the ionization efficiency of different compounds in complex mixtures kujawinski 2002 liu and kujawinski 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular characteristics on dom before versus after incubation the numbers of assigned features increased after the 4 d incubation and these increases depend on both cu2 concentrations and wildfire ash types during incubation there were 935 2033 assigned features disappeared 2597 4191 assigned features produced and 5557 6302 assigned features persistent resulting in a total 107 138 of the initial numbers before incubation fig 1 and table s2 after incubation with we the numbers of assigned features decreased with increasing cu2 concentrations and this tendency was not observed in the be incubation our previous study tsai et al 2019 reported that doc concentrations increased after incubation and increments reduced with increasing cu2 concentrations while algal populations decreased when treated with cu2 regardless of wildfire ash types changes in the pools of assigned features by incubation potentially affected dom reactivity in forming dbps we observed higher dom chlorine reactivity in forming haas in control than the initial for both be and we tsai et al 2019 hua et al 2017 reported higher reactivity in forming haas than thms for both extra and intra cellular aom and higher reactivity for intra than extra cellular aom in forming both haas and thms from a green alga chlorella sp they attributed it to the primary component of aromatic and aliphatic compounds with high hydroxyl and amide contents in intra cellular aom and humic and fulvic like compounds with high carboxylic contents in extra cellular aom in general the carboxylic group as an electron receiving ligand is unfavorable for dbp formation relative to aliphatic if bond to electron donating ligands such as hydroxyl amine and sulfide groups aromatic and keto functional groups hua et al 2017 we observed the new assigned features during incubation considered as aom and the molecular characteristics of produced aom depended on wildfire ash types there were 2597 4191 new assigned features produced considered aom accounting for a large percentage of 34 2 55 2 in the initial numbers before incubation relative to dom before incubation the produced aom had higher average carbon number mw dbe dbe o and dbe o lower average oxygen number and o c and similar dbe c this result suggests that aom had higher degrees of unsaturation π bonds and rings even excluding all the possible c o bonds higher numbers of c o bonds keto carbon and a similar number of c c double bonds roth et al 2013 molecules with lower h c or higher dbe likely highly aromatic compounds and o c ratios are more reactive toward chlorine harris et al 2015 zhang et al 2012a lavonen et al 2013 found cl containing compounds after disinfection had greatly lower h c dbe c and o c ratios relative to cl containing compounds before disinfection wang et al 2017 reported the significant correlation of molecules with high o c ratio and low h c ratio with the formation potentials of thms and haas during chlorination the wildfire ash type affected the molecular characteristics of incubation produced aom the be incubated aom contained lower average values of carbon and oxygen numbers mw and h c but higher average values of o c more hydrophobic n c nosc dbe c dbe o and aimod compared to we incubated aom table s3 this result suggests that the be incubated aom contained more unsaturated oxidized nitrogen containing and aromatic and less reduced compounds with lower mw schmidt et al 2017 wen et al 2018 compared to the we incubated dom tsai et al 2019 found more promotive effect of cu2 addition on dbp formation in the be incubated dom they attributed it to the presence of more carboxylic groups partially confirmed by higher o c and aimod and lower h c in our study among dom before and after incubation we observed the same shapes and centers but different numbers of assigned features at peaks in the distribution of properties including mw o c h c nosc dbe and aimod fig 2 the peaks were found in 300 400 m z for mw 0 3 0 4 for o c 1 3 1 5 for h c 1 0 for nosc 8 12 for dbe and 0 2 0 4 for aimod respectively indicating the dominance of less oxidized highly unsaturated reduced and less aromatic molecules wang et al 2020 the number of assigned features at the distribution peaks increased after incubation and these increases depended on the cu2 concentrations and wildfire ash types specifically the number of assigned features at peaks did not vary greatly among different cu2 concentrations after incubated by be indicating no influence of cu2 concentrations however after incubated by we the treatments of 0 and 0 5 mg cu l had similar peak numbers higher than these treated with 1 0 mg cu l this result suggests that the increased tendency in the number of assigned features was neutralized to a certain extent when treated with 1 0 mg cu l using aimod and h c the assigned features were divided into four groups with the order of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds 42 3 47 4 group 3 aliphatic compounds 23 5 29 6 group 4 combustion derived condensed polycyclic aromatics 13 0 17 6 group 1 vascular plant derived polyphenols 12 5 15 8 group 2 figure s1 this result suggests the dominance of highly unsaturated phenolic and aliphatic compounds in dom before and after incubation and the phenolic and aliphatic dbp precursors could an important fraction of dbp precursors wang et al 2016 interestingly in group 1 there was a larger number percentage of assigned features with n atoms 8 49 15 6 relative to these without n atom 2 67 5 68 table s4 the heteroatom and biochemical classes of dom were not changed greatly after incubation and differences were observed between be and we related dom the heteroatom classes were dominated by cho and chon with 41 1 41 2 43 5 and 35 4 36 9 38 9 in be and 46 9 47 4 53 8 and 26 3 25 7 28 5 in we before after incubation figures s1 s2 this result indicates that be related dom had less cho but more chon formulas than these in we related dom both of which were not significantly influenced by both incubation and cu2 concentrations don represented by chon in our study favors the formation of n dpbs lee et al 2007 specifically be related dom had a larger number of black nitrogen assigned features aimod 0 67 and n 0 than we related dom table s4 no hydrocarbons ch were identified possibly due to their low water solubilities chen et al 2018 and the negative modes we used in ft icr ms he et al 2018 hemmler et al 2018 the major biochemical class was phytochemical oxygenated aromatic compounds phyoxyaroms followed with liquids phyoxyaroms were contributed by oxy condensed aromatic compounds in ash from incomplete combustion of biomass and polyphenolic compounds in algae s living system rivas ubach et al 2018 compounds in phyoxyaroms could be active dbp precursors due to the possible presence of aromatic and oxygen containing e g hydroxyl functional groups lavonen et al 2013 algae s lipid content depends on the nitrogen limitations and trophic conditions bono et al 2013 feng et al 2011 shen et al 2015 higher lipid content in we incubated samples could be because of the lower chon percentage in we other biochemical classes were minor classes such as amino sugars of 1 01 1 43 as one of the important dbp precursors leenheer 2004 and protein of 3 88 9 24 as the precursors of n dbps due to the presence of nitrogen in protein 3 2 disappeared assigned features after disinfections both disinfectants effectively removed assigned features from dom after incubation with 5 906 9 041 and 3 080 6 015 assigned features disappeared by chlorine and chloramine table s2 respectively the disappeared assigned features during disinfections were considered potential dbp precursors in our study this result indicates that a higher number of assigned features acted as the potential dbp precursors when using chlorine compared to chloramine this result possibly explained the traditional view that chlorine produces more c dbps and oxygenated dbps o dbps compared to chloramine chuang et al 2013 the average nosc negative by chlorine was higher than these negative by chloramine table s3 indicating that potential dbp precursors by chloramine were more reduced the nocs was negatively related to the gibbs energy of the oxidation half reaction of organic compounds δ g c o x o kj mol e and removing an electron from an organic compound with lower nosc was less thermodynamically favorable larowe and van cappellen 2011 boye et al 2017 further suggested that organic compounds with nosc 0 6 provided insufficient energy for microbial growth and were thermodynamically preserved in anaerobic soils sediments under the standard conditions 1 atm and 25 chlorine e h o 1 36 v had a higher half reaction potential than monochloramine basic condition e h o 0 75 v copeland and lytle 2014 however free chlorine hocl formed through the monochloramine hydrolysis had a higher half reaction potential of e h o 1 49 v copeland and lytle 2014 and likely provided a more important contribution to dbp formation relative to a direct halogenation of dom by monochloramine zhang et al 2020 compared to assigned features after incubation the disappeared assigned features had similar dominated heteroatom and biochemical classes figure s3 but higher average values of carbon number oxygen number mw and dbe table s3 suggesting compounds with high mw and more double bonds rings as preferable dbp precursors the increases in dbe are correlated to the increase in not only aromaticity i e additional aromatic rings increase by 3 dbe but also double bonds i e c o and c c jarvis et al 2018 niu et al 2018 found a strong correlation between weight averaged dbe and suva254 and suggested dbe as the indicator of the unsaturation or aromaticity degree hua et al 2015 suggested the hydrophobic dom with high mw 500 m z and more aromatic structures as primary dbp precursors however aimod as a traditional indicator of aromaticity in ft icr ms data in disappeared assigned features was not higher than that in assigned features after incubation gonsior et al 2019 found no evidence for aromatic dbp precursors from known metabolites of microcystis aeruginosa with regular culture medium these results indicate a high fraction of dbp precursors in our study with potentially unsaturated and aliphatic structures and a relatively less important role of the aromatic structure during disinfection studies gonsior et al 2014 li and mitch 2018 found that products with high o c ratio and dbe were generated through targeting polyphenolic structures during chlorination zhang et al 2012b revealed the prevalent presence of unknown chlorinated products with a possible abundance of the carboxylic and phenolic functional groups in drinking water the influence of cu2 on dbp formations is due to the complexation of cu2 with dom acidic and aromatic functional groups such as carboxylic phenolic and aminopolycarboxylate moistures liu et al 2007 tsai et al 2019 compared to the control the treatments of either 0 5 or 1 0 mg cu l had less disappeared assigned features using chlorine 0 65 0 82 but more disappeared assigned features using chloramine 1 11 1 76 indicating the distinct roles of cu2 during chlorination and chloramination table s2 specifically relative to the control without cu2 addition the numbers of unique disappeared assigned features in the treatments with cu2 addition were slightly higher using chlorine 1 07 1 10 but greatly higher using chloramine 4 51 5 56 fig 3 this result suggests that more compounds acted as potential chloramine dbp precursors after the addition of cu2 which could partially explain higher dom chloramine reactivity in forming ndma in the treatments compared to the control tsai et al 2019 the distributions of mw o c h c nosc dbe and aimod for disappeared assigned features had the same shape among the control and two treatments figure s4 generally the peaks were found in 300 400 m z for mw 0 3 0 4 for o c 1 3 1 5 for h c 1 0 for nosc 8 12 for dbe and 0 2 0 4 for aimod respectively compared to the control the number of assigned features at peaks decreased by chlorine but increased by chloramine in the treatments moreover related to 0 5 mg cu l these numbers of assigned features under 1 0 mg cu l were similar when using be but slightly lower when using we in addition two studies attributed the generation of hydroxyl radical in the presence of cu2 to the catalytic effect of cu2 on dbp formation however this mechanism still requires further researches fu et al 2009 liu et al 2012 while fu et al 2009 reported a positive effect of cu2 on the thms formation during chlorination and monochloramination liu et al 2012 found the presence of cu2 inhibited thms formation and promoted haas formation during chlorination 3 3 o1 14 n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 in disappeared assigned features the most abundant species in disappeared assigned features after adding disinfectants were oxygen containing compounds of o1 14 species cho1 14 36 7 53 5 followed by oxygen and nitrogen containing compounds of n1o1 14 cho1 14n1 12 0 23 0 and n2o1 14 cho1 14n2 5 26 12 7 figs 4 s3 s5 the cho1 14 class may include carboxylic acids hydroxybenzoic acids and phenols which are the active precursors for thms chang et al 2006 the cho1 14n1 2 classes were possibly composed of amino acids containing amine nh2 and carboxyl cooh groups and phenolic amine containing amine nh2 and phenol c6h5oh groups which are considered as the important precursors of both c i e chloroform and n dbps i e dichloroacetonitrile bond et al 2014 chu et al 2012 the assigned features in the cho1 14n1 and cho1 14n2 classes formed two crescent regions in the n c versus mw plots figure s6 and the assigned features on the righter side of each horizontal dots could more saturated and have a larger number of oxygen containing e g hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups li et al 2019 the number percentages of disappeared o1 14 n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 features followed a good tendency of increasing and then decreasing with oxygen number figure s5 and their average oxygen numbers had the order of o1 14 7 30 8 50 n1o1 14 7 21 8 19 n2o1 14 5 61 7 26 table s5 this result suggests the rich of carbonyl carboxyl groups in these three species especially the o1 14 species besides we observed the increase of nosc dbe and aimod with the order of o1 14 n1o1 14 n2o1 14 figure s7 the nosc values were negative for the o1 14 species but positive for the n2o1 14 species indicating more reduced compounds in the ox species but more oxidized compounds in the n2ox species the average dbe values were in an order of 8 42 9 32 o1 14 9 02 10 1 n1o1 14 9 97 13 2 n2o1 14 table s5 the compounds with dbe 4 could be aromatic because a benzene ring has a dbe value of 4 jarvis et al 2018 this result indicates possibly higher carbonyl carboxyl groups in the o1 14 species and more aromatic structures in the n2o1 14 species the increases in carbon number for any particular dbe value can be associated with increasing alkylation of a core structure or several different core structures jarvis et al 2018 some exemplary core structures for the o6 11 species contain the aromatic ring s and hydroxyl and carboxyl groups which are reactive in dbp formation chang et al 2006 for example compounds c9 30 with dbe 8 in the o6 species could be 5 carboxyisophthalate c9h4o6 dbe 8 with the alkyl groups tables s6 s7 s8 besides the carboxyl group the oxygen containing functional groups in the ox species could be hydroxyl and carbonyl co groups all of which are hydrophilic oxygenated moieties wang et al 2015a the n1o6 11 and n2o4 9 species could be nitro substituted compounds and organonitrates because the nitro no2 or nitrooxy ono2 group has the high o n ratios 2 zhang et al 2018 the structures of the n1 and n2 species being part of chn which were not identified in our study proposed by the previous studies fang et al 2017 pan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 could be the potential structures of no species when oxygen does not appear in the c o bond zhang et al 2018 suggested the n1 species with dbe 3 may be six membered heterocyclic compounds containing one nitrogen heteroatom such as pyridine c5h5n dbe 4 the core structures of the n1 compounds with dbe of 6 9 10 12 and 15 could be indole c8h7n dbe 6 carbazoles c12h9n dbe 9 phenylindoles c14h11n dbe 10 or carbazoles with a naphthenic ring benzocarbazole c16h11n dbe 12 and dibenzocarbazoles c20h13n dbe 15 respectively the n2 classes with the dbe of 12 and 17 could be bi indole compounds and compounds with two fused carbazole cores han et al 2018 mazur et al 2016 all of those suggested compounds contain the aromatic carbon and nitrogen which are considered as the reactive dbp precursors le roux et al 2016 especially the n1o6 11 and n2o4 9 species could contain the carboxyl group and the aromatic amino acids i e tyrosine l aspartic acid and l asparagine have been considered as the important precursors of dbps i e thms bond et al 2011a hong et al 2009 relative to the control the treatments with either 0 5 or 1 0 mg cu l induced slightly smaller numbers of disappeared o1 14 n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 features when using chlorine but higher numbers of disappeared o1 14 and n1o1 14 features when using chloramine fig 4 our previous study tsai et al 2019 reported higher dom reactivity mmol mol c in forming c dbps of thms and haas and o dbps of chd and htks using chlorine and n dbps of ndma using chloramine in the treatments compared to the control regardless of wildfire ash types relative to the control the larger numbers of disappeared o1 14 and n1o1 14 features partially explained higher dom reactivity of ndma in the treatments when using chloramine the compounds with dbe 15 possibly contain more than five aromatic rings in their chemical structures djokic et al 2018 the disappeared assigned features after disinfections primarily had dbe 20 fig 5 indicating the potential existence of both small and large aromatic rings in the molecular structures xiao et al 2019 using chlorine we observed larger numbers of disappeared assigned features with low dbe 1 10 in control partially explaining lower dom reactivity in forming c and o dbps relative to the treatments in contrast using chloramine the treatments had larger numbers of disappeared assigned features with high dbe 5 16 partially explaining higher dom reactivity in forming ndma relative to the control 4 conclusions and environmental implications due to global warming severe wildfires could happen more frequently the harmful algae bloom could be initialized by the elevated nutrient levels after transporting the ash derived dom from the forest floor to steam waters in post fire rainstorms using ft icr ms in characterizing dom after cu2 controlled post fire algae bloom our study presents the increase of 7 38 on the number of assigned features after the 4 d incubation depending on both cu2 concentrations and wildfire ash types the produced aom accounted for 34 2 55 2 in the initial numbers and had a higher average carbon number mw dbe dbe o and dbe o lower average oxygen number and similar dbe c relative to dom before incubation this result possibly explained higher dom chlorine reactivity in forming haas in control compared to the initial disinfectants effectively removed the assigned features from incubated dom with 5906 9041 and 3080 6015 assigned features disappeared by chlorine and chloramine respectively the disappeared assigned features had negative nosc under both chlorine and chloramine but lower under chloramine possibly suggesting more reduced a higher number of disappeared assigned features as potential dbp precursors possibly explained the traditional view of more c and o dbps produced using chlorine relative to chloramine relative to dom after incubation the disappeared dom had higher average values of mw and dbe indicating assigned features with high mw and more double bonds rings as preferable dbp precursors the most abundant species in disappeared assigned features after adding disinfectants were o1 14 followed by n1o1 14 and n2o1 14 lower dom chlorine reactivity in forming c and o dbps in control without cu2 addition could attribute to a larger number of disappeared assigned features with low dbe of 1 10 relative to the treatments with cu2 addition on the other hand higher dom chloramine reactivity in forming ndma could be explained by a larger number of o1 14 and n1o1 14 and dbe 5 16 in disappeared assigned features in the treatments compared to the control our study suggests the oxygen and nitrogen containing organic compounds with more double bonds aromatic rings as the primary remediation target for reducing the dom reactivity in forming dbps as a selective oxidant ozone attacks the electron rich functional groups of c c double bonds activated aromatic systems and non protonated amines liu et al 2014 von gunten 2003 and could be an option for removing these potential dbp precursors besides coagulation can neutralize the negatively charged functional groups e g phenolic and carboxylic chen et al 2020 and selectively remove organic compounds with oxidized carbon low h c ratio and high o c lavonen et al 2015 overall the analytic technique of ft icr ms was effective in characterizing dbp precursors during disinfection and

17379,the bound water in waste activated sludge was is trapped in extracellular polymeric substances eps in the form of gel like structure leading to a great challenge in the sludge deep dewatering traditional flocculation conditioning is unable to destroy eps and ineffective to remove the bound water in was in this study we employed integration of fe ii sulfite oxidation and polyacrylamide flocculation f s pam treatment for removing the bound water and improving sludge dewaterability under aerobic conditions meanwhile the floc microstructure and eps properties were examined to understand the mechanisms of f s pam conditioning f s produced so3 radicals which could decompose the eps in sludge releasing bound water into free water in addition the formed fe iii from f s led to re coagulation of decomposed eps and c o groups of tryptophan played the leading role in fe eps association binding causing transformation of the secondary structure of proteins especially β sheets and α helices then the introduction of pam caused re flocculation of disintegrated sludge flocs enhancing the sludge filterability this work provides a novel and cost effective method for efficient removal of bound water in sludge and subsequence improvement in sludge dewaterability graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge sludge dewaterability fe ii sulfite polyacrylamide extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction nowadays the main method of wastewater treatment involves activated sludge which makes excess sludge containing over 99 wt of water an emerging problem qi et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 sludge dewatering is an effective approach to reduce the volume and costs of subsequence transportation landfilling incineration and handling of sludge xiao et al 2018 however extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge flocs are in the form of gel like structure which can firmly bind with water molecules chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 traditional flocculants are not sufficient to decompose eps structure and convert bound water into free water liu et al 2016a thus numerous pretreatments including acidification and ultrasonication tiehm et al 2001 xiao et al 2016 hydrothermal process wang et al 2017 electro osmosis daneshmand et al 2012 and advanced oxidation processes aops xiao et al 2018 have been developed to destruct the stability of sludge colloid system and release intracellular water among these strategies aops generating various oxidative radicals have been considered for eps decomposition and deep dewatering of sludge xiao et al 2018 hydroxyl radical oh derived from fenton reagent showed potency in destructing eps via disrupting rigid cell membranes liang et al 2015 however h2o2 has some drawbacks since it is explosive unstable and corrosive thus there are some limitations for its transportation and use neyens et al 2004 another strong radical of emerging interest sulfate radical so4 has sparked a lot of attention due to its selective degradation of electron rich recalcitrant substances anipsitakis et al 2004 especially effective in bacterial inactivation wordofa et al 2017 traditional so4 generating process relies on one step activation of peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps anipsitakis et al 2004 in contract sulfite auto catalyzed by transition metals capable of deriving continuous generation of so4 in the presence of oxygen is via intricate sulfite associated radical chain reactions chen et al 2017 in transition metals sulfite systems generated so4 exclusively oxidized parent sulfite without interference of other substances chen et al 2012 neta et al 1977 leading to kinetically favored auto oxidation of sulfite as a result the pool of so4 catalyzes sulfite to re generate so3 for auto oxidation of sulfite achieving better performance in the inactivation of bacteria chen et al 2017 anipsitakis et al 2004 sulfite auto catalyzed by fe ii was reported to inactivate bacteria species via disrupting rigid cell membranes chen et al 2012 xie et al 2019 wang et al 2019 this inspired us to form the hypothesis that the fe ii sulfite f s process might be used to destruct cell walls releasing protein pn and polysaccharide ps meanwhile the in situ generated fe iii from f s could also complex with released pn ps converting the bound water into free water however the mechanism of fe ii catalyzed sulfite oxidation for sludge dewaterability needs to be experimentally confirmed it is widely accepted that extracellular proteins are the major hydrophilic substances in sludge and play a predominant role in sludge dewaterability compared to polysaccharides or humic substances wu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 wu et al 2017 claimed that spatial distribution of hydrophilic functional groups in extracellular proteins during aops was the key for determining the removal of interstitial water from sludge thus the effects of fe ii catalyzed sulfite system on the molecular structure transformation of extracellular proteins in sludge needs to be explored although aops favor the decomposition of eps releasing bound water trapped in eps plenty of colloidal fragments are also discharged hu et al 2018 these colloidal fragments in sludge increase the blockage of micro filtration medium resulting in decreased sludge filterability the chemical flocculation inorganic coagulants and organic polymers is recognized as an efficient approach to promote agglomeration of fine particles in sludge through bridging and electrostatic reactions yan et al 2013 zhao et al 2003 thereby enhancing the sludge filterability and dewaterability therefore the combination of aops and flocculation potentially integrates complementary roles for these two treatments however pam flocculation prior to f s treatment probably causes deterioration of sludge dewaterability due to the unreleased bound water trapped in eps wang et al 2019 ayol et al 2005 further effort is required to optimize the synergism between pre oxidation and flocculation such as the sequence of pre treatment by organic polymer flocculant steps and improvement of pre oxidation configuration in this study we integrated fe ii sulfite oxidation with polyacrylamide flocculation f s pam for waste activated sludge was dewaterability improvement and elucidated the synergism of pre oxidation and flocculation in sludge conditioning the main objectives of this work were 1 to optimize the sludge conditioning process of f s pam for wastewater sludge dewaterability improvement 2 to study interaction between fe ii and eps in presence of sulfite as well as identify the active radicals for eps degradation and 3 to determine the distribution of biopolymers in sludge and the changes in predominant group of eps and extracellular proteins transformation during the f s treatment this study not only provides a novel technology for sludge conditioning but also elucidates the mechanism of sludge conditioning by f s pam process which has important implications for its application in engineering practices 2 experimental section 2 1 waste activated sludge properties waste activated sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in nanjing city china the ratio of volatile suspended solids vss to suspended solids tss in the sludge samples was 51 88 determined according to cai et al 2018 in addition other detailed characteristics of the waste activated sludge are provided in supporting information si table s1 2 2 reagents and materials details of all reagents and materials used in this study are provided in si text s1 2 3 procedures for sludge conditioning the bench scale tests for sludge dewatering and conditioning were conducted in batch mode using flask beakers 1 l under stirring by a hexagonal agitator my3000 6b first 300 ml of raw wastewater sludge was transferred into 1 l flask beakers then conditioned according to the following procedure adding sulfite with 2 min of rapid mixing 250 rpm followed by adding fe ii with 30 min of slowing mixing 150 rpm oxidation period finally adding pam 4 76 mg g tss with 20 min of slowing mixing 150 rpm re flocculation period it should be noted that the molar ratio dosage of sulfite to fe ii is controlled at 0 8 in which fe ii is 1 79 mmol l tss after the conditioning process the sludge was withdrawn for sludge dewaterability determination 2 4 dewaterability assessment of sludge details for specific resistance to filtration srf and capillary suction time cst measurements are provided in si text 2 bound water content was determined using a differential scanning calorimetry analyzer dsc25 ta company u s equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooling system katsiris et al 1987 in brief the sludge sample was first subjected to 20 c the free water in sludge was frozen and then brought back to 10 c at a rate of 2 c min the dsc analytical procedure was performed as detailed in the study of zhang et al 2014 the amount of free water fw was calculated by the area a of the endothermic curve below the baseline which represented the amount of heat required to melt the free water then the bound water wf was calculated by the difference between the known total water content wt and the amount of free water fw content in sludge 1 f w k a 2 w f w t f w w t k a where w t f w and w f are the mass of total water mg free water mg and bound water mg respectively and k is the conversion factor mg mj which is determined by obtaining the thermograms of pure water of known mass and measured curve area 2 5 characterization of sludge flocs properties the physical surface morphology changes of sludge flocs samples were observed through scanning electron microscope sem zeiss at an acceleration voltage of 5 0 kv in addition zeta sizer zs900 malvern instrument ltd was utilized for determining the zeta potential variations of sludge flocs 2 6 eps extraction and analysis in sludge the extracellular polymeric substances eps of sludge was extracted by cation exchange resin cer technique which enabled a high extraction efficiency with little cell lysis and polymer disruption frolund et al 1996 the resin could be removed readily after the extraction process and did not interfere with the subsequent analysis the detailed procedures for eps extraction and measurement of proteins and polysaccharides were provided in si text s3 and si text s4 in addition the spatial distribution of eps including proteins and polysaccharides in sludge flocs under the different treatments was characterized using a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm zeiss lsm 510 instrument meanwhile fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and con a texas red were used for dyeing polysaccharides and proteins in sludge flocs then the dyed sludge samples were observed under 488 nm red color for polysaccharides and 543 nm green color for proteins excitation filter conditions through clsm instrument respectively 2 7 interaction mechanism studies between eps and fe ii in presence of sulfite 2 7 1 complexation parameters determination for fe eps fluorescent chromophores in eps are generally related to tyrosine tryptophan and quinoid structures ai et al 2019 shou et al 2018 in this study there was only one fluorescent peak detected fig s3a which was associated with tryptophan structure in protein like substances chen et al 2003 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 hitachi japan was used to quantitatively explore the metal eps association through fluorescence quenching experiment sheng et al 2013 shou et al 2018 specifically an aqueous fe ii stock solution 24 mmol l was added into 20 ml of dissolved eps solutions 21 84 mg l with desired fe ii concentrations 0 1 5 10 50 100 and 200 μmol l followed by magnetic stirring for 1 h at 300 rpm ph 7 0 0 2 and 25 0 5 c both the fluorescence spectrum and intensity were recorded over an excitation wavelength ex of 200 400 nm 5 nm bandwidth and an emission wavelength em of 220 550 nm 5 nm bandwidth with a scanning speed of 12000 nm min the relationship between the fluorescence intensity and introduced metal fe ii can be described by the following stern volmer equations boaz et al 1950 3 f 0 f 1 k q τ 0 q 1 k s v q 4 l o g f 0 f f l o g k a n l o g q where f0 and f represent the relative fluorescence intensity of chromophore in absence and presence of the quencher metal ion respectively q represents the concentration of quencher metal ion ksv is the stern volmer quenching constant k q is the bimolecular quenching rate constant and τ0 is the average lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of the quencher which is approximately 5 10 9 s shou et al 2018 for the static quenching process the equation 2 can be used to determine the association constant ka and number of bonding sites n bi et al 2004 2 7 2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps characterization of fe eps complexes the fe eps complexes were dried using a freezer drier tf sfd 5 prior to spectroscopic characterization to determine the predominant group of eps in fe eps association binding x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250x thermo fischer u s was performed on the fe eps with a 70 0 ev pass energy for the broad survey scan and a 20 0 ev pass energy for the narrow spectrum survey scan 2 7 3 ftir combined with 2d cos the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of the freeze dried fe eps samples mixed with kbr mass ratio of 1 100 was conducted on a thermo nicolet 6700 spectrometer ftir spectra were recorded in range of 400 4000 cm 1 the two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos is developed by noda 2004 to investigate the binding sequences between dom groups with iron metal in this study the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir with structure sensitive spectral techniques was used to assign the ft ir bands and to verify their covariations noda et al 2004 more specifically the synchronous map was a symmetric spectrum with respect to the diagonal line which denoted the overall susceptibility of corresponding spectral region in contract the asynchronous map reflected the sequential or successive variations of spectral intensities in response to external perturbation xu et al 2018 yan et al 2013b during the f s treatment addition of fe ii acted as the external perturbation to set a metal concentration dependent ftir spectrum for fe complexed eps the obtained ftir spectra of complexed eps were normalized through summed intensities of 400 4000 cm 1 and noise components were removed using principle component analysis then the normalized ftir data matrix was processed with 2d shige software to obtain synchronous and asynchronous maps xu et al 2018 2 8 other analysis the dissolved organic matter in sludge supernatant was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc teledyne tekmar uv254 was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1900 japan to quantify aromatics both toc and uv254 were analyzed after the filtration through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate fiber membrane during the sludge conditioning assays with f s system the reactive radical was trapped with 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo and characterized using electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr jes fa200 jeol ltd instrument detailed procedure for radical determination is provided in si text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of f s oxidation and pam flocculation on sludge dewaterability batch experiments were conducted to compare the sludge dewaterability by pam s f and s f pam from si fig s1 the sludge filterability performed the best when the dosage of na2so3 and fe ii were 1 43 mmol l tss and 1 79 mmol l tss with the pam dosage of 4 76 mg g tss thus the optimal conditions were chosen for the subsequent sludge conditioning as illustrated in fig 1 a the specific resistance to filtration srf was reduced from 7 71 0 16 to 2 34 0 93 1 89 0 03 and 1 57 0 41 1012 m kg respectively at the same time the cst values after the pam s f and s f pam treatments decreased from 131 60 4 90 to 84 15 4 65 92 35 3 85 and 54 82 3 38 s respectively indicating the enhancement of sludge filterability after these treatments it should be noted that the sludge filterability and srf by f s pam was better than pam or s f treatment alone with the pre oxidation of s f the sludge flocs were broken down into fine floccules and the contact proportion of negatively charged functional groups on eps to pam increased resulting in higher flocculation performance of sludge particles and ultimately a decrease in cst and srf values liu et al 2010 wong et al 2015 therefore decreased cst and srf indicated that f s pam treatment was capable of improving sludge filterability while still maintaining good performance in sludge dewaterability in addition from fig 1 b bound water content in sludge significantly decreased from 3 54 0 23 to 3 15 0 26 1 15 0 31 and 0 73 0 15 g g per dry solids ds after pam f s and f s pam treatments respectively the sludge cake moisture also decreased from 89 2 3 7 wt to 86 9 3 9 wt 81 6 6 6 wt and 79 7 2 6 wt after pam f s and f s pam treatments respectively the 9 5 wt moisture reduction by f s pam was higher than that of pam 2 3 wt or f s 5 3 wt treatment alone these results indicated that f s pretreatment was more effective in removal of bound water than single flocculation conditioning pam could interact with eps through charge neutralization and bridging reactions but the bound water was still enclosed in sludge floc and hard to be released yan et al 2013 by pam treatment alone on the other hand the pre oxidation of eps by f s forced the release of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps and accompanied by the release of bound water as evidenced by the decreased pn ps concentrations in bound eps from 306 29 mg l and 28 64 mg l to 131 29 mg l and 17 48 mg l respectively si fig s2 besides the in situ formed fe iii accelerated the separation of pn ps from water via complexation causing reduction of bound water content li et al 2012 meanwhile the electrostatic interactions between cationic pam and negatively charged component in sludge flocs resulted in the re flocculation of disintegrated sludge flocs therefore f s pam was the most efficient treatment tested converting bound water into free water 3 2 effects of fe ii sulfite oxidation and flocculation on microstructure of sludge floc in order to examine the changes in surface morphology of sludge treated by different reagents the micrographs of sludge were observed through sem fig 3 a d the raw sludge existed in the form of compact blocky structures with organics filling the voids fig 3 a after f s treatment fig 3 c the surface of flocs exhibited a more sparse and porous morphology this indicated that the sludge was disrupted through oxidation effect by f s process however the sludge flocs showed a relatively smoother surface after f s pam treatment fig 3 d this was because that negatively charged eps agglomerated easily with pam via the electrostatic interactions and bridging yan et al 2013 therefore it seems that the porous surface resulted from decomposition of eps releasing ps pn into the bulk solution during f s treatment and released pn ps re coagulated by in situ formed fe iii subsequently the disintegrated sludge flocs were finally agglomerated by pam via electrostatic interactions cai et al 2018 leading to the formation of smoother surface of sludge floc meanwhile the surface of sludge was relatively more porous after f s pam treatment than that of single pam treatment fig 3 b prior to pam flocculation f s pre treatment decomposed eps and caused release of bound water into bulk phase leading to high dispersion of sludge particles then the cracked sludge flocs were easily bridged and re flocculated by pam leading to a more porous structure in addition zeta potential of sludge particles significantly increase from 36 1 1 1 to 11 23 0 48 and 8 66 2 39 mv after f s and f s pam treatments fig 2 a indicating a decrease in net surface charge on sludge flocs sludge particles were negatively charged due to the presence of carboxylate and phosphate groups in eps liao et al 2001 cai et al 2018 with the introduction of fe ii and pam these negatively charged sludge particles were electrically neutralized this in turn reduced solubility and increased aggregation of eps leading to the flocculation of colloidal sludge particles as evidenced by the sludge floc size increased from d50 33 04 0 80 μm to 84 90 1 09 μm 40 22 1 27 μm and 110 59 1 93 μm after treated by pam f s and f s pam respectively this observation revealed f s pretreatment enhanced the sludge flocculation efficiency of pam as evidenced by d50 these results supported the idea that f s pre oxidation and pam flocculation showed a synergistic effect in sludge dewaterability improvement 3 3 eps changes in sludge conditioning with fe ii sulfite oxidation and flocculation 3 3 1 effects of fe ii sulfite oxidation and flocculation on eps to examine the decomposition of eps under different treatments organics of supernatant in treated sludge were also quantified by uv254 for aromatic compounds and toc fig 2 b by comparison there was no significant change in toc and uv254 upon pam treatment while increased concentrations in toc and uv254 were observed after the f s and f s pam treatment moreover fig s2 si displayed the concentrations of pn and ps as the major eps component in supernatant of raw and treated sludge the pn in soluble eps s eps changed from 100 19 mg l to 78 86 11 357 54 28 and 528 43 67 14 mg l after pam f s and f s pam treatments respectively these results confirmed that the f s process decomposed the eps biopolymers and caused the release of bound water trapped in gel like structure although pam flocculation increased d50 of sludge floc the toc and uv254 remained relatively stable indicating that charge neutralization and bridging induced flocculation played more profound role in sludge dewaterability enhancement than decomposition of eps to release bound water in contrast f s treatment resulted in a significant increase in toc and uv254 with a slight decrease in cst as expected the combination of f s pam process provided the optimal sludge dewatering performance compared to either f s treatment or pam flocculation alone typically the decomposition of eps by f s evidenced by toc and uv254 led to greater release of bound water trapped in eps fig 1 b relative to pam alone furthermore the introduction of pam promoted the re flocculation of sludge flocs evidenced by d50 resulting in lower bound water and increased sludge dewaterability 3 3 2 effects of fe ii sulfite oxidation and flocculation on biopolymers distribution in sludge floc as discussed above eps readily undergoes decomposition by f s oxidation releasing pn ps into bulk phase resulting in higher dispersion of sludge flocs thus flocculation of disintegrated sludge flocs by pam was significantly enhanced via charge neutralization and bridging to verify the above assumption the spatial distribution of pn and ps in eps were observed through clsm fig 4 both pn and ps in eps exhibited broken and scattered patterns compared to pristine eps a after the f s treatment c and re flocculated together with the introduction of pam d in addition the flocculation effect of pn ps by pam was stronger in f s system than that of single pam treatment b this was ascribed to the fact that pre oxidative effect of f s caused the release of pn and ps from eps into bulk solution thus increased access of pam to pn and ps subsequently enhanced the sludge flocculation via electrical neutralization and bridging this is in consistence with our assumptions 3 4 mechanisms of f s pre treatment for sludge dewaterability improvement 3 4 1 role of oxidative radicals in f s system in controlled experiments with f s system the release of pn ps from bound eps into bulk solution by f s oxidation was observed resulting in an increase of toc concentration in supernatant of sludge fig 2 b auto oxidation of sulfite catalyzed by fe ii has been widely recognized through radical chain reactions that involved several intermediate short lived radicals including so3 so5 and so4 zhou et al 2018 during generation of these radicals so5 and so4 were secondarily derived from initially generated so3 radicals eqs 5 9 chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 evident signals corresponding to dmpo so3 adduct a h β 16 0 g a n 14 7 g rao et al 2019 were detected in the esr spectra of f s system moreover consistent with the above results the peak intensities of dmpo so3 adduct decreased with the addition of freely dissolved eps indicating the so3 participated in the eps decomposition 5 h s o 3 f e 2 1 4 o 2 f e s o 3 1 2 h 2 o 6 f e s o 3 f e 2 s o 3 7 s o 3 o 2 s o 5 8 s o 5 s o 5 2 s o 4 o 2 9 s o 4 h s o 3 s o 4 2 s o 3 h 3 4 2 parameters determination for the coordination binding of fe eps in addition to the sulfite activation by fe ii fe ii iii was reported to chelate with eps and subsequently caused the eps coagulation in sludge li et al 2012 fe iii had higher correlation binding ability than fe ii since the generation of fe iii was accelerated by sulfite making sulfite vital to the complexation of fe eps li et al 2012 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to study the fe complexation to freely dissolved eps in presence and absence of sulfite fig 6 from fig s3 a b in the eem spectra there was mainly one fluorescence peak ex em 280 320 nm chen et al 2003 according to the results of parafac analysis associated to tryptophan proteins tpn in eps this suggested that tpn in freely dissolved eps acted as a natural fluorescence which played a crucial role in fe eps complexation to quantify the complexation of fe ii with eps in absence presence of na2so3 eqs 3 and 4 were used to calculate the complexation parameters as shown in table 1 and fig 6 the high coefficients of determination r2 indicated the accuracy of the equations to describe the complexation process for sludge eps the ksv value of sulfite supplied system was higher than that of sulfite free system indicating a stronger complexation ability of fe ii to eps in presence of sulfite shou et al 2018 chen 2012 demonstrated that fe ii was easily transformed into fe iii via sulfite auto oxidation process accompanied by so4 radical generation this contributed to intensive fe eps complexations in addition the index f f0 represented the residual fluorescence of eps sample when all the available fe ii was bound a larger value of this index indicated a lower influence of fe ii on fluorescence quenching from table 1 the fe ii had higher fluorescence quenching effect on tryptophan in eps with the presence of sulfite as compared to sulfite free system this re confirmed that sulfite enhanced the binding strength of fe ii to eps due to the accelerated generation of fe iii the c n and o valence electron changes of eps complexes were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to determine the predominant groups in eps during the coordination process as illustrated in fig 7 the c 1s signal was resolved into three major component peaks the peaks at 284 79 286 26 and 287 99 ev of c1s attribute to the c c h c o n and c o o c o respectively which are commonly found in carboxylic esters carbonyls amides or acetals ding et al 2018 he et al 2020 the o 1s peaks at 531 68 and 532 73 corresponded to c o of the terminal carboxyl in tryptophan proteins polysaccharides of eps and c o c c o h in glycoside shou et al 2018 respectively the n 1s peak at 399 8 ev correlated to nitrogen in amines or amides si fig s4 as there was no protonated peaks observed after f s treatment yuan et al 2010 in spectra of o 1s the oxygen signal of c o was divided into 532 2 ev and 531 2 ev after fe ii sulfite treatment meanwhile the fitting area proportions of c oh 56 11 and c o 43 90 decreased to 34 41 and 36 11 after treated by fe ii sulfite si table s3 in addition in the ftir spectra si fig s6 two bands at 1384 and 1143 cm 1 in pristine eps associated to the stretching bands of c o c o groups in carboxylates and deformation vibration of c o groups in carboxyl lyng et al 2007 were weakened after the fe ii sulfite treatment these changes were associated with carboxyl groups in tpn moreover there was no humics in freely eps si fig s3 thus the carboxyl groups from humics can be excluded from the metal fe coordination sites these results re confirmed that fe ii coordination at the carboxyl terminal was more likely related to tryptophan proteins in eps rather than humics of freely dissolved eps were responsible for fe ii iii eps coordination 3 4 3 heterogeneities of fe ii binding with eps chromophores studies by differential absorption spectra although the above results revealed that tpn in eps coordinated with fe the binding sites of tpn to fe in presence of sulfite still need to be further confirmed thus the eps complexation compounds were analyzed using uv and ftir spectroscopy the intensity of zero order absorption spectra of eps complexes increased along the wavelength range before 275 nm and then decreased fig 8 a meanwhile the variations in spectral intensities in response to the addition of fe ii were inconspicuous which was similar to those of other type metal ions such as pb2 and cu2 xu et al 2018 to heighten the spectral resolution the differential spectra of eps complexes samples were normalized to show the binding heterogeneity between fe and eps compared to zero order absorption spectra of eps complexes it was found that the normalized differential spectra of eps complexes exhibited two predominant types of fe eps chromophores with peaks at 215 and 280 nm respectively fig 8 b both the intensities of those two peaks 215 nm and 280 nm increased consistently with fe ii addition and with a greater extent for the peak at 215 nm compared to that at 280 nm in order to examine the sensitivity of bands peaks of epss associated with fe ii binding the log transformed spectra of eps complexes were also shown in fig 8 c as expected the log transformed spectra of eps complexes exhibited a linear decline along with the increasing wavelength and more regions e g 202 245 nm 245 410 nm and 410 nm with different slopes were also observed indicating a heterogeneous distribution of active sites and functional groups on eps for fe ii binding accordingly to get more information on the heterogeneous sites the differential log transformed spectra of eps complexes were calculated as shown in fig 8 d combined with log transformed spectra the derived differential log transformed spectral indicated that the major bands peaks attributed to fe ii binding were at 241 nm 241 302 nm and 413 nm respectively these results suggested that addition of fe ii during f s oxidation induced a slight intensity enhancement for bands peaks indicating the sensitive heterogeneity of chromophores in eps for fe ii binding 3 4 4 two dimensional ftir and uv ftir hetero spectral correlation spectroscopy the coordination site in freely dissolved eps complexes was also determined through the variations of the functionalities with ftir spectra si fig s6 the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir was used to assign the ftir bands and examine their covariations as shown in fig 9 a the synchronous map obtained from the ftir spectra of fe eps complexes showed four predominant auto peaks at 1380 cm 1 coo of amino acid 1458 cm 1 c oh of protein 1150 cm 1 and 1040 cm 1 c o c and c oh of polysaccharides wang et al 2018 yin et al 2015 xie et al 2020 respectively the color of the peak at 1380 cm 1 was darker than others indicating that the band intensities of 1380 cm 1 coo of amino acid changed the greatest under the given fe ii concentration in addition four cross peaks at λx λy 1620 1380 cm 1 λx λy 1380 1150 cm 1 λx λy 1458 1380 cm 1 and λx λy 1150 1380 cm 1 were positive marked in red and two cross peaks at λx λy 1380 1040 cm 1 and λx λy 1040 1380 cm 1 were negative marked in blue in the asynchronous map cross peaks at λx λy 1620 1380 cm 1 λx λy 1380 1150 cm 1 and λx λy 1150 1380 cm 1 were positively correlated while cross peak at λx λy 1150 1380 cm 1 λx λy 1458 1380 cm 1 and λx λy 1380 1040 cm 1 were negatively correlated according to the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the sequence of the binding affinities of bands with fe ii followed the order 1620 1380 1040 1458 1150 950 cm 1 the results indicated that the binding of organic ligands in eps with fe ii in presence of sulfite followed the sequence amide i region of protein c o carboxyl c o and coo of amino acid polysaccharides c o c c oh groups thus amide i region of protein c o contributed more to eps fe ii complexation in the presence of sulfite furthermore the 2d hetero spectral uv ftir 2d uv ftir correlation analysis was assigned to test the co variations of uv and ftir bands from fig 9 c in synchronous map the uv peak at 201 nm aromatic protein was positively correlated with the ftir bands 1750 1620 1380 and 1150 cm 1 but negatively related to the band at 1050 cm 1 in addition the uv peaks at 260 nm tryptophan protein was negatively correlated with the bands at 1750 1620 1380 and 1150 cm 1 and positively correlated with ftir bands at 1050 cm 1 as depicted in si fig s5 a b uv cross peak at λx λy 201 260 nm was negatively correlated in synchronous map with the combination of asynchronous map based on the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the binding sequence of these functional groups was as follows 1750 cm 1 1620 cm 1 1380 cm 1 260 nm 201 nm 1150 cm 1 these results also demonstrated that amide i region of protein c o groups in eps gave the fastest response during the f s treatment followed by coo of amino acid eps260 and ceps201 then polysaccharides c o c and c oh which were in consistence with the results of 2d ftir cos and uv spectra overall the amide i region of protein c o groups contributed the most to the correlation binding of fe ii eps during the sludge treatment by fe ii sulfite to gain more insights into the protein structure and the change of amide i region in eps with f s treatment the protein secondary structures were isolated and investigated according to hlady and buijs 1996 fig s7 table s2 displayed the content of isolated β sheets α helices 3 turn helices antiparallel β sheets and aggregated strands in eps before and after f s treatment there was a decrease in α helices content 18 65 18 19 and an increase in β sheets content 21 87 22 55 of proteins indicating these two groups played an important role in correlation binding of fe ii eps under f s treatment in addition from the amide i region in eps on 2d ftir cos spectra si fig s5 c d in synchronous map si fig s5c there were two predominant auto peaks at 1672 and 1619 cm 1 related to antiparallel β sheets and β sheets of amide i respectively meanwhile the color of 1619 cm 1 was darker than the former indicating the β sheets in amide i changed the greatest during the f s treatment in addition the synchronous map exhibited six positive cross peaks at λx λy 1697 1619 cm 1 λx λy 1672 1621 cm 1 λx λy 1621 1670 cm 1 λx λy 1621 1697 cm 1 λx λy 1672 1695 cm 1 and λx λy 1697 1672 cm 1 respectively whereas the asynchronous map showed two positive cross peaks at λx λy 1621 1697 cm 1 and λx λy 1672 1695 cm 1 four negative cross peaks at λx λy 1697 1619 cm 1 λx λy 1672 1621 cm 1 λx λy 1621 1670 cm 1 and λx λy 1697 1672 cm 1 respectively based on the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the changing sequence of the bands in amide i during the treatment was as follows 1619 1621 1672 1670 1695 1697 cm 1 this suggested that bands of 1619 cm 1 associated to β sheets in amide i region changed the fastest during f s treatment which implied that β sheets of the extracellular proteins were more sensitive to fe than the α helices therefore destructing the secondary structure represented by the α helices as evidenced by decreased α helices content of proteins as well as the formed β sheets by the correlation binding between the fe and carbonyl oxygen amide hydrogen might be the key to eliminate the inhibitory effects of extracellular proteins on the bound water removal from was 3 5 comparison of dewatering performance and economic analysis the dewatering performances of related works are listed in table 2 according to the reported studies regarding sludge conditioning technology li et al 2016 hu et al 2018 this work provided an economical option chemical costs involving na2so3 fecl2 4h2o and pam consumption were calculated to be 49 6 usd per ton of ds sludge which were significantly lower than that of fenton reagent and zero valent iron activated persulfate oxidation zep for sludge conditioning furthermore the water content in sludge cake was 76 96 and the tss was 30 8 g l saving considerable cost on transport and disposal expense for sludge 4 conclusions a novel and cost effective method of fe ii sulfite oxidation coupled organic polymer flocculation f s pam for enhancing sludge dewaterability was developed the mechanisms of sludge dewaterability improvement by f s pam process was found to be dominated by f s oxidation and pam re flocculation causing the release of bound water from was during the f s oxidation polysaccharides and proteins were released into the bulk solution via disrupting rigid cell membranes meanwhile the formed fe iii of f s led to re coagulation of decomposed eps through correlation binding process releasing eps bound water in addition the introduced positively charged pam helped re flocculate negative charged components in sludge flocs enhancing the sludge settling and filterability besides so3 acted as transition reactive radicals for so4 production based on the esr studies the so4 oxidizes parent sulfite and leads to favored auto oxidation of sulfite resulting in rapid decomposition of cell walls of eps in addition to this the c o groups in tpn played the leading role to fe eps association binding causing transformation of the secondary structure of proteins especially β sheets and α helices destruction of secondary structure represented by α helices and formed β sheets by the correlation binding between the fe and carbonyl oxygen amide hydrogen eliminated the inhibitory effects of extracellular proteins on bound water removal from was finally the synergistic effect between s f and pam was proven to be beneficial to enhance sludge dewaterability with superior oxidative ability and stronger flocculation capacity on eps this work not only provides an economical method to enhance sludge dewaterability but also presents a guidance for the oxidation coupled flocculation process application in sludge handling declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17379,the bound water in waste activated sludge was is trapped in extracellular polymeric substances eps in the form of gel like structure leading to a great challenge in the sludge deep dewatering traditional flocculation conditioning is unable to destroy eps and ineffective to remove the bound water in was in this study we employed integration of fe ii sulfite oxidation and polyacrylamide flocculation f s pam treatment for removing the bound water and improving sludge dewaterability under aerobic conditions meanwhile the floc microstructure and eps properties were examined to understand the mechanisms of f s pam conditioning f s produced so3 radicals which could decompose the eps in sludge releasing bound water into free water in addition the formed fe iii from f s led to re coagulation of decomposed eps and c o groups of tryptophan played the leading role in fe eps association binding causing transformation of the secondary structure of proteins especially β sheets and α helices then the introduction of pam caused re flocculation of disintegrated sludge flocs enhancing the sludge filterability this work provides a novel and cost effective method for efficient removal of bound water in sludge and subsequence improvement in sludge dewaterability graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge sludge dewaterability fe ii sulfite polyacrylamide extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction nowadays the main method of wastewater treatment involves activated sludge which makes excess sludge containing over 99 wt of water an emerging problem qi et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 sludge dewatering is an effective approach to reduce the volume and costs of subsequence transportation landfilling incineration and handling of sludge xiao et al 2018 however extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge flocs are in the form of gel like structure which can firmly bind with water molecules chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 traditional flocculants are not sufficient to decompose eps structure and convert bound water into free water liu et al 2016a thus numerous pretreatments including acidification and ultrasonication tiehm et al 2001 xiao et al 2016 hydrothermal process wang et al 2017 electro osmosis daneshmand et al 2012 and advanced oxidation processes aops xiao et al 2018 have been developed to destruct the stability of sludge colloid system and release intracellular water among these strategies aops generating various oxidative radicals have been considered for eps decomposition and deep dewatering of sludge xiao et al 2018 hydroxyl radical oh derived from fenton reagent showed potency in destructing eps via disrupting rigid cell membranes liang et al 2015 however h2o2 has some drawbacks since it is explosive unstable and corrosive thus there are some limitations for its transportation and use neyens et al 2004 another strong radical of emerging interest sulfate radical so4 has sparked a lot of attention due to its selective degradation of electron rich recalcitrant substances anipsitakis et al 2004 especially effective in bacterial inactivation wordofa et al 2017 traditional so4 generating process relies on one step activation of peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps anipsitakis et al 2004 in contract sulfite auto catalyzed by transition metals capable of deriving continuous generation of so4 in the presence of oxygen is via intricate sulfite associated radical chain reactions chen et al 2017 in transition metals sulfite systems generated so4 exclusively oxidized parent sulfite without interference of other substances chen et al 2012 neta et al 1977 leading to kinetically favored auto oxidation of sulfite as a result the pool of so4 catalyzes sulfite to re generate so3 for auto oxidation of sulfite achieving better performance in the inactivation of bacteria chen et al 2017 anipsitakis et al 2004 sulfite auto catalyzed by fe ii was reported to inactivate bacteria species via disrupting rigid cell membranes chen et al 2012 xie et al 2019 wang et al 2019 this inspired us to form the hypothesis that the fe ii sulfite f s process might be used to destruct cell walls releasing protein pn and polysaccharide ps meanwhile the in situ generated fe iii from f s could also complex with released pn ps converting the bound water into free water however the mechanism of fe ii catalyzed sulfite oxidation for sludge dewaterability needs to be experimentally confirmed it is widely accepted that extracellular proteins are the major hydrophilic substances in sludge and play a predominant role in sludge dewaterability compared to polysaccharides or humic substances wu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 wu et al 2017 claimed that spatial distribution of hydrophilic functional groups in extracellular proteins during aops was the key for determining the removal of interstitial water from sludge thus the effects of fe ii catalyzed sulfite system on the molecular structure transformation of extracellular proteins in sludge needs to be explored although aops favor the decomposition of eps releasing bound water trapped in eps plenty of colloidal fragments are also discharged hu et al 2018 these colloidal fragments in sludge increase the blockage of micro filtration medium resulting in decreased sludge filterability the chemical flocculation inorganic coagulants and organic polymers is recognized as an efficient approach to promote agglomeration of fine particles in sludge through bridging and electrostatic reactions yan et al 2013 zhao et al 2003 thereby enhancing the sludge filterability and dewaterability therefore the combination of aops and flocculation potentially integrates complementary roles for these two treatments however pam flocculation prior to f s treatment probably causes deterioration of sludge dewaterability due to the unreleased bound water trapped in eps wang et al 2019 ayol et al 2005 further effort is required to optimize the synergism between pre oxidation and flocculation such as the sequence of pre treatment by organic polymer flocculant steps and improvement of pre oxidation configuration in this study we integrated fe ii sulfite oxidation with polyacrylamide flocculation f s pam for waste activated sludge was dewaterability improvement and elucidated the synergism of pre oxidation and flocculation in sludge conditioning the main objectives of this work were 1 to optimize the sludge conditioning process of f s pam for wastewater sludge dewaterability improvement 2 to study interaction between fe ii and eps in presence of sulfite as well as identify the active radicals for eps degradation and 3 to determine the distribution of biopolymers in sludge and the changes in predominant group of eps and extracellular proteins transformation during the f s treatment this study not only provides a novel technology for sludge conditioning but also elucidates the mechanism of sludge conditioning by f s pam process which has important implications for its application in engineering practices 2 experimental section 2 1 waste activated sludge properties waste activated sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in nanjing city china the ratio of volatile suspended solids vss to suspended solids tss in the sludge samples was 51 88 determined according to cai et al 2018 in addition other detailed characteristics of the waste activated sludge are provided in supporting information si table s1 2 2 reagents and materials details of all reagents and materials used in this study are provided in si text s1 2 3 procedures for sludge conditioning the bench scale tests for sludge dewatering and conditioning were conducted in batch mode using flask beakers 1 l under stirring by a hexagonal agitator my3000 6b first 300 ml of raw wastewater sludge was transferred into 1 l flask beakers then conditioned according to the following procedure adding sulfite with 2 min of rapid mixing 250 rpm followed by adding fe ii with 30 min of slowing mixing 150 rpm oxidation period finally adding pam 4 76 mg g tss with 20 min of slowing mixing 150 rpm re flocculation period it should be noted that the molar ratio dosage of sulfite to fe ii is controlled at 0 8 in which fe ii is 1 79 mmol l tss after the conditioning process the sludge was withdrawn for sludge dewaterability determination 2 4 dewaterability assessment of sludge details for specific resistance to filtration srf and capillary suction time cst measurements are provided in si text 2 bound water content was determined using a differential scanning calorimetry analyzer dsc25 ta company u s equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooling system katsiris et al 1987 in brief the sludge sample was first subjected to 20 c the free water in sludge was frozen and then brought back to 10 c at a rate of 2 c min the dsc analytical procedure was performed as detailed in the study of zhang et al 2014 the amount of free water fw was calculated by the area a of the endothermic curve below the baseline which represented the amount of heat required to melt the free water then the bound water wf was calculated by the difference between the known total water content wt and the amount of free water fw content in sludge 1 f w k a 2 w f w t f w w t k a where w t f w and w f are the mass of total water mg free water mg and bound water mg respectively and k is the conversion factor mg mj which is determined by obtaining the thermograms of pure water of known mass and measured curve area 2 5 characterization of sludge flocs properties the physical surface morphology changes of sludge flocs samples were observed through scanning electron microscope sem zeiss at an acceleration voltage of 5 0 kv in addition zeta sizer zs900 malvern instrument ltd was utilized for determining the zeta potential variations of sludge flocs 2 6 eps extraction and analysis in sludge the extracellular polymeric substances eps of sludge was extracted by cation exchange resin cer technique which enabled a high extraction efficiency with little cell lysis and polymer disruption frolund et al 1996 the resin could be removed readily after the extraction process and did not interfere with the subsequent analysis the detailed procedures for eps extraction and measurement of proteins and polysaccharides were provided in si text s3 and si text s4 in addition the spatial distribution of eps including proteins and polysaccharides in sludge flocs under the different treatments was characterized using a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm zeiss lsm 510 instrument meanwhile fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and con a texas red were used for dyeing polysaccharides and proteins in sludge flocs then the dyed sludge samples were observed under 488 nm red color for polysaccharides and 543 nm green color for proteins excitation filter conditions through clsm instrument respectively 2 7 interaction mechanism studies between eps and fe ii in presence of sulfite 2 7 1 complexation parameters determination for fe eps fluorescent chromophores in eps are generally related to tyrosine tryptophan and quinoid structures ai et al 2019 shou et al 2018 in this study there was only one fluorescent peak detected fig s3a which was associated with tryptophan structure in protein like substances chen et al 2003 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 hitachi japan was used to quantitatively explore the metal eps association through fluorescence quenching experiment sheng et al 2013 shou et al 2018 specifically an aqueous fe ii stock solution 24 mmol l was added into 20 ml of dissolved eps solutions 21 84 mg l with desired fe ii concentrations 0 1 5 10 50 100 and 200 μmol l followed by magnetic stirring for 1 h at 300 rpm ph 7 0 0 2 and 25 0 5 c both the fluorescence spectrum and intensity were recorded over an excitation wavelength ex of 200 400 nm 5 nm bandwidth and an emission wavelength em of 220 550 nm 5 nm bandwidth with a scanning speed of 12000 nm min the relationship between the fluorescence intensity and introduced metal fe ii can be described by the following stern volmer equations boaz et al 1950 3 f 0 f 1 k q τ 0 q 1 k s v q 4 l o g f 0 f f l o g k a n l o g q where f0 and f represent the relative fluorescence intensity of chromophore in absence and presence of the quencher metal ion respectively q represents the concentration of quencher metal ion ksv is the stern volmer quenching constant k q is the bimolecular quenching rate constant and τ0 is the average lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of the quencher which is approximately 5 10 9 s shou et al 2018 for the static quenching process the equation 2 can be used to determine the association constant ka and number of bonding sites n bi et al 2004 2 7 2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps characterization of fe eps complexes the fe eps complexes were dried using a freezer drier tf sfd 5 prior to spectroscopic characterization to determine the predominant group of eps in fe eps association binding x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250x thermo fischer u s was performed on the fe eps with a 70 0 ev pass energy for the broad survey scan and a 20 0 ev pass energy for the narrow spectrum survey scan 2 7 3 ftir combined with 2d cos the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of the freeze dried fe eps samples mixed with kbr mass ratio of 1 100 was conducted on a thermo nicolet 6700 spectrometer ftir spectra were recorded in range of 400 4000 cm 1 the two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos is developed by noda 2004 to investigate the binding sequences between dom groups with iron metal in this study the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir with structure sensitive spectral techniques was used to assign the ft ir bands and to verify their covariations noda et al 2004 more specifically the synchronous map was a symmetric spectrum with respect to the diagonal line which denoted the overall susceptibility of corresponding spectral region in contract the asynchronous map reflected the sequential or successive variations of spectral intensities in response to external perturbation xu et al 2018 yan et al 2013b during the f s treatment addition of fe ii acted as the external perturbation to set a metal concentration dependent ftir spectrum for fe complexed eps the obtained ftir spectra of complexed eps were normalized through summed intensities of 400 4000 cm 1 and noise components were removed using principle component analysis then the normalized ftir data matrix was processed with 2d shige software to obtain synchronous and asynchronous maps xu et al 2018 2 8 other analysis the dissolved organic matter in sludge supernatant was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc teledyne tekmar uv254 was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1900 japan to quantify aromatics both toc and uv254 were analyzed after the filtration through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate fiber membrane during the sludge conditioning assays with f s system the reactive radical was trapped with 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo and characterized using electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr jes fa200 jeol ltd instrument detailed procedure for radical determination is provided in si text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of f s oxidation and pam flocculation on sludge dewaterability batch experiments were conducted to compare the sludge dewaterability by pam s f and s f pam from si fig s1 the sludge filterability performed the best when the dosage of na2so3 and fe ii were 1 43 mmol l tss and 1 79 mmol l tss with the pam dosage of 4 76 mg g tss thus the optimal conditions were chosen for the subsequent sludge conditioning as illustrated in fig 1 a the specific resistance to filtration srf was reduced from 7 71 0 16 to 2 34 0 93 1 89 0 03 and 1 57 0 41 1012 m kg respectively at the same time the cst values after the pam s f and s f pam treatments decreased from 131 60 4 90 to 84 15 4 65 92 35 3 85 and 54 82 3 38 s respectively indicating the enhancement of sludge filterability after these treatments it should be noted that the sludge filterability and srf by f s pam was better than pam or s f treatment alone with the pre oxidation of s f the sludge flocs were broken down into fine floccules and the contact proportion of negatively charged functional groups on eps to pam increased resulting in higher flocculation performance of sludge particles and ultimately a decrease in cst and srf values liu et al 2010 wong et al 2015 therefore decreased cst and srf indicated that f s pam treatment was capable of improving sludge filterability while still maintaining good performance in sludge dewaterability in addition from fig 1 b bound water content in sludge significantly decreased from 3 54 0 23 to 3 15 0 26 1 15 0 31 and 0 73 0 15 g g per dry solids ds after pam f s and f s pam treatments respectively the sludge cake moisture also decreased from 89 2 3 7 wt to 86 9 3 9 wt 81 6 6 6 wt and 79 7 2 6 wt after pam f s and f s pam treatments respectively the 9 5 wt moisture reduction by f s pam was higher than that of pam 2 3 wt or f s 5 3 wt treatment alone these results indicated that f s pretreatment was more effective in removal of bound water than single flocculation conditioning pam could interact with eps through charge neutralization and bridging reactions but the bound water was still enclosed in sludge floc and hard to be released yan et al 2013 by pam treatment alone on the other hand the pre oxidation of eps by f s forced the release of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps and accompanied by the release of bound water as evidenced by the decreased pn ps concentrations in bound eps from 306 29 mg l and 28 64 mg l to 131 29 mg l and 17 48 mg l respectively si fig s2 besides the in situ formed fe iii accelerated the separation of pn ps from water via complexation causing reduction of bound water content li et al 2012 meanwhile the electrostatic interactions between cationic pam and negatively charged component in sludge flocs resulted in the re flocculation of disintegrated sludge flocs therefore f s pam was the most efficient treatment tested converting bound water into free water 3 2 effects of fe ii sulfite oxidation and flocculation on microstructure of sludge floc in order to examine the changes in surface morphology of sludge treated by different reagents the micrographs of sludge were observed through sem fig 3 a d the raw sludge existed in the form of compact blocky structures with organics filling the voids fig 3 a after f s treatment fig 3 c the surface of flocs exhibited a more sparse and porous morphology this indicated that the sludge was disrupted through oxidation effect by f s process however the sludge flocs showed a relatively smoother surface after f s pam treatment fig 3 d this was because that negatively charged eps agglomerated easily with pam via the electrostatic interactions and bridging yan et al 2013 therefore it seems that the porous surface resulted from decomposition of eps releasing ps pn into the bulk solution during f s treatment and released pn ps re coagulated by in situ formed fe iii subsequently the disintegrated sludge flocs were finally agglomerated by pam via electrostatic interactions cai et al 2018 leading to the formation of smoother surface of sludge floc meanwhile the surface of sludge was relatively more porous after f s pam treatment than that of single pam treatment fig 3 b prior to pam flocculation f s pre treatment decomposed eps and caused release of bound water into bulk phase leading to high dispersion of sludge particles then the cracked sludge flocs were easily bridged and re flocculated by pam leading to a more porous structure in addition zeta potential of sludge particles significantly increase from 36 1 1 1 to 11 23 0 48 and 8 66 2 39 mv after f s and f s pam treatments fig 2 a indicating a decrease in net surface charge on sludge flocs sludge particles were negatively charged due to the presence of carboxylate and phosphate groups in eps liao et al 2001 cai et al 2018 with the introduction of fe ii and pam these negatively charged sludge particles were electrically neutralized this in turn reduced solubility and increased aggregation of eps leading to the flocculation of colloidal sludge particles as evidenced by the sludge floc size increased from d50 33 04 0 80 μm to 84 90 1 09 μm 40 22 1 27 μm and 110 59 1 93 μm after treated by pam f s and f s pam respectively this observation revealed f s pretreatment enhanced the sludge flocculation efficiency of pam as evidenced by d50 these results supported the idea that f s pre oxidation and pam flocculation showed a synergistic effect in sludge dewaterability improvement 3 3 eps changes in sludge conditioning with fe ii sulfite oxidation and flocculation 3 3 1 effects of fe ii sulfite oxidation and flocculation on eps to examine the decomposition of eps under different treatments organics of supernatant in treated sludge were also quantified by uv254 for aromatic compounds and toc fig 2 b by comparison there was no significant change in toc and uv254 upon pam treatment while increased concentrations in toc and uv254 were observed after the f s and f s pam treatment moreover fig s2 si displayed the concentrations of pn and ps as the major eps component in supernatant of raw and treated sludge the pn in soluble eps s eps changed from 100 19 mg l to 78 86 11 357 54 28 and 528 43 67 14 mg l after pam f s and f s pam treatments respectively these results confirmed that the f s process decomposed the eps biopolymers and caused the release of bound water trapped in gel like structure although pam flocculation increased d50 of sludge floc the toc and uv254 remained relatively stable indicating that charge neutralization and bridging induced flocculation played more profound role in sludge dewaterability enhancement than decomposition of eps to release bound water in contrast f s treatment resulted in a significant increase in toc and uv254 with a slight decrease in cst as expected the combination of f s pam process provided the optimal sludge dewatering performance compared to either f s treatment or pam flocculation alone typically the decomposition of eps by f s evidenced by toc and uv254 led to greater release of bound water trapped in eps fig 1 b relative to pam alone furthermore the introduction of pam promoted the re flocculation of sludge flocs evidenced by d50 resulting in lower bound water and increased sludge dewaterability 3 3 2 effects of fe ii sulfite oxidation and flocculation on biopolymers distribution in sludge floc as discussed above eps readily undergoes decomposition by f s oxidation releasing pn ps into bulk phase resulting in higher dispersion of sludge flocs thus flocculation of disintegrated sludge flocs by pam was significantly enhanced via charge neutralization and bridging to verify the above assumption the spatial distribution of pn and ps in eps were observed through clsm fig 4 both pn and ps in eps exhibited broken and scattered patterns compared to pristine eps a after the f s treatment c and re flocculated together with the introduction of pam d in addition the flocculation effect of pn ps by pam was stronger in f s system than that of single pam treatment b this was ascribed to the fact that pre oxidative effect of f s caused the release of pn and ps from eps into bulk solution thus increased access of pam to pn and ps subsequently enhanced the sludge flocculation via electrical neutralization and bridging this is in consistence with our assumptions 3 4 mechanisms of f s pre treatment for sludge dewaterability improvement 3 4 1 role of oxidative radicals in f s system in controlled experiments with f s system the release of pn ps from bound eps into bulk solution by f s oxidation was observed resulting in an increase of toc concentration in supernatant of sludge fig 2 b auto oxidation of sulfite catalyzed by fe ii has been widely recognized through radical chain reactions that involved several intermediate short lived radicals including so3 so5 and so4 zhou et al 2018 during generation of these radicals so5 and so4 were secondarily derived from initially generated so3 radicals eqs 5 9 chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 evident signals corresponding to dmpo so3 adduct a h β 16 0 g a n 14 7 g rao et al 2019 were detected in the esr spectra of f s system moreover consistent with the above results the peak intensities of dmpo so3 adduct decreased with the addition of freely dissolved eps indicating the so3 participated in the eps decomposition 5 h s o 3 f e 2 1 4 o 2 f e s o 3 1 2 h 2 o 6 f e s o 3 f e 2 s o 3 7 s o 3 o 2 s o 5 8 s o 5 s o 5 2 s o 4 o 2 9 s o 4 h s o 3 s o 4 2 s o 3 h 3 4 2 parameters determination for the coordination binding of fe eps in addition to the sulfite activation by fe ii fe ii iii was reported to chelate with eps and subsequently caused the eps coagulation in sludge li et al 2012 fe iii had higher correlation binding ability than fe ii since the generation of fe iii was accelerated by sulfite making sulfite vital to the complexation of fe eps li et al 2012 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to study the fe complexation to freely dissolved eps in presence and absence of sulfite fig 6 from fig s3 a b in the eem spectra there was mainly one fluorescence peak ex em 280 320 nm chen et al 2003 according to the results of parafac analysis associated to tryptophan proteins tpn in eps this suggested that tpn in freely dissolved eps acted as a natural fluorescence which played a crucial role in fe eps complexation to quantify the complexation of fe ii with eps in absence presence of na2so3 eqs 3 and 4 were used to calculate the complexation parameters as shown in table 1 and fig 6 the high coefficients of determination r2 indicated the accuracy of the equations to describe the complexation process for sludge eps the ksv value of sulfite supplied system was higher than that of sulfite free system indicating a stronger complexation ability of fe ii to eps in presence of sulfite shou et al 2018 chen 2012 demonstrated that fe ii was easily transformed into fe iii via sulfite auto oxidation process accompanied by so4 radical generation this contributed to intensive fe eps complexations in addition the index f f0 represented the residual fluorescence of eps sample when all the available fe ii was bound a larger value of this index indicated a lower influence of fe ii on fluorescence quenching from table 1 the fe ii had higher fluorescence quenching effect on tryptophan in eps with the presence of sulfite as compared to sulfite free system this re confirmed that sulfite enhanced the binding strength of fe ii to eps due to the accelerated generation of fe iii the c n and o valence electron changes of eps complexes were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to determine the predominant groups in eps during the coordination process as illustrated in fig 7 the c 1s signal was resolved into three major component peaks the peaks at 284 79 286 26 and 287 99 ev of c1s attribute to the c c h c o n and c o o c o respectively which are commonly found in carboxylic esters carbonyls amides or acetals ding et al 2018 he et al 2020 the o 1s peaks at 531 68 and 532 73 corresponded to c o of the terminal carboxyl in tryptophan proteins polysaccharides of eps and c o c c o h in glycoside shou et al 2018 respectively the n 1s peak at 399 8 ev correlated to nitrogen in amines or amides si fig s4 as there was no protonated peaks observed after f s treatment yuan et al 2010 in spectra of o 1s the oxygen signal of c o was divided into 532 2 ev and 531 2 ev after fe ii sulfite treatment meanwhile the fitting area proportions of c oh 56 11 and c o 43 90 decreased to 34 41 and 36 11 after treated by fe ii sulfite si table s3 in addition in the ftir spectra si fig s6 two bands at 1384 and 1143 cm 1 in pristine eps associated to the stretching bands of c o c o groups in carboxylates and deformation vibration of c o groups in carboxyl lyng et al 2007 were weakened after the fe ii sulfite treatment these changes were associated with carboxyl groups in tpn moreover there was no humics in freely eps si fig s3 thus the carboxyl groups from humics can be excluded from the metal fe coordination sites these results re confirmed that fe ii coordination at the carboxyl terminal was more likely related to tryptophan proteins in eps rather than humics of freely dissolved eps were responsible for fe ii iii eps coordination 3 4 3 heterogeneities of fe ii binding with eps chromophores studies by differential absorption spectra although the above results revealed that tpn in eps coordinated with fe the binding sites of tpn to fe in presence of sulfite still need to be further confirmed thus the eps complexation compounds were analyzed using uv and ftir spectroscopy the intensity of zero order absorption spectra of eps complexes increased along the wavelength range before 275 nm and then decreased fig 8 a meanwhile the variations in spectral intensities in response to the addition of fe ii were inconspicuous which was similar to those of other type metal ions such as pb2 and cu2 xu et al 2018 to heighten the spectral resolution the differential spectra of eps complexes samples were normalized to show the binding heterogeneity between fe and eps compared to zero order absorption spectra of eps complexes it was found that the normalized differential spectra of eps complexes exhibited two predominant types of fe eps chromophores with peaks at 215 and 280 nm respectively fig 8 b both the intensities of those two peaks 215 nm and 280 nm increased consistently with fe ii addition and with a greater extent for the peak at 215 nm compared to that at 280 nm in order to examine the sensitivity of bands peaks of epss associated with fe ii binding the log transformed spectra of eps complexes were also shown in fig 8 c as expected the log transformed spectra of eps complexes exhibited a linear decline along with the increasing wavelength and more regions e g 202 245 nm 245 410 nm and 410 nm with different slopes were also observed indicating a heterogeneous distribution of active sites and functional groups on eps for fe ii binding accordingly to get more information on the heterogeneous sites the differential log transformed spectra of eps complexes were calculated as shown in fig 8 d combined with log transformed spectra the derived differential log transformed spectral indicated that the major bands peaks attributed to fe ii binding were at 241 nm 241 302 nm and 413 nm respectively these results suggested that addition of fe ii during f s oxidation induced a slight intensity enhancement for bands peaks indicating the sensitive heterogeneity of chromophores in eps for fe ii binding 3 4 4 two dimensional ftir and uv ftir hetero spectral correlation spectroscopy the coordination site in freely dissolved eps complexes was also determined through the variations of the functionalities with ftir spectra si fig s6 the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir was used to assign the ftir bands and examine their covariations as shown in fig 9 a the synchronous map obtained from the ftir spectra of fe eps complexes showed four predominant auto peaks at 1380 cm 1 coo of amino acid 1458 cm 1 c oh of protein 1150 cm 1 and 1040 cm 1 c o c and c oh of polysaccharides wang et al 2018 yin et al 2015 xie et al 2020 respectively the color of the peak at 1380 cm 1 was darker than others indicating that the band intensities of 1380 cm 1 coo of amino acid changed the greatest under the given fe ii concentration in addition four cross peaks at λx λy 1620 1380 cm 1 λx λy 1380 1150 cm 1 λx λy 1458 1380 cm 1 and λx λy 1150 1380 cm 1 were positive marked in red and two cross peaks at λx λy 1380 1040 cm 1 and λx λy 1040 1380 cm 1 were negative marked in blue in the asynchronous map cross peaks at λx λy 1620 1380 cm 1 λx λy 1380 1150 cm 1 and λx λy 1150 1380 cm 1 were positively correlated while cross peak at λx λy 1150 1380 cm 1 λx λy 1458 1380 cm 1 and λx λy 1380 1040 cm 1 were negatively correlated according to the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the sequence of the binding affinities of bands with fe ii followed the order 1620 1380 1040 1458 1150 950 cm 1 the results indicated that the binding of organic ligands in eps with fe ii in presence of sulfite followed the sequence amide i region of protein c o carboxyl c o and coo of amino acid polysaccharides c o c c oh groups thus amide i region of protein c o contributed more to eps fe ii complexation in the presence of sulfite furthermore the 2d hetero spectral uv ftir 2d uv ftir correlation analysis was assigned to test the co variations of uv and ftir bands from fig 9 c in synchronous map the uv peak at 201 nm aromatic protein was positively correlated with the ftir bands 1750 1620 1380 and 1150 cm 1 but negatively related to the band at 1050 cm 1 in addition the uv peaks at 260 nm tryptophan protein was negatively correlated with the bands at 1750 1620 1380 and 1150 cm 1 and positively correlated with ftir bands at 1050 cm 1 as depicted in si fig s5 a b uv cross peak at λx λy 201 260 nm was negatively correlated in synchronous map with the combination of asynchronous map based on the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the binding sequence of these functional groups was as follows 1750 cm 1 1620 cm 1 1380 cm 1 260 nm 201 nm 1150 cm 1 these results also demonstrated that amide i region of protein c o groups in eps gave the fastest response during the f s treatment followed by coo of amino acid eps260 and ceps201 then polysaccharides c o c and c oh which were in consistence with the results of 2d ftir cos and uv spectra overall the amide i region of protein c o groups contributed the most to the correlation binding of fe ii eps during the sludge treatment by fe ii sulfite to gain more insights into the protein structure and the change of amide i region in eps with f s treatment the protein secondary structures were isolated and investigated according to hlady and buijs 1996 fig s7 table s2 displayed the content of isolated β sheets α helices 3 turn helices antiparallel β sheets and aggregated strands in eps before and after f s treatment there was a decrease in α helices content 18 65 18 19 and an increase in β sheets content 21 87 22 55 of proteins indicating these two groups played an important role in correlation binding of fe ii eps under f s treatment in addition from the amide i region in eps on 2d ftir cos spectra si fig s5 c d in synchronous map si fig s5c there were two predominant auto peaks at 1672 and 1619 cm 1 related to antiparallel β sheets and β sheets of amide i respectively meanwhile the color of 1619 cm 1 was darker than the former indicating the β sheets in amide i changed the greatest during the f s treatment in addition the synchronous map exhibited six positive cross peaks at λx λy 1697 1619 cm 1 λx λy 1672 1621 cm 1 λx λy 1621 1670 cm 1 λx λy 1621 1697 cm 1 λx λy 1672 1695 cm 1 and λx λy 1697 1672 cm 1 respectively whereas the asynchronous map showed two positive cross peaks at λx λy 1621 1697 cm 1 and λx λy 1672 1695 cm 1 four negative cross peaks at λx λy 1697 1619 cm 1 λx λy 1672 1621 cm 1 λx λy 1621 1670 cm 1 and λx λy 1697 1672 cm 1 respectively based on the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2004 the changing sequence of the bands in amide i during the treatment was as follows 1619 1621 1672 1670 1695 1697 cm 1 this suggested that bands of 1619 cm 1 associated to β sheets in amide i region changed the fastest during f s treatment which implied that β sheets of the extracellular proteins were more sensitive to fe than the α helices therefore destructing the secondary structure represented by the α helices as evidenced by decreased α helices content of proteins as well as the formed β sheets by the correlation binding between the fe and carbonyl oxygen amide hydrogen might be the key to eliminate the inhibitory effects of extracellular proteins on the bound water removal from was 3 5 comparison of dewatering performance and economic analysis the dewatering performances of related works are listed in table 2 according to the reported studies regarding sludge conditioning technology li et al 2016 hu et al 2018 this work provided an economical option chemical costs involving na2so3 fecl2 4h2o and pam consumption were calculated to be 49 6 usd per ton of ds sludge which were significantly lower than that of fenton reagent and zero valent iron activated persulfate oxidation zep for sludge conditioning furthermore the water content in sludge cake was 76 96 and the tss was 30 8 g l saving considerable cost on transport and disposal expense for sludge 4 conclusions a novel and cost effective method of fe ii sulfite oxidation coupled organic polymer flocculation f s pam for enhancing sludge dewaterability was developed the mechanisms of sludge dewaterability improvement by f s pam process was found to be dominated by f s oxidation and pam re flocculation causing the release of bound water from was during the f s oxidation polysaccharides and proteins were released into the bulk solution via disrupting rigid cell membranes meanwhile the formed fe iii of f s led to re coagulation of decomposed eps through correlation binding process releasing eps bound water in addition the introduced positively charged pam helped re flocculate negative charged components in sludge flocs enhancing the sludge settling and filterability besides so3 acted as transition reactive radicals for so4 production based on the esr studies the so4 oxidizes parent sulfite and leads to favored auto oxidation of sulfite resulting in rapid decomposition of cell walls of eps in addition to this the c o groups in tpn played the leading role to fe eps association binding causing transformation of the secondary structure of proteins especially β sheets and α helices destruction of secondary structure represented by α helices and formed β sheets by the correlation binding between the fe and carbonyl oxygen amide hydrogen eliminated the inhibitory effects of extracellular proteins on bound water removal from was finally the synergistic effect between s f and pam was proven to be beneficial to enhance sludge dewaterability with superior oxidative ability and stronger flocculation capacity on eps this work not only provides an economical method to enhance sludge dewaterability but also presents a guidance for the oxidation coupled flocculation process application in sludge handling declaration of competing interest the authors declare
