randomized block design rbd with sub plots being irrigated at 100 i100 80 i80 and 60 i60 of the calculated crop water requirements using drip the leaf moisture content was monitored at different soil moisture conditions at early vegetative and full vegetative stages the results showed that the crop water stress index cwsi derived from the mobile phone based thermal images is sensitive to leaf moisture content lmc in i80 and i60 at all vegetative stages the uav derived normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi correlated with lmc at the vegetative and full vegetative stages for all three irrigation treatments in cases where eggplant is irrigated under normal conditions the use of ndvi or osavi at full vegetative stages will be able to predict eggplant yields in cases where eggplant is grown under deficit irrigation cwsi can be used at vegetative or full vegetative stages next to ndvi or osavi depending on available resources

for managing water in irrigated agriculture soil based methods use either manual or computerized soil moisture monitoring technologies enciso et al 2009 zotarelli et al 2011 soulis et al 2015 the use of soil moisture sensors provide point based soil moisture values and are sensitive to installation calibration and location in the field depending on the density of soil moisture sensors one might fail to capture field heterogeneity plant canopy based methods have been recommended in recent years in crop water status monitoring because signs of canopy stress occur much earlier than soil based signs poblete echeverría et al 2017 petrie et al 2019 canopy based methods are categorized into contact and non contact measurements contact methods include the stomatal conductance and water potential measurements using ventilated and pressure chambers among others boyer 1967 goulden and field 1994 examples of non contact methods are infrared thermometers mobile phone based thermal imaging and remote sensing stone et al 2016 reyes gonzález et al 2018 the latter have been recommended due to their ability to indicate the plant physiological condition and leaf moisture content lmc throughout crop growth stages without interference leading to improved irrigation decisions zhang and zhou 2019 depending on the sensor type and resolution remote sensing methods have the capability of indicating spatial variation of plant condition across the field this helps the irrigator to apply water only in stressed zones however accuracy depends on the resolution of the images and the sensor used mobile phone based thermal imaging as part of non contact methods have been adopted due to its ability to indicate variations in canopy temperature within the plant canopy as a result of differences in leaf water content as the leaf water content is related to the plant water availability in the soil the canopy temperature and therefore leaf water content is dependent on the level of watering within the field well watered plants have a high leaf water content resulting into low canopy temperature due to higher levels of transpiration from the plant stomata gusso 2018 as water stress causes stomatal closure there will be a considerable reduction in transpiration leading to an increase in leaf surface temperature dejonge et al 2015 çolak et al 2015 the crop water stress index cwsi a relationship between the canopy temperature for well watered and stressed crops has been used to determine irrigation scheduling gerhards et al 2016 grant et al 2016 the use of mobile phone based thermal imaging has worked well in the computation of crop water stress indices with variation in effectiveness depending on crop type and climatic conditions whilst the method has been found useful at plant level it is labor intensive to capture the heterogeneity in farmer fields remote sensing images from satellites aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles uav provide valuable information for agricultural decision making ballester et al 2019 jorge et al 2019 siegfried et al 2019 among these methods uavs have been recommended in agricultural water management because of its ability to collect high resolution data at low cost without cloud interference alvino and marino 2017 the uavs carry sensors of different types such as visual thermal multispectral or hyperspectral with varying sensitivity depending on the applications multispectral sensors collect information in three to ten broadband reflectance while hyperspectral bands collect information from hundreds of narrow band reflectance badzmierowski et al 2019 zhang and zhou 2019 vegetation indices vi derived by calculating the ratios of two or more spectral bands vary in function of canopy moisture content as different level of plant water status results in different spectral responses for instance well watered plant canopy is characterized by a high reflectance of near infrared nir and low reflectance of red bands genc et al 2013 van beek et al 2013 hence different vegetation indices can be derived to assess plant water status stone et al 2016 and reyes gonzález et al 2018 recommended the use of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in delineating water stressed zones within a corn field likewise studies under turf grass systems recommended the use of ndvi and green to red ratio index gri in the estimation of soil moisture status badzmierowski et al 2019 jorge et al 2019 recommended normalized difference red edge ndre among other vegetation indices due to its capability of detecting water stressed zones in olive trees this is due to the sharp response of the reflectance between the red and nir spectral bands with water stress additionally shi et al 2019 suggested the use of soil adjusted vegetation index savi and ndvi in identifying field spatial variability as they strongly correlate with the cwsi furthermore vegetation indices derived from nir and red spectral bands can be used in crop yield prediction katsoulas et al 2016 kyratzis et al 2017 recommended the use of gndvi and ndvi to predict durum wheat yield subjected under water stress in the mediterranean environment similarly ballester et al 2019 recommended the ndvi in forecasting cotton yield in semi arid environments likewise ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 recommended the combination of the water index wi and ndvi to assess water stress impacts on bell pepper yield furthermore maresma et al 2016 suggested the use of various vegetation indices such as wide dynamic range vegetation index wdrvi for assessing maize yield vegetation indices maps are an alternative to productivity maps to support targeting of agricultural water management interventions veysi et al 2017 the maps convert numerical values of vegetation indices into color scales depicting water stressed zones to support quick evaluations different vegetation indices maps such as ndre gndvi and ndvi have been used due to their capability of mapping the variation of water supply within a field shiratsuchi et al 2011 genc et al 2013 damian et al 2020 so far studies focus predominantly on staple crops such as maize and few measure the interaction between fertilizer application and deficit irrigation rates on crop yield shiratsuchi et al 2011 stone et al 2016 despite the potential of mobile phone based thermal and uav based multispectral vegetation indices in assessing crop water stress in various crops their application for vegetables grown under deficit irrigation is limited little information is found on the ability of vegetation indices to depict crop water stress in vegetables e g african eggplant under drip systems using deficit irrigation in tropical sub humid areas each crop has different spectral response due to differences in climatic conditions leaf structure water stress levels and plant water uptake response functions influencing leaf water composition bellvert et al 2014 establishing uav or mobile phone based thermal imagery assessments to assess irrigation performance for irrigated crops such as african eggplants can support public or private sector extension services for small medium and large scale farming as part of tanzania s economic growth development strategy mandalu and costa 2018 wuyts and kilama 2014 small scale farming is expected to shift to large scale farming as a result of increasing demand of food and raw materials for industrial development management of large scale farms or contract farming of smallholders will require the development of contextually relevant advisory services to enhance yields and water use efficiency therefore this study aimed at investigating the efficacy of using the crop water stress index cwsi and vegetation indices vi in assessing irrigation performance of african eggplant under different irrigation strategies in a tropical sub humid area specifically the study aimed at using mobile phone based thermal imaging and uav derived multispectral imaging to 1 evaluate whether lmc cwsi and vi differ at different irrigation depths throughout cropping stages investigate the sensitivity of the cwsi and vegetation indices to lmc variation among irrigation treatments 3 develop vegetation indices maps to capture spatial and temporal variations in irrigation application and support precision agriculture and 4 assess the applicability of cwsi and vegetation indices to predict crop yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the study was conducted at rudewa watershed in kilosa district within

experiment was conducted using a randomized block design rbd with 3 irrigation application rates 100 i100 80 i80 and 60 i60 of crop water requirements and 3 replicates per treatment fig 2 nitrogen fertilizer was uniformly applied at a rate of 250 kg ha i e 100 for all treatments and was part of a larger study as described in mwinuka et al in press crop water requirements were estimated using cropwat 8 0 software as recommended by fao diku et al 2015 using 15 years of climatic data from ilonga meteorological station the crop actual evapotranspiration etc was estimated using the crop coefficient kc and crop reference evapotranspiration eto the eto was calculated using a fao climwat 2 0 software diku et al 2015 furthermore the estimated daily net irrigation water requirements iwrn and gross irrigation requirements giwr were calculated table 1 the water application and conveyance efficiencies of the system were 94 and 90 which was estimated from the relationship of the dripline discharge and the total volume of water supplied subsequently microclimate data were used to fine tune daily water requirement through an automatic weather station installed adjacent to the experimental plot within the two cropping seasons june to october of 2017 and 2018 the average rainfall effective rainfall and temperature for the study site were recorded see figs 3 and 4 the effective rainfall was estimated by usda scs method as described by patwardhan et al 1990 but found too low to be significantly contributing to the crop water balance irrigation water was applied through non pressurized drip lines the irrigation application was regulated through a water control valve installed in each sub main line irrigation was activated when soil moisture reached the maximum allowable depletion i e 17 volumetric soil moisture content the amount of water irrigated for each treatment was measured using an installed flow meter table 2 2 3 data collection throughout the irrigation season 2 3 1 soil and plant canopy moisture measurements soil sampling was conducted by establishing five sampling quadrants of 5 5 m to represent the field from each quadrant five sampling points were marked where undisturbed soil samples were taken using 100 cm3 metallic cylinders soil samples were taken at a depths 0 20 and 20 40 cm in representative locations at the beginning of the cropping season samples were analysed for field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp using a pressure plate apparatus at a soil matric suction of 30 kpa and 1500 kpa respectively the average volumetric fc and pwp moisture content was 28 and 14 soil moisture was measured from six measuring points in each treatment moisture measurements were conducted using a calibrated dsmm500 soil moisture sensor every 24 h between irrigation the sensor detects soil moisture to a depth of 20 cm moisture content from the plant leaves was taken through the irrigation cycle in all treatments to minimize solar radiation errors caused by evaporation leaves were harvested between 08 00 and 10 00 h the fresh weight wl samples were recorded and dried in the greenhouse to prevent samples from deterioration samples were finally oven dried at 70 c until a constant weight dl was attained leaf dry samples were then determined according to ge et al 2016 as shown in eq 1 1 lwc wl dl wl 100 2 3 2 determining of the crop water stress index using mobile phone based thermal imaging canopy temperature was collected by a flir camera flirone camera p n 435 0003 01 00 connected to samsung galaxy s5 smartphone the flirone camera captures both thermal and visible spectrum the sensor has a thermal resolution of 240 320 pixels and a temperature sensitivity of 0 1 c its scene temperature ranges between 20 and 120 c and operates at a temperature range of 0 35 c additionally an emissivity of 0 98 was used a common emissivity value when estimating canopy temperature of horticultural crops chen 2015 gerhards et al 2016 xue and su 2017 thermal images were acquired between 12 00 and 14 00 h from six monitoring plants in each plot throughout the season as mentioned by grant et al 2016 thermal images were acquired throughout the irrigation cycle all subsequent days after irrigation so that to record the canopy temperature at different levels of soil moisture flirone and flir tools computer software p n 435 0003 01 00 were used to process thermal images the canopy temperature for instance sp1 to sp8 in fig 5 for water stressed treatments were higher as compared to non stressed canopy with values ranging between 29 7 c to 32 c and 24 2 c to 25 8 c respectively fig 5a and b the crop water stress index cwsi was calculated from the relationship of canopy temperature tc artificial wet reference temperature tw and dry reference temperature td according to levy et al 2013 baluja et al 2012 petrie et al 2019 as shown by eq 2 2 cwsi tc tw td tw the canopy temperature for each treatment was estimated from the temperature images acquired by a flirone camera the average pure canopy temperature tc was obtained by eliminating the soil background surface using the thermal fusion and box tool within the flir tools computer software version 5 9 16284 1001 reference artificial wet temperature tw was estimated using the manual aspirated psychrometer psychron 15691 yonah et al 2018 the canopy dry reference temperature td was simulated by covering the leaf by petroleum jelly to prevent it from transpiration a condition of non transpiring canopy poblete echeverría et al 2017 jones et al 2002 2 4 determining vegetation indices using uav derived multi spectral bands 2 4 1 uav images acquisition images were acquired using a multispec4c sensor attached to the fixed wings uav ebeetm drone a sensefly sa cheseaux lausanne switzerland the fields were georeferenced using a global positioning system gps the points were then recorded in a csv file format and processed using qgis 2 18 to produce a kml file the kml files were imported in the emotion 3 computer software for the creation of flight plans the multispec4c sensor had four spectral bands green red red edge and near infrared the corresponding wavelengths for the respective spectral band was 550 nm 660 nm 735 nm and 790 nm the sensor was set at 1 2 megapixel providing a full resolution of 12 cm pixel with a lateral and longitudinal overlap of 70 and 65 the images were taken between 12 00 and 13 30 h to minimize the effects of shadow using a uav flown at an average altitude of 115 m above elevation data aed radiometric calibration of the sensor was conducted before each flight using a calibration board 2 4 2 uav images processing and computation of vegetation indices production of digital surface model dsm orthomosaic maps from multispectral images was conducted using the sensefly pix4d software the processed orthomosaic maps were trimmed to the field level using the extraction clipper application in the qgis 2 18 software a geometric correction process image to image registration was conducted to ensure that images for each of the treatments corresponded to the same location throughout the irrigation cycle dave et al 2015 images in different spectral bands were extracted using a python script and used to compute different vegetation indices through raster and rgdal packages in r software version 3 6 1 table 3 soil background effect were corrected by setting a vegetation index threshold value which separates bare soil surface from vegetation naji 2018 the decision of the threshold values to use was considered after studying the values of vegetation indices from the bare soil and the soil with vegetation cover the choice of vegetation indices was based on their capability to capture variations in the canopy leaf water content katsoulas et al 2016 stone et al 2016 jorge et al 2019 and were limited to four spectral bands green g red r near infrared nir and red edge re available in multispec4c sensor table 3 2 5 data analysis and statistics the sensitivity of cwsi and other vegetation indices vi to lmc in different irrigation depths at various cropping stages was assessed using the analysis of variance anova test cwsi and vi which showed a significant difference among the different irrigation treatments p 0 05 were selected and their correlation with lmc was explored the analyses were performed using r software version 3 6 1 vegetation indices maps were developed to assess spatial variation in plant water status within the different drip treatments the image mosaic was processed using the rgdal and raster packages for evaluating the vector spatial data in the respective bands through rstudio version 3 6 1 software the plot function was applied to generate vegetation indices maps yield prediction was conducted by developing a linear regression model between the vegetation indices with the first season yields the second season yields were used to test the accuracy of the model by developing a regression relationship of the predicted and observed yields the root mean square error rmse was then calculated to show the yield prediction error of vegetation indices at different treatments zhao et al 2020 yield prediction was conducted through ggplot2 and ggpubr packages under rstudio version 3 6 1 software the vegetation indices with the coefficient of determination greater than 0 5 was considered sensitive in forecasting the end of the season yields 3 results 3 1 the response of the lmc cwsi and vi to irrigation treatment the lwc cwsi and vegetation indices responded differently at different irrigation rates within the irrigation cycle table 4 the lmc was significantly different in all treatments at early vegetative and full vegetative stages p 0 001 similar results were obtained for cwsi except at highest irrigation rates i100 during the vegetative and full vegetative stages from all the vi measured the gndvi responded well at i80 during the vegetative stage p 0 001 but not for other irrigation treatments or in other stages the ndvi and osavi were able to pick up differences in lmc across all water treatments during the vegetative and full vegetative stages in contrast the evi2 tdvi and ndre had a weak response to irrigation applied across all cropping stages 3 2 the sensitivity of cwsi and vi to lmc in different irrigation treatments the cwsi and vi responded differently to lmc at all three crop development stages at i100 the correlation of ndvi and osavi with lmc was 0 5 and 0 51 during the vegetative stage and 0 52 and 0 54 during the full vegetative stage respectively fig 6 for i80 the correlation between cwsi and lmc was 0 58 at early crop stage fig 7 during the vegetative stage the correlation with lmc was 0 54 and 0 5 for the ndvi and osavi at full vegetative stage the cwsi ndvi and osavi correlation with lmc was 0 52 0 57 and 0 54 respectively at 60 of irrigation depth the cwsi ndvi and osavi during the vegetative stage were 0 81 0 68 and 0 69 fig 8 this reduced slightly during the full vegetative stages of crop development other vegetation indices responded well in some occasions figures not shown for example the gndvi responded well to leaf moisture content to i80 r2 0 52 p 0 0006 at the vegetative stage the grvi responded well in detecting the lmc r2 0 63 p 8 3 10 5 at i60 during the full vegetative stage of crop development on the other hand savi had a weak response in all development stages despite the occurrence of significant differences among treatments 3 3 mapping of vegetation indices for spatial field water status assessments as mentioned in the previous sections both the ndvi and the osavi outperformed the other selected vi in assessing lmc changes as a result of the irrigation treatment hence ndvi and osavi were used to assess the in field spatial variation and the difference in irrigation treatment at the vegetative stage 40 days after transplanting the ndvi and osavi ranged between 0 3 to 0 62 and 0 32 to 0 6 respectively with most of negative values representing areas with bare soils fig 9 areas where water stress occurred and influenced crop performance typically ranged between 0 2 0 35 and 0 2 0 32 differences in these vegetation indices were caused by different irrigation treatments applied within the field and uniformity issues among certain drip lines during the full vegetative stages 60 days after planting the ndvi was in the range of 0 3 to 0 74 and osavi in the range of 0 35 to 0 72 fig 10 water stressed areas influencing crop performance typically ranged between 0 3 and 0 4 for both ndvi and osavi 3 4 yield prediction using cwsi and vegetation indices the average fruit yields for i100 i80 and i60 were 63 t ha 51 1 t ha and 43 1 t ha and differed significantly among the three treatments p 0 001 the results showed that the i80 treatment resulted in a higher water use efficiency and was defined as an optimum irrigation strategy under water limiting conditions see details in mwinuka et al in press the cwsi for the i80 treatment at vegetative and full vegetative stages was 0 44 0 14 and 0 39 0 08 respectively table 6 the corresponding ndvi and osavi was 0 44 0 2 and 0 53 0 1 at the full vegetative stage the cwsi ndvi and osavi was 0 39 0 08 0 58 0 08 and 0 58 0 08 respectively the indices for i100 and i60 are indicated in table 6 the ability to predict yield at vegetative and full vegetative stages depended on the index used table 5 at the vegetative stage the use of cwsi enabled the prediction of eggplant yields in the i60 treatment r2 0 53 predicting eggplant yields using cwsi was possible using data in either the vegetative or the full vegetative stage in the i80 treatment as plants were not stressed under i100 the use of cwsi did not result in a good prediction model at the full vegetative stage yield prediction could be derived for i80 or i60 using either cwsi i80 r2 0 55 i60 r2 0 76 ndvi i80 r2 0 76 i60 r2 0 56 or osavi i80 r2 0 71 i60 r2 0 59 table 5 the established regression models were validated using the eggplant yields from the second season the performance of the cwsi ndvi and osavi based yield prediction models varied amongst irrigation treatments and depended on the crop stage table 6 except for i100 osavi based prediction models seemed to result in a slightly lower rmse compared to those using ndvi furthermore for ndvi and osavi based predictions rmse improved when using data from the full vegetative stage for i80 the use of the ndvi r2 0 87 rmse 2 77 t ha and the odvi r2 0 86 rmse 2 77 t ha at the full vegetative stage performed better than cwsi r2 0 78 rmse 3 93 t ha for i60 at the vegetative stage the yield predictions using cwsi r2 0 62 rmse 2 9 t ha outperformed those derived using ndvi r2 0 63 rmse 3 58 t ha and osavi r2 0 65 rmse 3 45 t ha table 6 whilst at the full vegetative stage using osavi r2 0 57 rmse 2 57 t ha resulted in slightly better yield predictions compared to cwsi r2 0 6 rmse 3 32 t ha and ndvi r2 0 54 rmse 2 15 t ha table 6 4 discussion the leaf moisture content lmc crop water stress index cwsi and vegetation indices vi differed significantly at different irrigation regimes the cwsi was significantly different to i80 and i60 water regimes within the irrigation cycle these differences were caused by a significant rise of temperature within the plant canopy as the canopy moisture content decreases dejonge et al 2015 çolak et al 2015 prashar and jones 2014 furthermore the highest canopy temperature was observed in the treatments leading to increased levels of water stress i e i60 resulting in high correlation of cwsi to lmc within the irrigation cycle insignificant differences occurred at i100 was due to high accumulation of leaf moisture within the plant canopy and hence low variation of leaf temperature gusso 2018 other vegetation indices had a different response to varying plant canopy moisture content at early crop development all vegetation indices were not significantly different this is due to soil background interference as most of the reflectance was observed from the soil surface ballester et al 2019 at vegetative and full vegetative cropping stages various vegetation indices responded differently due to a difference in spectral response to the plant canopy the ndvi and osavi differed significantly within the vegetative and full vegetative stages in all irrigation regimes the grvi and savi was sensitive only for some irrigation regimes this indicates that the nir spectral response was more sensitive to the variation of canopy temperature as compared to the green band peng et al 2013 badzmierowski et al 2019 reported a good response of ndvi to distinguish lmc across the field of turfgrass on the contrary the evi2 tdvi and ndre had a weak capability of differentiating leaf moisture content the failure of ndre is due to the weak response of the red edge spectral band to variations in the leaf moisture content this is contrary to the study conducted in irrigated maize fields siegfried et al 2019 where the ndre was capable of distinguishing differences in plant water stress this is because maize was sensitive to the red edge reflectance due to its leaf greying with water stress resulting in a detectable signal by the sensor siegfried et al 2019 moreover the spatial variation as a result of irrigation treatment and inter drip line uniformity was reflected in the ndvi and osavi based vi maps the variation of the plant condition within the field as a result of the different levels of water application resulted in a different color scales for instance non water stressed plants resulted in high ndvi and therefore green color whilst the water stressed plants in the i60 had lower values and a yellowish color also veysi et al 2017 recommended the use of indices maps for spatial and temporal management of irrigation water in sugarcane production by distinguishing areas with high medium and low water stress within the whole cropping season more studies have shown the opportunity of using vegetation indices in mapping water deficiency in irrigated fields genc et al 2013 stone et al 2016 damian et al 2020 the application of this technology in african eggplant production is anticipated to boost yields increase water use efficiency but also reduce production cost through improved targeting of water and fertilizer application the reflection of the plant physiological status during the vegetative stages as a result of water application was reflected in eggplant yields hence those indices which showed sensitivity to the lmc were able to predict eggplant yields the cwsi as a stress indicator was able to better predict yields at 60 using the vegetative stage this is likely due to the fact that the water stress in the vegetative stage correlated better with declines in yield than those observed in the full vegetative stage for 80 the water stress indicator in the full vegetative stage were found to be better yield predictors the ndvi and osavi performed well in predicting yield at i100 as well as under water stressed conditions due to the high capability of detecting plant water stress responsible for yield declines siegfried et al 2019 also observed a good correlation of osavi with maize yields at different soil moisture levels similarly ballester et al 2019 recommended the use of ndvi as good predictors of lint yield as compared to others likewise ranjan et al 2019 recommended the application of ndvi r 0 62 tdvi r 0 61 gndvi r 0 54 savi r 0 62 and osavi r 0 62 to predict the pinto bean yields the variation in the best performance of these indices depends on leaf size and plant mechanisms responsible for the adaptation to water stress as this results in differences in canopy spectral reflectances in concordance to the lmc indices therefore have different capabilities in predicting yields under deficit irrigation using drip 5 conclusion variation of leaf moisture content at different levels of irrigation enables canopy water stress assessments it is important to understand not only the predictive ability of each of the vi but also its relation to the translation of water stress into plant physiology and crop yield which differs among crops soil and climate conditions this study compared various vegetation indices and cwsi to assess irrigation performance and detect water stress in african eggplant under deficit irrigation as plant water stress results in increased canopy temperature cwsi correlates well with lmc and can be used to predict yields under deficit irrigation the response of vegetation indices derived from a uav multispectral sensor to lmc varied depending on the spectral bands combined the soil interference and the cropping stage used for example during the early stages of the crop vegetation indices responded poorly to lmc changes due to soil background reflectance interference ndvi and osavi were the two best performing vi correlating well with lmc changes and predicting yields as affected by deficit irrigation under drip systems in cases were eggplant is irrigated under normal conditions the use of ndvi or osavi at full vegetative stages will be able to predict eggplant yields in cases were eggplant is grown under deficit irrigation cwsi can be used at vegetative or full vegetative stages next to ndvi or osavi depending on available resources funding this

differences in leaf water content as the leaf water content is related to the plant water availability in the soil the canopy temperature and therefore leaf water content is dependent on the level of watering within the field well watered plants have a high leaf water content resulting into low canopy temperature due to higher levels of transpiration from the plant stomata gusso 2018 as water stress causes stomatal closure there will be a considerable reduction in transpiration leading to an increase in leaf surface temperature dejonge et al 2015 çolak et al 2015 the crop water stress index cwsi a relationship between the canopy temperature for well watered and stressed crops has been used to determine irrigation scheduling gerhards et al 2016 grant et al 2016 the use of mobile phone based thermal imaging has worked well in the computation of crop water stress indices with variation in effectiveness depending on crop type and climatic conditions whilst the method has been found useful at plant level it is labor intensive to capture the heterogeneity in farmer fields remote sensing images from satellites aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles uav provide valuable information for agricultural decision making ballester et al 2019 jorge et al 2019 siegfried et al 2019 among these methods uavs have been recommended in agricultural water management because of its ability to collect high resolution data at low cost without cloud interference alvino and marino 2017 the uavs carry sensors of different types such as visual thermal multispectral or hyperspectral with varying sensitivity depending on the applications multispectral sensors collect information in three to ten broadband reflectance while hyperspectral bands collect information from hundreds of narrow band reflectance badzmierowski et al 2019 zhang and zhou 2019 vegetation indices vi derived by calculating the ratios of two or more spectral bands vary in function of canopy moisture content as different level of plant water status results in different spectral responses for instance well watered plant canopy is characterized by a high reflectance of near infrared nir and low reflectance of red bands genc et al 2013 van beek et al 2013 hence different vegetation indices can be derived to assess plant water status stone et al 2016 and reyes gonzález et al 2018 recommended the use of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in delineating water stressed zones within a corn field likewise studies under turf grass systems recommended the use of ndvi and green to red ratio index gri in the estimation of soil moisture status badzmierowski et al 2019 jorge et al 2019 recommended normalized difference red edge ndre among other vegetation indices due to its capability of detecting water stressed zones in olive trees this is due to the sharp response of the reflectance between the red and nir spectral bands with water stress additionally shi et al 2019 suggested the use of soil adjusted vegetation index savi and ndvi in identifying field spatial variability as they strongly correlate with the cwsi furthermore vegetation indices derived from nir and red spectral bands can be used in crop yield prediction katsoulas et al 2016 kyratzis et al 2017 recommended the use of gndvi and ndvi to predict durum wheat yield subjected under water stress in the mediterranean environment similarly ballester et al 2019 recommended the ndvi in forecasting cotton yield in semi arid environments likewise ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 recommended the combination of the water index wi and ndvi to assess water stress impacts on bell pepper yield furthermore maresma et al 2016 suggested the use of various vegetation indices such as wide dynamic range vegetation index wdrvi for assessing maize yield vegetation indices maps are an alternative to productivity maps to support targeting of agricultural water management interventions veysi et al 2017 the maps convert numerical values of vegetation indices into color scales depicting water stressed zones to support quick evaluations different vegetation indices maps such as ndre gndvi and ndvi have been used due to their capability of mapping the variation of water supply within a field shiratsuchi et al 2011 genc et al 2013 damian et al 2020 so far studies focus predominantly on staple crops such as maize and few measure the interaction between fertilizer application and deficit irrigation rates on crop yield shiratsuchi et al 2011 stone et al 2016 despite the potential of mobile phone based thermal and uav based multispectral vegetation indices in assessing crop water stress in various crops their application for vegetables grown under deficit irrigation is limited little information is found on the ability of vegetation indices to depict crop water stress in vegetables e g african eggplant under drip systems using deficit irrigation in tropical sub humid areas each crop has different spectral response due to differences in climatic conditions leaf structure water stress levels and plant water uptake response functions influencing leaf water composition bellvert et al 2014 establishing uav or mobile phone based thermal imagery assessments to assess irrigation performance for irrigated crops such as african eggplants can support public or private sector extension services for small medium and large scale farming as part of tanzania s economic growth development strategy mandalu and costa 2018 wuyts and kilama 2014 small scale farming is expected to shift to large scale farming as a result of increasing demand of food and raw materials for industrial development management of large scale farms or contract farming of smallholders will require the development of contextually relevant advisory services to enhance yields and water use efficiency therefore this study aimed at investigating the efficacy of using the crop water stress index cwsi and vegetation indices vi in assessing irrigation performance of african eggplant under different irrigation strategies in a tropical sub humid area specifically the study aimed at using mobile phone based thermal imaging and uav derived multispectral imaging to 1 evaluate whether lmc cwsi and vi differ at different irrigation depths throughout cropping stages investigate the sensitivity of the cwsi and vegetation indices to lmc variation among irrigation treatments 3 develop vegetation indices maps to capture spatial and temporal variations in irrigation application and support precision agriculture and 4 assess the applicability of cwsi and vegetation indices to predict crop yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the study was conducted at rudewa watershed in kilosa district within

experiment was conducted using a randomized block design rbd with 3 irrigation application rates 100 i100 80 i80 and 60 i60 of crop water requirements and 3 replicates per treatment fig 2 nitrogen fertilizer was uniformly applied at a rate of 250 kg ha i e 100 for all treatments and was part of a larger study as described in mwinuka et al in press crop water requirements were estimated using cropwat 8 0 software as recommended by fao diku et al 2015 using 15 years of climatic data from ilonga meteorological station the crop actual evapotranspiration etc was estimated using the crop coefficient kc and crop reference evapotranspiration eto the eto was calculated using a fao climwat 2 0 software diku et al 2015 furthermore the estimated daily net irrigation water requirements iwrn and gross irrigation requirements giwr were calculated table 1 the water application and conveyance efficiencies of the system were 94 and 90 which was estimated from the relationship of the dripline discharge and the total volume of water supplied subsequently microclimate data were used to fine tune daily water requirement through an automatic weather station installed adjacent to the experimental plot within the two cropping seasons june to october of 2017 and 2018 the average rainfall effective rainfall and temperature for the study site were recorded see figs 3 and 4 the effective rainfall was estimated by usda scs method as described by patwardhan et al 1990 but found too low to be significantly contributing to the crop water balance irrigation water was applied through non pressurized drip lines the irrigation application was regulated through a water control valve installed in each sub main line irrigation was activated when soil moisture reached the maximum allowable depletion i e 17 volumetric soil moisture content the amount of water irrigated for each treatment was measured using an installed flow meter table 2 2 3 data collection throughout the irrigation season 2 3 1 soil and plant canopy moisture measurements soil sampling was conducted by establishing five sampling quadrants of 5 5 m to represent the field from each quadrant five sampling points were marked where undisturbed soil samples were taken using 100 cm3 metallic cylinders soil samples were taken at a depths 0 20 and 20 40 cm in representative locations at the beginning of the cropping season samples were analysed for field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp using a pressure plate apparatus at a soil matric suction of 30 kpa and 1500 kpa respectively the average volumetric fc and pwp moisture content was 28 and 14 soil moisture was measured from six measuring points in each treatment moisture measurements were conducted using a calibrated dsmm500 soil moisture sensor every 24 h between irrigation the sensor detects soil moisture to a depth of 20 cm moisture content from the plant leaves was taken through the irrigation cycle in all treatments to minimize solar radiation errors caused by evaporation leaves were harvested between 08 00 and 10 00 h the fresh weight wl samples were recorded and dried in the greenhouse to prevent samples from deterioration samples were finally oven dried at 70 c until a constant weight dl was attained leaf dry samples were then determined according to ge et al 2016 as shown in eq 1 1 lwc wl dl wl 100 2 3 2 determining of the crop water stress index using mobile phone based thermal imaging canopy temperature was collected by a flir camera flirone camera p n 435 0003 01 00 connected to samsung galaxy s5 smartphone the flirone camera captures both thermal and visible spectrum the sensor has a thermal resolution of 240 320 pixels and a temperature sensitivity of 0 1 c its scene temperature ranges between 20 and 120 c and operates at a temperature range of 0 35 c additionally an emissivity of 0 98 was used a common emissivity value when estimating canopy temperature of horticultural crops chen 2015 gerhards et al 2016 xue and su 2017 thermal images were acquired between 12 00 and 14 00 h from six monitoring plants in each plot throughout the season as mentioned by grant et al 2016 thermal images were acquired throughout the irrigation cycle all subsequent days after irrigation so that to record the canopy temperature at different levels of soil moisture flirone and flir tools computer software p n 435 0003 01 00 were used to process thermal images the canopy temperature for instance sp1 to sp8 in fig 5 for water stressed treatments were higher as compared to non stressed canopy with values ranging between 29 7 c to 32 c and 24 2 c to 25 8 c respectively fig 5a and b the crop water stress index cwsi was calculated from the relationship of canopy temperature tc artificial wet reference temperature tw and dry reference temperature td according to levy et al 2013 baluja et al 2012 petrie et al 2019 as shown by eq 2 2 cwsi tc tw td tw the canopy temperature for each treatment was estimated from the temperature images acquired by a flirone camera the average pure canopy temperature tc was obtained by eliminating the soil background surface using the thermal fusion and box tool within the flir tools computer software version 5 9 16284 1001 reference artificial wet temperature tw was estimated using the manual aspirated psychrometer psychron 15691 yonah et al 2018 the canopy dry reference temperature td was simulated by covering the leaf by petroleum jelly to prevent it from transpiration a condition of non transpiring canopy poblete echeverría et al 2017 jones et al 2002 2 4 determining vegetation indices using uav derived multi spectral bands 2 4 1 uav images acquisition images were acquired using a multispec4c sensor attached to the fixed wings uav ebeetm drone a sensefly sa cheseaux lausanne switzerland the fields were georeferenced using a global positioning system gps the points were then recorded in a csv file format and processed using qgis 2 18 to produce a kml file the kml files were imported in the emotion 3 computer software for the creation of flight plans the multispec4c sensor had four spectral bands green red red edge and near infrared the corresponding wavelengths for the respective spectral band was 550 nm 660 nm 735 nm and 790 nm the sensor was set at 1 2 megapixel providing a full resolution of 12 cm pixel with a lateral and longitudinal overlap of 70 and 65 the images were taken between 12 00 and 13 30 h to minimize the effects of shadow using a uav flown at an average altitude of 115 m above elevation data aed radiometric calibration of the sensor was conducted before each flight using a calibration board 2 4 2 uav images processing and computation of vegetation indices production of digital surface model dsm orthomosaic maps from multispectral images was conducted using the sensefly pix4d software the processed orthomosaic maps were trimmed to the field level using the extraction clipper application in the qgis 2 18 software a geometric correction process image to image registration was conducted to ensure that images for each of the treatments corresponded to the same location throughout the irrigation cycle dave et al 2015 images in different spectral bands were extracted using a python script and used to compute different vegetation indices through raster and rgdal packages in r software version 3 6 1 table 3 soil background effect were corrected by setting a vegetation index threshold value which separates bare soil surface from vegetation naji 2018 the decision of the threshold values to use was considered after studying the values of vegetation indices from the bare soil and the soil with vegetation cover the choice of vegetation indices was based on their capability to capture variations in the canopy leaf water content katsoulas et al 2016 stone et al 2016 jorge et al 2019 and were limited to four spectral bands green g red r near infrared nir and red edge re available in multispec4c sensor table 3 2 5 data analysis and statistics the sensitivity of cwsi and other vegetation indices vi to lmc in different irrigation depths at various cropping stages was assessed using the analysis of variance anova test cwsi and vi which showed a significant difference among the different irrigation treatments p 0 05 were selected and their correlation with lmc was explored the analyses were performed using r software version 3 6 1 vegetation indices maps were developed to assess spatial variation in plant water status within the different drip treatments the image mosaic was processed using the rgdal and raster packages for evaluating the vector spatial data in the respective bands through rstudio version 3 6 1 software the plot function was applied to generate vegetation indices maps yield prediction was conducted by developing a linear regression model between the vegetation indices with the first season yields the second season yields were used to test the accuracy of the model by developing a regression relationship of the predicted and observed yields the root mean square error rmse was then calculated to show the yield prediction error of vegetation indices at different treatments zhao et al 2020 yield prediction was conducted through ggplot2 and ggpubr packages under rstudio version 3 6 1 software the vegetation indices with the coefficient of determination greater than 0 5 was considered sensitive in forecasting the end of the season yields 3 results 3 1 the response of the lmc cwsi and vi to irrigation treatment the lwc cwsi and vegetation indices responded differently at different irrigation rates within the irrigation cycle table 4 the lmc was significantly different in all treatments at early vegetative and full vegetative stages p 0 001 similar results were obtained for cwsi except at highest irrigation rates i100 during the vegetative and full vegetative stages from all the vi measured the gndvi responded well at i80 during the vegetative stage p 0 001 but not for other irrigation treatments or in other stages the ndvi and osavi were able to pick up differences in lmc across all water treatments during the vegetative and full vegetative stages in contrast the evi2 tdvi and ndre had a weak response to irrigation applied across all cropping stages 3 2 the sensitivity of cwsi and vi to lmc in different irrigation treatments the cwsi and vi responded differently to lmc at all three crop development stages at i100 the correlation of ndvi and osavi with lmc was 0 5 and 0 51 during the vegetative stage and 0 52 and 0 54 during the full vegetative stage respectively fig 6 for i80 the correlation between cwsi and lmc was 0 58 at early crop stage fig 7 during the vegetative stage the correlation with lmc was 0 54 and 0 5 for the ndvi and osavi at full vegetative stage the cwsi ndvi and osavi correlation with lmc was 0 52 0 57 and 0 54 respectively at 60 of irrigation depth the cwsi ndvi and osavi during the vegetative stage were 0 81 0 68 and 0 69 fig 8 this reduced slightly during the full vegetative stages of crop development other vegetation indices responded well in some occasions figures not shown for example the gndvi responded well to leaf moisture content to i80 r2 0 52 p 0 0006 at the vegetative stage the grvi responded well in detecting the lmc r2 0 63 p 8 3 10 5 at i60 during the full vegetative stage of crop development on the other hand savi had a weak response in all development stages despite the occurrence of significant differences among treatments 3 3 mapping of vegetation indices for spatial field water status assessments as mentioned in the previous sections both the ndvi and the osavi outperformed the other selected vi in assessing lmc changes as a result of the irrigation treatment hence ndvi and osavi were used to assess the in field spatial variation and the difference in irrigation treatment at the vegetative stage 40 days after transplanting the ndvi and osavi ranged between 0 3 to 0 62 and 0 32 to 0 6 respectively with most of negative values representing areas with bare soils fig 9 areas where water stress occurred and influenced crop performance typically ranged between 0 2 0 35 and 0 2 0 32 differences in these vegetation indices were caused by different irrigation treatments applied within the field and uniformity issues among certain drip lines during the full vegetative stages 60 days after planting the ndvi was in the range of 0 3 to 0 74 and osavi in the range of 0 35 to 0 72 fig 10 water stressed areas influencing crop performance typically ranged between 0 3 and 0 4 for both ndvi and osavi 3 4 yield prediction using cwsi and vegetation indices the average fruit yields for i100 i80 and i60 were 63 t ha 51 1 t ha and 43 1 t ha and differed significantly among the three treatments p 0 001 the results showed that the i80 treatment resulted in a higher water use efficiency and was defined as an optimum irrigation strategy under water limiting conditions see details in mwinuka et al in press the cwsi for the i80 treatment at vegetative and full vegetative stages was 0 44 0 14 and 0 39 0 08 respectively table 6 the corresponding ndvi and osavi was 0 44 0 2 and 0 53 0 1 at the full vegetative stage the cwsi ndvi and osavi was 0 39 0 08 0 58 0 08 and 0 58 0 08 respectively the indices for i100 and i60 are indicated in table 6 the ability to predict yield at vegetative and full vegetative stages depended on the index used table 5 at the vegetative stage the use of cwsi enabled the prediction of eggplant yields in the i60 treatment r2 0 53 predicting eggplant yields using cwsi was possible using data in either the vegetative or the full vegetative stage in the i80 treatment as plants were not stressed under i100 the use of cwsi did not result in a good prediction model at the full vegetative stage yield prediction could be derived for i80 or i60 using either cwsi i80 r2 0 55 i60 r2 0 76 ndvi i80 r2 0 76 i60 r2 0 56 or osavi i80 r2 0 71 i60 r2 0 59 table 5 the established regression models were validated using the eggplant yields from the second season the performance of the cwsi ndvi and osavi based yield prediction models varied amongst irrigation treatments and depended on the crop stage table 6 except for i100 osavi based prediction models seemed to result in a slightly lower rmse compared to those using ndvi furthermore for ndvi and osavi based predictions rmse improved when using data from the full vegetative stage for i80 the use of the ndvi r2 0 87 rmse 2 77 t ha and the odvi r2 0 86 rmse 2 77 t ha at the full vegetative stage performed better than cwsi r2 0 78 rmse 3 93 t ha for i60 at the vegetative stage the yield predictions using cwsi r2 0 62 rmse 2 9 t ha outperformed those derived using ndvi r2 0 63 rmse 3 58 t ha and osavi r2 0 65 rmse 3 45 t ha table 6 whilst at the full vegetative stage using osavi r2 0 57 rmse 2 57 t ha resulted in slightly better yield predictions compared to cwsi r2 0 6 rmse 3 32 t ha and ndvi r2 0 54 rmse 2 15 t ha table 6 4 discussion the leaf moisture content lmc crop water stress index cwsi and vegetation indices vi differed significantly at different irrigation regimes the cwsi was significantly different to i80 and i60 water regimes within the irrigation cycle these differences were caused by a significant rise of temperature within the plant canopy as the canopy moisture content decreases dejonge et al 2015 çolak et al 2015 prashar and jones 2014 furthermore the highest canopy temperature was observed in the treatments leading to increased levels of water stress i e i60 resulting in high correlation of cwsi to lmc within the irrigation cycle insignificant differences occurred at i100 was due to high accumulation of leaf moisture within the plant canopy and hence low variation of leaf temperature gusso 2018 other vegetation indices had a different response to varying plant canopy moisture content at early crop development all vegetation indices were not significantly different this is due to soil background interference as most of the reflectance was observed from the soil surface ballester et al 2019 at vegetative and full vegetative cropping stages various vegetation indices responded differently due to a difference in spectral response to the plant canopy the ndvi and osavi differed significantly within the vegetative and full vegetative stages in all irrigation regimes the grvi and savi was sensitive only for some irrigation regimes this indicates that the nir spectral response was more sensitive to the variation of canopy temperature as compared to the green band peng et al 2013 badzmierowski et al 2019 reported a good response of ndvi to distinguish lmc across the field of turfgrass on the contrary the evi2 tdvi and ndre had a weak capability of differentiating leaf moisture content the failure of ndre is due to the weak response of the red edge spectral band to variations in the leaf moisture content this is contrary to the study conducted in irrigated maize fields siegfried et al 2019 where the ndre was capable of distinguishing differences in plant water stress this is because maize was sensitive to the red edge reflectance due to its leaf greying with water stress resulting in a detectable signal by the sensor siegfried et al 2019 moreover the spatial variation as a result of irrigation treatment and inter drip line uniformity was reflected in the ndvi and osavi based vi maps the variation of the plant condition within the field as a result of the different levels of water application resulted in a different color scales for instance non water stressed plants resulted in high ndvi and therefore green color whilst the water stressed plants in the i60 had lower values and a yellowish color also veysi et al 2017 recommended the use of indices maps for spatial and temporal management of irrigation water in sugarcane production by distinguishing areas with high medium and low water stress within the whole cropping season more studies have shown the opportunity of using vegetation indices in mapping water deficiency in irrigated fields genc et al 2013 stone et al 2016 damian et al 2020 the application of this technology in african eggplant production is anticipated to boost yields increase water use efficiency but also reduce production cost through improved targeting of water and fertilizer application the reflection of the plant physiological status during the vegetative stages as a result of water application was reflected in eggplant yields hence those indices which showed sensitivity to the lmc were able to predict eggplant yields the cwsi as a stress indicator was able to better predict yields at 60 using the vegetative stage this is likely due to the fact that the water stress in the vegetative stage correlated better with declines in yield than those observed in the full vegetative stage for 80 the water stress indicator in the full vegetative stage were found to be better yield predictors the ndvi and osavi performed well in predicting yield at i100 as well as under water stressed conditions due to the high capability of detecting plant water stress responsible for yield declines siegfried et al 2019 also observed a good correlation of osavi with maize yields at different soil moisture levels similarly ballester et al 2019 recommended the use of ndvi as good predictors of lint yield as compared to others likewise ranjan et al 2019 recommended the application of ndvi r 0 62 tdvi r 0 61 gndvi r 0 54 savi r 0 62 and osavi r 0 62 to predict the pinto bean yields the variation in the best performance of these indices depends on leaf size and plant mechanisms responsible for the adaptation to water stress as this results in differences in canopy spectral reflectances in concordance to the lmc indices therefore have different capabilities in predicting yields under deficit irrigation using drip 5 conclusion variation of leaf moisture content at different levels of irrigation enables canopy water stress assessments it is important to understand not only the predictive ability of each of the vi but also its relation to the translation of water stress into plant physiology and crop yield which differs among crops soil and climate conditions this study compared various vegetation indices and cwsi to assess irrigation performance and detect water stress in african eggplant under deficit irrigation as plant water stress results in increased canopy temperature cwsi correlates well with lmc and can be used to predict yields under deficit irrigation the response of vegetation indices derived from a uav multispectral sensor to lmc varied depending on the spectral bands combined the soil interference and the cropping stage used for example during the early stages of the crop vegetation indices responded poorly to lmc changes due to soil background reflectance interference ndvi and osavi were the two best performing vi correlating well with lmc changes and predicting yields as affected by deficit irrigation under drip systems in cases were eggplant is irrigated under normal conditions the use of ndvi or osavi at full vegetative stages will be able to predict eggplant yields in cases were eggplant is grown under deficit irrigation cwsi can be used at vegetative or full vegetative stages next to ndvi or osavi depending on available resources funding this

for metropolitan areas in the state to enhance urban water use efficiency keep landscape plants alive under continued drought and water restrictions and guarantee the long term sustainability of water resources turfgrasses provide functional and recreational benefits to society and the environment and are also considered to be an essential part of the landscape and ecological systems monteiro 2017 turfgrass has become an important crop in the united states based on the maintained acreage including residential commercial and institutional lawns parks golf courses and athletic fields across the nation residential lawns account for the largest sector of turfgrass typically more than half of household water is used outdoors mainly for irrigating landscapes mayer et al 1999 landscape water use in summer months can account for up to 90 of total municipal water use in the southwestern united states cooley and gleick 2009 a significant portion of the applied water for landscape irrigation could be wasted due to over irrigation inefficient irrigation and broken or poorly maintained irrigation systems a recent case study in three kansas cities revealed that more than 60 of the surveyed homeowners i e over 3000 homeowners did not know how much water their lawns required and more than 70 did not know how much irrigation water they applied bremer et al 2013 substantial advancements in smart urban irrigation technologies over the past two decades mainly due to the development of computer technologies and the application of electromagnetic approaches to estimate soil water content have led to the design implementation and production of affordable smart irrigation controllers cardenas lailhacar et al 2008 more recently the commercialization of wireless sensing technologies and the rapid development of smartphone applications have further enhanced the capability to optimize site specific urban irrigation management mayer et al 1999 studied the water usage of single family homes in twelve north american locations and showed households with automatic irrigation timers used 47 more water outdoors than those not using timers revealing that the automation of urban irrigation systems without proper irrigation management leads to an over application of water the same study reported residential areas with in ground sprinkler irrigation systems used 35 more water outdoors than areas with no in ground systems mayer et al 1999 literature indicates that the implementation of et based smart irrigation controllers provides opportunities to improve water use efficiency in residential areas by estimating the crop water demand and depletion of available soil water by incorporating weather data in irrigation scheduling davis et al 2009 reported on average a 43 reduction in applied water using et based smart controllers compared to a time based treatment in florida other case studies in florida and nevada devitt et al 2008 davis and dukes 2016 reported that the et based controllers typically help conserve water as compared to fixed irrigation rates with no smart technology yet davis and dukes 2016 emphasized it is crucial to evaluate the reliability of the algorithms used by available et based commercial controllers in some states including california texas and florida the use of smart controllers is mandated or incentivized by law yet much of the scientific research on the application and reliability of novel landscape irrigation management approaches including the use of smart controllers has been done in humid regions where the main objective was to avoid over irrigation when rainfall is abundant dukes 2012 currently information is lacking about the efficacy of et based smart irrigation technologies to autonomously implement water conservation and deficit irrigation strategies in inland southern california the main objective of this study in order to develop efficient water conservation strategies in urban settings it is vital to quantify the response of landscape species to watering frequency restriction and deficit irrigation scenarios the crop water production functions cwpfs are statistical models developed for agricultural crops to estimate the response of the crop in terms of relative yield to the varying deficit and full irrigation levels the cwpfs have a wide range of applications including in irrigation scheduling and economic analysis haghverdi et al 2014 since turfgrass response to deficit irrigation is evaluated based on the esthetic values rather than relative yield the term turfgrass water response function twrf is proposed and hereafter used in this study consequently the particular objectives of the study are to i evaluate the response of hybrid bermudagrass to a wide range of irrigation strategies including varying irrigation levels and frequency restrictions ii determine the minimum irrigation requirement to maintain the desired quality level of hybrid bermudagrass iii analyze the dynamics of near surface volumetric soil water content and soil tension under a wide range of irrigation treatments and iv develop a regression based twrf for hybrid bermudagrass irrigation management in inland southern california 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a three year 2017 2019 hybrid bermudagrass irrigation research study was conducted at the university of california riverside agricultural experiment station 33 57 47 0 n 117 20 13 4 w in riverside california the soil at the research site is classified as a well drained low runoff hanford coarse sandy loam websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov with a soil volumetric water content of 22 5 at 33 kpa the climate at riverside is semi arid with a long term average 1986 2016 reference et eto and rainfall of 1471 and 220 mm year 1 respectively 2 2 irrigation trial a total of 36 plots were organized in a factorial complete randomized block design with repeated measures to study the response of hybrid bermudagrass tifgreen cynodon dactylon l pers c transvaalensis burtt davy to 12 irrigation treatments 6 irrigation levels 2 irrigation frequency restrictions replicated three times figs 1 and 2 table 1 summarizes the irrigation treatments plots sized 3 7 m 3 7 m with approximately 60 90 cm border between the plots to eliminate plot edge effect and avoid interference between adjacent plots plot and irrigation system establishment was completed from jan to april 2017 the plots were covered with sod in may 2017 and for several months non limiting water was provided for root development and grass establishment each plot was equipped with a hunter pgv 101g solenoid valve hunter industries inc san marcos ca which controlled and supplied water to 4 quarter circle 102 mm tall pop up sprinkler heads toro o t 12 qp with operating pressure range and flow rate of 276 517 kpa and 0 001 0 545 m3 h 1 respectively a pressure regulator was installed to regulate pressure to approximately 380 kpa upstream of the irrigation plots the sprinklers were equipped with a factory installed pressure compensating disc to regulate the flow and maintain steady water pressure toro co bloomington mn usa we followed standard cultural practices to maintain the plots throughout the experimental periods a triplex mower was set to mow the plots roughly at the height of 13 mm twice per week the fertilizer was applied uniformly to all plots the borders were sprayed regularly with herbicides roundup pro and makaze to control the weeds a weathermatic smartline sl 4800 et based smart irrigation controller connected to an slw5 wireless weather sensor was used to apply irrigation across the treatments telsco industries inc garland tx usa an slfsi t10 flow sensor telsco industries inc garland tx usa in 2017 and 2018 and a badger meter recordall turbo flowmeter badger meter inc milwaukee wi usa in 2019 were connected to the controller for automatic leak detection and water application monitoring the controller utilized on site measured temperature data and latitude based solar radiation estimations to calculate eto using the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 the estimated eto was used by the controller to determine the water deficit each day at midnight based on user defined plant type values for each treatment irrigation application plant type eto for each treatment the plant type value was calculated as the percentage of eto divided by the efficiency of the irrigation system the next irrigation was then applied based on the water deficit accumulated since the last irrigation event for each treatment the controller converts the irrigation application into irrigation runtime values based on the user defined estimated precipitation rate of the irrigation system the controller set back the water deficit to zero when watering was finished while the irrigation frequency restrictions eliminated water applications on specific weekdays to avoid light irrigation the controller was programmed to use the default deficit threshold 3 81 mm as the amount of deficit that must be accumulated before any irrigation occurs plots were irrigated overnight to minimize evaporative losses and wind drift total daily irrigation run time was divided into multiple irrigation applications to avoid a runoff the controller was wired such that all three replications were irrigated at the same time the trials started on july 9 may 1 and june 1 and ended on october 5 september 12 and october 19 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively throughout the experiment all the irrigation applications were automatically calculated and applied by the irrigation controller using plant type and watering cycles values programmed by the research team at the beginning of the experimental period all plots were switched back to the uniform non limiting irrigation for recovery each year after the termination of the experiment 2 3 data collection and analysis two types of soil moisture sensors were used in this study including teros 21 meter group inc pullman wa usa soil tension and sdi 12 digital time domain transmissometer tdt soil water content sensors acclima inc meridian id usa the teros 21 sensor has a measurement range of 9 100000 kpa with a 0 1 kpa resolution and accuracy of 10 of reading 2 kpa from 9 to 100 kpa according to the manufacturer teros 21 measurements represent the matric potential of the soil since its ceramic disc comes into hydraulic equilibrium with the surrounding soil the acclima tdt sensor measures the soil permittivity and subsequently estimates the soil volumetric water content vwc by transmitting an electromagnetic wave along a waveguide rod through the soil and calculating the propagation time the tdt sensors have a measurement range of 0 100 vwc with a 0 06 resolution and 2 vwc typical accuracy as reported by the manufacturer one experimental block a total of twelve plots was instrumented with soil moisture sensors one teros 21 and one tdt sensor were installed roughly at the center of each plot in the active turfgrass rootzone approximately 127 152 mm deep the datasnap acclima inc meridian id usa and em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa loggers were used to collect soil moisture data every 30 min the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi eq 1 was selected as the main parameter to monitor turfgrass response to the imposed irrigation treatments since it provides consistent objective values representing overall turfgrass health and quality bell et al 2009 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir and r are near infrared and red reflectance values respectively the ndvi data were collected using the active light source optical greenseeker handheld sensor trimble inc sunnyvale ca usa the sensor has an oval field of view approximately 51 cm wide at 122 cm above the ground and a measurement range of 0 0 99 the sensor emits brief bursts of red and infrared light and then measures the reflectance value for each band the greenseeker was held at the waist height 1 m and hovered over the center of each plot 3 4 m2 while the trigger remained engaged so the sensor continuously sampled the scanned area and reported the average ndvi the measurements were done under cloud free conditions within two hours of solar noon the ndvi data were collected for a total of 12 times in 2017 july 7 to september 22 18 times in 2018 may 1 2018 to september 24 2018 and 16 times in 2019 june 1 2019 to october 19 2019 plots were also visually assessed and scaled from 1 dead plot to 9 ideal turfgrass following the national turfgrass evaluation program ntep standards shearman and morris 1998 the visual ratings were done 3 18 and 12 times in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the visual score six was considered roughly the minimum acceptable quality for residential areas the ndvi and visual ratings were statistically analyzed using proc glimmix in sas 9 4 software package sas institute inc 2014 each year was independently analyzed for the treatment effects since the irrigation application and duration of the experiment differed across the years for all the response variables irrigation levels irrigation frequencies and the date of data collection were considered the fixed effect while block and its interaction with irrigation levels and irrigation frequencies were the random effects the treatment effects were considered significant at p values 0 05 all graphs were created using the plotting software package veusz 3 2 1 sanders 2018 the daily eto data were collected from a nearby california irrigation management information system cimis station number 44 weather station located approximately 250 m away from the experimental site the cimis uses a revised version of the pruitt doorenbos modified penman equation which utilizes a unique cloud factor value for each station and a wind function developed at the university of california davis to calculate eto using hourly weather data eching 1998 the irrigation runtime data reported by the smart irrigation controller were converted to percent eto values after adjusting for the irrigation treatment and irrigation efficiency and compared against the cimis data we focused on high eto demand months in this study when significant precipitation is highly unlikely repeating the experiment for three years with adequate recovery periods between the years enabled us to test a wide range of irrigation treatments and generate enough data points necessary to develop twrf we used a multiple linear regression with interactions and quadratic terms included to develop hybrid bermudagrass twrf the data for all three years were combined the average ndvi values for treatments were used as the response variable the primary input variables included applied irrigation levels eto irrigation frequency restrictions and cumulative eto since the beginning of the experiment for each particular year all possible regression equations were developed and ranked based on correlation coefficients with 0 7 as the minimum acceptable value using sas 9 4 software sas institute inc cary nc usa then the list of input variables of the top model was finalized using multiple regression diagnostics including the shapiro wilk w statistic to check the normality of the residuals the condition index to monitor the collinearity between the variables and the first and second moment specification test to check the equal residual variance the rmse and correlation coefficient were calculated to evaluate the performance of the twrf 2 rmse 1

irrigation levels into the controller i e irrigation treatment values divided by the irrigation efficiency and applied water throughout the experiment the applied water values are based on the actual average precipitation rate of the system measured by the calibrated flowmeter in 2019 the typical industry practice is to estimate precipitation rate and distribution uniformity of landscape sprinkler irrigation systems using a catch can test we ran two catch can tests in 2017 and 2018 to determine the uniformity and precipitation rate of the irrigation system following the ansi asabe s626 procedure asabe 2016 the tests were conducted on days that were not windy wind speed less than 2 24 m s 1 with 10 min test periods in 2017 the test was repeated four times each time using 120 catch devices in 2018 the test was repeated three times each time using 60 catch devices based on the results of the catch can tests the irrigation efficiency i e the low half distribution uniformity and precipitation rate were set to 0 77 and 25 mm h 1 in 2017 and to 0 81 and 22 mm h 1 in 2018 in 2019 the factory calibrated badger flow meter data were utilized to calculate a precipitation rate of 29 mm h 1 for the system and the irrigation efficiency was set to 0 76 equal to the average flow measured by the flow meter divided by the flow estimated based on 2018 catch can test fig 3 depicts the dynamics of cimis eto values in the years 2017 2018 and 2019 the cumulative eto in the years 2017 2018 and 2019 were 1431 1503 1469 mm respectively the cumulative eto values in the experimental periods were 434 840 and 790 mm in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the average daily eto throughout the experimental periods was 5 6 and 6 mm day 1 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the precipitation was negligible during the trial with only 12 mm 8 mm and 1 mm in years 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively analysis of the cimis data reveals that the smart controller over irrigated the plots by an average of 12 range 10 15 2 range 1 5 and 3 range less than one up to 6 throughout the experimental periods in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the analysis of irrigation runtime data showed that the actual irrigation frequencies for the 3 d wk 1 treatments varied between 2 8 and 3 d wk 1 in 2017 and between 2 7 and 2 9 d wk 1 in 2018 in 2019 3 d wk 1 treatments had an average frequency of 4 3 d wk 1 that is likely because the controller was programmed to irrigate the 3 d wk 1 treatments late at night therefore it had sometimes crossed midnight to complete the irrigation cycles the 5 d wk 1 treatments were irrigated between 2 8 and 4 6 d wk 1 in 2017 no frequency restrictions i e 7 d wk 1 irrigation treatment resulted in 3 8 6 5 d wk 1 irrigation in 2018 and 3 4 5 9 d wk 1 irrigation in 2019 3 2 impact of irrigation treatments ndvi visual rating figs 4 6 depict the dynamics of vr versus ndvi values over time across the irrigation treatments imposed in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 7 shows the relationship between ndvi and vr values to make a reliable comparison only readings that were made on the same date or one day apart in 2018 and 2019 were used the r value of 0 84 indicated a strong correlation between ndvi and vr the fitted linear regression showed an ndvi value of 0 6 as the minimum acceptable quality corresponding to vr of 6 table 3 summarizes the results of the statistical analysis in our study the 2018 and 2017 trials were the longest and shortest among the three years the june 2018 ndvi and vr data were impacted by improper mowing hence were removed from the statistical analysis but are shown in figs 4 6 and 7 8 the ndvi values ranged from 0 50 to 0 88 in 2017 from 0 29 to 0 84 in 2018 and from 0 25 to 0 81 in 2019 in the years 2018 p 0 01 and 2019 p 0 001 the irrigation levels showed a significant effect on ndvi values the irrigation frequency restrictions showed no significant impact on ndvi in any of the years restricting irrigation frequencies slightly decreased the ndvi in 2017 and 2018 but not in 2019 the interaction of irrigation level and frequency showed a significant impact on ndvi in 2019 p 0 05 the 2017 ndvi values followed a similar pattern across the irrigation treatments such that the differences were not statistically significant the 2018 and 2019 ndvi values were lower for more severe deficit irrigation treatments as expected the vr values ranged from 3 to 9 in 2017 from 2 to 9 in 2018 and from 2 to 8 in 2019 the irrigation quantity showed a significant effect on vr values in 2018 p 0 001 and 2019 p 0 001 but not in 2017 the irrigation frequency had a significant impact only in 2019 p 0 05 restricting irrigation frequency caused lower vr values in 2017 and 2018 but not in 2019 the interaction of irrigation level and irrigation frequency showed no significant impact on vr in any of the years fig 8 illustrates the dynamics of ndvi values over time across the irrigation treatments for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 the ndvi values greater than 0 6 are highlighted in green to proximate the acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality for residential areas all 2017 treatments showed a similar response over time a steady decrease in ndvi values occurred as the trial progressed yet treatments stayed in the accepted quality range for almost the entire duration of the experiment the last two ndvi values however were close to or slightly lower than the 0 6 ndvi threshold the lowest 2018 irrigation treatments 50 and 58 eto showed a constant decrease in ndvi over time to values below the 0 6 threshold in early to late july other 2018 treatments illustrated a more gradual reduction in ndvi values over time such that the top three irrigation levels i e 86 79 and 72 eto stayed in the acceptable quality range the lowest 2019 irrigation treatments 39 and 44 eto had significantly lower ndvi values compared to the other treatments all 2019 treatments showed a similar trend of continuous reduction in ndvi values down to 0 4 0 5 levels for the 3 d wk 1 treatments for the 7 d wk 1 treatments the same overall trend was observed but the lowest irrigation treatments i e 39 and 44 eto showed a greater reduction in ndvi values compared to the other treatments all treatments reached ndvi values less than 0 6 threshold toward the end of the 2019 experiment the downward trend in quality over time suggests that most of the 2019 irrigation levels were not sustainable and could only maintain the quality in the acceptable range for a certain period of time fig 9 illustrates the dynamics of visual rating vr values over time across the irrigation treatments for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 the vr greater than 6 are highlighted in green to show the acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality for residential areas the 2017 vr of 103 and 93 eto and 3 d wk 1 treatments reduced over time like the rest of the treatments yet stayed above the minimum acceptable vr of 6 the vrs were slightly higher for the 5 d wk 1 treatments such that only 63 and 54 eto levels fell below the minimum quality level toward the end of the trial the lowest 2018 irrigation treatments 50 and 58 eto had significantly lower vr values compared to that of other treatments the top three 2018 irrigation levels i e 86 79 and 72 eto had vr greater than 6 for most of the experimental period the vr of 50 and 58 eto irrigation levels in both frequencies fell below the minimum threshold towards the end of june 2018 the vr values for all the 2019 treatments gradually diminished over time the 66 eto had the highest vr values and stay above the minimum threshold for most of the experimental period the lowest 2019 irrigation treatments 39 and 44 eto had significantly lower vr values than the other treatments 3 3 soil water dynamics fig 10 shows the dynamics of mean daily soil tension and vwc values across the irrigation treatments in three years of the experiment the 2017 vwc across 5 d wk 1 treatments showed a gradual reduction over time more pronounced for the 74 63 and 54 eto irrigation levels the vwc values of the greatest irrigation level 103 eto however showed a relatively slight fluctuation and an increase toward the end of the experiment a similar trend was observed for the 7 d wk 1 treatments but vwc for the top three irrigation levels 103 93 and 83 eto showed low fluctuations over time overall soil tension followed the same pattern of variation as vwc the soil tension fluctuated around pf 2 2 5 9 8 31 kpa for the irrigation level of 103 eto the soil tension decreased to roughly pf of 4 5 3100 kpa and vwc of 7 5 for the 54 eto irrigation level and 5 d wk 1 frequency for 54 eto and 5 d wk 1 treatment the soil tension and soil moisture content decreased to roughly a pf of 4 4 5 981 3100 kpa and vwc of 10 the top three 2018 irrigation treatments 86 79 and 72 eto showed similar vwc patterns consisting of a gradual reduction till the may june and then slight fluctuations with minimum to no decrease over time the 50 and 58 eto treatments showed a more pronounced reduction in vwc and soil tension levels down to 15 and pf 3 5 4 310 981 kpa for the 3 d wk 1 frequency and 13 and pf 4 4 5 981 3100 kpa for the 7 d wk 1 frequency the soil tension and vwc of 2019 treatments with no frequency restriction 7 d wk 1 showed a sharp reduction at the beginning of the experiment afterward the soil tension and vwc more gradually diminished toward the end of the trial the 3 d wk 1 treatments followed a somewhat similar pattern but with much higher fluctuations except for the 66 eto treatment which showed almost no reduction in vwc over time the noticeable spikes in soil tension values toward the end of the 2019 experiment is attributed to several cloudy days with very low evaporative demands 3 4 turfgrass water response function the twrf developed using the combined three years data is 4 ndvi 0 604 0 110 10 2 ceto 0 521 i 0 407 i 2 0 176 10 6 ceto 2 0 101 10 2 i ceto where i is the relative irrigation level eto percentages and ceto is the cumulative eto mm fig 11 shows the scatter plot of the estimated versus measured ndvi values the slope and shape of the developed twrf clearly illustrate how higher deficit irrigation levels fell below the minimum acceptable quality much quicker than moderate deficit irrigation scenarios the twrf showed high accuracy rmse 0 047 and estimated ndvi values are highly correlated r 0 89 with measured ndvi values 4 discussion 4 1 response of hybrid bermudagrass to deficit irrigation treatments the reported water requirement for warm season grasses varies substantially in the literature wherley et al 2015 developed crop coefficients kc for four warm season turfgrass species including tifway bermudagrass cynodon dactylon l pers c transvaalensis burtt davy using three seasons data collected from non stressed well watered turfgrass in florida they reported fluctuations in kc values over time with roughly 0 8 and 0 3 as kc values for active growth periods periods with greatest pressure deficit and solar radiation and slow growing late fall and dormant winter seasons respectively they showed that a commonly used kc value of 0 6 for warm season turfgrass underestimated actual et during active growth periods a fact that was also observed in our study pinnix and miller 2019 reported kc values of 0 44 0 59 0 10 standard deviation for tifway hybrid bermudagrass in north carolina these values are substantially lower than the values reported for florida by wherley et al 2015 and our results also suggest a much higher irrigation requirement for bermudagrass we attribute the spatial variability in reported warm season turfgrass water requirements among these studies to the environmental conditions a fact that was also mentioned by pinnix and miller 2019 who also emphasized the need for development and use of local kc values for turfgrass we used the fitted twrf to estimate the response of hybrid bermudagrass to multiple levels of irrigation using the long term 34 years eto data obtained from the cimis station located in the study area fig 12 shows the maximum minimum and average ndvi values for six months may to november the results suggest 75 eto as the minimum irrigation application to maintain the minimum acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality in the inland southern california semiarid climate during the high water demand months i e may to november the results suggest that imposing more severe deficit irrigation levels is feasible for shorter periods before the hybrid bermudagrass quality starts to fall below the minimum acceptable quality the hybrid bermudagrass ability to withstand drought varies roughly between 25 and 75 consecutive days for 40 70 eto irrigation levels respectively the results also reveal that the variation in weather conditions have a more pronounced impact on hybrid bermudagrass quality when more severe deficit irrigation scenarios are imposed for example depending on weather conditions i e eto demand it may take twice as long roughly 50 versus 25 days for years with min and max eto demands respectively for a 40 eto irrigation application to result in unacceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality in contrast the variation in weather conditions i e eto demand has a much less noticeable impact on hybrid bermudagrass quality ndvi levels for a 70 eto irrigation application our soil moisture data suggest that hybrid bermudagrass likely maintains acceptable quality when near surface i e 127 152 mm deep soil tension and vwc values fluctuate around pf of 2 5 3 31 98 kpa and vwc of 20 25 respectively for the study site the laboratory measured vwc of soil surface 0 20 cm at soil tensions of 10 and 33 kpa are 30 and 22 respectively further studies are needed to determine whether these values could be used as triggering thresholds for efficient autonomous irrigation management of hybrid bermudagrass using soil moisture based smart irrigation controllers in the region with similar soil type 4 2 autonomous deficit irrigation using weathermatic et based controller davis and dukes 2010 emphasized the importance of manufacturer programmed and user defined settings on proper irrigation scheduling using et based smart controllers our results showed that accurate estimation of irrigation precipitation rate and proper selection of plant factor i e optimum fraction eto irrigation replacement to conserve water while maintaining the minimum acceptable landscape quality are critical factors for reliable autonomous deficit irrigation scheduling by et based controllers in summer months in the arid region of inland southern california the catch can test in our study underestimated the precipitation rate of the irrigation system in 2017 and 2018 this might be related to non uniformity of water applied i e not as much water is being applied in all spots leading to a lower catch can calculated precipitation rate and inherent errors in getting water into catch devices e g water hitting the cans at an angle and splashing out more studies are needed to evaluate the reliability accuracy and uncertainty of the catch can test to estimate the precipitation rate of irrigation systems the accuracy of eto estimations also impacts the performance of the et based smart controllers grabow et al 2013 observed on average about 10 more water applied by et based treatments than by a timer based treatment in north carolina and suggested overestimation of eto by the et controllers as a potential reseason for the overirrigation observed davis et al 2007 reported a 32 overestimation of eto by the weathermatic smart line series controller in florida the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 with on site temperature measurements and latitude based solar radiation estimations showed promising performance in our study on average 5 7 overestimation compared to cimis eto further studies are needed to evaluate the year round performance of the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 in inland southern california as well as other areas with different climate patterns across the state of california according to grabow et al 2013 the ability of smart controllers to take the precipitation into account when scheduling irrigation and impose irrigation frequency restrictions are likely the main factors impacting their potential water saving davis and dukes 2010 also reported that weather conditions and particularly considerable rainfall in rainy summer seasons in florida reduced the irrigation adequacy and scheduling efficiency of et based controllers we focused on high eto demand months in this study when significant precipitation is highly unlikely more studies are needed to evaluate the year round performance of the et based controllers and in particular their accuracy over rainy seasons in inland southern california the common perception is that less frequent watering encourages deep rooting and improves turfgrass quality although we did not measure rooting depth our turfgrass quality assessment did not support the idea of quality improvement due to less frequent irrigation we attribute this at least in part to the low water holding capacity of our soil due to its high sand content no watering restriction with proper identification of minimum deficit threshold to avoid light irrigation applications might be the optimum programming choice during dry months in inland southern california this setting allows the controller to identify the right irrigation frequencies dynamically based on the weather patterns in inland southern california summer periods with heatwaves cause very high eto demand when more frequent irrigation is needed to avoid drought injury at the same time less regular watering is desirable in periodic cool and cloudy days with much smaller eto demand 4 3 turfgrass quality assessment via handheld ndvi versus vr we used ndvi as the main parameter to monitor the response of turfgrass to varying degrees of deficit irrigation due to its reported high correlation with turfgrass tissue moisture content r 0 95 and crop coefficient r 0 90 fenstermaker shaulis et al 1997 overall we also observed a good match between the vr and ndvi data across irrigation treatments and in all three years of the experiment figs 4 6 this finding is in line with the reported results by bell et al 2009 and trenholm et al 1999 bell et al 2009 compared the greenseeker handheld sensor ndvi with vr values and reported the highest correlations for the bermudagrass with r values of 0 79 and 0 85 in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively trenholm et al 1999 studied three hybrid bermudagrass cultivars and reported r values ranging from 0 70 to 0 90 between turfgrass vr and ndvi our results suggest ndvi of 0 6 could be used roughly as the minimum threshold indicating acceptable quality for hybrid bermudagrass turf tifgreen cynodon dactylon l pers c transvaalensis burtt davy in the inland southern california region johnsen et al 2009 evaluated the utility of remote sensing to measure plant stress in creeping bentgrass agrostis stolonifera l fairways they noticed that reflectance measurements could detect water stress up to 2 days before visual observation we did not see early detection of drought injury based on ndvi data as compared to vr which is likely attributed to our weekly data collection protocol compared to the more frequent data collection by johnsen et al 2009 5 conclusion this study focused on developing irrigation water conservation strategies for hybrid bermudagrass a warm season grass underused in residential areas but is relatively drought tolerant and is starting to be used more widely across california the weathermatic et based smart controller used in our study showed acceptable accuracy with on average 5 7 overestimation of eto compared to cimis ndvi and vr values were highly correlated r 0 84 in our study therefore we suggest the application of handheld measured ndvi data for fast and consistent evaluation of overall hybrid bermudagrass turfgrass response to different irrigation regimes the regression based twrf introduced in our study as a statistical model to estimate the response of turfgrass to different irrigation strategies showed a good fit to experimental data our long term analysis using twsf indicated that 75 eto irrigation application could maintain the hybrid bermudagrass quality in the acceptable range for residential areas in dry seasons in inland southern california our results showed that depending on weather patterns eto demands more severe deficit irrigation scenarios could be implemented for shorter periods before the hybrid

10286,a three year 2017 2019 irrigation research trial was conducted to evaluate the response of hybrid bermudagrass to a wide range of irrigation scenarios and assess the efficacy of weathermatic evapotranspiration based et based smart controller for autonomous landscape irrigation management during dry seasons in inland southern california the irrigation levels applied throughout the experiment ranged between 39 and 103 reference et eto and the irrigation frequency restrictions imposed were 3 5 and 7 d wk normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data were continuously collected

and 2019 respectively a long term 34 years analysis using cimis eto data and twrf model revealed 75 eto as the minimum irrigation application to maintain the acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality in the inland southern california semiarid climate for months with high irrigation demand i e may to november the results also showed that hybrid bermudagrass could withstand more severe deficit irrigation treatments for shorter periods depending on eto demand keywords weather based irrigation controller evapotranspiration urban irrigation water conservation ndvi soil moisture sensor turfgrass water response function 1 introduction an ever growing population combined with increasing water scarcity has created urgency for integrated and sustainable water resources management across the state of california climate variability and change likely further impact available water resources vicuna et al 2007 for this reason it is vital to establish novel water conservation strategies for metropolitan areas in the state to enhance urban water use efficiency keep landscape plants alive under continued drought and water restrictions and guarantee the long term sustainability of water resources turfgrasses provide functional and recreational benefits to society and the environment and are also considered to be an essential part of the landscape and ecological systems monteiro 2017 turfgrass has become an important crop in the united states based on the maintained acreage including residential commercial and institutional lawns parks golf courses and athletic fields across the nation residential lawns account for the largest sector of turfgrass typically more than half of household water is used outdoors mainly for irrigating landscapes mayer et al 1999 landscape water use in summer months can account for up to 90 of total municipal water use in the southwestern united states cooley and gleick 2009 a significant portion of the applied water for landscape irrigation could be wasted due to over irrigation inefficient irrigation and broken or poorly maintained irrigation systems a recent case study in three kansas cities revealed that more than 60 of the surveyed homeowners i e over 3000 homeowners did not know how much water their lawns required and more than 70 did not know how much irrigation water they applied bremer et al 2013 substantial advancements in smart urban irrigation technologies over the past two decades mainly due to the development of computer technologies and the application of electromagnetic approaches to estimate soil water content have led to the design implementation and production of affordable smart irrigation controllers cardenas lailhacar et al 2008 more recently the commercialization of wireless sensing technologies and the rapid development of smartphone applications have further enhanced the capability to optimize site specific urban irrigation management mayer et al 1999 studied the water usage of single family homes in twelve north american locations and showed households with automatic irrigation timers used 47 more water outdoors than those not using timers revealing that the automation of urban irrigation systems without proper irrigation management leads to an over application of water the same study reported residential areas with in ground sprinkler irrigation systems used 35 more water outdoors than areas with no in ground systems mayer et al 1999 literature indicates that the implementation of et based smart irrigation controllers provides opportunities to improve water use efficiency in residential areas by estimating the crop water demand and depletion of available soil water by incorporating weather data in irrigation scheduling davis et al 2009 reported on average a 43 reduction in applied water using et based smart controllers compared to a time based treatment in florida other case studies in florida and nevada devitt et al 2008 davis and dukes 2016 reported that the et based controllers typically help conserve water as compared to fixed irrigation rates with no smart technology yet davis and dukes 2016 emphasized it is crucial to evaluate the reliability of the algorithms used by available et based commercial controllers in some states including california texas and florida the use of smart controllers is mandated or incentivized by law yet much of the scientific research on the application and reliability of novel landscape irrigation management approaches including the use of smart controllers has been done in humid regions where the main objective was to avoid over irrigation when rainfall is abundant dukes 2012 currently information is lacking about the efficacy of et based smart irrigation technologies to autonomously implement water conservation and deficit irrigation strategies in inland southern california the main objective of this study in order to develop efficient water conservation strategies in urban settings it is vital to quantify the response of landscape species to watering frequency restriction and deficit irrigation scenarios the crop water production functions cwpfs are statistical models developed for agricultural crops to estimate the response of the crop in terms of relative yield to the varying deficit and full irrigation levels the cwpfs have a wide range of applications including in irrigation scheduling and economic analysis haghverdi et al 2014 since turfgrass response to deficit irrigation is evaluated based on the esthetic values rather than relative yield the term turfgrass water response function twrf is proposed and hereafter used in this study consequently the particular objectives of the study are to i evaluate the response of hybrid bermudagrass to a wide range of irrigation strategies including varying irrigation levels and frequency restrictions ii determine the minimum irrigation requirement to maintain the desired quality level of hybrid bermudagrass iii analyze the dynamics of near surface volumetric soil water content and soil tension under a wide range of irrigation treatments and iv develop a regression based twrf for hybrid bermudagrass irrigation management in inland southern california 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a three year 2017 2019 hybrid bermudagrass irrigation research study was conducted at the university of california riverside agricultural experiment station 33 57 47 0 n 117 20 13 4 w in riverside california the soil at the research site is classified as a well drained low runoff hanford coarse sandy loam websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov with a soil volumetric water content of 22 5 at 33 kpa the climate at riverside is semi arid with a long term average 1986 2016 reference et eto and rainfall of 1471 and 220 mm year 1 respectively 2 2 irrigation trial a total of 36 plots were organized in a factorial complete randomized block design with repeated measures to study the response of hybrid bermudagrass tifgreen cynodon dactylon l pers c transvaalensis burtt davy to 12 irrigation treatments 6 irrigation levels 2 irrigation frequency restrictions replicated three times figs 1 and 2 table 1 summarizes the irrigation treatments plots sized 3 7 m 3 7 m with approximately 60 90 cm border between the plots to eliminate plot edge effect and avoid interference between adjacent plots plot and irrigation system establishment was completed from jan to april 2017 the plots were covered with sod in may 2017 and for several months non limiting water was provided for root development and grass establishment each plot was equipped with a hunter pgv 101g solenoid valve hunter industries inc san marcos ca which controlled and supplied water to 4 quarter circle 102 mm tall pop up sprinkler heads toro o t 12 qp with operating pressure range and flow rate of 276 517 kpa and 0 001 0 545 m3 h 1 respectively a pressure regulator was installed to regulate pressure to approximately 380 kpa upstream of the irrigation plots the sprinklers were equipped with a factory installed pressure compensating disc to regulate the flow and maintain steady water pressure toro co bloomington mn usa we followed standard cultural practices to maintain the plots throughout the experimental periods a triplex mower was set to mow the plots roughly at the height of 13 mm twice per week the fertilizer was applied uniformly to all plots the borders were sprayed regularly with herbicides roundup pro and makaze to control the weeds a weathermatic smartline sl 4800 et based smart irrigation controller connected to an slw5 wireless weather sensor was used to apply irrigation across the treatments telsco industries inc garland tx usa an slfsi t10 flow sensor telsco industries inc garland tx usa in 2017 and 2018 and a badger meter recordall turbo flowmeter badger meter inc milwaukee wi usa in 2019 were connected to the controller for automatic leak detection and water application monitoring the controller utilized on site measured temperature data and latitude based solar radiation estimations to calculate eto using the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 the estimated eto was used by the controller to determine the water deficit each day at midnight based on user defined plant type values for each treatment irrigation application plant type eto for each treatment the plant type value was calculated as the percentage of eto divided by the efficiency of the irrigation system the next irrigation was then applied based on the water deficit accumulated since the last irrigation event for each treatment the controller converts the irrigation application into irrigation runtime values based on the user defined estimated precipitation rate of the irrigation system the controller set back the water deficit to zero when watering was finished while the irrigation frequency restrictions eliminated water applications on specific weekdays to avoid light irrigation the controller was programmed to use the default deficit threshold 3 81 mm as the amount of deficit that must be accumulated before any irrigation occurs plots were irrigated overnight to minimize evaporative losses and wind drift total daily irrigation run time was divided into multiple irrigation applications to avoid a runoff the controller was wired such that all three replications were irrigated at the same time the trials started on july 9 may 1 and june 1 and ended on october 5 september 12 and october 19 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively throughout the experiment all the irrigation applications were automatically calculated and applied by the irrigation controller using plant type and watering cycles values programmed by the research team at the beginning of the experimental period all plots were switched back to the uniform non limiting irrigation for recovery each year after the termination of the experiment 2 3 data collection and analysis two types of soil moisture sensors were used in this study including teros 21 meter group inc pullman wa usa soil tension and sdi 12 digital time domain transmissometer tdt soil water content sensors acclima inc meridian id usa the teros 21 sensor has a measurement range of 9 100000 kpa with a 0 1 kpa resolution and accuracy of 10 of reading 2 kpa from 9 to 100 kpa according to the manufacturer teros 21 measurements represent the matric potential of the soil since its ceramic disc comes into hydraulic equilibrium with the surrounding soil the acclima tdt sensor measures the soil permittivity and subsequently estimates the soil volumetric water content vwc by transmitting an electromagnetic wave along a waveguide rod through the soil and calculating the propagation time the tdt sensors have a measurement range of 0 100 vwc with a 0 06 resolution and 2 vwc typical accuracy as reported by the manufacturer one experimental block a total of twelve plots was instrumented with soil moisture sensors one teros 21 and one tdt sensor were installed roughly at the center of each plot in the active turfgrass rootzone approximately 127 152 mm deep the datasnap acclima inc meridian id usa and em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa loggers were used to collect soil moisture data every 30 min the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi eq 1 was selected as the main parameter to monitor turfgrass response to the imposed irrigation treatments since it provides consistent objective values representing overall turfgrass health and quality bell et al 2009 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir and r are near infrared and red reflectance values respectively the ndvi data were collected using the active light source optical greenseeker handheld sensor trimble inc sunnyvale ca usa the sensor has an oval field of view approximately 51 cm wide at 122 cm above the ground and a measurement range of 0 0 99 the sensor emits brief bursts of red and infrared light and then measures the reflectance value for each band the greenseeker was held at the waist height 1 m and hovered over the center of each plot 3 4 m2 while the trigger remained engaged so the sensor continuously sampled the scanned area and reported the average ndvi the measurements were done under cloud free conditions within two hours of solar noon the ndvi data were collected for a total of 12 times in 2017 july 7 to september 22 18 times in 2018 may 1 2018 to september 24 2018 and 16 times in 2019 june 1 2019 to october 19 2019 plots were also visually assessed and scaled from 1 dead plot to 9 ideal turfgrass following the national turfgrass evaluation program ntep standards shearman and morris 1998 the visual ratings were done 3 18 and 12 times in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the visual score six was considered roughly the minimum acceptable quality for residential areas the ndvi and visual ratings were statistically analyzed using proc glimmix in sas 9 4 software package sas institute inc 2014 each year was independently analyzed for the treatment effects since the irrigation application and duration of the experiment differed across the years for all the response variables irrigation levels irrigation frequencies and the date of data collection were considered the fixed effect while block and its interaction with irrigation levels and irrigation frequencies were the random effects the treatment effects were considered significant at p values 0 05 all graphs were created using the plotting software package veusz 3 2 1 sanders 2018 the daily eto data were collected from a nearby california irrigation management information system cimis station number 44 weather station located approximately 250 m away from the experimental site the cimis uses a revised version of the pruitt doorenbos modified penman equation which utilizes a unique cloud factor value for each station and a wind function developed at the university of california davis to calculate eto using hourly weather data eching 1998 the irrigation runtime data reported by the smart irrigation controller were converted to percent eto values after adjusting for the irrigation treatment and irrigation efficiency and compared against the cimis data we focused on high eto demand months in this study when significant precipitation is highly unlikely repeating the experiment for three years with adequate recovery periods between the years enabled us to test a wide range of irrigation treatments and generate enough data points necessary to develop twrf we used a multiple linear regression with interactions and quadratic terms included to develop hybrid bermudagrass twrf the data for all three years were combined the average ndvi values for treatments were used as the response variable the primary input variables included applied irrigation levels eto irrigation frequency restrictions and cumulative eto since the beginning of the experiment for each particular year all possible regression equations were developed and ranked based on correlation coefficients with 0 7 as the minimum acceptable value using sas 9 4 software sas institute inc cary nc usa then the list of input variables of the top model was finalized using multiple regression diagnostics including the shapiro wilk w statistic to check the normality of the residuals the condition index to monitor the collinearity between the variables and the first and second moment specification test to check the equal residual variance the rmse and correlation coefficient were calculated to evaluate the performance of the twrf 2 rmse 1

irrigation levels into the controller i e irrigation treatment values divided by the irrigation efficiency and applied water throughout the experiment the applied water values are based on the actual average precipitation rate of the system measured by the calibrated flowmeter in 2019 the typical industry practice is to estimate precipitation rate and distribution uniformity of landscape sprinkler irrigation systems using a catch can test we ran two catch can tests in 2017 and 2018 to determine the uniformity and precipitation rate of the irrigation system following the ansi asabe s626 procedure asabe 2016 the tests were conducted on days that were not windy wind speed less than 2 24 m s 1 with 10 min test periods in 2017 the test was repeated four times each time using 120 catch devices in 2018 the test was repeated three times each time using 60 catch devices based on the results of the catch can tests the irrigation efficiency i e the low half distribution uniformity and precipitation rate were set to 0 77 and 25 mm h 1 in 2017 and to 0 81 and 22 mm h 1 in 2018 in 2019 the factory calibrated badger flow meter data were utilized to calculate a precipitation rate of 29 mm h 1 for the system and the irrigation efficiency was set to 0 76 equal to the average flow measured by the flow meter divided by the flow estimated based on 2018 catch can test fig 3 depicts the dynamics of cimis eto values in the years 2017 2018 and 2019 the cumulative eto in the years 2017 2018 and 2019 were 1431 1503 1469 mm respectively the cumulative eto values in the experimental periods were 434 840 and 790 mm in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the average daily eto throughout the experimental periods was 5 6 and 6 mm day 1 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the precipitation was negligible during the trial with only 12 mm 8 mm and 1 mm in years 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively analysis of the cimis data reveals that the smart controller over irrigated the plots by an average of 12 range 10 15 2 range 1 5 and 3 range less than one up to 6 throughout the experimental periods in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the analysis of irrigation runtime data showed that the actual irrigation frequencies for the 3 d wk 1 treatments varied between 2 8 and 3 d wk 1 in 2017 and between 2 7 and 2 9 d wk 1 in 2018 in 2019 3 d wk 1 treatments had an average frequency of 4 3 d wk 1 that is likely because the controller was programmed to irrigate the 3 d wk 1 treatments late at night therefore it had sometimes crossed midnight to complete the irrigation cycles the 5 d wk 1 treatments were irrigated between 2 8 and 4 6 d wk 1 in 2017 no frequency restrictions i e 7 d wk 1 irrigation treatment resulted in 3 8 6 5 d wk 1 irrigation in 2018 and 3 4 5 9 d wk 1 irrigation in 2019 3 2 impact of irrigation treatments ndvi visual rating figs 4 6 depict the dynamics of vr versus ndvi values over time across the irrigation treatments imposed in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 7 shows the relationship between ndvi and vr values to make a reliable comparison only readings that were made on the same date or one day apart in 2018 and 2019 were used the r value of 0 84 indicated a strong correlation between ndvi and vr the fitted linear regression showed an ndvi value of 0 6 as the minimum acceptable quality corresponding to vr of 6 table 3 summarizes the results of the statistical analysis in our study the 2018 and 2017 trials were the longest and shortest among the three years the june 2018 ndvi and vr data were impacted by improper mowing hence were removed from the statistical analysis but are shown in figs 4 6 and 7 8 the ndvi values ranged from 0 50 to 0 88 in 2017 from 0 29 to 0 84 in 2018 and from 0 25 to 0 81 in 2019 in the years 2018 p 0 01 and 2019 p 0 001 the irrigation levels showed a significant effect on ndvi values the irrigation frequency restrictions showed no significant impact on ndvi in any of the years restricting irrigation frequencies slightly decreased the ndvi in 2017 and 2018 but not in 2019 the interaction of irrigation level and frequency showed a significant impact on ndvi in 2019 p 0 05 the 2017 ndvi values followed a similar pattern across the irrigation treatments such that the differences were not statistically significant the 2018 and 2019 ndvi values were lower for more severe deficit irrigation treatments as expected the vr values ranged from 3 to 9 in 2017 from 2 to 9 in 2018 and from 2 to 8 in 2019 the irrigation quantity showed a significant effect on vr values in 2018 p 0 001 and 2019 p 0 001 but not in 2017 the irrigation frequency had a significant impact only in 2019 p 0 05 restricting irrigation frequency caused lower vr values in 2017 and 2018 but not in 2019 the interaction of irrigation level and irrigation frequency showed no significant impact on vr in any of the years fig 8 illustrates the dynamics of ndvi values over time across the irrigation treatments for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 the ndvi values greater than 0 6 are highlighted in green to proximate the acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality for residential areas all 2017 treatments showed a similar response over time a steady decrease in ndvi values occurred as the trial progressed yet treatments stayed in the accepted quality range for almost the entire duration of the experiment the last two ndvi values however were close to or slightly lower than the 0 6 ndvi threshold the lowest 2018 irrigation treatments 50 and 58 eto showed a constant decrease in ndvi over time to values below the 0 6 threshold in early to late july other 2018 treatments illustrated a more gradual reduction in ndvi values over time such that the top three irrigation levels i e 86 79 and 72 eto stayed in the acceptable quality range the lowest 2019 irrigation treatments 39 and 44 eto had significantly lower ndvi values compared to the other treatments all 2019 treatments showed a similar trend of continuous reduction in ndvi values down to 0 4 0 5 levels for the 3 d wk 1 treatments for the 7 d wk 1 treatments the same overall trend was observed but the lowest irrigation treatments i e 39 and 44 eto showed a greater reduction in ndvi values compared to the other treatments all treatments reached ndvi values less than 0 6 threshold toward the end of the 2019 experiment the downward trend in quality over time suggests that most of the 2019 irrigation levels were not sustainable and could only maintain the quality in the acceptable range for a certain period of time fig 9 illustrates the dynamics of visual rating vr values over time across the irrigation treatments for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 the vr greater than 6 are highlighted in green to show the acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality for residential areas the 2017 vr of 103 and 93 eto and 3 d wk 1 treatments reduced over time like the rest of the treatments yet stayed above the minimum acceptable vr of 6 the vrs were slightly higher for the 5 d wk 1 treatments such that only 63 and 54 eto levels fell below the minimum quality level toward the end of the trial the lowest 2018 irrigation treatments 50 and 58 eto had significantly lower vr values compared to that of other treatments the top three 2018 irrigation levels i e 86 79 and 72 eto had vr greater than 6 for most of the experimental period the vr of 50 and 58 eto irrigation levels in both frequencies fell below the minimum threshold towards the end of june 2018 the vr values for all the 2019 treatments gradually diminished over time the 66 eto had the highest vr values and stay above the minimum threshold for most of the experimental period the lowest 2019 irrigation treatments 39 and 44 eto had significantly lower vr values than the other treatments 3 3 soil water dynamics fig 10 shows the dynamics of mean daily soil tension and vwc values across the irrigation treatments in three years of the experiment the 2017 vwc across 5 d wk 1 treatments showed a gradual reduction over time more pronounced for the 74 63 and 54 eto irrigation levels the vwc values of the greatest irrigation level 103 eto however showed a relatively slight fluctuation and an increase toward the end of the experiment a similar trend was observed for the 7 d wk 1 treatments but vwc for the top three irrigation levels 103 93 and 83 eto showed low fluctuations over time overall soil tension followed the same pattern of variation as vwc the soil tension fluctuated around pf 2 2 5 9 8 31 kpa for the irrigation level of 103 eto the soil tension decreased to roughly pf of 4 5 3100 kpa and vwc of 7 5 for the 54 eto irrigation level and 5 d wk 1 frequency for 54 eto and 5 d wk 1 treatment the soil tension and soil moisture content decreased to roughly a pf of 4 4 5 981 3100 kpa and vwc of 10 the top three 2018 irrigation treatments 86 79 and 72 eto showed similar vwc patterns consisting of a gradual reduction till the may june and then slight fluctuations with minimum to no decrease over time the 50 and 58 eto treatments showed a more pronounced reduction in vwc and soil tension levels down to 15 and pf 3 5 4 310 981 kpa for the 3 d wk 1 frequency and 13 and pf 4 4 5 981 3100 kpa for the 7 d wk 1 frequency the soil tension and vwc of 2019 treatments with no frequency restriction 7 d wk 1 showed a sharp reduction at the beginning of the experiment afterward the soil tension and vwc more gradually diminished toward the end of the trial the 3 d wk 1 treatments followed a somewhat similar pattern but with much higher fluctuations except for the 66 eto treatment which showed almost no reduction in vwc over time the noticeable spikes in soil tension values toward the end of the 2019 experiment is attributed to several cloudy days with very low evaporative demands 3 4 turfgrass water response function the twrf developed using the combined three years data is 4 ndvi 0 604 0 110 10 2 ceto 0 521 i 0 407 i 2 0 176 10 6 ceto 2 0 101 10 2 i ceto where i is the relative irrigation level eto percentages and ceto is the cumulative eto mm fig 11 shows the scatter plot of the estimated versus measured ndvi values the slope and shape of the developed twrf clearly illustrate how higher deficit irrigation levels fell below the minimum acceptable quality much quicker than moderate deficit irrigation scenarios the twrf showed high accuracy rmse 0 047 and estimated ndvi values are highly correlated r 0 89 with measured ndvi values 4 discussion 4 1 response of hybrid bermudagrass to deficit irrigation treatments the reported water requirement for warm season grasses varies substantially in the literature wherley et al 2015 developed crop coefficients kc for four warm season turfgrass species including tifway bermudagrass cynodon dactylon l pers c transvaalensis burtt davy using three seasons data collected from non stressed well watered turfgrass in florida they reported fluctuations in kc values over time with roughly 0 8 and 0 3 as kc values for active growth periods periods with greatest pressure deficit and solar radiation and slow growing late fall and dormant winter seasons respectively they showed that a commonly used kc value of 0 6 for warm season turfgrass underestimated actual et during active growth periods a fact that was also observed in our study pinnix and miller 2019 reported kc values of 0 44 0 59 0 10 standard deviation for tifway hybrid bermudagrass in north carolina these values are substantially lower than the values reported for florida by wherley et al 2015 and our results also suggest a much higher irrigation requirement for bermudagrass we attribute the spatial variability in reported warm season turfgrass water requirements among these studies to the environmental conditions a fact that was also mentioned by pinnix and miller 2019 who also emphasized the need for development and use of local kc values for turfgrass we used the fitted twrf to estimate the response of hybrid bermudagrass to multiple levels of irrigation using the long term 34 years eto data obtained from the cimis station located in the study area fig 12 shows the maximum minimum and average ndvi values for six months may to november the results suggest 75 eto as the minimum irrigation application to maintain the minimum acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality in the inland southern california semiarid climate during the high water demand months i e may to november the results suggest that imposing more severe deficit irrigation levels is feasible for shorter periods before the hybrid bermudagrass quality starts to fall below the minimum acceptable quality the hybrid bermudagrass ability to withstand drought varies roughly between 25 and 75 consecutive days for 40 70 eto irrigation levels respectively the results also reveal that the variation in weather conditions have a more pronounced impact on hybrid bermudagrass quality when more severe deficit irrigation scenarios are imposed for example depending on weather conditions i e eto demand it may take twice as long roughly 50 versus 25 days for years with min and max eto demands respectively for a 40 eto irrigation application to result in unacceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality in contrast the variation in weather conditions i e eto demand has a much less noticeable impact on hybrid bermudagrass quality ndvi levels for a 70 eto irrigation application our soil moisture data suggest that hybrid bermudagrass likely maintains acceptable quality when near surface i e 127 152 mm deep soil tension and vwc values fluctuate around pf of 2 5 3 31 98 kpa and vwc of 20 25 respectively for the study site the laboratory measured vwc of soil surface 0 20 cm at soil tensions of 10 and 33 kpa are 30 and 22 respectively further studies are needed to determine whether these values could be used as triggering thresholds for efficient autonomous irrigation management of hybrid bermudagrass using soil moisture based smart irrigation controllers in the region with similar soil type 4 2 autonomous deficit irrigation using weathermatic et based controller davis and dukes 2010 emphasized the importance of manufacturer programmed and user defined settings on proper irrigation scheduling using et based smart controllers our results showed that accurate estimation of irrigation precipitation rate and proper selection of plant factor i e optimum fraction eto irrigation replacement to conserve water while maintaining the minimum acceptable landscape quality are critical factors for reliable autonomous deficit irrigation scheduling by et based controllers in summer months in the arid region of inland southern california the catch can test in our study underestimated the precipitation rate of the irrigation system in 2017 and 2018 this might be related to non uniformity of water applied i e not as much water is being applied in all spots leading to a lower catch can calculated precipitation rate and inherent errors in getting water into catch devices e g water hitting the cans at an angle and splashing out more studies are needed to evaluate the reliability accuracy and uncertainty of the catch can test to estimate the precipitation rate of irrigation systems the accuracy of eto estimations also impacts the performance of the et based smart controllers grabow et al 2013 observed on average about 10 more water applied by et based treatments than by a timer based treatment in north carolina and suggested overestimation of eto by the et controllers as a potential reseason for the overirrigation observed davis et al 2007 reported a 32 overestimation of eto by the weathermatic smart line series controller in florida the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 with on site temperature measurements and latitude based solar radiation estimations showed promising performance in our study on average 5 7 overestimation compared to cimis eto further studies are needed to evaluate the year round performance of the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 in inland southern california as well as other areas with different climate patterns across the state of california according to grabow et al 2013 the ability of smart controllers to take the precipitation into account when scheduling irrigation and impose irrigation frequency restrictions are likely the main factors impacting their potential water saving davis and dukes 2010 also reported that weather conditions and particularly considerable rainfall in rainy summer seasons in florida reduced the irrigation adequacy and scheduling efficiency of et based controllers we focused on high eto demand months in this study when significant precipitation is highly unlikely more studies are needed to evaluate the year round performance of the et based controllers and in particular their accuracy over rainy seasons in inland southern california the common perception is that less frequent watering encourages deep rooting and improves turfgrass quality although we did not measure rooting depth our turfgrass quality assessment did not support the idea of quality improvement due to less frequent irrigation we attribute this at least in part to the low water holding capacity of our soil due to its high sand content no watering restriction with proper identification of minimum deficit threshold to avoid light irrigation applications might be the optimum programming choice during dry months in inland southern california this setting allows the controller to identify the right irrigation frequencies dynamically based on the weather patterns in inland southern california summer periods with heatwaves cause very high eto demand when more frequent irrigation is needed to avoid drought injury at the same time less regular watering is desirable in periodic cool and cloudy days with much smaller eto demand 4 3 turfgrass quality assessment via handheld ndvi versus vr we used ndvi as the main parameter to monitor the response of turfgrass to varying degrees of deficit irrigation due to its reported high correlation with turfgrass tissue moisture content r 0 95 and crop coefficient r 0 90 fenstermaker shaulis et al 1997 overall we also observed a good match between the vr and ndvi data across irrigation treatments and in all three years of the experiment figs 4 6 this finding is in line with the reported results by bell et al 2009 and trenholm et al 1999 bell et al 2009 compared the greenseeker handheld sensor ndvi with vr values and reported the highest correlations for the bermudagrass with r values of 0 79 and 0 85 in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively trenholm et al 1999 studied three hybrid bermudagrass cultivars and reported r values ranging from 0 70 to 0 90 between turfgrass vr and ndvi our results suggest ndvi of 0 6 could be used roughly as the minimum threshold indicating acceptable quality for hybrid bermudagrass turf tifgreen cynodon dactylon l pers c transvaalensis burtt davy in the inland southern california region johnsen et al 2009 evaluated the utility of remote sensing to measure plant stress in creeping bentgrass agrostis stolonifera l fairways they noticed that reflectance measurements could detect water stress up to 2 days before visual observation we did not see early detection of drought injury based on ndvi data as compared to vr which is likely attributed to our weekly data collection protocol compared to the more frequent data collection by johnsen et al 2009 5 conclusion this study focused on developing irrigation water conservation strategies for hybrid bermudagrass a warm season grass underused in residential areas but is relatively drought tolerant and is starting to be used more widely across california the weathermatic et based smart controller used in our study showed acceptable accuracy with on average 5 7 overestimation of eto compared to cimis ndvi and vr values were highly correlated r 0 84 in our study therefore we suggest the application of handheld measured ndvi data for fast and consistent evaluation of overall hybrid bermudagrass turfgrass response to different irrigation regimes the regression based twrf introduced in our study as a statistical model to estimate the response of turfgrass to different irrigation strategies showed a good fit to experimental data our long term analysis using twsf indicated that 75 eto irrigation application could maintain the hybrid bermudagrass quality in the acceptable range for residential areas in dry seasons in inland southern california our results showed that depending on weather patterns eto demands more severe deficit irrigation scenarios could be implemented for shorter periods before the hybrid

10287,salinization in the low lying edges of the yinchuan plain in northwest china is a threat to productive farmland an experiment adopting drip irrigation high ridge salt tolerant plant reclaiming pattern was conducted to develop a method of forest construction the drip irrigation was scheduled by soil matric potentials smps monitored by tensiometers at both 20 cm and 50 cm depths exactly under drip emitters there were five treatments marked as s1 s5 with their corresponding smps controlled higher than 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa two salt tolerant plants the elaeagnus angustifolia and the astragalus adsurgens were planted on ridges for reclamation results showed that low salinity zones formed quickly under drip emitters and the average electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste extracts ece within 60 cm depth increased as smp thresholds decreased the 3 year average ece values were 1 8 4 6 6 0 7 1 and 7 7 ds m 1 for s1 s5 respectively reduced by 93 4 83 1 77 9 73 9 and 71 7 compared with initial values soil salt was progressively leached and reached to an equilibrium state when smp was kept above 10 kpa within one growing season two growing seasons were required to reach a similar equilibrium for smp threshold between 15 and 25 kpa the soil ph increased 0 25 0 11 0 09 0 05 and 0 07 and the soil sodium adsorption ratios declined by 59 3 36 2 37 8 44 9 and 42 7 in s1 s5 respectively indicating a dealkalizing soil environment in all treatments plant growth indicators decreased as smp thresholds declined and a threshold of 20 kpa was important to maintain plant survival rates and growths therefore keeping smp higher than 10 kpa in the first two years was important to ensure desalinization and that higher than 20 kpa in the third year was essential to maintain salt balance and plant growth a method consisting of agronomic practices and a four stage drip irrigation schedule based on the key smps is recommended for constructing a forest system keywords ecological conservation drip irrigation salt tolerant plants saline soil reclamation 1 introduction the yinchuan plain covers an area of 17 000 km2 in northwest china and is the economic center of the ningxia hui autonomous region the population and gdp here were 4 37 million and 257 37 billion rmb in 2016 accounting for 64 82 and 81 23 of the corresponding totals for the ningxia hui autonomous region jia and xu 2017 the city of yinchuan capital of the ningxia hui autonomous region has a long history deep cultural connotations and is also located in this plain the richness in both economy and culture of the plain is attributed to the yellow river which passes through it and brings abundant available water for agriculture and industry more than 2000 years ago the chinese people dug canals to divert water from the yellow river for irrigation wang et al 1993 xiong et al 1996 through the ages this mother river has supported the agricultural prosperity of the plain within this arid region with only 200 mm of annual rainfall however long term flood irrigation has raised the groundwater in this plain the heavy salinization has occurred in some low lying edges around the plain as a result of high evapotranspiration from shallow groundwater wang et al 1993 xiong et al 1996 furthermore these edges observed between the yinchuan plain and the tengger desert fig 1 are extremely ecologically vulnerable the sand and salt dusts brought into the plain by the seasonal wind in winter and spring can induce soil salinization and damage crops and plant leaves causing damage to agriculture and ecology the air quality and visibility are reduced by dusts affecting the lives of the local people thus ecological conservation around this plain is urgently needed to maintain economic development and ecological benefits an ecological protection system suited to this environment which does not include costly drainage systems is needed the local salt and drought tolerant species the elaeagnus angustifolia linn ea and the astragalus adsurgens pall aa are the likely best suited because their potential economic values ahmadiani et al 2000 wang et al 2006 khamzina et al 2009 wang and wang 2013 li 2017 will compensate for the operating costs such as irrigation and trimming and thus enhance sustainability of the ecological forest system these tolerant species are easy to establish in high salinity soil and capable of completing their life cycle under highly saline conditions hasanuzzaman et al 2014 zhang 2014 an ecological forest of salt tolerant species around the plain would build up an ecological barrier acting as a windbreaker and shelterbelt improving the soil environment regulating the microclimate lowering the water table and enhancing ecological balance danso et al 1992 kürsten et al 2001 franco et al 2003 zhang 2014 although these plants are salt tolerant soil reclamation is needed to control the soil salinity in plants root zones at levels below their salt tolerances traditionally a combination of irrigation and drainage practice is used to improve saline soil the area in this study was a catchment area and drainage from the plain will continue to flow in large amounts to this location thus the forced drainage system must be large enough to ensure the lowering of the water table resulting in too high investment and running costs other methods such as adding soil amendments in the plow layer and inoculating microorganisms into soil or crops have been widely used and have led to improvements such as decreasing soil salinity increasing soil nutrients and improving crop yield when applied to agricultural production in saline soil tillman et al 2010 hu and qi 2013 talaat 2015 ibrahim and she 2018 these methods could control the movement of salt out of the root zones of crops mostly annual crops with shallow roots in the growing seasons the perennial forests with deep roots require a low salt environment within deep root zones throughout the year which limits their usefulness drip irrigation is used to reclaim saline soil for its advantages of supplying sustainable water leaching salt reducing percolation and not requiring large drainage facilities goldberg et al 1976 kang 1998 using tensiometers buried at 20 cm as a drip irrigation scheduling indicator wan et al 2007 conducted an experiment for tomato cultivation irrigated with saline water in a semi humid area in north china and they found the tensiometer worked well under saline condition and suggested the smp of 20 kpa was a key parameter for salinity control this smp scheduled reclamation method combined with high ridges 0 8 m high and 0 6 m wide was successfully used to cultivate perennial plants such as lycium barbarum l and poplar in low lying areas with high salinity in arid regions kang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 this method also played a positive role in reclaiming coastal saline soil in a semi humid region the scheduled drip irrigation combined with a gravel sand layer set above the highest water table in a year was effective in preventing capillary action thus maintaining high survival rates of salt sensitive plants during urban landscaping in coastal saline soil sun et al 2012 chen et al 2015 and li et al 2015 used the same method as sun et al 2012 in a nearby area to cultivate the ornamental shrub rosa chinensis for using fresh water and saline water respectively they proposed a four stage drip irrigation schedule of fresh water and a three stage drip irrigation schedule of saline water for salt sensitive plant cultivation in coastal saline soil however their practice of setting a gravel sand layer above water table was too expensive to be adopted for establishing an ecological forest system in this area with shallow groundwater at present the obstacles to establishing an ecological forest system in this low lying area lie in how to regulate soil salinity in the long run and how can engineering measures be minimized to reduce costs therefore this study using the drip irrigation high ridge salt tolerant plant afforesting system mainly focuses on 1 spatial and temporal salt dynamics under drip irrigation 2 responses of salt tolerant plants to different drip irrigation schedules and 3 proposing a low cost method for establishing an ecological forest system in this saline area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this experiment was conducted at a field research station 38 1 43 38 1 48 n 105 56 29 105 56 36 e during 2015 2017 located between the edges of the yinchuan plain and the tengger desert fig 1 the annual sunshine here is 2955 h the average annual temperature is 9 3 c with lowest and highest of 23 7 c and 36 7 c respectively and the frost free period is 176 days annual average rainfall and evaporation from a water surface are 210 and 1800 mm respectively the soil within 0 80 cm was basic sand and loamy sand and within 80 120 cm was loam table 1 the average groundwater depth in this area was 1 2 m with ec of 20 ds m 1 and ph of 8 5 before the experiment irrigation water was pumped from a canal connected to the yellow river the ec ph and sar of irrigation water were 0 86 ds m 1 7 95 and 1 98 mmol0 5 l 0 5 respectively table 2 2 2 agronomic practices the saline soil was ridged with 0 8 m high at a space of 3 m similar to that used by dou et al 2011 however the ridge surface was set at 1 3 m wide twice that in their experiment to support more vegetation the widths of the ridge bottom and furrow were 2 7 and 0 3 m respectively fig 2 three drip tapes were arranged on the ridge surface at spaces of 0 5 m the ea trees with bare roots were transplanted into holes in the rows with a spacing of 2 m and filled with the original saline soils the aa seed was sown in three rows on each ridge all plants were set at lateral spacing of 0 1 m from drip tapes 2 3 experimental design this experiment consisted of five smp treatments s1 s5 and their corresponding smp thresholds were controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa fig 2a at soil depths of both 20 and 50 cm based on studies in the similar areas dou et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 if the smps monitored by tensiometers in a treatment reduce to the smp threshold as soil water evapotranspiration irrigation occurs in the treatment each treatment had three replications and there were 15 experimental plots in total in a complete randomized design fig 2a each plot was 12 m 8 m with 16 trees in total with four rows in each plot fig 2b two tensiometers were buried exactly under drip emitters nearest to trees at soil depths of 20 and 50 cm respectively in the second replicated plot in each treatment fig 2a before installation the native soil beneath the emitter was removed to make a hole 0 1 m in diameter which was filled with the non saline soil slurry to ensure the ceramic cup of the tensiometer was in firm contact with the soil fig 2c an independent irrigation controller that included water meter pressure gauge mesh filter and fertilizer device was set in each treatment to control the irrigation for three replicate plots each irrigation controller controlled 36 drip tapes with discharge rate of 1 38 l h 1 at a 10 m water head and emitter space of 0 3 m in total per treatment the discharge rate was estimated in the field and the wetting areas between two adjacent emitters contacted each other with no obvious ponding area irrigation scheduling consisted of three stages chen et al 2015 li et al 2015 the enhanced leaching stage stage ⅰ lasted for 3 5 days only after transplantation and the discharge rate was restricted to 0 5 l h 1 to reduce the ponding area caused by the initially poor infiltration of saline alkali soil in the initial stage the conventional leaching stage stage ⅱ began after the stage ⅰ and the irrigation was controlled by daily smp values the smp values in all treatments were monitored twice a day at 8 00 and 15 00 the discharge rate of drip emitters was adjusted to 1 38 l h 1 in this stage all treatments received 10 mm of water based on the wetting depth of dou et al 2011 if 2 out of 10 or more smp values in all treatments fell below 5 kpa stage ⅱ lasted for about 45 days to leach salt and ensure good establishment of transplants the precise water and salt regulation stage stage ⅲ started immediately following stage ⅱ in this stage the five treatments were irrigated separately according to their smp thresholds a treatment received 10 mm of water only if the smp values at depths of 20 cm or 50 cm in this treatment fell below the matched smp thresholds if smp values were not higher than 10 kpa after one irrigation another 10 mm of water was supplied in the first and last irrigations of each growing season the irrigation water amount for all treatments was 4 8 times the usual value according to soil water and salt conditions the surplus winter irrigation can replenish the soil water reservoir in time to meet the winter water consumption and the early spring irrigation can replenish the soil water deficit and provide suitable conditions for plants to sprout 2 4 measurement and methods 2 4 1 smp the smp values in all treatments were monitored twice a day at 8 00 and 15 00 2 4 2 ece phe and sare soil samples were taken from each plot with an auger 4 cm diameter and 10 cm high at an interval of 1 2 months in the first 2 years and at the beginning and the end of the third growing season before sampling a drip emitter on the outermost drip tape fig 2c was selected randomly in a plot then the samples were taken from both sides based on the drip emitter fig 2c there were 58 soil samples in total in one soil profile all soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve three replicate samples were mixed into one sample to make an extract of saturated soil paste by standard method robbins and wiegand 1990 the mass ratio of water to soil was approximate 3 5 the ece and phe were determined by a conductivity meter dds 11a yulong shanghai china and a ph meter phs 3c yulong based on extracts of saturated soil paste respectively the na mg2 and ca2 were measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer optima 5300dv perkinelmer shelton ct usa using the extract of saturated soil paste the sare was calculated as follows 1 sare n a m g 2 c a 2 0 5 where the concentration of each cation is in mmol l 1 2 4 3 plant growth and biomass the annual survival rates of trees and their growth indicators including height h ground diameter gd and crown diameter cd were measured in three growing seasons the coverage rate of ridge surface was measured by handheld plant canopy spectrometer acs 430 holland scientific lincoln ne usa in each treatment in 2016 a 1 m 1 m quadrat was set randomly in each plot to estimate the dry yield of aa in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the aa in the quadrat was manual harvest and dried at 75 c for 48 h in an oven then the dry matter was weighed the total yields of aa were converted by area 2 4 4 data analysis and statistical methods the average ece in a soil profile was calculated in the same way as dong et al 2020 taking both the distance and the area as weight factors fig 2c and the equation is as follows 2 ece i 1 n j 1 j k 1 k ece i j k d i j k a i i 1 n j 1 j k 1 k d i j k a i where i is the number of soil sampling areas j is lateral id number lid of soil samples in each area part k is vertical id number vid of soil samples in each area part ece i j k is ece at lid j and vid k in area part i d i j k is vertical interval of soil sample ece j j k and s i is area of part i the average phe and sare were calculated in the same way the gompertz equation was adopted to fit the desalinization processes of different treatments 3 rdr a exp exp x x 0 b where rdr is relative desalinization rate calculated as the decreased values divided by the initial value x is the total days of experiment and a x0 and b are parameters generally the parameter a is the stable value of fitting curve x0 is the inflection point and b determines the slope one way anova was conducted to evaluate the differences in growth indexes among treatments one way anova was conducted to test the differences of values of ece phe and sare in profiles between treatments 3 results 3 1 rainfall smp and irrigation the rainfall during the three growing seasons is shown in fig 3 there were 22 27 and 4 rainfall events with total rainfalls of 115 3 142 6 and 100 3 mm for the 2015 2017 growing seasons respectively the numbers of the rainfall events exceeding 5 mm believed to be effective for plants were 10 8 and 4 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively correspondingly one two and three events exceeded 20 mm this indicated that there was mostly light and moderate rainfall with high frequency in 2015 and 2016 seasons but mostly heavy rain with low frequency in 2017 the daily smp dynamics are shown in fig 4 the continuous irrigation in stage ⅰ only lasted for 5 days and none smp data was recorded the smp values in all treatments were controlled around 5 kpa in stage ⅱ before july 22 2015 during which irrigations in all treatments were conducted simultaneously fig 4a when treatments started stage ⅲ in 2015 the smp values in s3 s5 treatments gradually decreased to reach their corresponding thresholds as a result of evapotranspiration obviously the smps in s4 and s5 treatments in 2015 failed to reach their thresholds and smps in all treatments increased to around 5 kpa in early september owing to the continuous rainfall in this period fig 3 the smps in stage ⅲ in the latter two seasons fig 4b and c basically fluctuated along with the irrigation interval except when there was heavy rainfall fig 3 there was a period of water shortage because of a dry period from september 15 to october 4 2016 resulting in the smps generally being less than thresholds fig 4b in general heavy rainfall increased smp values for a period in all treatments but the smp values were generally controlled near to their thresholds the total applied water in s2 s5 respectively accounted for 70 7 47 6 45 2 and 45 2 of that in s1 in 2015 table 3 the corresponding values were 71 8 53 9 48 7 and 43 4 of that in s1 in 2016 and 60 2 52 0 45 9 and 43 8 of that in s1 in 2017 the data above indicated that the applied water amount reduced as smp thresholds decreased in all three growing seasons and also suggested that applied water increased yearly as a result of increasing water consumption due to plant growth 3 2 soil salinity dynamics 3 2 1 ece spatial distributions the ece spatial distributions at different time periods are shown in fig 5 soil ece generally exceeded 20 ds m 1 in the upper 60 cm of soil and that was lower than 20 ds m 1 in the 60 120 cm layer with average value of 20 2 ds m 1 in the whole profile before commencing the experiment table 4 and fig 5a the ece values in all treatments decreased markedly by the end of 2015 fig 5b as a result of salt leaching in stages ⅰ and ⅱ there were low salinity zones under drip emitters in all treatments and average ece values decreased significantly in all treatments table 4 by the end of the 2016 growing season the low salinity zones had enlarged progressively in s1 and s2 and those shrank upwards in treatments s3 s5 fig 5c it should be noted that the salinity in furrows and bottoms of ridges in s3 s5 increased drastically likely due to capillary action during a period of water shortage as circled in fig 4b the average ece value in s1decreased significantly while those in other treatments increased at an insignificant level table 4 decreases in salinity were found in ridge profiles at the end of 2017 especially in furrows compared with 2016 the final average ece values in all treatments were the lowest among three years when the experiment terminated soil salts were leached quickly in stages ⅰ and ⅱ and the average ece generally increased as the smp threshold decreased in stage ⅲ in all 3 years the soil salinity distributions indicated that the soil salinity in s1 5 kpa and s2 10 kpa treatments kept decreasing or were stable as affected by high total water potential that promoted the downward movement of water the soil salinity especially in furrows and bottoms of ridges in s3 s5 15 to 25 kpa treatments was dynamically changing 3 2 2 desalinization process the dynamics of the ece within 60 cm depth ece 60 a depth in which roots of perennial plant are mainly distributed under drip irrigation salgado and cautín 2008 sokalska et al 2009 lopes et al 2014 with time in all treatments are shown in fig 6a the average ece 60 decreased from 27 2 ds m 1 before the experiment to 4 4 ds m 1 after stage ⅱ fig 6a when treatments were applied during stage ⅲ in the first two growing seasons 2015 and 2016 the ece 60 basically increased as smp thresholds decreased at the same sampling time with average values of 1 8 4 7 6 0 7 0 and 8 3 ds m 1 in s1 s5 treatments respectively by the end of the third season 2017 the ece 60 s in s3 s5 treatments were greatly reduced likely due to the increased irrigation water table 3 and heavy rainfalls in this season fig 3 the average ece 60s among the three growing seasons were 1 8 4 6 6 0 7 1 and 7 7 ds m 1 for s1 s5 respectively reduced by 93 4 83 1 77 9 73 9 and 71 7 compared with initial values the rdr dynamics with time in the whole soil profiles in all treatments are shown in fig 6b the rdr increased quickly in stages ⅰ and ⅱ and slowly increased during stage ⅲ the fitted curves of s1 and s2 in the whole experimental period fig 6b suggested that the rdr remained in an equilibrium state in stage ⅲ the parameters of the fitted equations table 5 indicated that the inflection points of rdr were around 55 days in accordance with the total periods of stages ⅰ and ⅱ and the stable rdrs for s1 and s2 were 70 67 and 47 54 respectively the rdrs in s3 s5 fluctuated sharply with time in the first two seasons and were stable in the third season with their correspondingly stable rdrs of 36 4 41 2 and 40 4 this suggested that the salt desalinization reached an equilibrium state within one growing season if the smp threshold was maintained above 10 kpa two growing seasons were needed to reach an equilibrium if the smp threshold was kept within 15 to 25 kpa 3 2 3 the phe and sare the initial phe was homogeneous in the soil profile fig 7a with average value of 7 93 table 4 by the end of the 2016 growing season fig 7b the phe in soil profiles increased significantly in all treatments and the phe in s2 was significantly higher than other treatments the phe in all treatments except s1 had remarkable decreases by october 2017 table 4 the phe increased in the second year and then declined in the third year during the desalinization process the initial sare was also homogeneous in the soil profile fig 8a with an average of 49 18 mmol0 5 l 0 5 table 4 by the end of the 2016 growing season sare in soil profiles in all treatments showed appreciable decreases fig 8b low sare zones were found in all treatments and the average sare in all treatments except s4 had significant decreases table 4 further reductions were found in 2017 fig 8c the low sare zones sare 15 mmol0 5 l 0 5 enlarged to depths of 50 cm in all treatments and the final values in s1 s5 reduced by 59 3 36 2 37 8 44 9 and 42 7 compared with the initial values the sare reduced yearly in all treatments and the most prominent and sustained decline occurred when smp was controlled at 5 kpa s1 3 3 plant responses 3 3 1 the growth of ea the survival rates of ea are shown in table 6 the first year survival rates in all treatments were around 80 with no differences among treatments the survival rates were generally lower in the second than in the first year although there were no differences among treatments the survival rates reduced as smp thresholds decreased the third year survival rates in s1 s4 were 79 2 79 2 75 0 and 68 8 respectively which were significantly higher than for s5 with 56 3 the growth increments of ea in the three growing seasons are shown in table 7 the increments of h gd and cd in 2015 were small owing to the short growing period these values increased substantially in the 2016 growing season the increments of h gd and cd were 178 5 92 2 cm 35 1 16 2 mm and 214 4 108 9 cm respectively for s1 s5 all of which basically reduced as smp threshold decreased further increases occurred in the third growing season with increments of 286 1 146 8 cm and 56 5 26 5 mm for h and gd respectively in s1 s5 statistical analysis for 2016 and 2017 suggested that growth increments were significantly higher for s1 s3 than for s4 and s5 3 3 2 coverage and aboveground biomass of aa the coverage rate in this area was near zero before the experiment and that improved appreciably after 2 years owing to the growth of aa fig 9 the coverage rates of ridges were around 70 when smp thresholds were set above 10 kpa and were reduced for smp below 10 kpa the aboveground biomass of aa aba declined from 2309 to 1069 kg ha 1 in 2016 and from 4972 to 3149 kg ha 1 in 2017 in s1 s5 indicating that aba reduced linearly as smp thresholds decreased the total aba in the two growing seasons for s1 s4 was significantly higher than for s5 3 4 method for afforestation of salt tolerant plants overall the high ridge staged drip irrigation system played important roles in the management of water and salt in this study the soil salt was leached quickly in stages ⅰ and ⅱ with ece 60 decreasing from 27 2 to 4 4 ds m 1 within 50 days after transplantation in stage ⅲ if the smp threshold was maintained above 10 kpa within one growing season the ece 60 was lowered below the salt tolerance threshold of plants and reached a desalinization equilibrium state for the smp threshold between 15 and 25 kpa two growing seasons were required to achieve similar effects the survival rates of trees in the third year and the aba indicated that keeping the smp threshold above 20 kpa was important to ensure plant growth base on soil salt dynamics plant responses and the principle of water saving we recommend the following four stage drip irrigation schedule for ecological forest construction in this area 1 ridging of appropriate size according to the requirements of afforestation and the condition of groundwater for example to construct an ecological forest system in an area with depth to the water table of around 1 2 m we suggest that the width of the ridge top be no less than 1 m distance between ridges be no less than 3 m and ridge height be no less than 0 8 m 2 transplant trees into the transplanting pits on the ridge with non saline soil backfilling the pits however for tree species with salt tolerance similar to those in this study direct transplanting into the ridge is also acceptable grass seeds can be sown directly on the ridge plants transplanted or sown should be irrigated as soon as possible to leach salt 3 irrigation stage ⅰ is the same as that in 2 3 experimental design continuous drip irrigation should last for 3 5 days immediately following plants being transplanted or sown 4 irrigation stage ⅱ starts immediately after stage ⅰ drip irrigation is conducted according to smp monitored at 20 cm and 50 cm and irrigation with 10 mm of water is triggered if the smp decreases to a threshold of 5 kpa this stage should last for around 45 days to leach the salt in ridges as soon as possible 5 irrigation stage ⅲ begins immediately following stage ⅱ the smp threshold is adjusted to 10 kpa and lasts for the rest of the first season and the whole second season to reduce the salt gradually and reach an equilibrium state 6 irrigation stage ⅳ starts in the third growing season the smp threshold is adjusted to 20 kpa to save water and maintain salt balance 4 discussion 4 1 the soil salinity changes under combined conditions irrigation scheduling plays a crucial role in salinity control in irrigated arid areas ren et al 2019 many studies have found that the soil salinity within the plant root zone is negatively correlated with the smp threshold used to trigger drip irrigation zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 a similar result was also found between ece 60 and the smp threshold in this study however the table rdr in the 0 120 cm soil layer fig 7 in this study showed no significant linear correlation with smp threshold and the lowest rdr was for s3 15 kpa rather than s5 25 kpa this result was not in accordance with the results of chen et al 2015 and xu and li 2019 who found that the soil salinity within a depth of 1 2 m was negatively correlated with the smp threshold the differences in groundwater dynamics and the types of plants transplanted might explain this difference the depths to groundwater in this study were 1 2 1 7 m during the three growing seasons and shallow saline groundwater within 1 5 2 0 m of the soil surface is generally considered harmful to common vegetation ibrakhimov et al 2011 2014 however a filter isolation layer consisting of gravel and sand and a drainage system of subsurface pipes were arranged at 1 2 m beneath soil surface in the experiments of chen et al 2015 and xu and li 2019 respectively to reduce capillary action and control the water table in their experiments the effect of groundwater dynamics was minimized and the soil salinity was mainly affected by irrigation scheduling as compared the deep soil in this experiment directly contacted with groundwater and salt from groundwater could easily enter the soil through capillary action additionally the differences in plant species would also explain the salinity difference the ea and aa in this study in the medium moisture conditions e g s3 treatment had deeper roots greater coverage and thus more water absorption by roots in deep soil than those in low moisture conditions e g s4 and s5 rosa chinensis was grown in the experiments of chen et al 2015 and xu and li 2019 a plant with shallow roots and low coverage which mainly consumed the soil water within the upper soil layer and would not have a strong influence on soil salinity under scheduled irrigation figs 5 and 6 indicated that the soil salt could be leached and controlled at a certain level when the smp threshold was controlled higher than 25 kpa within 3 years however fig 5c indicated the salt moved to the deep soil or furrow through capillary action as a result of no irrigation this raised a very important question that if the plants survived when irrigation ceased in this arid region in a semi humid region in north china li 2019 found that the annual rainfall of 400 600 mm played an important role in salt leaching and the potential use of rainfed supplementary irrigation was proved feasible to reclaim saline soil in this region in this study we also found that the heavy rainfalls in 2017 helped with salt leaching in furrows fig 5c and d however the total rainfall amount in 2017 was only 100 mm which was far less than the et 525 mm of a sparse woodland in an arid region yang and yang 1988 according to the principle of water balance 425 mm water must be replenished to plant root zone by groundwater which would inevitably lead to a sustainable increase in soil salinity thus in order to maintain the healthy development of ecological forest irrigation is essential in this region and this study suggested the smp threshold of 20 kpa was suitable to maintain salt and water balance table 3 4 2 the soil phe and sare changes during desalination process the phe in this study increased in the second year and then declined in the third year during the desalinization process sun et al 2012 carried a field experiment of salt reclamation in a coastal region by drip irrigation and found that the phe increased 1 8 4 1 in the second year and decreased 1 1 3 3 when the third year terminated compared with the initial values xu and li 2019 also reported that soil ph increased substantially after 4 months salt leaching and then decreased slowly along with the reclaiming time what these studies had in common was that soil ph increased when soil salt was washed out the likely reason was that a high concentration of sodium chloride in soil solution suppressed the displacement of exchangeable sodium by hydrogen sreenivas and reddy 2008 and ph increased when sodium chloride was leached by irrigation xu and li 2019 believed that the differences of transferring velocity and distribution characteristic of salt ions under drip irrigation changed the ionic composition of the soil during desalinization process the sare in this study decreased year by year fig 8 which were like those of ece fig 5 the ece reflects the total amount of ions and as the soil salt leached by drip irrigation the total amount of ions decreased the previous studies have found that the na was more easily leached than mg2 and ca2 under saline condition white 2006 therefore during desalination more na was washed out while less mg2 and ca2 were washed out resulting in a decrease in the sar that calculated by na as the molecule and mg2 and ca2 as the denominator generally soils with phe 8 5 and sare 13 mmol0 5 l 0 5 are classified as non alkali soil james et al 1982 chhabra 2004 although phe in all treatments increased in this study the stable values were still lower than the threshold of 8 5 the sare distributions with time showed that the soil environment was in a dealkalizing process thus there would not be problems with alkalinization under this salt reclaiming process 4 3 methods for vegetation construction using drip irrigation methods for vegetation construction using drip irrigation had been studied in the last 10 years in a semi arid region similar to our study area in northwest china dou et al 2011 conducted an experiment on cultivating an economic plant lycium barbarum l in a low lying area using drip irrigation with saline water they concluded that a high ridge 0 8 m high and 0 6 m wide on the top mulched with plastic film combining with daily drip irrigation of 4 mm of saline water could provide a feasible soil environment for the plant growth daily drip irrigation is a common practice to reduce the hazard of salt in saline water and the operating cost can be compensated by the economic output in highly saline wasteland in a semi humid area near bohai bay china chen et al 2015 proposed a method for rosa chinensis cultivation for urban landscaping purposes in which they set a gravel sand layer above the shallow water table to cut off capillary action they suggested that the smp thresholds for triggering drip irrigation should be 5 10 and 20 kpa for the first the second and the third years respectively similar methods were also proposed for vegetation construction using drip irrigation with saline water li et al 2015 li 2019 the gravel sand layer was effective in minimizing capillary effects near the sea and the smp threshold at 20 kpa after 3 years was also a consideration for making full use of the annual rainfall of 600 mm the object of this study was constructing an ecological forest system in a semi arid region which differed from the economic production and urban landscaping purposes mentioned above thus investment should be minimized to cope with the high water table in this low lying area the method of ridging to reduce water table was adopted instead of setting a gravel sand layer above the shallow water table as chen et al 2015 and li et al 2015 2019 did during urban landscaping the practice of ridging would save lots of money when compared with setting a gravel sand layer in addition to reduce irrigation frequencies and operating costs this study adopted two salt tolerant plants the ea and the aa these plants had salinity tolerance of around 6 ds m 1 falling between moderately sensitive to moderately tolerant rhoades et al 1992 the ece 60 changes in fig 6a indicated that the salinity remained below the tolerance threshold when the smp threshold was controlled above 10 kpa in the first two years and above 25 kpa in the third year the irrigation scheduling would save water and operating costs when compared with the daily irrigation for cultivating economic plant in the study of dou et al 2011 what s further the annual rainfall in study area of li et al 2015 2019 was around 600 mm which was far more than that in this area of 210 mm the adoption of salt tolerant plants was also a consideration of this rainfall deficit because the salt tolerant plants had higher salt tolerance thresholds which reduced the leaching requirements derived from sum of the irrigation and rainfall in general the combination of agronomic practices salt tolerant plants and drip irrigation scheduling in this study was a comprehensive method appropriate for the natural and economic conditions in this area the water and salt regulation methods for vegetation construction differ among locations for the diversities of their purposes climate type and groundwater conditions 5 conclusions soil salinity decreased quickly in the stages ⅰ and ⅱ and slowly decreased in stage ⅲ in stage ⅲ keeping the smp threshold above 10 kpa within one growing season maintained the ece 60 below the salt tolerance threshold of plants and reached a desalinization equilibrium state for smp thresholds between 15 and 25 kpa two growing seasons were required to achieve similar effects soil phe initially increased and then decreased during the desalinization process however the finally stable phe and sare values indicated decreases in soil alkalinity in all treatments the survival rates of trees and growth parameters of all plants reduced as smp thresholds decreased and the results indicated that the smp thresholds above 10 kpa in the second growing season and above 20 kpa in the third growing season were important to ensure plant growths a method was proposed for constructing an ecological forest system of salt tolerant plants the agronomic practices included ridging transplanting requirements and a drip irrigation schedule consisting of four stages ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ stage ⅰ lasts 3 5 days with continuous drip irrigation after planting stages ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ last approximately 45 days in the first growing season the rest of the first and the whole of the second growing season and the whole third season respectively and their corresponding smp thresholds for drip irrigation scheduling are 5 10 and 20 kpa declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

10287,salinization in the low lying edges of the yinchuan plain in northwest china is a threat to productive farmland an experiment adopting drip irrigation high ridge salt tolerant plant reclaiming pattern was conducted to develop a method of forest construction the drip irrigation was scheduled by soil matric potentials smps monitored by tensiometers at both 20 cm and 50 cm depths exactly under drip emitters there were five treatments marked as s1 s5 with their corresponding smps controlled higher than 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa two salt tolerant plants the elaeagnus angustifolia and the astragalus adsurgens were planted on ridges for reclamation results showed that low salinity zones formed quickly under drip emitters and the average electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste extracts ece within 60 cm depth increased as smp thresholds decreased the 3 year average ece values were 1 8 4 6 6 0 7 1 and 7 7 ds m 1 for s1 s5 respectively reduced by 93 4 83 1 77 9 73 9 and 71 7 compared with initial values soil salt was progressively leached and reached to an equilibrium state when smp was kept above 10 kpa within one growing season two growing seasons were required to reach a similar equilibrium for smp threshold between 15 and 25 kpa the soil ph increased 0 25 0 11 0 09 0 05 and 0 07 and the soil sodium adsorption ratios declined by 59 3 36 2 37 8 44 9 and 42 7 in s1 s5 respectively indicating a dealkalizing soil environment in all treatments plant growth indicators decreased as smp thresholds declined and a threshold of 20 kpa was important to maintain plant survival rates and growths therefore keeping smp higher than 10 kpa in the first two years was important to ensure desalinization and that higher than 20 kpa in the third year was essential to maintain salt balance and plant growth a method consisting of agronomic practices and a four stage drip irrigation schedule based on the key smps is recommended for constructing a forest system keywords ecological conservation drip irrigation salt tolerant plants saline soil reclamation 1 introduction the yinchuan plain covers an area of 17 000 km2 in northwest china and is the economic center of the ningxia hui autonomous region the population and gdp here were 4 37 million and 257 37 billion rmb in 2016 accounting for 64 82 and 81 23 of the corresponding totals for the ningxia hui autonomous region jia and xu 2017 the city of yinchuan capital of the ningxia hui autonomous region has a long history deep cultural connotations and is also located in this plain the richness in both economy and culture of the plain is attributed to the yellow river which passes through it and brings abundant available water for agriculture and industry more than 2000 years ago the chinese people dug canals to divert water from the yellow river for irrigation wang et al 1993 xiong et al 1996 through the ages this mother river has supported the agricultural prosperity of the plain within this arid region with only 200 mm of annual rainfall however long term flood irrigation has raised the groundwater in this plain the heavy salinization has occurred in some low lying edges around the plain as a result of high evapotranspiration from shallow groundwater wang et al 1993 xiong et al 1996 furthermore these edges observed between the yinchuan plain and the tengger desert fig 1 are extremely ecologically vulnerable the sand and salt dusts brought into the plain by the seasonal wind in winter and spring can induce soil salinization and damage crops and plant leaves causing damage to agriculture and ecology the air quality and visibility are reduced by dusts affecting the lives of the local people thus ecological conservation around this plain is urgently needed to maintain economic development and ecological benefits an ecological protection system suited to this environment which does not include costly drainage systems is needed the local salt and drought tolerant species the elaeagnus angustifolia linn ea and the astragalus adsurgens pall aa are the likely best suited because their potential economic values ahmadiani et al 2000 wang et al 2006 khamzina et al 2009 wang and wang 2013 li 2017 will compensate for the operating costs such as irrigation and trimming and thus enhance sustainability of the ecological forest system these tolerant species are easy to establish in high salinity soil and capable of completing their life cycle under highly saline conditions hasanuzzaman et al 2014 zhang 2014 an ecological forest of salt tolerant species around the plain would build up an ecological barrier acting as a windbreaker and shelterbelt improving the soil environment regulating the microclimate lowering the water table and enhancing ecological balance danso et al 1992 kürsten et al 2001 franco et al 2003 zhang 2014 although these plants are salt tolerant soil reclamation is needed to control the soil salinity in plants root zones at levels below their salt tolerances traditionally a combination of irrigation and drainage practice is used to improve saline soil the area in this study was a catchment area and drainage from the plain will continue to flow in large amounts to this location thus the forced drainage system must be large enough to ensure the lowering of the water table resulting in too high investment and running costs other methods such as adding soil amendments in the plow layer and inoculating microorganisms into soil or crops have been widely used and have led to improvements such as decreasing soil salinity increasing soil nutrients and improving crop yield when applied to agricultural production in saline soil tillman et al 2010 hu and qi 2013 talaat 2015 ibrahim and she 2018 these methods could control the movement of salt out of the root zones of crops mostly annual crops with shallow roots in the growing seasons the perennial forests with deep roots require a low salt environment within deep root zones throughout the year which limits their usefulness drip irrigation is used to reclaim saline soil for its advantages of supplying sustainable water leaching salt reducing percolation and not requiring large drainage facilities goldberg et al 1976 kang 1998 using tensiometers buried at 20 cm as a drip irrigation scheduling indicator wan et al 2007 conducted an experiment for tomato cultivation irrigated with saline water in a semi humid area in north china and they found the tensiometer worked well under saline condition and suggested the smp of 20 kpa was a key parameter for salinity control this smp scheduled reclamation method combined with high ridges 0 8 m high and 0 6 m wide was successfully used to cultivate perennial plants such as lycium barbarum l and poplar in low lying areas with high salinity in arid regions kang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 this method also played a positive role in reclaiming coastal saline soil in a semi humid region the scheduled drip irrigation combined with a gravel sand layer set above the highest water table in a year was effective in preventing capillary action thus maintaining high survival rates of salt sensitive plants during urban landscaping in coastal saline soil sun et al 2012 chen et al 2015 and li et al 2015 used the same method as sun et al 2012 in a nearby area to cultivate the ornamental shrub rosa chinensis for using fresh water and saline water respectively they proposed a four stage drip irrigation schedule of fresh water and a three stage drip irrigation schedule of saline water for salt sensitive plant cultivation in coastal saline soil however their practice of setting a gravel sand layer above water table was too expensive to be adopted for establishing an ecological forest system in this area with shallow groundwater at present the obstacles to establishing an ecological forest system in this low lying area lie in how to regulate soil salinity in the long run and how can engineering measures be minimized to reduce costs therefore this study using the drip irrigation high ridge salt tolerant plant afforesting system mainly focuses on 1 spatial and temporal salt dynamics under drip irrigation 2 responses of salt tolerant plants to different drip irrigation schedules and 3 proposing a low cost method for establishing an ecological forest system in this saline area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this experiment was conducted at a field research station 38 1 43 38 1 48 n 105 56 29 105 56 36 e during 2015 2017 located between the edges of the yinchuan plain and the tengger desert fig 1 the annual sunshine here is 2955 h the average annual temperature is 9 3 c with lowest and highest of 23 7 c and 36 7 c respectively and the frost free period is 176 days annual average rainfall and evaporation from a water surface are 210 and 1800 mm respectively the soil within 0 80 cm was basic sand and loamy sand and within 80 120 cm was loam table 1 the average groundwater depth in this area was 1 2 m with ec of 20 ds m 1 and ph of 8 5 before the experiment irrigation water was pumped from a canal connected to the yellow river the ec ph and sar of irrigation water were 0 86 ds m 1 7 95 and 1 98 mmol0 5 l 0 5 respectively table 2 2 2 agronomic practices the saline soil was ridged with 0 8 m high at a space of 3 m similar to that used by dou et al 2011 however the ridge surface was set at 1 3 m wide twice that in their experiment to support more vegetation the widths of the ridge bottom and furrow were 2 7 and 0 3 m respectively fig 2 three drip tapes were arranged on the ridge surface at spaces of 0 5 m the ea trees with bare roots were transplanted into holes in the rows with a spacing of 2 m and filled with the original saline soils the aa seed was sown in three rows on each ridge all plants were set at lateral spacing of 0 1 m from drip tapes 2 3 experimental design this experiment consisted of five smp treatments s1 s5 and their corresponding smp thresholds were controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa fig 2a at soil depths of both 20 and 50 cm based on studies in the similar areas dou et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 if the smps monitored by tensiometers in a treatment reduce to the smp threshold as soil water evapotranspiration irrigation occurs in the treatment each treatment had three replications and there were 15 experimental plots in total in a complete randomized design fig 2a each plot was 12 m 8 m with 16 trees in total with four rows in each plot fig 2b two tensiometers were buried exactly under drip emitters nearest to trees at soil depths of 20 and 50 cm respectively in the second replicated plot in each treatment fig 2a before installation the native soil beneath the emitter was removed to make a hole 0 1 m in diameter which was filled with the non saline soil slurry to ensure the ceramic cup of the tensiometer was in firm contact with the soil fig 2c an independent irrigation controller that included water meter pressure gauge mesh filter and fertilizer device was set in each treatment to control the irrigation for three replicate plots each irrigation controller controlled 36 drip tapes with discharge rate of 1 38 l h 1 at a 10 m water head and emitter space of 0 3 m in total per treatment the discharge rate was estimated in the field and the wetting areas between two adjacent emitters contacted each other with no obvious ponding area irrigation scheduling consisted of three stages chen et al 2015 li et al 2015 the enhanced leaching stage stage ⅰ lasted for 3 5 days only after transplantation and the discharge rate was restricted to 0 5 l h 1 to reduce the ponding area caused by the initially poor infiltration of saline alkali soil in the initial stage the conventional leaching stage stage ⅱ began after the stage ⅰ and the irrigation was controlled by daily smp values the smp values in all treatments were monitored twice a day at 8 00 and 15 00 the discharge rate of drip emitters was adjusted to 1 38 l h 1 in this stage all treatments received 10 mm of water based on the wetting depth of dou et al 2011 if 2 out of 10 or more smp values in all treatments fell below 5 kpa stage ⅱ lasted for about 45 days to leach salt and ensure good establishment of transplants the precise water and salt regulation stage stage ⅲ started immediately following stage ⅱ in this stage the five treatments were irrigated separately according to their smp thresholds a treatment received 10 mm of water only if the smp values at depths of 20 cm or 50 cm in this treatment fell below the matched smp thresholds if smp values were not higher than 10 kpa after one irrigation another 10 mm of water was supplied in the first and last irrigations of each growing season the irrigation water amount for all treatments was 4 8 times the usual value according to soil water and salt conditions the surplus winter irrigation can replenish the soil water reservoir in time to meet the winter water consumption and the early spring irrigation can replenish the soil water deficit and provide suitable conditions for plants to sprout 2 4 measurement and methods 2 4 1 smp the smp values in all treatments were monitored twice a day at 8 00 and 15 00 2 4 2 ece phe and sare soil samples were taken from each plot with an auger 4 cm diameter and 10 cm high at an interval of 1 2 months in the first 2 years and at the beginning and the end of the third growing season before sampling a drip emitter on the outermost drip tape fig 2c was selected randomly in a plot then the samples were taken from both sides based on the drip emitter fig 2c there were 58 soil samples in total in one soil profile all soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve three replicate samples were mixed into one sample to make an extract of saturated soil paste by standard method robbins and wiegand 1990 the mass ratio of water to soil was approximate 3 5 the ece and phe were determined by a conductivity meter dds 11a yulong shanghai china and a ph meter phs 3c yulong based on extracts of saturated soil paste respectively the na mg2 and ca2 were measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer optima 5300dv perkinelmer shelton ct usa using the extract of saturated soil paste the sare was calculated as follows 1 sare n a m g 2 c a 2 0 5 where the concentration of each cation is in mmol l 1 2 4 3 plant growth and biomass the annual survival rates of trees and their growth indicators including height h ground diameter gd and crown diameter cd were measured in three growing seasons the coverage rate of ridge surface was measured by handheld plant canopy spectrometer acs 430 holland scientific lincoln ne usa in each treatment in 2016 a 1 m 1 m quadrat was set randomly in each plot to estimate the dry yield of aa in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the aa in the quadrat was manual harvest and dried at 75 c for 48 h in an oven then the dry matter was weighed the total yields of aa were converted by area 2 4 4 data analysis and statistical methods the average ece in a soil profile was calculated in the same way as dong et al 2020 taking both the distance and the area as weight factors fig 2c and the equation is as follows 2 ece i 1 n j 1 j k 1 k ece i j k d i j k a i i 1 n j 1 j k 1 k d i j k a i where i is the number of soil sampling areas j is lateral id number lid of soil samples in each area part k is vertical id number vid of soil samples in each area part ece i j k is ece at lid j and vid k in area part i d i j k is vertical interval of soil sample ece j j k and s i is area of part i the average phe and sare were calculated in the same way the gompertz equation was adopted to fit the desalinization processes of different treatments 3 rdr a exp exp x x 0 b where rdr is relative desalinization rate calculated as the decreased values divided by the initial value x is the total days of experiment and a x0 and b are parameters generally the parameter a is the stable value of fitting curve x0 is the inflection point and b determines the slope one way anova was conducted to evaluate the differences in growth indexes among treatments one way anova was conducted to test the differences of values of ece phe and sare in profiles between treatments 3 results 3 1 rainfall smp and irrigation the rainfall during the three growing seasons is shown in fig 3 there were 22 27 and 4 rainfall events with total rainfalls of 115 3 142 6 and 100 3 mm for the 2015 2017 growing seasons respectively the numbers of the rainfall events exceeding 5 mm believed to be effective for plants were 10 8 and 4 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively correspondingly one two and three events exceeded 20 mm this indicated that there was mostly light and moderate rainfall with high frequency in 2015 and 2016 seasons but mostly heavy rain with low frequency in 2017 the daily smp dynamics are shown in fig 4 the continuous irrigation in stage ⅰ only lasted for 5 days and none smp data was recorded the smp values in all treatments were controlled around 5 kpa in stage ⅱ before july 22 2015 during which irrigations in all treatments were conducted simultaneously fig 4a when treatments started stage ⅲ in 2015 the smp values in s3 s5 treatments gradually decreased to reach their corresponding thresholds as a result of evapotranspiration obviously the smps in s4 and s5 treatments in 2015 failed to reach their thresholds and smps in all treatments increased to around 5 kpa in early september owing to the continuous rainfall in this period fig 3 the smps in stage ⅲ in the latter two seasons fig 4b and c basically fluctuated along with the irrigation interval except when there was heavy rainfall fig 3 there was a period of water shortage because of a dry period from september 15 to october 4 2016 resulting in the smps generally being less than thresholds fig 4b in general heavy rainfall increased smp values for a period in all treatments but the smp values were generally controlled near to their thresholds the total applied water in s2 s5 respectively accounted for 70 7 47 6 45 2 and 45 2 of that in s1 in 2015 table 3 the corresponding values were 71 8 53 9 48 7 and 43 4 of that in s1 in 2016 and 60 2 52 0 45 9 and 43 8 of that in s1 in 2017 the data above indicated that the applied water amount reduced as smp thresholds decreased in all three growing seasons and also suggested that applied water increased yearly as a result of increasing water consumption due to plant growth 3 2 soil salinity dynamics 3 2 1 ece spatial distributions the ece spatial distributions at different time periods are shown in fig 5 soil ece generally exceeded 20 ds m 1 in the upper 60 cm of soil and that was lower than 20 ds m 1 in the 60 120 cm layer with average value of 20 2 ds m 1 in the whole profile before commencing the experiment table 4 and fig 5a the ece values in all treatments decreased markedly by the end of 2015 fig 5b as a result of salt leaching in stages ⅰ and ⅱ there were low salinity zones under drip emitters in all treatments and average ece values decreased significantly in all treatments table 4 by the end of the 2016 growing season the low salinity zones had enlarged progressively in s1 and s2 and those shrank upwards in treatments s3 s5 fig 5c it should be noted that the salinity in furrows and bottoms of ridges in s3 s5 increased drastically likely due to capillary action during a period of water shortage as circled in fig 4b the average ece value in s1decreased significantly while those in other treatments increased at an insignificant level table 4 decreases in salinity were found in ridge profiles at the end of 2017 especially in furrows compared with 2016 the final average ece values in all treatments were the lowest among three years when the experiment terminated soil salts were leached quickly in stages ⅰ and ⅱ and the average ece generally increased as the smp threshold decreased in stage ⅲ in all 3 years the soil salinity distributions indicated that the soil salinity in s1 5 kpa and s2 10 kpa treatments kept decreasing or were stable as affected by high total water potential that promoted the downward movement of water the soil salinity especially in furrows and bottoms of ridges in s3 s5 15 to 25 kpa treatments was dynamically changing 3 2 2 desalinization process the dynamics of the ece within 60 cm depth ece 60 a depth in which roots of perennial plant are mainly distributed under drip irrigation salgado and cautín 2008 sokalska et al 2009 lopes et al 2014 with time in all treatments are shown in fig 6a the average ece 60 decreased from 27 2 ds m 1 before the experiment to 4 4 ds m 1 after stage ⅱ fig 6a when treatments were applied during stage ⅲ in the first two growing seasons 2015 and 2016 the ece 60 basically increased as smp thresholds decreased at the same sampling time with average values of 1 8 4 7 6 0 7 0 and 8 3 ds m 1 in s1 s5 treatments respectively by the end of the third season 2017 the ece 60 s in s3 s5 treatments were greatly reduced likely due to the increased irrigation water table 3 and heavy rainfalls in this season fig 3 the average ece 60s among the three growing seasons were 1 8 4 6 6 0 7 1 and 7 7 ds m 1 for s1 s5 respectively reduced by 93 4 83 1 77 9 73 9 and 71 7 compared with initial values the rdr dynamics with time in the whole soil profiles in all treatments are shown in fig 6b the rdr increased quickly in stages ⅰ and ⅱ and slowly increased during stage ⅲ the fitted curves of s1 and s2 in the whole experimental period fig 6b suggested that the rdr remained in an equilibrium state in stage ⅲ the parameters of the fitted equations table 5 indicated that the inflection points of rdr were around 55 days in accordance with the total periods of stages ⅰ and ⅱ and the stable rdrs for s1 and s2 were 70 67 and 47 54 respectively the rdrs in s3 s5 fluctuated sharply with time in the first two seasons and were stable in the third season with their correspondingly stable rdrs of 36 4 41 2 and 40 4 this suggested that the salt desalinization reached an equilibrium state within one growing season if the smp threshold was maintained above 10 kpa two growing seasons were needed to reach an equilibrium if the smp threshold was kept within 15 to 25 kpa 3 2 3 the phe and sare the initial phe was homogeneous in the soil profile fig 7a with average value of 7 93 table 4 by the end of the 2016 growing season fig 7b the phe in soil profiles increased significantly in all treatments and the phe in s2 was significantly higher than other treatments the phe in all treatments except s1 had remarkable decreases by october 2017 table 4 the phe increased in the second year and then declined in the third year during the desalinization process the initial sare was also homogeneous in the soil profile fig 8a with an average of 49 18 mmol0 5 l 0 5 table 4 by the end of the 2016 growing season sare in soil profiles in all treatments showed appreciable decreases fig 8b low sare zones were found in all treatments and the average sare in all treatments except s4 had significant decreases table 4 further reductions were found in 2017 fig 8c the low sare zones sare 15 mmol0 5 l 0 5 enlarged to depths of 50 cm in all treatments and the final values in s1 s5 reduced by 59 3 36 2 37 8 44 9 and 42 7 compared with the initial values the sare reduced yearly in all treatments and the most prominent and sustained decline occurred when smp was controlled at 5 kpa s1 3 3 plant responses 3 3 1 the growth of ea the survival rates of ea are shown in table 6 the first year survival rates in all treatments were around 80 with no differences among treatments the survival rates were generally lower in the second than in the first year although there were no differences among treatments the survival rates reduced as smp thresholds decreased the third year survival rates in s1 s4 were 79 2 79 2 75 0 and 68 8 respectively which were significantly higher than for s5 with 56 3 the growth increments of ea in the three growing seasons are shown in table 7 the increments of h gd and cd in 2015 were small owing to the short growing period these values increased substantially in the 2016 growing season the increments of h gd and cd were 178 5 92 2 cm 35 1 16 2 mm and 214 4 108 9 cm respectively for s1 s5 all of which basically reduced as smp threshold decreased further increases occurred in the third growing season with increments of 286 1 146 8 cm and 56 5 26 5 mm for h and gd respectively in s1 s5 statistical analysis for 2016 and 2017 suggested that growth increments were significantly higher for s1 s3 than for s4 and s5 3 3 2 coverage and aboveground biomass of aa the coverage rate in this area was near zero before the experiment and that improved appreciably after 2 years owing to the growth of aa fig 9 the coverage rates of ridges were around 70 when smp thresholds were set above 10 kpa and were reduced for smp below 10 kpa the aboveground biomass of aa aba declined from 2309 to 1069 kg ha 1 in 2016 and from 4972 to 3149 kg ha 1 in 2017 in s1 s5 indicating that aba reduced linearly as smp thresholds decreased the total aba in the two growing seasons for s1 s4 was significantly higher than for s5 3 4 method for afforestation of salt tolerant plants overall the high ridge staged drip irrigation system played important roles in the management of water and salt in this study the soil salt was leached quickly in stages ⅰ and ⅱ with ece 60 decreasing from 27 2 to 4 4 ds m 1 within 50 days after transplantation in stage ⅲ if the smp threshold was maintained above 10 kpa within one growing season the ece 60 was lowered below the salt tolerance threshold of plants and reached a desalinization equilibrium state for the smp threshold between 15 and 25 kpa two growing seasons were required to achieve similar effects the survival rates of trees in the third year and the aba indicated that keeping the smp threshold above 20 kpa was important to ensure plant growth base on soil salt dynamics plant responses and the principle of water saving we recommend the following four stage drip irrigation schedule for ecological forest construction in this area 1 ridging of appropriate size according to the requirements of afforestation and the condition of groundwater for example to construct an ecological forest system in an area with depth to the water table of around 1 2 m we suggest that the width of the ridge top be no less than 1 m distance between ridges be no less than 3 m and ridge height be no less than 0 8 m 2 transplant trees into the transplanting pits on the ridge with non saline soil backfilling the pits however for tree species with salt tolerance similar to those in this study direct transplanting into the ridge is also acceptable grass seeds can be sown directly on the ridge plants transplanted or sown should be irrigated as soon as possible to leach salt 3 irrigation stage ⅰ is the same as that in 2 3 experimental design continuous drip irrigation should last for 3 5 days immediately following plants being transplanted or sown 4 irrigation stage ⅱ starts immediately after stage ⅰ drip irrigation is conducted according to smp monitored at 20 cm and 50 cm and irrigation with 10 mm of water is triggered if the smp decreases to a threshold of 5 kpa this stage should last for around 45 days to leach the salt in ridges as soon as possible 5 irrigation stage ⅲ begins immediately following stage ⅱ the smp threshold is adjusted to 10 kpa and lasts for the rest of the first season and the whole second season to reduce the salt gradually and reach an equilibrium state 6 irrigation stage ⅳ starts in the third growing season the smp threshold is adjusted to 20 kpa to save water and maintain salt balance 4 discussion 4 1 the soil salinity changes under combined conditions irrigation scheduling plays a crucial role in salinity control in irrigated arid areas ren et al 2019 many studies have found that the soil salinity within the plant root zone is negatively correlated with the smp threshold used to trigger drip irrigation zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 a similar result was also found between ece 60 and the smp threshold in this study however the table rdr in the 0 120 cm soil layer fig 7 in this study showed no significant linear correlation with smp threshold and the lowest rdr was for s3 15 kpa rather than s5 25 kpa this result was not in accordance with the results of chen et al 2015 and xu and li 2019 who found that the soil salinity within a depth of 1 2 m was negatively correlated with the smp threshold the differences in groundwater dynamics and the types of plants transplanted might explain this difference the depths to groundwater in this study were 1 2 1 7 m during the three growing seasons and shallow saline groundwater within 1 5 2 0 m of the soil surface is generally considered harmful to common vegetation ibrakhimov et al 2011 2014 however a filter isolation layer consisting of gravel and sand and a drainage system of subsurface pipes were arranged at 1 2 m beneath soil surface in the experiments of chen et al 2015 and xu and li 2019 respectively to reduce capillary action and control the water table in their experiments the effect of groundwater dynamics was minimized and the soil salinity was mainly affected by irrigation scheduling as compared the deep soil in this experiment directly contacted with groundwater and salt from groundwater could easily enter the soil through capillary action additionally the differences in plant species would also explain the salinity difference the ea and aa in this study in the medium moisture conditions e g s3 treatment had deeper roots greater coverage and thus more water absorption by roots in deep soil than those in low moisture conditions e g s4 and s5 rosa chinensis was grown in the experiments of chen et al 2015 and xu and li 2019 a plant with shallow roots and low coverage which mainly consumed the soil water within the upper soil layer and would not have a strong influence on soil salinity under scheduled irrigation figs 5 and 6 indicated that the soil salt could be leached and controlled at a certain level when the smp threshold was controlled higher than 25 kpa within 3 years however fig 5c indicated the salt moved to the deep soil or furrow through capillary action as a result of no irrigation this raised a very important question that if the plants survived when irrigation ceased in this arid region in a semi humid region in north china li 2019 found that the annual rainfall of 400 600 mm played an important role in salt leaching and the potential use of rainfed supplementary irrigation was proved feasible to reclaim saline soil in this region in this study we also found that the heavy rainfalls in 2017 helped with salt leaching in furrows fig 5c and d however the total rainfall amount in 2017 was only 100 mm which was far less than the et 525 mm of a sparse woodland in an arid region yang and yang 1988 according to the principle of water balance 425 mm water must be replenished to plant root zone by groundwater which would inevitably lead to a sustainable increase in soil salinity thus in order to maintain the healthy development of ecological forest irrigation is essential in this region and this study suggested the smp threshold of 20 kpa was suitable to maintain salt and water balance table 3 4 2 the soil phe and sare changes during desalination process the phe in this study increased in the second year and then declined in the third year during the desalinization process sun et al 2012 carried a field experiment of salt reclamation in a coastal region by drip irrigation and found that the phe increased 1 8 4 1 in the second year and decreased 1 1 3 3 when the third year terminated compared with the initial values xu and li 2019 also reported that soil ph increased substantially after 4 months salt leaching and then decreased slowly along with the reclaiming time what these studies had in common was that soil ph increased when soil salt was washed out the likely reason was that a high concentration of sodium chloride in soil solution suppressed the displacement of exchangeable sodium by hydrogen sreenivas and reddy 2008 and ph increased when sodium chloride was leached by irrigation xu and li 2019 believed that the differences of transferring velocity and distribution characteristic of salt ions under drip irrigation changed the ionic composition of the soil during desalinization process the sare in this study decreased year by year fig 8 which were like those of ece fig 5 the ece reflects the total amount of ions and as the soil salt leached by drip irrigation the total amount of ions decreased the previous studies have found that the na was more easily leached than mg2 and ca2 under saline condition white 2006 therefore during desalination more na was washed out while less mg2 and ca2 were washed out resulting in a decrease in the sar that calculated by na as the molecule and mg2 and ca2 as the denominator generally soils with phe 8 5 and sare 13 mmol0 5 l 0 5 are classified as non alkali soil james et al 1982 chhabra 2004 although phe in all treatments increased in this study the stable values were still lower than the threshold of 8 5 the sare distributions with time showed that the soil environment was in a dealkalizing process thus there would not be problems with alkalinization under this salt reclaiming process 4 3 methods for vegetation construction using drip irrigation methods for vegetation construction using drip irrigation had been studied in the last 10 years in a semi arid region similar to our study area in northwest china dou et al 2011 conducted an experiment on cultivating an economic plant lycium barbarum l in a low lying area using drip irrigation with saline water they concluded that a high ridge 0 8 m high and 0 6 m wide on the top mulched with plastic film combining with daily drip irrigation of 4 mm of saline water could provide a feasible soil environment for the plant growth daily drip irrigation is a common practice to reduce the hazard of salt in saline water and the operating cost can be compensated by the economic output in highly saline wasteland in a semi humid area near bohai bay china chen et al 2015 proposed a method for rosa chinensis cultivation for urban landscaping purposes in which they set a gravel sand layer above the shallow water table to cut off capillary action they suggested that the smp thresholds for triggering drip irrigation should be 5 10 and 20 kpa for the first the second and the third years respectively similar methods were also proposed for vegetation construction using drip irrigation with saline water li et al 2015 li 2019 the gravel sand layer was effective in minimizing capillary effects near the sea and the smp threshold at 20 kpa after 3 years was also a consideration for making full use of the annual rainfall of 600 mm the object of this study was constructing an ecological forest system in a semi arid region which differed from the economic production and urban landscaping purposes mentioned above thus investment should be minimized to cope with the high water table in this low lying area the method of ridging to reduce water table was adopted instead of setting a gravel sand layer above the shallow water table as chen et al 2015 and li et al 2015 2019 did during urban landscaping the practice of ridging would save lots of money when compared with setting a gravel sand layer in addition to reduce irrigation frequencies and operating costs this study adopted two salt tolerant plants the ea and the aa these plants had salinity tolerance of around 6 ds m 1 falling between moderately sensitive to moderately tolerant rhoades et al 1992 the ece 60 changes in fig 6a indicated that the salinity remained below the tolerance threshold when the smp threshold was controlled above 10 kpa in the first two years and above 25 kpa in the third year the irrigation scheduling would save water and operating costs when compared with the daily irrigation for cultivating economic plant in the study of dou et al 2011 what s further the annual rainfall in study area of li et al 2015 2019 was around 600 mm which was far more than that in this area of 210 mm the adoption of salt tolerant plants was also a consideration of this rainfall deficit because the salt tolerant plants had higher salt tolerance thresholds which reduced the leaching requirements derived from sum of the irrigation and rainfall in general the combination of agronomic practices salt tolerant plants and drip irrigation scheduling in this study was a comprehensive method appropriate for the natural and economic conditions in this area the water and salt regulation methods for vegetation construction differ among locations for the diversities of their purposes climate type and groundwater conditions 5 conclusions soil salinity decreased quickly in the stages ⅰ and ⅱ and slowly decreased in stage ⅲ in stage ⅲ keeping the smp threshold above 10 kpa within one growing season maintained the ece 60 below the salt tolerance threshold of plants and reached a desalinization equilibrium state for smp thresholds between 15 and 25 kpa two growing seasons were required to achieve similar effects soil phe initially increased and then decreased during the desalinization process however the finally stable phe and sare values indicated decreases in soil alkalinity in all treatments the survival rates of trees and growth parameters of all plants reduced as smp thresholds decreased and the results indicated that the smp thresholds above 10 kpa in the second growing season and above 20 kpa in the third growing season were important to ensure plant growths a method was proposed for constructing an ecological forest system of salt tolerant plants the agronomic practices included ridging transplanting requirements and a drip irrigation schedule consisting of four stages ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ stage ⅰ lasts 3 5 days with continuous drip irrigation after planting stages ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ last approximately 45 days in the first growing season the rest of the first and the whole of the second growing season and the whole third season respectively and their corresponding smp thresholds for drip irrigation scheduling are 5 10 and 20 kpa declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

10288,ensuring water energy and food security with minimum damage to groundwater resources is a key challenge to achieve sustainable development in arid areas to address this scientific and policy challenge a multi criteria decision making mcdm nonlinear programming approach is developed for informing debates over improved management of the groundwater energy and food nexus that optimally allocates resources to food production to improve economic benefit and control groundwater depletion furthermore this approach is capable of evaluating management policies affecting resource planning at a regional level the approach is applied to the neishaboor basin in northeast iran the main results are i economic profit and food production depend on groundwater availability and energy use which raise environmental protection challenges ii the solutions could be used to define optimal policy strategies for sustainable management of groundwater energy food and simultaneously achieve economic and environmental goals iii improved irrigation efficiency would be considered as an efficient strategy under conditions of growing water scarcity the results of this research can inform policy makers on effective strategies for integrated groundwater energy and food planning graphical abstract ga1 keywords nonlinear optimization water energy food nexus optimal control groundwater 1 introduction in the recent decade population growth economic development and urbanization have caused a rise in the demand for agricultural products and consequently in energy and water consumption for food production karabulut et al 2016 it is predicted that pressure on these resources will increase in the near future demand for water energy and food is expected to increase by 30 50 in the next three decades bizikova et al 2013 water energy and food are deemed as the main resources for human life poverty reduction economic growth and development and there exist inseparable relationships between these resources wa el a et al 2018 it is an undeniable fact that food production is highly dependent on water and energy inputs so that in many cases these resources are irreplaceable with other inputs the access allocation and treatment of water require energy while energy production is directly and indirectly dependent on water flammini et al 2017 the three way linkages between these resources are known as the water energy food wef nexus decision making planning and adoption of management policies in one sector without considering their impacts on the other two sectors may cause an imbalance between these vital resources mannan et al 2018 the wef nexus is a useful tool for recognizing the complex interaction among these elements which can be employed to evaluate the utilization of resources and organize trade offs and synergies rasul 2014 the bonn nexus conference in 2011 emphasized that the increase of pressure on water energy and food can be a serious threat to sustainable development such that the lack of proper management of trade offs between these resources leads to social tensions regional and international conflicts and irreparable damage to the environment hoff 2011 ringler et al 2013 quantifying and recognizing the interlinkages between these three sources is regarded as a primary step to design policies that will improve wef security and ensure sustainable food production chang et al 2016 karnib 2018 a review of the literature shows that some studies have modeled the inter relations between water energy and food in the agricultural sector for instance li et al 2019 employed nonlinear multi objective programming under uncertainty to identify the interconnection among wef in the agricultural sector of northwest china el gafy et al 2017 proposed an optimal cropping pattern through solving a linear mathematical program that was able to maximize a wef nexus index jalilov et al 2016 formulated a dynamic optimization model to address the wef nexus in amu darya in central asia the simulation model was able to predict the cropping pattern water consumption and energy production by country what can be deduced from these studies is that the optimization models have been considered as efficient tools to quantify simulate and optimize the interlinkages among agricultural wef systems the precise quantification and identification of interlinkages between water energy and food are required in a quantitative model that incorporates all stakeholders interests which are often in conflict with each other regarding the groundwater energy food nexus management in dry and semi arid regions there is a significant conflict between economic benefits and environmental damages groundwater table drop land subsidence soil and water salinization due to over exploitation of groundwater resources mirzaei et al 2019 it is a serious challenge for policy makers to achieve a consensus solution that balances these conflicting goals in these conditions multi objective mo approaches are regarded as powerful instruments to reach an optimal compromise solution among several contrasting goals fuentes cortés et al 2019 this approach produces a set of pareto optimal solutions representing an optimal trade off between conflicting objectives so that improvement in one target is associated with the expense of other targets galan martin et al 2017 the analysis of these solutions provides useful information to policy and decision makers to choose an optimal compromise solution which best meets national and regional targets the ability to consider different dimensions of a problem using diverse objective functions leads the mo programming to have been implemented in many scientific studies dealing with the wef nexus dhaubanjar et al 2017 falconer et al 2020 garcia et al 2019 gonzález bravo et al 2018 hu et al 2019 ji et al 2020 li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 namany et al 2019 nie et al 2019 niu et al 2019 si et al 2019 sun et al 2020 uen et al 2018 wicaksono et al 2019 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 for example nie et al 2019 maximized profit and food yield while minimizing energy and water use as well as environmental penalty in a region in china the research of si et al 2019 used a mo optimization to quantify the trade off between the wef in the upper yellow river basin in this study they attempted to maximize water supply and food production benefits namany et al 2019 proposed a mo optimization to determine the optimal energy and water combination to ensure 40 self sufficiency in the perishable food production of qatar to achieve this goal they minimized the total cost of the food nexus system as well as environmental damages related to energy technologies wicaksono et al 2019 attempted to develop the wef nexus optimization model for quantifying the interlinkage among water energy and food under a climate change scenario in korea the authors employed a mo optimization to determine optimal resource allocation by maximizing user reliability index and total reliability index zhang et al 2018 developed a mo programming for agricultural drought management in the context of wef nexus to achieve the simultaneous objectives i e maximizing irrigation profit maximizing crop yield and minimizing the pumped water volume in the united states another research group gonzález bravo et al 2018 developed a mo programming to design a network of water distribution from the viewpoint of the wef nexus they optimized three objectives two objectives to maximize the gross profit and number of jobs and an objective to minimize the greenhouse gas emissions since the interlinkages between the wef nexus components are nonlinear it is necessary to use non linear models to quantify the complexity of the wef nexus system for example the link between crop yield and inputs is non linear typically this is usually modeled through non linear production functions due to the reasons proposed as above the use of nonlinear multi objective optimization nmop model is required further the mo optimization for wef nexus can provide the pareto frontier which consists of a series of optimal compromise solutions solutions which are non dominated hence it is challenging for decision makers to select the best desired solution thus the selection of one best of the best optimal solution that ensures the sustainable management of wef resources can be considered as a multi criteria decision making mcdm problem with goals to select optimal alternatives with multiple attributes mcdm approaches are deemed as effective tools to evaluate pareto solutions and choose a comprehensive solution among them jing et al 2019 mohammed et al 2019 while many previous studies only quantified the pareto frontier and neglected the decision making process thus to overcome these challenges developing a hybrid mcdm nmop approach is needed for managing the wef nexus the recognition and correct assessment of synergies and trade offs among water agriculture and energy have been more accentuated in developing countries reddy et al 2018 particularly in the arid and semi arid countries of the middle east badran et al 2017 borgomeo et al 2018 daher and mohtar 2015 keulertz and woertz 2015 which are suffering from the water crisis as well as increased demand for food and energy iran is one of the largest countries in the middle east which is located in an arid and semi arid climate the average annual rainfall in iran is about 240 mm which is less than 70 of the global average rainfall so that in many areas of the country lack of access to water has become a major obstacle to food production nevertheless having experienced war economic sanctions and consequently limited access to world trade iran s discourse on food security has focused on self sufficiency in iranian political literature self sufficiency means increasing food production and independence from other countries to meet domestic demand for food hence the expansion of the agricultural sector through subsidies to production inputs like water and energy has been intended as a strategic objective to meet food security and eliminate unemployment in rural areas notwithstanding irreversible damage to groundwater resources and the environment these environmental reactions became evident in dropping groundwater tables reducing water quality and the increasing cost of water pumping and extraction the increasing energy demand see fig 1 in the recent decade the adoption of incentive policies to increase production alongside the environmental and water crises due to inefficient policies and mismanagement in the agricultural sector has intensified the importance of proper implementation of the wef nexus approach nevertheless to the best of our knowledge no study has been done in iran using the optimization model considering the wef nexus concept to optimally allocate the limited resources to different sectors as well as to contribute to sustainable development it is worth noting that most part of iran have less than 100 mm annual rainfall consequently to overcome the intermittency of surface water supply the majority of the country s population is concentrated in areas that are heavily dependent on groundwater resources for drinking and agricultural irrigation nabavi 2018 due to this fact iran has become one of the largest consumers of groundwater in the globe basically over 75 of the country s water needs are served by this water resource based on the findings of dalin et al 2017 iran ranks second after india in terms of groundwater depletion associated with national food production over the past two decades that includes about 15 4 of global groundwater depletion for food production due to the special importance of groundwater and environmental problems associated with it in arid regions this study focuses on the sustainable management of groundwater therefore the present study aims to extend a novel approach for planning a groundwater energy and food nexus system the neishaboor basin in northeastern iran formed the location for the present case study the contribution of this paper is five fold first a nonlinear multi objective optimization nmop model is developed to quantify the trade off between the wef second this is likely the first study of its kind that has employed an integrated multi criterion decision making mcdm nmop approach to solve the wef nexus optimization problem third to our knowledge this approach has not been used previously in the sustainable management of wef resources in iran where access to adequate water resources food insecurity energy management as well as environmental problems are considered the main challenges of the government fourth this developed approach optimally determines crop patterns in different areas thereby improving economic benefit and reducing groundwater depletion fifth the results of this developed approach optimally allocates groundwater to food production domestic use and industrial uses in different areas and months the rest of the article is organized as follows the methodology and solution methods of the nmop wef approach are provided in section 2 the findings of the application of the developed model in iran s neishaboor basin are presented in section 3 finally the conclusion and policy implication are provided in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development as mentioned earlier there are the interlinkages between food production groundwater and energy in the agricultural system furthermore any decision in this system would not be effective without considering the environmental impacts therefore the development of an efficient model for sustainable management of these resources is required to take into account the negative environmental impacts of using these resources hence in this study a hybrid mcdm nmop wef model for the sustainable management of water energy and food is developed the proposed model aims to reconcile conflicts between socioeconomic and environmental development therefore the model uses two objective functions maximization of economic benefit and minimization of damage to freshwater resources the main constraints of the model are included groundwater availability energy availability crop pattern policy and food security the groundwater supplies for agriculture household and industry energy supplies for water supply and food production and the cultivated area of crops are regarded as the main decision variables the technical framework of the developed model is shown in fig 2 2 2 formulating the nmop wef model 2 2 1 objective functions the system s economic profit reflects economic development which is the primary concern of decision makers to achieve sustainable development besides economic development should not be associated with environmental costs hence the proposed model is developed using two objective functions in the first objective function the economic view of the water consumers farmers households and industrial units is considered by maximizing their groundwater use benefits in the second objective function the environmental managers concerns are considered by minimizing environmental damages 1 maximize groundwater use benefits the first objective is to maximize the economic profits of groundwater usage in agricultural industrial and domestic sectors that can be expressed as 1 max z 1 k 1 k i 1 i a i k p c i y c i k j 1 j i n c i j k t 1 t t a

calculated as follows 2 pwa k pe ec k where pe is the energy price usd kw h ec k is the energy required for pumping one cubic meter of water in region k reca et al 2015 3 ec k ϑ h k 3 6 10 6 τ k where ϑ is the specific weight of water n m3 h k is the pumping head in region k m and τ k is the pumping efficiency in region k in order to calculate domestic benefits households consumer surplus needs to be estimated the consumer surplus is the area under the water demand curve that shows the difference between the price that consumers pay and the price that they are willing to pay for a quantity of water supplied henderson et al 2015b in the current study the acquired benefits from household water uses domestic benefits are obtained from an inverse water demand curve firstly a log linear water demand function is considered based on this function there is a negative relationship between water price and water demand as well as a positive relationship between income and water demand that can be shown as follows 4 ln wdh k φ β ln i k ε ln pwh k where wdh k is the mean volume of water demand per month for one household in region k m3 i k is the mean household income per month in region k usd pwh k is domestic water price for one cubic meter in region k usd m3 φ is the constant coefficient β and ε are the income and price elasticities of demand respectively based on findings of falahi et al 2009 in the current study the values of β and ε are assumed to be 0 502 and 0 525 respectively to compute the household consumer surplus the inverse water demand curve is integrated at an interval between the level of normal water consumption wdh and the observed water consumption value wdh the integrated function is specified in the second part of eq 1 domestic benefits in this function np k is the number of households in region k regarding the industrial benefits due to the lack of industrial survey data using the approach of production function cannot be realized to industrial water demands therefore a modified approach employed for domestic benefit is used for industrial benefits the third part of eq 1 is related to the acquired benefits from industrial water uses industrial benefits that are derived from an inverse water demand curve as mentioned in the above in the first step it is required to define the industrial water demand function that is as follows 5 ln wdin k μ θ ln pwin k where wdin k is the mean volume of water demand per month for one industrial unit in region k m3 pwin k is the industrial water price for one cubic meter in region k usd m3 μ is the constant coefficient θ is the price elasticities of demand according to the results of rigi 2012 the value of θ is assumed to be 0 07 to calculate the industrial consumer surplus the

presented in the third part of eq 1 industrial benefits in this integrated expression n i n k is the number of industrial units in region k in this study to establish the link between crop yield and production inputs a quadratic function is employed because of decreasing marginal returns to additional inputs and substitutability of inputs cai et al 2008 the crop production function of crop i can be expressed as 6 y ik j 1 j x ijk α ijk 1 2 q 1 q β ijqk x ijk x ijk in this expression y ik x ijk is the yield of crop i x ijk is input j for crop i in region k respectively the symbols α ijk and β

as fixed at non water stressed yield given that the number of inputs n 6 27 parameters n n n 1 2 need to be estimated for each yield function in this condition using the traditional econometric methods generates unreliable results because of inadequate observations ill posed problem to overcome this problem following paris and howitt 1998 we use the generalized maximum entropy gme to estimate one set of yield functions of crops i for region k this method is able to estimate the coefficients with any sample size huang et al 2010 for further information about the details of the gme

2015a we consider a constraint for water supply to meet at least 50 of the crops water demand in fact this constraint guarantees the minimum amount of water required to grow crops 2 minimize the damage to groundwater resources the second objective function is related to minimize the damage to groundwater resources that is quantified through the surplus energy required mj to reinstate the

availability in region k 2 2 2 constrains 1 groundwater availability a food production the constraint on water availability for food production eq 11 shows that the amount of groundwater allocated for food production should not exceed allowed groundwater withdrawal for food production that is as follows 11 aw ikt a ik ϑ taw ikt j k t where aw ikt is the water requirement of crop i in the region k in period t ϑ is the technical efficiency of irrigation water use and taw ikt is the groundwater availability for the production of crop i in region k in period t b domestic uses the constraint on

epsilon constraint method epcm which is known as one of the most efficient methods compared with traditional methods such as weighting approaches this approach creates a valuable outcome of a set of pareto front solutions for policy and decision makers hence it provides more freedom in choosing the best solution ahmadi et al 2015 in the epcm one of the objectives is determined as a main objective and other objectives are transferred to the constraints section this constraint has the right hand side ε epsilon bounds the overall nonlinear bi objective programming model can be expressed as follows min f 1 x f 2 x s t 32 x s where function f 1 x is the economic profits of groundwater use eq 1 and function f 2 x is the environmental damage due to water depletion eq 8 in the epcm we optimize the function f 1 x as main objective and the function f 2 x is considered as constraints of the model that can be presented as follows max f 1 x s t f 2 x ε 1 33 x s the set of pareto front solutions are gained by solving eq 1 with different values of ε 1 thus the solution of mo problem is presented by a set of pareto points that represent the best trade off among two objectives f 1 x and f 2 x cai et al 2015 these solutions cannot be better off in one of the objective functions without degrading at least another objective value 2 4 the wef nexus indicators to evaluate and achieve a solution that ensures the sustainable management of wef resources from a set of pareto front solutions we need indicators that can properly quantify the nexus between resources based on the findings of el gafy 2017 the wef nexus indicators are holistic tools to evaluate the performance of wef nexus management accordingly we employ the wef nexus indicators which include water consumption wac energy consumption eng economic water productivity ecowp physical water productivity phwp economic energy productivity ecoep physical energy productivity phep as well as environmental damage env these indicators address the inter linkages between water food wac ecowp phwp and env water energy eng and energy food eng ecoep and phep see fig 3 for the first time the wef nexus indicators are applied to find the best pareto optimal solution water consumption wac this index indicates the total groundwater used its unit is 106 m3 inas et al 2017 radmehr et al 2020 the polarity of this attribute is negative lower is better energy consumption eng this index indicates the total energy used its unit is 106mj inas et al 2017 radmehr and shayanmehr 2018 the polarity of this attribute is negative economic water productivity ecowp this index implies the economic benefit derived per unit of groundwater used its unit is usd m3 inas et al 2017 radmehr et al 2020 the polarity of this attribute is positive greater is better physical water productivity phwp this index shows the mass of crop produced per unit of groundwater its unit is kg mj inas et al 2017 radmehr et al 2020 the polarity of this attribute is positive economic energy productivity ecoep this index represents the economic benefit derived per unit of energy used its unit is usd mj inas et al 2017 the polarity of this attribute is positive physical energy productivity phep this index indicates the mass of crop produced per unit of energy used its unit is kg mj inas et al 2017 the polarity of this attribute is positive environmental damages env this index is equivalent to the value of the second objective eq 8 the polarity of this attribute is negative 2 5 decision making method after pareto front solutions are calculated by the epcm the next step needs to select the best solution there have been introduced several decision making methods in order to select the best desired solution technique for order preferred preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis can be applied in the current study to achieve the best option the main advantages of this method are the ability to i depict the rationale of human choice shih et al 2007 ii evaluate the relative performance of alternatives based on the simple algorithm othman et al 2015 and iii define flexibly the selection set hsu et al 2009 based on this method one solution in the set of pareto front solutions is selected as the best solution when it has the minimum distance with the ideal solution and greatest distance from the negative ideal option ramesh et al 2012 this method involves six steps as follows i make a decision matrix in the first step it requires to build a decision matrix that can be expressed as follows 34 f 1 f 2 f j f n d a 1 a 2 a i a m f 11 f 12 f 1 j f 1 n f 21 f 22 f 2 j f 2 n f i 1 f i 2 f ij f in f m 1 f m 2 f mj f mn where a i is the alternative f j is the attribute and f ij is the performance value ii compute the normalized matrix d matrix nd as follows 35 n i j f i j j 1 n f i j 2 j 1 n i 1 m where n i j is the normalized score thus nd n i j m n iii compute the weighted matrix nd as follows 36 v i j n i j w j j 1 n i 1 m where wj is the weights of attributes iv define the positive a and negative a ideal options 37 a r 1 r 2 r n max r ij j ϵ j min r ij j ϵ j 38 a r 1 r 2 r n min r ij j ϵ j max r ij j ϵ j where j and j are the attributes with positive polarity and negative polarity v compute the distance of each a i from a d i and a d i 39 d i j 1 n w j r ij r j 2 i 1 m 40 d i j 1 n w j r ij r j 2 i

alternative with a higher value of c i is selected as a better solution 3 application 3 1 case study the neishaboor basin nb in razavi khorasan province iran is chosen as the study area fig 4 nb is located at longitude 58 17 59 30 e and latitude 35 40 36 39 n with a total area of approximately 7 35 103 km2 that includes two areas of mountainous 3 16 103 km2 and plain 4 19 103 km2 this area is characterised by semi arid to arid climate with a potential evaporation of 2040 2760 mm y a mean annual rainfall of 180 360 mm y as well as average annual temperature of 13 13 8 c hoseini et al 2005 the nb was divided into seventeen rural districts over the last decades over extraction of the neishaboor aquifer has led to a decrease in the groundwater table by about 1 m y drastic groundwater table decline in the nb becomes manifest in the increasing cost of energy for water pumping land subsidence and a considerable reduction in water quality nazarieh et al 2018 these environmental threats have been main cause of the prohibition of nb groundwater resources development since 1986 the current situation the mean annual amount of groundwater withdrawal from the nb is about 920 106 m3 the agriculture uses 96 of groundwater resources and is deemed as the largest consumer of these resources in this area while domestic and industrial sectors use 3 5 and 0 5 of groundwater resources respectively these groundwater resources have played a key role in meeting food security in this area the total energy consumption for food production in this area is about 550 106mj the main crops in this area include wheat whe barley bar seedy watermelon wat tomato tom alfalfa alf sugar beet sug corn cor onion oni and melon mel 3 2 data preparation the required data regarding technical coefficients and the cost of inputs were collected through face to face interviews with farmers during farming activities that the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 fig 5 depicts the information about the current crop patterns and the population in each individual rural district that was gathered from annual reports of the khorasan razavi regional water authority and the statistical center of iran respectively among them the number of industrial units was obtained from the report of the khorasan razavi chamber of commerce industries mines and agriculture based on this report industrial parks are in the fi 8 units ze 239 units and ta 13 units the required parameters for the calculation of environmental objective function for each rural districts are shown in table 3 lower values of environmental damages imply less level of vulnerability to groundwater consumption table 3 shows the energy required for pumping one cubic meter of groundwater in each rural district that is calculated by eq 5 the required data to compute these coefficients were collected from the khorasan razavi regional water authority table 4 shows the information about net water consumption mean yield and price of crops which are obtained from the khorasan razavi agriculture jihad organization table 5 indicates the energy equivalent of inputs that are employed to calculate the energy consumption for food production these parameters are obtained from several literature sources 3 3 irrigation efficiency scenarios in the neishaboor basin about 40 of the water allocated to agriculture irrigates the crops and the remainder is lost which is mainly due to the low level of irrigation technology and inadequate infrastructure in this area hence the improvement of irrigation efficiency is deemed as one of the most effective tools to increase the level of food production and conservation of water resources in this section the following two schemes are implemented to examine the potential changes in the wef nexus under irrigation efficiency scenarios 20 increase in irrigation efficiency from 40 to 60 s1 40 increase in irrigation efficiency and a 10 increase in irrigated land availability it is expected that with the increase in irrigation efficiency all available irrigated land will be used consequently part of the dryland land may be used for irrigated crops therefore the scenario assumes a 10 increase in irrigated land availability s2 4 results and discussion to analyze the nmop wef model the gams software and conopt 4 solver are employed the section of results and discussion consists of five parts pareto frontier analysis decision making water energy and food production analysis optimization of objective functions and irrigation efficiency and wef nexus 4 1 pareto frontier analysis in the first step the pareto front solutions are calculated for the main problem involving two objective functions maximize groundwater use benefits while simultaneously minimizing the environmental damage caused by groundwater extraction to generate pareto points firstly minimum and maximum values for two objective functions are computed these values for economic and environmental objectives are min 41 54 max ideal solution 95 68 as well as min ideal solution 922 51 max 2181 09 respectively in the next step the epcm is used to solve the nmop wef model optimize the two objectives and produce the pareto front points in the epcm the groundwater use benefits are maximized as the main objective and the environmental objective is transferred to the constraint part of the problem with right hand side epsilon value to obtain epsilon values we divide the interval among two values into 10 points eventually the pareto front solutions see fig 6 are obtained through solving the non linear optimization model with different epsilon values moreover fig 6 shows the extreme points in red the solutions of a1 and a10 provide the least environmental damage and the greatest economic benefits respectively compared to other solutions it is interesting to note that the environmental damages increase dramatically with the rise of the economic benefits of groundwater use the reason could be that the increase of economic benefits of water use is usually associated with a growth in groundwater extraction consequently environmental degradation is a likely outcome 4 2 decision making in the nmop wfe models the selection of the solution that is able to best serve the goals of policymakers could be a critical challenge in adopting effective policies hence in the current study we employ topsis to select the best solution from the pareto sets based on water energy food nexus indicators the weight of the criteria is assumed to be the same 14 28 of the criteria wac enc and env have negative polarity lower is better as well as ecowp phwap ecoenp and phenp have positive polarity greater is better table 6 indicates the value of the wef nexus indicators in each of the pareto solutions the decision matrix is obtained using the data in this table table 7 reveals the normalized decision matrix that is calculated by the eq 35 fig 7 indicates how the positive and negative ideal solutions are spread out through the different wef nexus indicators it needs to note that in the ideal points all the positive indicators ecowp phwp ecoep and phep are maximal and the negative indicators wac eng and env are minimal in the non ideal points all the positive indicators are minimal and negative indicators are maximal before explaining the findings of the ranking of the solutions it is interesting to note that the increase of economic benefits on the one hand leads to a deteriorating situation for the criteria with negative polarity and on the other hand improves the situation for the criteria with positive polarity results in specific detail regarding water food and energy will be discussed in the next sections as mentioned previously the best solution has the highest ci value whereas the worst solution has less ci value table 8 shows the results of the calculated ci values based on the results of this table policymakers can select the best solution among all pareto points according to their preference subsequently the best solution mo is a5 since it has the highest ci values 0 705 in the following section the details of the results of this solution are presented along with the results of single objectives 4 3 water energy and food production analysis fig 8 presents the water and energy allocation for each agricultural product and rural district under the extreme solutions and the best solution the results reveal that when the only objective is economic profits wpmax total water and energy allocations are 860 44 106 m3 and 398 61 106 mj respectively water and energy allocations in this solution are at the highest level compared to other solutions because maximum profits are usually associated with more water and energy consumption on the other hand when the objective is to minimize environmental damage wdmin total water and energy allocations are 594 71 106 m3 and 327 11 106 mj respectively the values of allocated water and energy in this point are at the lowest level compared with other solutions because to minimize the damage of groundwater resources it is necessary to reduce groundwater extraction consequently energy consumption also decreases in this condition for the best solution total water and energy allocations are 735 78 106 m3 and 348 41 106 mj respectively it is worth noting that the amount of allocated water in this solution is closer to the amount of allocated water in the economic objective model showing that the water consumption plays a more important role than energy consumption in generating economic benefit in the nb as observed in fig 8 the allocations of groundwater and energy are closely associated with crop patterns the results of fig 8 show that in three solutions a significant portion of groundwater and energy resources in each rural district is allocated to wheat and barley given that the priority of decision makers is to meet food security by expanding the cultivation of strategic crops such as wheat and barley these crops are the largest consumers of groundwater and energy in the study area moreover water and energy allocation to seedy watermelon tomato and corn is highly dependent on water and energy availability for instance the values of water allocated to seedy watermelon tomato and corn are reduced by 78 80 and 76 respectively and for energy the percentages were 79 80 and 75 respectively in the wdmin compared to wpmax these findings indicate a strong positive correlation between groundwater and energy resources the results regarding the land allocation to different crops in each rural district under three solutions are presented in fig 9 as expected an increase in water and energy allocation results in an expansion of the cultivated area the total land allocated for food production under the wpmax is almost 29 greater than the wdmin in all three solutions wheat barley seedy watermelon and corn respectively have the largest cultivated areas in the study area the total land utilizes under the wpmax for wheat barley seedy watermelon and corn are 33 31 103 19 55 103 7 99 103 and 4 56 103 ha respectively for the wdmin are 26 84 103 19 55 103 1 70 103 and 1 15 103 ha respectively and for the mo are 26 84 103 19 55 103 7 36 103 and 3 20 103 ha respectively another aspect that needs to be addressed is the assessment of the impact of the implementation of environmental solutions on food production in different rural districts specifically for the wdmin the rural districts such as fi es pi and ro which have the least environmental vulnerability to the water extraction see table 3 the total of cultivated areas is approximately unchanged compared to the wpmax whereas the rural districts with greatest environmental vulnerability to water extraction such as or ba tj ma ze and bi experience the highest decrease in cultivated areas so that the land use differences between wpmax and wdmin in the rural district of or ba tj ma ze and bi are 76 74 75 60 73 and 75 respectively fig 10 presents the monthly distribution of groundwater use for three sectors of agriculture domestic and industry under the wpmax wdmin and mo according to the findings of fig 10 under three solutions agriculture uses most of the groundwater extracted throughout the year except in february domestic use is more than other sectors followed by domestic and industrial sectors the annual percentages of groundwater allocated to agriculture industry and domestic under the wpmax are 95 07 4 55 and 0 38 respectively for the wdmin are 94 29 5 27 and 0 44 respectively and for the mo are 94 25 5 24 and 0 51 respectively in the aspect of solutions as expected the volume of water allocated is lowest in the wdmin and highest in the wpmax in all months it is interesting to note that because of the high economic profit of water use and less dependency on seasonal variation in both the industrial and domestic sectors the water allocated to these two sectors have the least fluctuations unlike agriculture however the volume of groundwater allocated to the domestic sector is lowest in winter january february and highest in summer july september under the three solutions most of the groundwater allocated to agriculture about 90 is for five months from april to august under the three solutions moreover the findings also show that the electricity use is more related to groundwater consumption see fig 11 4 4 optimization of objective functions fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of the values of the two conflicting objectives maximum economic profit and minimum resource depletion under two extreme solutions wpmax wdmin and the best solution mo figs 12a and 12d present the groundwater use benefits and damage to groundwater resources under wpmax it is very clear from fig 12a that some of the rural districts which are in the northern mz and tj and eastern ze parts of the nb obtain the greatest groundwater benefits as expected because the majority of agricultural land domestic consumers and industrial units are located in these districts it is noteworthy that the most damage to resources is observed in these areas see fig 12d as can be seen from fig 12d unlike the northern and eastern areas the larger number of southern areas experience the minimum resource depletion due to the least environmental vulnerability to water use figs 12b and 12e indicate the value of economic and environmental objectives under wdmin the findings show when the decision makers only aim to protect groundwater resources groundwater extraction is eliminated especially in the districts with a high vulnerability to groundwater depletion consequently the economic benefits generated from groundwater in these areas are significantly decreased see fig 12b in this condition the concentration of food production will shift from the northern and eastern rural districts to the southern ones as well as the extent of resource depletion is diminished in the districts with a high vulnerability to groundwater withdrawal see fig 12e in this solution compared with wpmax the amount of the damage to groundwater resources and economic benefits reduces from 2181 09 106 to 992 51 106 mj 54 49 and from 95 68 to 41 54 m usd 56 58 respectively finally figs 12c and 12f show the value of economic and environmental objectives under the best solution mo as previously mentioned this point provides a compromise solution between two conflicting objectives as fig 12c shows the economic activities in some areas with high vulnerability to groundwater withdrawals such as ma or ro and ze are significantly reduced hence the extent of resource depletion and economic benefits are reduced more than wpmax in these areas see fig 12f the best solution compared to wpmax has less economic benefits 10 96 and environmental damage 43 38 and compared with wdmin has more economic benefits 52 and environmental damage 35 4 5 irrigation efficiency and wef nexus fig 13 shows pareto front solutions under the two scenarios based on the topsis the best solution mo is a3 in blue in both scenarios table 9 shows the impacts of increasing irrigation efficiency on the value of objective functions land use and energy consumption as well as the volume of groundwater withdrawal as the findings of table 9 indicate rising irrigation efficiency leads to an increase in irrigated areas consequently food production would be increased specifically in s1 under wpmax all available land would be used an increase of 13439 ha also in s2 under wpmax irrigated cultivated areas would be increased dramatically an increase of 21641 ha this could be because the improvement of irrigation efficiency also allows cultivating low profit crops therefore under wpmax the total groundwater use benefit would increase from 102 14 s1 to 110 30 m usd s2 in this study the annual cost of increasing irrigation efficiency is not included although it should not be greater than estimated profit table 9 shows that increasing irrigation efficiency has a positive impact on groundwater conservation for example in the second scenario s2 under the best solution mo groundwater withdrawals would reduce significantly to 46 of the basic situation under this solution consequently the damage to water resources decreases dramatically to 46 of the basic situation under this solution compared to the base case under mo the second scenario s2 allows decreasing the energy demand for groundwater withdrawal a decrease of 30 but due to the increase in the irrigated cultivated areas total energy consumption would increase by 1 fig 14 indicates the spatial distribution of the profit generated and resource depletion in the second scenario s2 under the best solution mo compared to figs 14c and 14f the mo in the second scenario s2 allows increasing the economic benefit while the damage to resource depletion is decreased in all rural districts the extent of resource depletion is especially dramatically declined in the areas with a high vulnerability to groundwater withdrawal northern and eastern areas 5 conclusion in this study a mcdm nonlinear programming approach is developed for forming debates over improved management of the groundwater energy and food nexus the proposed approach has the capability to i address the trade offs among groundwater energy and food production in the context of sustainable management through the simultaneous optimization of economic benefit maximize groundwater benefit uses and environmental target minimize the damage to groundwater resources ii be used as a tool to design strategies and select effective solutions for wef management and iii examine the effects of management policies on food production groundwater use and energy consumption at a regional level this developed approach is applied to the neishaboor basin nb an arid and semi arid area in the northeast of iran the main results of this study are summarized as follows i economic profit and food production are positively associated with groundwater availability and energy use which raises environmental protection challenges ii the solutions that could be used to define optimal policy strategies for sustainable management of groundwater energy food and simultaneously achieve economic and environmental goals iii a significant share of groundwater energy and land resources would be allocated to strategic crops wheat and barley due to their importance in meeting food security iv the improvement of irrigation efficiency could play a considerable role in controlling groundwater depletion and increasing economic profit and food production hence it would be considered as an efficient strategy under conditions of growing water scarcity in entirety a novel approach is developed to quantify and recognize the nexus between groundwater energy and food in a dry region so that it can be extended to other arid and semi arid regions that are highly dependent on groundwater resources although the findings of the current study give a comprehensive insight into the sustainable management of wef an agent based approach can be performed to select practical solutions that consider the conflicting interests of the stakeholders hence the integration of multi agent based modeling and mcdm nmop approach can be addressed in future studies in a practical wef nexus management groundwater availability water and energy consumptions food production and interlinkage between resources may be influenced by weather conditions input and product price fluctuations and other factors thus further research is needed to quantitatively addressee and incorporated these uncertain factors into the developed approach to increase model s practicality besides the focus of the current study is only on groundwater hence to improve the applicability of the mcdm nmop other water sources such as surface water need to be considered

10288,ensuring water energy and food security with minimum damage to groundwater resources is a key challenge to achieve sustainable development in arid areas to address this scientific and policy challenge a multi criteria decision making mcdm nonlinear programming approach is developed for informing debates over improved management of the groundwater energy and food nexus that optimally

at a regional level the approach is applied to the neishaboor basin in northeast iran the main results are i economic profit and food production depend on groundwater availability and energy use which raise environmental protection challenges ii the solutions could be used to define optimal policy strategies for sustainable management of groundwater energy food and simultaneously achieve economic and environmental goals iii improved irrigation efficiency would be considered as an efficient strategy under conditions of growing water scarcity the results of this research can inform policy makers on effective strategies for integrated groundwater energy and food planning graphical abstract ga1 keywords nonlinear optimization water energy food nexus optimal control groundwater 1 introduction in the recent decade population growth economic development and urbanization have caused a rise in the demand for agricultural products and consequently in energy and water consumption for food production karabulut et al 2016 it is predicted that pressure on these resources will increase in the near future demand for water energy and food is expected to increase by 30 50 in the next three decades bizikova et al 2013 water energy and food are deemed as the main resources for human life poverty reduction economic growth and development and there exist inseparable relationships between these resources wa el a et al 2018 it is an undeniable fact that food production is highly dependent on water and energy inputs so that in many cases these resources are irreplaceable with other inputs the access allocation and treatment of water require energy while energy production is directly and indirectly dependent on water flammini et al 2017 the three way linkages between these resources are known as the water energy food wef nexus decision making planning and adoption of management policies in one sector without considering their impacts on the other two sectors may cause an imbalance between these vital resources mannan et al 2018 the wef nexus is a useful tool for recognizing the complex interaction among these elements which can be employed to evaluate the utilization of resources and organize trade offs and synergies rasul 2014 the bonn nexus conference in 2011 emphasized that the increase of pressure on water energy and food can be a serious threat to sustainable development such that the lack of proper management of trade offs between these resources leads to social tensions regional and international conflicts and irreparable damage to the environment hoff 2011 ringler et al 2013 quantifying and recognizing the interlinkages between these three sources is regarded as a primary step to design policies that will improve wef security and ensure sustainable food production chang et al 2016 karnib 2018 a review of the literature shows that some studies have modeled the inter relations between water energy and food in the agricultural sector for instance li et al 2019 employed nonlinear multi objective programming under uncertainty to identify the interconnection among wef in the agricultural sector of northwest china el gafy et al 2017 proposed an optimal cropping pattern through solving a linear mathematical program that was able to maximize a wef nexus index jalilov et al 2016 formulated a dynamic optimization model to address the wef nexus in amu darya in central asia the simulation model was able to predict the cropping pattern water consumption and energy production by country what can be deduced from these studies is that the optimization models have been considered as efficient tools to quantify simulate and optimize the interlinkages among agricultural wef systems the precise quantification and identification of interlinkages between water energy and food are required in a quantitative model that incorporates all stakeholders interests which are often in conflict with each other regarding the groundwater energy food nexus management in dry and semi arid regions there is a significant conflict between economic benefits and environmental damages groundwater table drop land subsidence soil and water salinization due to over exploitation of groundwater resources mirzaei et al 2019 it is a serious challenge for policy makers to achieve a consensus solution that balances these conflicting goals in these conditions multi objective mo approaches are regarded as powerful instruments to reach an optimal compromise solution among several contrasting goals fuentes cortés et al 2019 this approach produces a set of pareto optimal solutions representing an optimal trade off between conflicting objectives so that improvement in one target is associated with the expense of other targets galan martin et al 2017 the analysis of these solutions provides useful information to policy and decision makers to choose an optimal compromise solution which best meets national and regional targets the ability to consider different dimensions of a problem using diverse objective functions leads the mo programming to have been implemented in many scientific studies dealing with the wef nexus dhaubanjar et al 2017 falconer et al 2020 garcia et al 2019 gonzález bravo et al 2018 hu et al 2019 ji et al 2020 li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 namany et al 2019 nie et al 2019 niu et al

and water use as well as environmental penalty in a region in china the research of si et al 2019 used a mo optimization to quantify the trade off between the wef in the upper yellow river basin in this study they attempted to maximize water supply and food production benefits namany et al 2019 proposed a mo optimization to determine the optimal energy and water combination to ensure 40 self sufficiency in the perishable food production of qatar to achieve this goal they minimized the total cost of the food nexus system as well as environmental damages related to energy technologies wicaksono et al 2019 attempted to develop the wef nexus optimization model for quantifying the interlinkage among water energy and food under a climate change scenario in korea the authors employed a mo optimization to determine optimal resource allocation by maximizing user reliability index and total reliability index zhang et al 2018 developed a mo programming for agricultural drought management in the context of wef nexus to achieve the simultaneous objectives i e maximizing irrigation profit maximizing crop yield and minimizing the pumped water volume in the united states another research group gonzález bravo et al 2018 developed a mo programming to design a network of water distribution from the viewpoint of the wef nexus they optimized three objectives two objectives to maximize the gross profit and number of jobs and an objective to minimize the greenhouse gas emissions since the interlinkages between the wef nexus components are nonlinear it is necessary to use non linear models to quantify the complexity of the wef nexus system for example the link between crop yield and inputs is non linear typically this is usually modeled through non linear production functions due to the reasons proposed as above the use of nonlinear multi objective optimization nmop model is required further the mo optimization for wef nexus can provide the pareto frontier which consists of a series of optimal compromise solutions solutions which are non dominated hence it is challenging for decision makers to select the best desired solution thus the selection of one best of the best optimal solution that ensures the sustainable management of wef resources can be considered as a multi criteria decision making mcdm problem with goals to select optimal alternatives with multiple attributes mcdm approaches are deemed as effective tools to evaluate pareto solutions and choose a comprehensive solution among them jing et al 2019 mohammed et al 2019 while many previous studies only quantified the pareto frontier and neglected the decision making process thus to overcome these challenges developing a hybrid mcdm nmop approach is needed for managing the wef nexus the recognition and correct assessment of synergies and trade offs among water agriculture and energy have been more accentuated in developing countries reddy et al 2018 particularly in the arid and semi arid countries of the middle east badran et al 2017 borgomeo et al 2018 daher and mohtar 2015 keulertz and woertz 2015 which are suffering from the water crisis as well as increased demand for food and energy iran is one of the largest countries in the middle east which is located in an arid and semi arid climate the average annual rainfall in iran is about 240 mm which is less than 70 of the global average rainfall so that in many areas of the country lack of access to water has become a major obstacle to food production nevertheless having experienced war economic sanctions and consequently limited access to world trade iran s discourse on food security has focused on self sufficiency in iranian political literature self sufficiency means increasing food production and independence from other countries to meet domestic demand for food hence the expansion of the agricultural sector through subsidies to production inputs like water and energy has been intended as a strategic objective to meet food security and eliminate unemployment in rural areas notwithstanding irreversible damage to groundwater resources and the environment these environmental reactions became evident in dropping groundwater tables reducing water quality and the increasing cost of water pumping and extraction the increasing energy demand see fig 1 in the recent decade the adoption of incentive policies to increase production alongside the environmental and water crises due to inefficient policies and mismanagement in the agricultural sector has intensified the importance of proper implementation of the wef nexus approach nevertheless to the best of our knowledge no study has been done in iran using the optimization model considering the wef nexus concept to optimally allocate the limited resources to different sectors as well as to contribute to sustainable development it is worth noting that most part of iran have less than 100 mm annual rainfall consequently to overcome the intermittency of surface water supply the majority of the country s population is concentrated in areas that are heavily dependent on groundwater resources for drinking and agricultural irrigation nabavi 2018 due to this fact iran has become one of the largest consumers of groundwater in the globe basically over 75 of the country s water needs are served by this water resource based on the findings of dalin et al 2017 iran ranks second after india in terms of groundwater depletion associated with national food production over the past two decades that includes about 15 4 of global groundwater depletion for food production due to the special importance of groundwater and environmental problems associated with it in arid regions this study focuses on the sustainable management of groundwater therefore the present study aims to extend a novel approach for planning a groundwater energy and food nexus system the neishaboor basin in northeastern iran formed the location for the present case study the contribution of this paper is five fold first a nonlinear multi objective optimization nmop model is developed to quantify the trade off between the wef second this is likely the first study of its kind that has employed an integrated multi criterion decision making mcdm nmop approach to solve the wef nexus optimization problem third to our knowledge this approach has not been used previously in the sustainable management of wef resources in iran where access to adequate water resources food insecurity energy management as well as environmental problems are considered the main challenges of the government fourth this developed approach optimally determines crop patterns in different areas thereby improving economic benefit and reducing groundwater depletion fifth the results of this developed approach optimally allocates groundwater to food production domestic use and industrial uses in different areas and months the rest of the article is organized as follows the methodology and solution methods of the nmop wef approach are provided in section 2 the findings of the application of the developed model in iran s neishaboor basin are presented in section 3 finally the conclusion and policy implication are provided in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development as mentioned earlier there are the interlinkages between food production groundwater and energy in the agricultural system furthermore any decision in this system would not be effective without considering the environmental impacts therefore the development of an efficient model for sustainable management of these resources is required to take into account the negative environmental impacts of using these resources hence in this study a hybrid mcdm nmop wef model for the sustainable management of water energy and food is developed the proposed model aims to reconcile conflicts between socioeconomic and environmental development therefore the model uses two objective functions maximization of economic benefit and minimization of damage to freshwater resources the main constraints of the model are included groundwater availability energy availability crop pattern policy and food security the groundwater supplies for agriculture household and industry energy supplies for water supply and food production and the cultivated area of crops are regarded as the main decision variables the technical framework of the developed model is shown in fig 2 2 2 formulating the nmop wef model 2 2 1 objective functions the system s economic profit reflects economic development which is the primary concern of decision makers to achieve sustainable development besides economic development should not be associated with environmental costs hence the proposed model is developed using two objective functions in the first objective function the economic view of the water consumers farmers households and industrial units is considered by maximizing their groundwater use benefits in the second objective function the environmental managers concerns are considered by minimizing environmental damages 1 maximize groundwater use benefits the first objective is to maximize the economic profits of groundwater usage in agricultural industrial and domestic sectors that can be expressed as 1 max z 1 k 1 k i 1 i a i k p c i y c i k j 1 j i n c i j k t 1 t t a

calculated as follows 2 pwa k pe ec k where pe is the energy price usd kw h ec k is the energy required for pumping one cubic meter of water in region k reca et al 2015 3 ec k ϑ h k 3 6 10 6 τ k where ϑ is the specific weight of water n m3 h k is the pumping head in region k m and τ k is the pumping efficiency in region k in order to calculate domestic benefits households consumer surplus needs to be estimated the consumer surplus is the area under the water demand curve that shows the difference between the price that consumers pay and the price that they are willing to pay for a quantity of water supplied henderson et al 2015b in the current study the acquired benefits from household water uses domestic benefits are obtained from an inverse water demand curve firstly a log linear water demand function is considered based on this function there is a negative relationship between water price and water demand as well as a positive relationship between income and water demand that can be shown as follows 4 ln wdh k φ β ln i k ε ln pwh k where wdh k is the mean volume of water demand per month for one household in region k m3 i k is the mean household income per month in region k usd pwh k is domestic water price for one cubic meter in region k usd m3 φ is the constant coefficient β and ε are the income and price elasticities of demand respectively based on findings of falahi et al 2009 in the current study the values of β and ε are assumed to be 0 502 and 0 525 respectively to compute the household consumer surplus the inverse water demand curve is integrated at an interval between the level of normal water consumption wdh and the observed water consumption value wdh the integrated function is specified in the second part of eq 1 domestic benefits in this function np k is the number of households in region k regarding the industrial benefits due to the lack of industrial survey data using the approach of production function cannot be realized to industrial water demands therefore a modified approach employed for domestic benefit is used for industrial benefits the third part of eq 1 is related to the acquired benefits from industrial water uses industrial benefits that are derived from an inverse water demand curve as mentioned in the above in the first step it is required to define the industrial water demand function that is as follows 5 ln wdin k μ θ ln pwin k where wdin k is the mean volume of water demand per month for one industrial unit in region k m3 pwin k is the industrial water price for one cubic meter in region k usd m3 μ is the constant coefficient θ is the price elasticities of demand according to the results of rigi 2012 the value of θ is assumed to be 0 07 to calculate the industrial consumer surplus the inverse water demand curve is integrated between the level of normal water consumption in the industrial sector wdin and observed water to the industrial sector wdin the integrated function is presented in the third part of eq 1 industrial benefits in this integrated expression n i n k is the number of industrial units in region k in this study to establish the link between crop yield and production inputs a quadratic function is employed because of decreasing marginal returns to additional inputs and substitutability of inputs cai et al 2008 the crop production function of crop i can be expressed as 6 y ik j 1 j x ijk α ijk 1 2 q 1 q β ijqk x ijk x ijk in this expression y ik x ijk is the yield of crop i x ijk is input j for crop i in region k respectively the symbols α ijk and β ijqk denote the input coefficients the set of j is included labor machinery chemical fertilizers nitrogen phosphate and potassium manure and pesticides in the production function water is considered as fixed at non water stressed yield given that the number of inputs n 6 27 parameters n n n 1 2 need to be estimated for each yield function in this condition using the traditional econometric methods generates unreliable results because of inadequate observations ill posed problem to overcome this problem following paris and howitt 1998 we use the generalized maximum entropy gme to estimate one set of yield functions of crops i for region k this method is able to estimate the coefficients with any sample size huang et al 2010 for further information about the details of the gme method see paris and howitt 1998 to quantify the link between crop yield and water scarcity the water yield function defined by mannocchi and mecarelli 1994 is utilized 7 yc ik yp ik t 1 t 1 ky t 1 was itk wad itk where yc ik and yp ik are actual yield and potential yield maximum yield when water required for crop c is in full supply of crop i in region k respectively ky t is yield response coefficient of crop c in month t wad itk is water demand of crop i in region k and month t was itk is water supply to crop i in region k and period t a decision variable following henderson et al 2015a we consider a constraint for water supply to meet at least 50 of the crops water demand in fact this constraint guarantees the minimum amount of water required to grow crops 2 minimize the damage to groundwater resources the second objective function is related to minimize the damage to groundwater resources that is quantified through the surplus energy required mj to reinstate the freshwater depleted from the desalination of seawater 8 min z 2 k 1 k e d f d k t 1 t t a w t k t h w t k t i n w t k where ed is the energy needed to desalinate one cubic seawater mj m3 fd k is a

where wta k is ratio of total annual groundwater withdrawals in region k to annual water availability in region k mu k is the total annual groundwater withdrawals in region k and wa k is annual water availability in region k 2 2 2 constrains 1 groundwater availability a food production the constraint on water availability for food production eq 11 shows that the amount of groundwater allocated for food production should not exceed allowed groundwater withdrawal for food production that is as follows 11 aw ikt a ik ϑ taw ikt j k t where aw ikt is the water requirement of crop i in the region k in period t ϑ is the technical efficiency of irrigation water use and taw ikt is the groundwater availability for the production of crop i in region k in period t b domestic uses the constraint on water required for domestic uses eq 12 states that the amount of groundwater allocated for household consumptions should be less than the groundwater availability for domestic uses 12 np k wdh kt γ tdw kt k t where γ is the efficiency coefficient of water allocation for domestic uses tdw kt is groundwater availability for domestic uses in region k in period t c industrial uses the constraint on

food production ef is divided into two categories indirect and indirect energy consumption the direct energy consumption forms include electricity or fuel and indirect energy consumption forms include the fertilizers and chemical inputs rao et al 2019 energy consumption for food production is defined as follows ef ik qm ik em i ql ik el i qdf ik edf i qn ik en i qph ik eph ik qpo ik epo ik qel ik

total energy available for food production in region k 4 total energy use the energy availability for food production and groundwater pumping should not be greater the total energy available for these purposes in region k tea k that is as follows 18 edf k eel te k teag k tea k k where teag k is the total electricity availability for agriculture 5 crop pattern policy the importance of farmers indigenous knowledge and skill in the cultivation of crops in any region on the one hand and on the other maintaining crop diversification as well as providing food requirements are strong reasons to consider a lower and upper bound for each crop in region k this constraint can be presented in eq 19 19 a ik min a ik a ik max i k where a ik min is the lower bound of planting area for crop i in region k a ik max is the upper bound of planting area for crop i in region k 6 land area land allocated to different crops in region k should not be greater than the total available land in each region that can be presented as follows 20 i 1 i a ik ta k k where ta k is the total available land in region k 7 food security self sufficiency in strategic crops has been introduced as a fundamental tool to meet food security hence the sum of cultivated areas strategic crops should at least be higher than 70 current cultivated areas of these crops wheat and barley are the main strategic crops in iran that is as follows 21 k 1 k a ik a i 0 1 i which are strategic crops where a i 0 is the current cultivated area of the strategic crops wheat or barley and is assumed 0 3 8 input availability

epsilon constraint method epcm which is known as one of the most efficient methods compared with traditional methods such as weighting approaches this approach creates a valuable outcome of a set of pareto front solutions for policy and decision makers hence it provides more freedom in choosing the best solution ahmadi et al 2015 in the epcm one of the objectives is determined as a main objective and other objectives are transferred to the constraints section this constraint has the right hand side ε epsilon bounds the overall nonlinear bi objective programming model can be expressed as follows min f 1 x f 2 x s t 32 x s where function f 1 x is the economic profits of groundwater use eq 1 and function f 2 x is the environmental damage due to water depletion eq 8 in the epcm we optimize the function f 1 x as main objective and the function f 2 x is considered as constraints of the model that can be presented as follows max f 1 x s t f 2 x ε 1 33 x s the set of pareto front solutions are gained by solving eq 1 with different values of ε 1 thus the solution of mo problem is presented by a set of pareto points that represent the best trade off among two objectives f 1 x and f 2 x cai et al 2015 these solutions cannot be better off in one of the objective functions without degrading at least another objective value 2 4 the wef nexus indicators to evaluate and achieve a solution that ensures the sustainable management of wef resources from a set of pareto front solutions we need indicators that can properly quantify the nexus between resources based on the findings of el gafy 2017 the wef nexus indicators are holistic tools to evaluate the performance of wef nexus management accordingly we employ the wef nexus indicators which include water consumption wac energy consumption eng economic water productivity ecowp physical water productivity phwp economic energy productivity ecoep physical energy productivity phep as well as environmental damage env these indicators address the inter linkages between water food wac ecowp phwp and env water energy eng and energy food eng ecoep and phep see fig 3 for the first time the wef nexus indicators are applied to find the best pareto optimal solution water consumption wac this index indicates the total groundwater used its unit is 106 m3 inas et al 2017 radmehr et al 2020 the polarity of this attribute is negative lower is better energy consumption eng this index indicates the total energy used its unit is 106mj inas et al 2017 radmehr and shayanmehr 2018 the polarity of this attribute is negative economic water productivity ecowp this index implies the economic benefit derived per unit of groundwater used its unit is usd m3 inas et al 2017 radmehr et al 2020 the polarity of this attribute is

attribute is positive economic energy productivity ecoep this index represents the economic benefit derived per unit of energy used its unit is usd mj inas et al 2017 the polarity of this attribute is positive physical energy productivity phep this index indicates the mass of crop produced per unit of energy used its unit is kg mj inas et al 2017 the polarity of this attribute is positive environmental damages env this index is equivalent to the value of the second objective eq 8 the polarity of this attribute is negative 2 5 decision making method after pareto front solutions are calculated by the epcm the next step needs to select the best solution there have been introduced several decision making methods in order to select the best desired solution technique for order preferred preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis can be applied in the current study to achieve the best option the main advantages of this method are the ability to i depict the rationale of human choice shih et al 2007 ii evaluate the relative performance of alternatives based on the simple algorithm othman et al 2015 and iii define flexibly the selection set hsu et al 2009 based on this method one solution in the set of pareto front solutions is selected as the best solution when it has the minimum distance with the ideal solution and greatest distance from the negative ideal option ramesh et al 2012 this method involves six steps as follows i make a decision matrix in the first step it requires to build a decision matrix that can be expressed as follows 34 f 1 f 2 f j f n d a 1 a 2 a i a m f 11 f 12 f 1 j f 1 n f 21 f 22 f 2 j f 2 n f i 1 f i 2 f ij f in f m 1 f m 2 f mj f mn where a i is the alternative f j is the attribute and f ij is the performance value ii compute the normalized matrix d matrix nd as follows 35 n i j f i j j 1 n f i j 2 j 1 n i 1 m where n i j is the normalized score thus nd n i j m n iii compute the weighted matrix nd as follows 36 v i j n i j w j j 1 n i 1 m where wj is the weights of attributes iv define the positive a and negative a ideal options 37 a r 1 r 2 r n max r ij j ϵ j min r ij j ϵ j 38 a r 1 r 2 r n min r ij j ϵ j max r ij j ϵ

alternative with a higher value of c i is selected as a better solution 3 application 3 1 case study the neishaboor basin nb in razavi khorasan province iran is chosen as the study area fig 4 nb is located at longitude 58 17 59 30 e and latitude 35 40 36 39 n with a total area of approximately 7 35 103 km2 that includes two areas of mountainous 3 16 103 km2 and plain 4 19 103 km2 this area is characterised by semi arid to arid climate with a potential evaporation of 2040 2760 mm y a mean annual rainfall of 180 360 mm y as well as average annual temperature of 13 13 8 c hoseini et al 2005 the nb was divided into seventeen rural districts over the last decades over extraction of the neishaboor aquifer has led to a decrease in the groundwater table by about 1 m y drastic groundwater table decline in the nb becomes manifest in the increasing cost of energy for water pumping land subsidence and a considerable reduction in water quality nazarieh et al 2018 these environmental threats have been main cause of the prohibition of nb groundwater resources development since 1986 the current situation the mean annual amount of groundwater withdrawal from the nb is about 920 106 m3 the agriculture uses 96 of groundwater resources and is deemed as the largest consumer of these resources in this area while domestic and industrial sectors use 3 5 and 0 5 of groundwater resources respectively these groundwater resources have played a key role in meeting food security in this area the total energy consumption for food production in this area is about 550 106mj the main crops in this area include wheat whe barley bar seedy watermelon wat tomato tom alfalfa alf sugar beet sug corn cor onion oni and melon mel 3 2 data preparation the required data regarding technical coefficients and the cost of inputs were collected through face to face interviews with farmers during farming activities that the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 fig 5 depicts the information about the current crop patterns and the population in each individual rural district that was gathered from annual reports of the khorasan razavi regional water authority and the statistical center of iran respectively among them the number of industrial units was obtained from the report of the khorasan razavi chamber of commerce industries mines and agriculture based on this report industrial parks are in the fi 8 units ze 239 units and ta 13 units the required parameters for the calculation of environmental objective function for each rural districts are shown in table 3 lower values of environmental damages imply less level of vulnerability to groundwater consumption table 3 shows the energy required for pumping one cubic meter of groundwater in each rural district that is calculated by eq 5 the required data to compute these coefficients were collected from the khorasan razavi regional water authority table 4 shows the information about net water consumption mean yield and price of crops which are obtained from the khorasan razavi agriculture jihad organization table 5 indicates the energy equivalent of inputs that are employed to calculate the energy consumption for food production these parameters are obtained from several literature sources 3 3 irrigation efficiency scenarios in the neishaboor basin about 40 of the water allocated to agriculture irrigates the crops and the remainder is lost which is mainly due to the low level of irrigation technology and inadequate infrastructure in this area hence the improvement of irrigation efficiency is deemed as one of the most effective tools to increase the level of food production and conservation of water resources in this section the following two schemes are implemented to examine the potential changes in the wef nexus under irrigation efficiency scenarios 20 increase in irrigation efficiency from 40 to 60 s1 40 increase in irrigation efficiency and a 10 increase in irrigated land availability it is expected that with the increase in irrigation efficiency all available irrigated land will be used consequently part of the dryland land may be used for irrigated crops therefore the scenario assumes a 10 increase in irrigated land availability s2 4 results and discussion to analyze the nmop wef model the gams software and conopt 4 solver are employed the section of results and discussion consists of five parts pareto frontier analysis decision making water energy and food production analysis optimization of objective functions and irrigation efficiency and wef nexus 4 1 pareto frontier analysis in the first step the pareto front solutions are calculated for the main problem involving two objective functions maximize groundwater use benefits while simultaneously minimizing the environmental damage caused by groundwater extraction to generate pareto points firstly minimum and maximum values for two objective functions are computed these values for economic and environmental objectives are min 41 54 max ideal solution 95 68 as well as min ideal solution 922 51 max 2181 09 respectively in the next step the epcm is used to solve the nmop wef model optimize the two objectives and produce the pareto front points in the epcm the groundwater use benefits are maximized as the main objective and the environmental objective is transferred to the constraint part of the problem with right hand side epsilon value to obtain epsilon values we divide the interval among two values into 10 points eventually the pareto front solutions see fig 6 are obtained through solving the non linear optimization model with different epsilon values moreover fig 6 shows the extreme points in red the solutions of a1 and a10 provide the least environmental damage and the greatest economic benefits respectively compared to other solutions it is interesting to note that the environmental damages increase dramatically with the rise of the economic benefits of groundwater use the reason could be that the increase of economic benefits of water use is usually associated with a growth in groundwater extraction consequently environmental degradation is a likely outcome 4 2 decision making in the nmop wfe models the selection of the solution that is able to best serve the goals of policymakers could be a critical challenge in adopting effective policies hence in the current study we employ topsis to select the best solution from the pareto sets based on water energy food nexus indicators the weight of the criteria is assumed to be the same 14 28 of the criteria wac enc and env have negative polarity lower is better as well as ecowp phwap ecoenp and phenp have positive polarity greater is better table 6 indicates the value of the wef nexus indicators in each of the pareto solutions the decision matrix is obtained using the data in this table table 7 reveals the normalized decision matrix that is calculated by the eq 35 fig 7 indicates how the positive and negative ideal solutions are spread out through the different wef nexus indicators it needs to note that in the ideal points all the positive indicators ecowp phwp ecoep and phep are maximal and the negative indicators wac eng and env are minimal in the non ideal points all the positive indicators are minimal and negative indicators are maximal before explaining the findings of the ranking of the solutions it is interesting to note that the increase of economic benefits on the one hand leads to a deteriorating situation for the criteria with negative polarity and on the other hand improves the situation for the criteria with positive polarity results in specific detail regarding water food and energy will be discussed in the next sections as mentioned previously the best solution has the highest ci value whereas the worst solution has less ci value table 8 shows the results of the calculated ci values based on the results of this table policymakers can select the best solution among all pareto points according to their preference subsequently the best solution mo is a5 since it has the highest ci values 0 705 in the following section the details of the results of this solution are presented along with the results of single objectives 4 3 water energy and food production analysis fig 8 presents the water and energy allocation for each agricultural product and rural district under the extreme solutions and the best solution the results reveal that when the only objective is economic profits wpmax total water and energy allocations are 860 44 106 m3 and 398 61 106 mj respectively water and energy allocations in this solution are at the highest level compared to other solutions because maximum profits are usually associated with more water and energy consumption on the other hand when the objective is to minimize environmental damage wdmin total water and energy allocations are 594 71 106 m3 and 327 11 106 mj respectively the values of allocated water and energy in this point are at the lowest level compared with other solutions because to minimize the damage of groundwater resources it is necessary to reduce groundwater extraction consequently energy consumption also decreases in this condition for the best solution total water and energy allocations are 735 78 106 m3 and 348 41 106 mj respectively it is worth noting that the amount of allocated water in this solution is closer to the amount of allocated water in the economic objective model showing that the water consumption plays a more important role than energy consumption in generating economic benefit in the nb as observed in fig 8 the allocations of groundwater and energy are closely associated with crop patterns the results of fig 8 show that in three solutions a significant portion of groundwater and energy resources in each rural district is allocated to wheat and barley given that the priority of decision makers is to meet food security by expanding the cultivation of strategic crops such as wheat and barley these crops are the largest consumers of groundwater and energy in the study area moreover water and energy allocation to seedy watermelon tomato and corn is highly dependent on water and energy availability for instance the values of water allocated to seedy watermelon tomato and corn are reduced by 78 80 and 76 respectively and for energy the percentages were 79 80 and 75 respectively in the wdmin compared to wpmax these findings indicate a strong positive correlation between groundwater and energy resources the results regarding the land allocation to different crops in each rural district under three solutions are presented in fig 9 as expected an increase in water and energy allocation results in an expansion of the cultivated area the total land allocated for food production under the wpmax is almost 29 greater than the wdmin in all three solutions wheat barley seedy watermelon and corn respectively have the largest cultivated areas in the study area the total land utilizes under the wpmax for wheat barley seedy watermelon and corn are 33 31 103 19 55 103 7 99 103 and 4 56 103 ha respectively for the wdmin are 26 84 103 19 55 103 1 70 103 and 1 15 103 ha respectively and for the mo are 26 84 103 19 55 103 7 36 103 and 3 20 103 ha respectively another aspect that needs to be addressed is the assessment of the impact of the implementation of environmental solutions on food production in different rural districts specifically for the wdmin the rural districts such as fi es pi and ro which have the least environmental vulnerability to the water extraction see table 3 the total of cultivated areas is approximately unchanged compared to the wpmax whereas the rural districts with greatest environmental vulnerability to water extraction such as or ba tj ma ze and bi experience the highest decrease in cultivated areas so that the land use differences between wpmax and wdmin in the rural district of or ba tj ma ze and bi are 76 74 75 60 73 and 75 respectively fig 10 presents the monthly distribution of groundwater use for three sectors of agriculture domestic and industry under the wpmax wdmin and mo according to the findings of fig 10 under three solutions agriculture uses most of the groundwater extracted throughout the year except in february domestic use is more than other sectors followed by domestic and industrial sectors the annual percentages of groundwater allocated to agriculture industry and domestic under the wpmax are 95 07 4 55 and 0 38 respectively for the wdmin are 94 29 5 27 and 0 44 respectively and for the mo are 94 25 5 24 and 0 51 respectively in the aspect of solutions as expected the volume of water allocated is lowest in the wdmin and highest in the wpmax in all months it is interesting to note that because of the high economic profit of water use and less dependency on seasonal variation in both the industrial and domestic sectors the water allocated to these two sectors have the least fluctuations unlike agriculture however the volume of groundwater allocated to the domestic sector is lowest in winter january february and highest in summer july september under the three solutions most of the groundwater allocated to agriculture about 90 is for five months from april to august under the three solutions moreover the findings also show that the electricity use is more related to groundwater consumption see fig 11 4 4 optimization of objective functions fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of the values of the two conflicting objectives maximum economic profit and minimum resource depletion under two extreme solutions wpmax wdmin and the best solution mo figs 12a and 12d present the groundwater use benefits and damage to groundwater resources under wpmax it is very clear from fig 12a that some of the rural districts which are in the northern mz and tj and eastern ze parts of the nb obtain the greatest groundwater benefits as expected because the majority of agricultural land domestic consumers and industrial units are located in these districts it is noteworthy that the most damage to resources is observed in these areas see fig 12d as can be seen from fig 12d unlike the northern and eastern areas the larger number of southern areas experience the minimum resource depletion due to the least environmental vulnerability to water use figs 12b and 12e indicate the value of economic and environmental objectives under wdmin the findings show when the decision makers only aim to protect groundwater resources groundwater extraction is eliminated especially in the districts with a high vulnerability to groundwater depletion consequently the economic benefits generated from groundwater in these areas are significantly decreased see fig 12b in this condition the concentration of food production will shift from the northern and eastern rural districts to the southern ones as well as the extent of resource depletion is diminished in the districts with a high vulnerability to groundwater withdrawal see fig 12e in this solution compared with wpmax the amount of the damage to groundwater resources and economic benefits reduces from 2181 09 106 to 992 51 106 mj 54 49 and from 95 68 to 41 54 m usd 56 58 respectively finally figs 12c and 12f show the value of economic and environmental objectives under the best solution mo as previously mentioned this point provides a compromise solution between two conflicting objectives as fig 12c shows the economic activities in some areas with high vulnerability to groundwater withdrawals such as ma or ro and ze are significantly reduced hence the extent of resource depletion and economic benefits are reduced more than wpmax in these areas see fig 12f the best solution compared to wpmax has less economic benefits 10 96 and environmental damage 43 38 and compared with wdmin has more economic benefits 52 and environmental damage 35 4 5 irrigation efficiency and wef nexus fig 13 shows pareto front solutions under the two scenarios based on the topsis the best solution mo is a3 in blue in both scenarios table 9 shows the impacts of increasing irrigation efficiency on the value of objective functions land use and energy consumption as well as the volume of groundwater withdrawal as the findings of table 9 indicate rising irrigation efficiency leads to an increase in irrigated areas consequently food production would be increased specifically in s1 under wpmax all available land would be used an increase of 13439 ha also in s2 under wpmax irrigated cultivated areas would be increased dramatically an increase of 21641 ha this could be because the improvement of irrigation efficiency also allows cultivating low profit crops therefore under wpmax the total groundwater use benefit would increase from 102 14 s1 to 110 30 m usd s2 in this study the annual cost of increasing irrigation efficiency is not included although it should not be greater than estimated profit table 9 shows that increasing irrigation efficiency has a positive impact on groundwater conservation for example in the second scenario s2 under the best solution mo groundwater withdrawals would reduce significantly to 46 of the basic situation under this solution consequently the damage to water resources decreases dramatically to 46 of the basic situation under this solution compared to the base case under mo the second scenario s2 allows decreasing the energy demand for groundwater withdrawal a decrease of 30 but due to the increase in the irrigated cultivated areas total energy consumption would increase by 1 fig 14 indicates the spatial distribution of the profit generated and resource depletion in the second scenario s2 under the best solution mo compared to figs 14c and 14f the mo in the second scenario s2 allows increasing the economic benefit while the damage to resource depletion is decreased in all rural districts the extent of resource depletion is especially dramatically declined in the areas with a high vulnerability to groundwater withdrawal northern and eastern areas 5 conclusion in this study a mcdm nonlinear programming approach is developed for forming debates over improved management of the groundwater energy and food nexus the proposed approach has the capability to i address the trade offs among groundwater energy and food production in the context of sustainable management through the simultaneous optimization of economic benefit maximize groundwater benefit uses and environmental target minimize the damage to groundwater resources ii be used as a tool to design strategies and select effective solutions for wef management and iii examine the effects of management policies on food production groundwater use and energy consumption at a regional level this developed approach is applied to the neishaboor basin nb an arid and semi arid area in the northeast of iran the main results of this study are summarized as follows i economic profit and food production are positively associated with groundwater availability and energy use which raises environmental protection challenges ii the solutions that could be used to define optimal policy strategies for sustainable management of groundwater energy food and simultaneously achieve economic and environmental goals iii a significant share of groundwater energy and land resources would be allocated to strategic crops wheat and barley due to their importance in meeting food security iv the improvement of irrigation efficiency could play a considerable role in controlling groundwater depletion and increasing economic profit and food production hence it would be considered as an efficient strategy under conditions of growing water scarcity in entirety a novel approach is developed to quantify and recognize the nexus between groundwater energy and food in a dry region so that it can be extended to other arid and semi arid regions that are highly dependent on groundwater resources although the findings of the current study give a comprehensive insight into the sustainable management of wef an agent based approach can be performed to select practical solutions that consider the conflicting interests of the stakeholders hence the integration of multi agent based modeling and mcdm nmop approach can be addressed in future studies in a practical wef nexus management groundwater availability water and energy consumptions food production and interlinkage between resources may be influenced by weather conditions input and product price fluctuations and other factors thus further research is needed to quantitatively addressee and incorporated these uncertain factors into the developed approach to increase model s practicality besides the focus of the current study is only on groundwater hence to improve the applicability of the mcdm nmop other water sources such as surface water need to be considered

10289,brewery effluent be can be used as a water and nutrient source for crop irrigation it contains high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus which are essential plant nutrients however the effluent at ibhayi brewery sab ltd has a high concentration of sodium which is a constraint for its reuse in agriculture the objectives here were to determine the salt removal efficiency crop growth and health and changes in soil structure when four salt tolerant test crops were irrigated with be and subjected to crop rotation or soil amendments these crops included swiss chard beta vulgaris saltbush atriplex nummularia salicornia meyeriana and sorghum sorghum bicolor and all grew efficiently in be irrigated soils but did not stop sodium accumulation in the growth medium nitrogen was successfully exploited while phosphorus availability was limited by an unfavourable ph swiss chard had the best growth with a wet biomass production of 8173 g m 2 due to the plant s ability to tolerate saline conditions and continuous cropping crop rotation aiming to limit the effects of nutrient depletion in soil had no significant effect on plant growth suggesting that the soils were provided enough micro nutrients in the short term prolonged irrigation with be can lead to sodium accumulation in the soil which was successfully ameliorated through addition of soil amendments gypsum and trichoderma these amendments reduced soil sodium from a potentially yield limiting level of 1398 mg l 1 to the acceptable levels of 240 mg l 1 and 353 mg l 1 respectively mainly through leaching however only the addition of trichoderma improved swiss chard production to 11 238 g m 2 while reducing soil surface crusting and improving infiltration rates soil amended with trichoderma appears to be a potential solution for be reuse as a water and nutrient source in agriculture keywords wastewater reuse crop irrigation sodium soil amendment 1 introduction brewery effluent be at ibhayi brewery sab ltd in port elizabeth south africa is treated partially onsite before being released into the municipal sewer jones et al 2013 the treatment process is costly and energy intensive power and jones 2016 alternative technologies such as the use of the effluent for crop irrigation can be a way to exploit the value of the water and nutrients in the be for downstream applications brewery effluent can be used as an irrigation water source for agricultural crops with economic value crops such as cabbage brassica oleracea var capitata swiss chard beta vulgaris lucerne medicago sativa tomato solanum lycopersicum and lettuce lactuca sativa have been successfully grown in be jones et al 2013 power and jones 2016 taylor et al 2018 this effluent includes high levels of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and other organic and inorganic compounds that are essential for crop growth and health taylor et al 2018 as such it has the potential to enhance the economic benefits for farmers by reducing the need to add fertilizers paranychianakis et al 2006 bedbabis et al 2010 however the salinity level and high ph of the effluent present challenges for its use as an irrigation source the high ph does not pose as much of a problem when soils are irrigated because soils can buffer against ph changes buckman and brady 1967 however salts will accumulate causing soil salinity which will be detrimental to soil structure and fertility eventually affecting crop growth and health qadir and schubert 2002 muyen et al 2011 the levels of salts in the be released by ibhayi brewery expressed in electrical conductivity ec is about 3019 48 µs cm 1 taylor 2015 with sodium being the dominant salt therefore irrigation with this effluent will lead to accumulation of sodium in the soil which would negatively impact plant growth epa victoria 2003 halophytes such as saltbush atriplex spp lucerne and salicornia spp have been shown to grow efficiently in saline soils gaag et al 2010 they have also been shown to have the ability to remediate saline or salt affected soils saiyood et al 2012 furthermore these plants can lower salt levels in the soil thereby preventing deterioration of its structure gaag et al 2010 soil management strategies such as crop rotation and the addition of soil amendments have been found to help improve the properties of soils irrigated with saline effluent as well as help improve crop productivity and nutrient uptake qadir et al 2006 zia et al 2007 murtaza et al 2009 uddin et al 2011 chen et al 2018 the aim here was to develop agricultural processes method that would contribute to making treated be more suitable as a nutrient and water source in crop production the objectives here were to determine the salt removal efficiency crop growth and health and changes in soil structure when four salt tolerant test crops were irrigated with be and subjected to crop rotation or soil amendments 2 materials and methods 2 1 crop comparison 2 1 1 experimental species and

was followed by saltbush sorghum and salicornia the mean biomass production of swiss chard is typically 20 30 t ha 1 1 0 2 0 t ha 1 for saltbush honeysett et al 2004 1 37 t ha 1 for sorghum and 8 76 t ha 1 y 1 for salicornia gaag et al 2010 the values obtained for swiss chard saltbush and sorghum 35 07 81 73 and 2 11 t ha 1 respectively in the first experiment were higher than some of the reported mean yields of the crops brewery effluent contains nutrients that are often found in fertilizers used to improve plant growth paran ychianakis et al 2006 bedbabis et al 2010 this could explain the above average yields of the crops this suggests the be was able to support efficient growth and crop yields were not influenced by osmotic stress that is often associated with high salinity hasegawa et al 2000 there was no biomass recorded for salicornia plants in the first experiment as the seedlings died at the beginning salicornia is an obligate halophyte that grows optimally in wet and highly saline conditions gaag et al 2010 it can tolerate non saline environments but often nacl is required for growth ayala and o leary 1995 the low salinity of the soil at the beginning of the study could have been the cause of death of salicornia seedlings crop rotation did not lead to any differences in the growth of the experimental crops this could be due to the short period of only 4 8 months of the study most crop rotations are done over longer periods of time e g 4 5 years before it is found to influence production shipton 1975 soils with high salt content have traditionally been managed using soil amendment practices as a way to improve soil quality and crop growth uddin et al 2011 the addition of gypsum as a chemical amendment did not influence the growth of swiss chard in the current experiment however the biological amendment trichoderma improved the growth productivity and cci of this crop significantly trichoderma induces the immune response system of plants and promotes growth ramírez valdespino et al 2019 positive effects of trichoderma on plant growth have been reported in plants such as gossypium cotton and lettuce mostafa and gayed 1952 catska et al 1975 the trichoderma in this study may have induced the plant defence system against the high na conditions resulting in improved growth of the swiss chard wet weight was used to measure crop productivity in this study even though the use of wet weight to measure crop productivity is sometimes considered unreliable for example in a greenhouse experiment to compare the effect of seven plant growth promoting bacteria the wet and dry weights of the shoots roots and or whole plants of tomato and sweet pepper capsicum annuum l plants varied significantly huang et al 2017 inconsistencies between wet and dry weights were also found in experiments on maize plants zahid et al 2015 and for tomato plants in a study testing the growth promoting effects of salinity resistant growth promoting rhizobacteria tank and saraf 2010 the problem arises firstly because variations in watering regimes change the wet weight of plants that have the same dry weight secondly plant wet weight is affected by environmental factors such as humidity temperature and air currents that plants are exposed to before weighting bashan and de bashan 2015 in this study watering regimes temperature and humidity did not differ among treatments furthermore wet weight continues to be used to report plant growth data ma et al 2011 saravanakumar et al 2011 zahid et al 2015 in some research where plant wet and dry weights have had the same water content then consistent correlations between the two parameters have been reported huang et al 2017 hence wet weight can be as accurate as dry weight in some instances also wet weights are practical and quick and do not require high volume dehydration equipment to dry down large quantities of vegetables with a high water content and this equipment was not available as an option in this study finally this work aimed to represent the potential outcomes for farmers using be for irrigation on vegetables for commercial sale i e as fresh produce hence wet weight is more representative of the farmer s reality than dry weight since none of these products are marketed dry with these considerations in mind wet weight was used as the measure of plant productivity in this study 4 2 levels of elements in plant leaves nitrogen is an important component of plant tissue growth kaburagi et al 2014 high salt levels can lead to decreased n levels as plants need to exert extra energy to absorb nutrients muyen et al 2011 this was observed in this study total n levels decreased in all plants with continuous saline be irrigation in the soil similar results have been reported in barley where leaf n levels decreased with increasing levels of nacl kaburagi et al 2014 this was attributed to the salinity decreasing the activity of nitrate reductase in the leaves however the same nacl increase elevated nitrate reductase activity in swiss chard leaves the swiss chard in that study was grown in an aquaponic solution the observed decrease in leaf n in this study suggests that there are other soil plant interactions that aid in n removal from the soil such as plant assisted leaching gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 owens 2001 the presence of na in plant tissues may affect the uptake of other nutrients sodium and k are monovalent cations which compete leading to high na levels potentially causing k deficiency and reduced growth in plants benlloch et al 1994 the deficiency of k decreases plant growth an increase in k levels was only observed in the saltbush plants while swiss chard and sorghum showed a decrease in line with what would be expected given the stronger halophytic nature of saltbush compared to the other plants in similar research salinity caused decreased k levels in two baby lettuce cultivars due to the antagonism of na and k at uptake sites in the plant roots the presence of n inhibited the k transport into the xylem and therefore its uptake hu and schmidhalter 2005 the increase in k observed in saltbush could be due to the plant s efficiency in absorbing nutrients under saline conditions neocleous et al 2014 a relationship between k and n in saline environments has been reported in some studies pilbeam and kirkby 1990 wang et al 2001 in the current study n and p uptake were correlated in swiss chard and sorghum but not in saltbush this is most likely because na uptake did not inhibit k uptake in saltbush due to its strongly halophytic nature in certain plant species salinity increases tissue p levels hu and schmidhalter 2005 keutgen and pawelzik 2008 however all the plants used in this study had a decrease in leaf p levels as salinity increased phosphorus is more available at a soil ph between 5 and 6 but it becomes less available outside this range lucas and davis 1961 the soil ph ranges of crops in this study were all outside this range and this could have been the cause of the observed decrease in leaf p levels similar results have been observed in saltbush and millet echinochloa esculenta plants where an adjustment of soil ph resulted in increased leaf levels of p taylor et al 2019 the observed decrease in leaf p could be attributed to the unfavourable soil ph sodium exerts osmotic pressure on plants which may lead to a decrease in the availability of nutrients such as ca k and mg grattan and grieve 1999 leaf ca levels decreased in saltbush and swiss chard while that of sorghum increased in the current study calcium levels decreased in green lettuce and increased in red lettuce irrigated with the same saline water likely due a more effective nutrient uptake in red lettuce under saline conditions neocleous et al 2014 this could have been the case with sorghum magnesium levels decreased in saltbush and increased in swiss chard and sorghum the observed decrease in saltbush leaf mg levels suggests that soil na levels exerted more osmotic pressure on saltbush that it did on swiss chard and sorghum salinity has been reported to increase mn and zn levels in the tissues of rice and zucchini plants turhan and eris 2005 however micronutrients such as mn zn and fe have been found to be unaffected by salinity in wheat leaves hu and schmidhalter 2001 iron mn zn cu were also found to be unaffected by salinity in baby lettuce crops as they were required in small quantities neocleous et al 2014 the observed decreases nutrients such as cu zn mn fe and al in this study suggested that be may not be a complete nutrient solution for crops taylor et al 2018 the addition of gypsum in the soil reduced the ability of swiss chard to uptake na into its leaves the ca ions in gypsum replace the na ions via an exchange complex qadir and oster 2004 murtaza et al 2006 this could explain the lower leaf na in gypsum grown plants gypsum did not influence swiss chard s ability to take up n p k ca mg zn and mn but improved fe and al uptake into the leaf tissue this could suggest that gypsum provided a suitable environment for uptake of fe and al but did not necessarily influence plant physiology as most of the leaf elements were similar between treatments gupta et al 2015 4 3 soil properties crops can assist in the reduction of na build up in the soil by assimilating the salt into their tissues which will decrease physical degradation of soil irrigated with moderately saline be chaudhri et al 1964 gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 owens 2001 qadir et al 2003 saltbush and swiss chard had high levels of leaf na suggesting that they assimilated na into their tissues however swiss chard also had high na levels in the soil in which it grew despite regular cropping and fast growth the high salt content in the soil did not have a negative effect on swiss chard growth as it has been reported to grow well under moderate salinity kaburagi et al 2014 it is possible that na leached out of the plant in an attempt to establish homeostasis between plant and soil hence high levels were measured in both plant and soil sodium can also be removed from the soil through plant assisted leaching gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 owens 2001 the low leaf and soil na levels in sorghum plants suggest that sorghum was efficient in plant assisted leaching of na gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 with the exclusion of na from the leaves being a possible mechanism by which this was achieved niu et al 2012 soil ph increased from the start of the experiment to the end the increase was probably due to the accumulation of basic cations particularly ca2 and mg2 from irrigation water libutti et al 2018 similar results have been observed when broccoli brassica oleracea var italica was irrigated with agri industrial effluent libutti et al 2018 soil ph was highest in the control treatment suggesting that plants had an effect on lowering ph basic cations such as na from alkaline wastewater have been reported to raise soil ph mancino and pepper 1992 a soil ph increase has also been reported with saline water irrigation chaudhry 2001 however the ph in the plant treatments was significantly lower than the control which also had higher na levels despite both treatments being subject to the same volume of irrigation water and therefore the same na exposure the lower ph level in the control treatment that remained unplanted suggests that plants contributed to na leaching from the soil chaudhri et al 1964 gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 owens 2001 the soil ec increased during the trial an increase in soil ec is a common and entirely predictable effect of saline irrigation water qadir and oster 2002 qadir and schubert 2002 murtaza et al 2006 the extent of the ec increase depends on plant type murtaza et al 2013 hence there were differences in the ec values of crops in this study electrical conductivity gives in indication of the total dissolved ions in the water especially na cl and k yilmaz and koc 2014 the increase in ec values in this study were mostly due to na as k did not follow a similar trend other studies have reported a higher leaching rate of k due to displacement by na in the wastewater al nakshabandi et al 1997 gloaguen et al 2007 the same phenomenon could explain the results obtained in this study soil c decreased in the experiment with swiss chard having the lowest levels at the end a decrease in organic c has been observed in the soil after irrigation with treated wastewater gloaguen et al 2007 this was thought to be due to the increase in soil microbiological activity because of the available c supplied by the irrigation water gloaguen et al 2007 availability of n and p from the wastewater stimulates soil microbial activity that often leads to increased mineralization of organic matter in the soil gloaguen et al 2007 duarte et al 2008 nitrogen decreased in swiss chard soil while it remained the same as the starting soil for the other treatments this suggests that swiss chard had a higher n uptake than other treatments oliveira et al 2016a high n uptake by plants has been linked to increased biomass production in hard red winter wheat triticum aestivum guo et al 2019 the water spinach ipomoea aquatica has also been reported to have a high n uptake and therefore high biomass production when compared to other plants grown in a floating bed system under saline conditions chen et al 2019 the high n uptake of swiss chard in this study resulted in the greater biomass production the decarbonisation potentially caused by increased microbial growth as discussed earlier would also result in soil microbes consuming and degrading n soil mg levels decreased in all crop treatments suggesting that the level of mg supplied by the be was not sufficient for the plants oliveira et al 2016b other nutrients such as cu mn and k decreased or stayed the same which could be attributed to the presence of high na levels which may lead to deficiencies in these nutrients naidu and rengasamy 1993 sumner 1993 the addition of gypsum and in the soil significantly reduced soil na ph and ec compared to non amendment soil similar results have been reported in other studies where crop rotation treatments were combined with gypsum application ilyas et al 1997 gypsum addition increased na leaching in the soil thereby decreasing na concentration which in turn decreased ph murtaza et al 2006 the ph and na decrease could be due to na replacement with ca from gypsum leading to desalination abro and mahar 2007 murtaza et al 2013 gypsum alleviates soil dispersion by maintaining a high ca na soil ratio and thus reduce na adsorption muhammed et al 1969 in the current study ca k and mg were lower in the soil with no amendment high na concentrations in saline waters increases the ratio of na to other cations such as ca k and mg leading to an increased na uptake and decreased cation uptake maas and grieve 1987 ehret et al 1990 this could explain the lower levels of ca k and mg in the non amendment treatment which also had a higher na level trichoderma effectively reduced soil na and consequently ec the mechanisms are not clear as the leaf na was also lower compared to the no amendment treatment so it could not have been plant uptake soil na removal by plant uptake has been found to account for less than five percent and the majority removed by leaching qadir et al 2003 trichoderma has been suggested to promote nutrient leaching in sandy loam soils planted with maize even though this was not tested in a study conducted by muter et al 2017 sodium could have been removed from the soil through leaching the soil ph was reduced by the trichoderma organic acids such as gluconic acid fumaric acid and citric acid are produced by trichoderma species and these help reduce soil ph kacprzak et al 2014 this was evidenced in this study the soil absorption ratio sar had an average of 0 49 0 02 and increased during the first experiment saline municipal irrigation water significantly increased soil sar moghbel et al 2017 agri industrial wastewater irrigation increased sar due to na accumulation in the roots munshower 1994 when sar is between 12 and 15 soils become sodic and this can cause physical damage to soil characteristics naidu rengasamy 1993 sumner 1993 munshower 1994 the sar in this study was well below 12 so the soil could not be considered sodic after the first harvest the sar decreased similar results were observed in salt tolerant rice trials where sar decreased after the first harvest murtaza et al 2009 the addition of soil amendments caused a significant reduction in the soil sar gypsum has been found to reduce sar ec and ph when applied after a year of wheat production in sodic soils iiyas et al 1997 trichoderma harzianum has been found to reduce the effect of salinity and sar in tomato crops irrigated with saline water daliakopoulos et al 2019 the same results were observed in this study the addition of na to the soil via saline water irrigation can lead to soil sodicity which may decrease the fertility of the soil qadir et al 2003 the planting of halophytes that take up soil na may limit its accumulation in the soil soils planted with swiss chard had the highest compaction and lowest moisture content high na in the soil often leads to a breakdown in the soil physical structure resulting in a hard soil crust the high na levels in the swiss chard soils could explain this crop irrigation with be can lead to an increase in soil bd reduced porosity and whc bulk density in the first growth cycle significantly increased in the control while the crop treatments remained the same an increase in bd could be due to the settling of the soil at the start of irrigation as saline irrigation weakens bonds holding soil aggregated together and causes them to compact over time van and hill 1995 the increase in bd could have been due to the accumulation of na in the soil minhas and gupta 1993 qadir et al 2002 this suggests that the crops in this experiment facilitated na removal either by plant uptake or plant assisted leaching the infiltration rate was highest in the sorghum treatment this could explain the low soil na in the sorghum soil the high infiltration rate would have aided in the na leaching in the soil zia et al 2007 lucerne caused a fourfold increase in the soils infiltration rates when compared to unplanted soils meek et al 1990 at the end of the trial swiss chard had the lowest infiltration rate probably due to na accumulating in the soil sodium causes soils to compact by dispersing soil particles resulting in a tightly packed soil matrix impeding water movement qadir and schubert 2002 sodium has been reported to affect the dispersion of soil aggregates qadir and schubert 2002 irrigation with na rich water can cause soil dispersion which is usually accompanied by a deterioration in the hydro physical soil properties buckman and brady 1967 irrigation of soil with post pfp be for 12 weeks did not show any signs of soil structure deterioration taylor 2015 soil aggregate stability was not measured in this study it is unlikely that the experimental time used in this study would have led to evidence of soil structure deterioration however an increase in soil na concentration after prolonged use of be for irrigation can result in decreased soil stability and structural deterioration qadir and schubert 2002 muyen et al 2011 trichoderma improved the soil moisture content reduced compaction and increased infiltration rate the improved water filtration could have been because the trichoderma exudes polysaccharides into the soil as do mycorrhizae aggarwal et al 2011 macías rodríguez et al 2018 these bind soil particles together reversing the effect of the na ions aggarwal et al 2011 the ability of trichoderma to reduce soil na levels may have contributed to these improvements muter et al 2017 daliakopoulos et al 2019 the application of soil amendments may be the key to maintaining good soil structure in be irrigated soils the reuse of wastewater from food processing industries such as breweries can be a way to alleviate the stress on available freshwater resources improve the productivity of crops and contribute to environmental stability while it has many advantages there may be costs to the environment associated with the reuse that need to be taken into account for example be contains salts that may accumulate in the root zone of plants with harmful impacts on soil and crop productivity these salts may leach into the soil causing groundwater pollution hussain et al 2002 long term use of be as an irrigation source may also affect the economic value of land which is being irrigated hussain et al 2002 it is therefore important that these trade offs are taken into consideration when wastewater is reused for irrigation purposes 4 4 conclusion the use of treated wastewater is a viable option that exploits nutrients such as n and p at optimum ph levels thus reducing the need for inorganic fertilizers this will not only reduce the cost of agricultural production but it will also contribute to moderating the environmental impact of agriculture in addition the practice of using industrial wastewater will alleviate limitations in the supply of freshwater for irrigation almuktar et al 2018 while at the same time it could potentially reduce the cost of wastewater bioremediation to the primary water user the current study demonstrated that leafy plants such as swiss chard can grow well in alkaline conditions and can be harvested multiple times in one growth cycle similar types of plants could also be investigated for growth using be crop rotation and the addition of soil amendments to ameliorate salt affected soils has also shown to be an effective way to further enhance soil properties and hence plant production using be while these did not completely mitigate the accumulation of na it did manage it to some extent suggesting that further optimisation can be achieved to enable a fully sustainable system this work demonstrated the effective use of salt tolerant plants grown in soils amended with trichoderma to mitigate salt build up associated with the use of recycled be as an irrigation source while producing food crops this will increase the recyclability of the be declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

10289,brewery effluent be can be used as a water and nutrient source for crop irrigation it contains high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus which are essential plant nutrients however the effluent at ibhayi brewery sab ltd has a high concentration of sodium which is a constraint for its reuse in agriculture the objectives here were to determine the salt removal efficiency crop growth and health and changes in soil structure when four salt tolerant test crops were irrigated with be and subjected to crop rotation or soil amendments these crops included swiss chard beta vulgaris saltbush atriplex nummularia salicornia meyeriana and sorghum sorghum bicolor and all grew efficiently in be irrigated soils but did not stop sodium accumulation in the growth medium nitrogen was successfully exploited while phosphorus availability was limited by an unfavourable ph swiss chard had the best growth with a wet biomass production of 8173 g m 2 due to the plant s ability to tolerate saline conditions and continuous cropping crop rotation aiming to limit the effects of nutrient depletion in soil had no significant effect on plant growth suggesting that the soils were provided enough micro nutrients in the short term prolonged irrigation with be can lead to sodium accumulation in the soil which was successfully ameliorated through addition of soil amendments gypsum and trichoderma these amendments reduced soil sodium from a potentially yield limiting level of 1398 mg l 1 to the acceptable levels of 240 mg l 1 and 353 mg l 1 respectively mainly through leaching however only the addition of trichoderma improved swiss chard production to 11 238 g m 2 while reducing soil surface crusting and improving infiltration rates soil amended with trichoderma appears to be a potential solution for be reuse as a water and nutrient source in agriculture keywords wastewater reuse crop irrigation sodium soil amendment 1 introduction brewery effluent be at ibhayi brewery sab ltd in port elizabeth south africa is treated partially onsite before being released into the municipal sewer jones et al 2013 the treatment process is costly and energy intensive power and jones 2016 alternative technologies such as the use of the effluent for crop irrigation can be a way to exploit the value of the water and nutrients in the be for downstream applications brewery effluent can be used as an irrigation water source for agricultural crops with economic value crops such as cabbage brassica oleracea var capitata swiss chard beta vulgaris lucerne medicago sativa tomato solanum lycopersicum and lettuce lactuca sativa have been successfully grown in be jones et al 2013 power and jones 2016 taylor et al 2018 this effluent includes high levels of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and other organic and inorganic compounds that are essential for crop growth and health taylor et al 2018 as such it has the potential to enhance the economic benefits for farmers by reducing the need to add fertilizers paranychianakis et al 2006 bedbabis et al 2010 however the salinity level and high ph of the effluent present challenges for its use as an irrigation source the high ph does not pose as much of a problem when soils are irrigated because soils can buffer against ph changes buckman and brady 1967 however salts will accumulate causing soil salinity which will be detrimental to soil structure and fertility eventually affecting crop growth and health qadir and schubert 2002 muyen et al 2011 the levels of salts in the be released by ibhayi brewery expressed in electrical conductivity ec is about 3019 48 µs cm 1 taylor 2015 with sodium being the dominant salt therefore irrigation with this effluent will lead to accumulation of sodium in the soil which would negatively impact plant growth epa victoria 2003 halophytes such as saltbush atriplex spp lucerne and salicornia spp have been shown to grow efficiently in saline soils gaag et al 2010 they have also been shown to have the ability to remediate saline or salt affected soils saiyood et al 2012 furthermore these plants can lower salt levels in the soil thereby preventing deterioration of its structure gaag et al 2010 soil management strategies such as crop rotation and the addition of soil amendments have been found to help improve the properties of soils irrigated with saline effluent as well as help improve crop productivity and nutrient uptake qadir et al 2006 zia et al 2007 murtaza et al 2009 uddin et al 2011 chen et al 2018 the aim here was to develop agricultural processes method that would contribute to making treated be more suitable as a nutrient and water source in crop production the objectives here were to determine the salt removal efficiency crop growth and health and changes in

was followed by saltbush sorghum and salicornia the mean biomass production of swiss chard is typically 20 30 t ha 1 1 0 2 0 t ha 1 for saltbush honeysett et al 2004 1 37 t ha 1 for sorghum and 8 76 t ha 1 y 1 for salicornia gaag et al 2010 the values obtained for swiss chard saltbush and sorghum 35 07 81 73 and 2 11 t ha 1 respectively in the first experiment were higher than some of the reported mean yields of the crops brewery effluent contains nutrients that are often found in fertilizers used to improve plant growth paran ychianakis et al 2006 bedbabis et al 2010 this could explain the above average yields of the crops this suggests the be was able to support efficient growth and crop yields were not influenced by osmotic stress that is often associated with high salinity hasegawa et al 2000 there was no biomass recorded for salicornia plants in the first experiment as the seedlings died at the beginning salicornia is an obligate halophyte that grows optimally in wet and highly saline conditions gaag et al 2010 it can tolerate non saline environments but often nacl is required for growth ayala and o leary 1995 the low salinity of the soil at the beginning of the study could have been the cause of death of salicornia seedlings crop rotation did not lead to any differences in the growth of the experimental crops this could be due to the short period of only 4 8 months of the study most crop rotations are done over longer periods of time e g 4 5 years before it is found to influence production shipton 1975 soils with high salt content have traditionally been managed using soil amendment practices as a way to improve soil quality and crop growth uddin et al 2011 the addition of gypsum as a chemical amendment did not influence the growth of swiss chard in the current experiment however the biological amendment trichoderma improved the growth productivity and cci of this crop significantly trichoderma induces the immune response system of plants and promotes growth ramírez valdespino et al 2019 positive effects of trichoderma on plant growth have been reported in plants such as gossypium cotton and lettuce mostafa and gayed 1952 catska et al 1975 the trichoderma in this study may have induced the plant defence system against the high na conditions resulting in improved growth of the swiss chard wet weight was used to measure crop productivity in this study even though the use of wet weight to measure crop productivity is sometimes considered unreliable for example in a greenhouse experiment to compare the effect of seven plant growth promoting bacteria the wet and dry weights of the shoots roots and or whole plants of tomato and sweet pepper capsicum annuum l plants varied significantly huang et al 2017 inconsistencies between wet and dry weights were also found in experiments on maize plants zahid et al 2015 and for tomato plants in a study testing the growth promoting effects of salinity resistant growth promoting rhizobacteria tank and saraf 2010 the problem arises firstly because variations in watering regimes change the wet weight of plants that have the same dry weight secondly plant wet weight is affected by environmental factors such as humidity temperature and air currents that plants are exposed to before weighting bashan and de bashan 2015 in this study watering regimes temperature and humidity did not differ among treatments furthermore wet weight continues to be used to report plant growth data ma et al 2011 saravanakumar et al 2011 zahid et al 2015 in some research where plant wet and dry weights have had the same water content then consistent correlations between the two parameters have been reported huang et al 2017 hence wet weight can be as accurate as dry weight in some instances also wet weights are practical and quick and do not require high volume dehydration equipment to dry down large quantities of vegetables with a high water content and this equipment was not available as an option in this study finally this work aimed to represent the potential outcomes for farmers using be for irrigation on vegetables for commercial sale i e as fresh produce hence wet weight is more representative of the farmer s reality than dry weight since none of these products are marketed dry with these considerations in mind wet weight was used as the measure of plant productivity in this study 4 2 levels of elements in plant leaves nitrogen is an important component of plant tissue growth kaburagi et al 2014 high salt levels can lead to decreased n levels as plants need to exert extra energy to absorb nutrients muyen et al 2011 this was observed in this study total n levels decreased in all plants with continuous saline be irrigation in the soil similar results have been reported in barley where leaf n levels decreased with increasing levels of nacl kaburagi et al 2014 this was attributed to the salinity decreasing the activity of nitrate reductase in the leaves however the same nacl increase elevated nitrate reductase activity in swiss chard leaves the swiss chard in that study was grown in an aquaponic solution the observed decrease in leaf n in this study suggests that there are other soil plant interactions that aid in n removal from the soil such as plant assisted leaching gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 owens 2001 the presence of na in plant tissues may affect the uptake of other nutrients sodium and k are monovalent cations which compete leading to high na levels potentially causing k deficiency and reduced growth in plants benlloch et al 1994 the deficiency of k decreases plant growth an increase in k levels was only observed in the saltbush plants while swiss chard and sorghum showed a decrease in line with what would be expected given the stronger halophytic nature of saltbush compared to the other plants in similar research salinity caused decreased k levels in two baby lettuce cultivars due to the antagonism of na and k at uptake sites in the plant roots the presence of n inhibited the k transport into the xylem and therefore its uptake hu and schmidhalter 2005 the increase in k observed in saltbush could be due to the plant s efficiency in absorbing nutrients under saline conditions neocleous et al 2014 a relationship between k and n in saline environments has been reported in some studies pilbeam and kirkby 1990 wang et al 2001 in the current study n and p uptake were correlated in swiss chard and sorghum but not in saltbush this is most likely because na uptake did not inhibit k uptake in saltbush due to its strongly halophytic nature in certain plant species salinity increases tissue p levels hu and schmidhalter 2005 keutgen and pawelzik 2008 however all the plants used in this study had a decrease in leaf p levels as salinity increased phosphorus is more available at a soil ph between 5 and 6 but it becomes less available outside this range lucas and davis 1961 the soil ph ranges of crops in this study were all outside this range and this could have been the cause of the observed decrease in leaf p levels similar results have been observed in saltbush and millet echinochloa esculenta plants where an adjustment of soil ph resulted in increased leaf levels of p taylor et al 2019 the observed decrease in leaf p could be attributed to the unfavourable soil ph sodium exerts osmotic pressure on plants which may lead to a decrease in the availability of nutrients such as ca k and mg grattan and grieve 1999 leaf ca levels decreased in saltbush and swiss chard while that of sorghum increased in the current study calcium levels decreased in green lettuce and increased in red lettuce irrigated with the same saline water likely due a more effective nutrient uptake in red lettuce under saline conditions neocleous et al 2014 this could have been the case with sorghum magnesium levels decreased in saltbush and increased in swiss chard and sorghum the observed decrease in saltbush leaf mg levels suggests that soil na levels exerted more osmotic pressure on saltbush that it did on swiss chard and sorghum salinity has been reported to increase mn and zn levels in the tissues of rice and zucchini plants turhan and eris 2005 however micronutrients such as mn zn and fe have been found to be unaffected by salinity in wheat leaves hu and schmidhalter 2001 iron mn zn cu were also found to be unaffected by salinity in baby lettuce crops as they were required in small quantities neocleous et al 2014 the observed decreases nutrients such as cu zn mn fe and al in this study suggested that be may not be a complete nutrient solution for crops taylor et al 2018 the addition of gypsum in the soil reduced the ability of swiss chard to uptake na into its leaves the ca ions in gypsum replace the na ions via an exchange complex qadir and oster 2004 murtaza et al 2006 this could explain the lower leaf na in gypsum grown plants gypsum did not influence swiss chard s ability to take up n p k ca mg zn and mn but improved fe and al uptake into the leaf tissue this could suggest that gypsum provided a suitable environment for uptake of fe and al but did not necessarily influence plant physiology as most of the leaf elements were similar between treatments gupta et al 2015 4 3 soil properties crops can assist in the reduction of na build up in the soil by assimilating the salt into their tissues which will decrease physical degradation of soil irrigated with moderately saline be chaudhri et al 1964 gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 owens 2001 qadir et al 2003 saltbush and swiss chard had high levels of leaf na suggesting that they assimilated na into their tissues however swiss chard also had high na levels in the soil in which it grew despite regular cropping and fast growth the high salt content in the soil did not have a negative effect on swiss chard growth as it has been reported to grow well under moderate salinity kaburagi et al 2014 it is possible that na leached out of the plant in an attempt to establish homeostasis between plant and soil hence high levels were measured in both plant and soil sodium can also be removed from the soil through plant assisted leaching gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 owens 2001 the low leaf and soil na levels in sorghum plants suggest that sorghum was efficient in plant assisted leaching of na gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 with the exclusion of na from the leaves being a possible mechanism by which this was achieved niu et al 2012 soil ph increased from the start of the experiment to the end the increase was probably due to the accumulation of basic cations particularly ca2 and mg2 from irrigation water libutti et al 2018 similar results have been observed when broccoli brassica oleracea var italica was irrigated with agri industrial effluent libutti et al 2018 soil ph was highest in the control treatment suggesting that plants had an effect on lowering ph basic cations such as na from alkaline wastewater have been reported to raise soil ph mancino and pepper 1992 a soil ph increase has also been reported with saline water irrigation chaudhry 2001 however the ph in the plant treatments was significantly lower than the control which also had higher na levels despite both treatments being subject to the same volume of irrigation water and therefore the same na exposure the lower ph level in the control treatment that remained unplanted suggests that plants contributed to na leaching from the soil chaudhri et al 1964 gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 owens 2001 the soil ec increased during the trial an increase in soil ec is a common and entirely predictable effect of saline irrigation water qadir and oster 2002 qadir and schubert 2002 murtaza et al 2006 the extent of the ec increase depends on plant type murtaza et al 2013 hence there were differences in the ec values of crops in this study electrical conductivity gives in indication of the total dissolved ions in the water especially na cl and k yilmaz and koc 2014 the increase in ec values in this study were mostly due to na as k did not follow a similar trend other studies have reported a higher leaching rate of k due to displacement by na in the wastewater al nakshabandi et al 1997 gloaguen et al 2007 the same phenomenon could explain the results obtained in this study soil c decreased in the experiment with swiss chard having the lowest levels at the end a decrease in organic c has been observed in the soil after irrigation with treated wastewater gloaguen et al 2007 this was thought to be due to the increase in soil microbiological activity because of the available c supplied by the irrigation water gloaguen et al 2007 availability of n and p from the wastewater stimulates soil microbial activity that often leads to increased mineralization of organic matter in the soil gloaguen et al 2007 duarte et al 2008 nitrogen decreased in swiss chard soil while it remained the same as the starting soil for the other treatments this suggests that swiss chard had a higher n uptake than other treatments oliveira et al 2016a high n uptake by plants has been linked to increased biomass production in hard red winter wheat triticum aestivum guo et al 2019 the water spinach ipomoea aquatica has also been reported to have a high n uptake and therefore high biomass production when compared to other plants grown in a floating bed system under saline conditions chen et al 2019 the high n uptake of swiss chard in this study resulted in the greater biomass production the decarbonisation potentially caused by increased microbial growth as discussed earlier would also result in soil microbes consuming and degrading n soil mg levels decreased in all crop treatments suggesting that the level of mg supplied by the be was not sufficient for the plants oliveira et al 2016b other nutrients such as cu mn and k decreased or stayed the same which could be attributed to the presence of high na levels which may lead to deficiencies in these nutrients naidu and rengasamy 1993 sumner 1993 the addition of gypsum and in the soil significantly reduced soil na ph and ec compared to non amendment soil similar results have been reported in other studies where crop rotation treatments were combined with gypsum application ilyas et al 1997 gypsum addition increased na leaching in the soil thereby decreasing na concentration which in turn decreased ph murtaza et al 2006 the ph and na decrease could be due to na replacement with ca from gypsum leading to desalination abro and mahar 2007 murtaza et al 2013 gypsum alleviates soil dispersion by maintaining a high ca na soil ratio and thus reduce na adsorption muhammed et al 1969 in the current study ca k and mg were lower in the soil with no amendment high na concentrations in saline waters increases the ratio of na to other cations such as ca k and mg leading to an increased na uptake and decreased cation uptake maas and grieve 1987 ehret et al 1990 this could explain the lower levels of ca k and mg in the non amendment treatment which also had a higher na level trichoderma effectively reduced soil na and consequently ec the mechanisms are not clear as the leaf na was also lower compared to the no amendment treatment so it could not have been plant uptake soil na removal by plant uptake has been found to account for less than five percent and the majority removed by leaching qadir et al 2003 trichoderma has been suggested to promote nutrient leaching in sandy loam soils planted with maize even though this was not tested in a study conducted by muter et al 2017 sodium could have been removed from the soil through leaching the soil ph was reduced by the trichoderma organic acids such as gluconic acid fumaric acid and citric acid are produced by trichoderma species and these help reduce soil ph kacprzak et al 2014 this was evidenced in this study the soil absorption ratio sar had an average of 0 49 0 02 and increased during the first experiment saline municipal irrigation water significantly increased soil sar moghbel et al 2017 agri industrial wastewater irrigation increased sar due to na accumulation in the roots munshower 1994 when sar is between 12 and 15 soils become sodic and this can cause physical damage to soil characteristics naidu rengasamy 1993 sumner 1993 munshower 1994 the sar in this study was well below 12 so the soil could not be considered sodic after the first harvest the sar decreased similar results were observed in salt tolerant rice trials where sar decreased after the first harvest murtaza et al 2009 the addition of soil amendments caused a significant reduction in the soil sar gypsum has been found to reduce sar ec and ph when applied after a year of wheat production in sodic soils iiyas et al 1997 trichoderma harzianum has been found to reduce the effect of salinity and sar in tomato crops irrigated with saline water daliakopoulos et al 2019 the same results were observed in this study the addition of na to the soil via saline water irrigation can lead to soil sodicity which may decrease the fertility of the soil qadir et al 2003 the planting of halophytes that take up soil na may limit its accumulation in the soil soils planted with swiss chard had the highest compaction and lowest moisture content high na in the soil often leads to a breakdown in the soil physical structure resulting in a hard soil crust the high na levels in the swiss chard soils could explain this crop irrigation with be can lead to an increase in soil bd reduced porosity and whc bulk density in the first growth cycle significantly increased in the control while the crop treatments remained the same an increase in bd could be due to the settling of the soil at the start of irrigation as saline irrigation weakens bonds holding soil aggregated together and causes them to compact over time van and hill 1995 the increase in bd could have been due to the accumulation of na in the soil minhas and gupta 1993 qadir et al 2002 this suggests that the crops in this experiment facilitated na removal either by plant uptake or plant assisted leaching the infiltration rate was highest in the sorghum treatment this could explain the low soil na in the sorghum soil the high infiltration rate would have aided in the na leaching in the soil zia et al 2007 lucerne caused a fourfold increase in the soils infiltration rates when compared to unplanted soils meek et al 1990 at the end of the trial swiss chard had the lowest infiltration rate probably due to na accumulating in the soil sodium causes soils to compact by dispersing soil particles resulting in a tightly packed soil matrix impeding water movement qadir and schubert 2002 sodium has been reported to affect the dispersion of soil aggregates qadir and schubert 2002 irrigation with na rich water can cause soil dispersion which is usually accompanied by a deterioration in the hydro physical soil properties buckman and brady 1967 irrigation of soil with post pfp be for 12 weeks did not show any signs of soil structure deterioration taylor 2015 soil aggregate stability was not measured in this study it is unlikely that the experimental time used in this study would have led to evidence of soil structure deterioration however an increase in soil na concentration after prolonged use of be for irrigation can result in decreased soil stability and structural deterioration qadir and schubert 2002 muyen et al 2011 trichoderma improved the soil moisture content reduced compaction and increased infiltration rate the improved water filtration could have been because the trichoderma exudes polysaccharides into the soil as do mycorrhizae aggarwal et al 2011 macías rodríguez et al 2018 these bind soil particles together reversing the effect of the na ions aggarwal et al 2011 the ability of trichoderma to reduce soil na levels may have contributed to these improvements muter et al 2017 daliakopoulos et al 2019 the application of soil amendments may be the key to maintaining good soil structure in be irrigated soils the reuse of wastewater from food processing industries such as breweries can be a way to alleviate the stress on available freshwater resources improve the productivity of crops and contribute to environmental stability while it has many advantages there may be costs to the environment associated with the reuse that need to be taken into account for example be contains salts that may accumulate in the root zone of plants with harmful impacts on soil and crop productivity these salts may leach into the soil causing groundwater pollution hussain et al 2002 long term use of be as an irrigation source may also affect the economic value of land which is being irrigated hussain et al 2002 it is therefore important that these trade offs are taken into consideration when wastewater is reused for irrigation purposes 4 4 conclusion the use of treated wastewater is a viable option that exploits nutrients such as n and p at optimum ph levels thus reducing the need for inorganic fertilizers this will not only reduce the cost of agricultural production but it will also contribute to moderating the environmental impact of agriculture in addition the practice of using industrial wastewater will alleviate limitations in the supply of freshwater for irrigation almuktar et al 2018 while at the same time it could potentially reduce the cost of wastewater bioremediation to the primary water user the current study demonstrated that leafy plants such as swiss chard can grow well in alkaline conditions and can be harvested multiple times in one growth cycle similar types of plants could also be investigated for growth using be crop rotation and the addition of soil amendments to ameliorate salt affected soils has also shown to be an effective way to further enhance soil properties and hence plant production using be while these did not completely mitigate the accumulation of na it did manage it to some extent suggesting that further optimisation can be achieved to enable a fully sustainable system this work demonstrated the effective use of salt tolerant plants grown in soils amended with trichoderma to mitigate salt build up associated with the use of recycled be as an irrigation source while producing food crops this will increase the recyclability of the be declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the
