advantages as good solids retention time the elimination of the secondary sedimentation step efficient operating controls and simple operation 9 several studies on metal and sulfate removal from wastewater indicate the asbr is a good low cost alternative 10 14 the kinetics of the system can be affected by several factors such as microorganism immobilization properties substrate diffusion in the biofilm stirring speed long cellular retention times a high biomass concentration bioreactor configuration and environmental conditions e g sulfide concentration temperature and ph a deep understanding of the phenomena that occur in the system such as the mass transfer between granule and substrate is important for process improvement 9 15 considering the need to carry out studies to elucidate the fundamental phenomena that occur in the microenvironment of a particle and in its neighborhood the main goal of this study was to verify the influence of increasing metals concentrations on the kinetics of cod and sulfate removal in an asbr designed to treat amd changes in the electron flow to the sulfidogenic process related to high metals concentration were also evaluated 2 methodology 2 1 reactor setup and materials a bench scale reactor equipped with a paddle stirrer and a thermal bath kept at 50 rpm and 30 c respectively was used to treat synthetic acid mine drainage the total volume reactor 7 l was filled with 5 5 l of synthetic amd every 48 h cycle the biomass was contained during the entire reactor operation in a perforated stainless steel plate basket the synthetic wastewater included sulfate and ethanol as a sole carbon source both at 1500 mg l 1 from phase i to iv in the adaptation phase the cod and sulfate concentration was 1000 mg l 1 the sludge used as inoculum was obtained from an up flow anaerobic sludge bed reactor uasb used to treat poultry slaughterhouse effluent metals concentrations were defined according to the toxicity of sulfate reducing bacteria srb for these metals 16 17 the composition of synthetic amd was na2so4 mgso4 7h2o feso4 7h2o zncl2 and cuso4 7h2o the concentration of mg2 was 8 7 mg l 1 in all phases only as a nutrient and the concentrations of fe2 and zn2 were 3 4 mg l 1 and 7 2 mg l 1 respectively in the adaptation phase the affluent ph was corrected closed to value 4 before cycle the metals composition of wastewater varied among the five phases of this study according to table 1 which also shows the operating time in each phase 2 2 experimental procedure the system was evaluated as a function of organic matter removal in the form of cod sulfate and metals removal ph analyses of the affluent effluent and sulfide production were also performed the time cycle was set to 48 h 10 12 14 all analyses followed the procedures given by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 18 2 3 kinetic adjustment temporal profiles were performed at the end of each phase allowing the apparent kinetic parameters to be identified the microbial growth was assumed to be constant due to the slow growth of the biomass and the short duration of the temporal profile considering that mass transfer occurs between the granule and the synthetic amd and that it is the limiting step of the removal process using the first order model it is possible to obtain eq 1 where ds dt is the sulfate consumption rate mg l 1 h 1 s is the substrate concentration mg l 1 and k s a p is the apparent kinetic constant h 1 12 19 1 d s d t k s a p s from eq 1 for batch reactor design the residual

residual concentration adjusted by non linear regression levenberg marquardt method using originpro 8 0 software as demonstrated by other authors for sulfate 9 12 and for cod kinetic parameters 20 21 whose expression is presented in eq 3 where s 0 is the initial concentration mg l 1 and t is time h for cod analysis a first order model was used regardless the residual 3 s t s s r s o s s r e k s a p t 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal data table 2 presents the average results for ph sulfide sulfate cod and metals removals after 245 days the sulfate removal rate increased as metals were added 13 in general the reactor operation was stable in all operation phases demonstrating effluent ph values in the range of neutrality which are adequate for microbiological development and allows adequate disposal in the water bodies high removals of so4 2 cod and metals fe2 cu2 and zn2 were obtained 3 2 sulfidogenic activity and electron flow changes to evaluate the competition between srb and the other microbial groups methanogenesis fermentative the electron flow to sulfate reduction was calculated based on the fraction of cod removed by sulfate reduction taking into account that 0 67 g of cod are oxidized per gram of sulfate reduced 22 eq 4 fig 1 shows the proportion of electrons utilized by srb and mpa fb 4 c o d s o 4 0 67 s o 4 2 r e m o v e d the increase in metals concentration throughout the phases increased the electron flow to sulfate reducing process the increase of fe2 concentration to 100 200 300 and 400 mg l 1 increased the electron flow used by srb to 34 7 46 7 62 10 and 63 12 respectively even with decreasing cod removal sulfidogenesis was favored by increased metals concentrations metals remove sulfide from the bulk liquid by precipitation which reduces the inhibition of sulfide in the microbial community due to the fact that sulfide combines with the iron in cytochromes or any other metal containing compounds that affect cellular functionality 23 in addition an overbalance in the chemical equilibrium of the sulfate reduction to sulfide can change the thermodynamics of the reaction as the presence of metals consumes the sulfide in the solution favoring the formation of the product 12 the microbial interactions between srb and mpa fermentative are complex and variable depending on the operating conditions reactor design and environmental factors in a down flow fixed structured bed reactor dfsbr for amd treatment the electron flow to srb was stable around 38 when the fe2 concentration was increased from 100 to 400 mg l 1 8 factors such as the origin of the inoculum the transport of substrate within the granule the site of sulfate reduction and its proximity to the site of methanogenesis sulfidogenesis determine the toxicity of the sulfide and the competitiveness interactions thus potentially causing a unique scenario 24 sulfate removals from 72 6 92 5 were obtained using an up flow anaerobic packed bed reactor containing wastewater with the metals cd2 ni2 fe2 cu2 pb2 and zn2 the biomass characterization revealed that the precipitation of metals was associated with the outer and inner cell surfaces of srb as a result of the sulfide generated by them 25 3 3 kinetic analysis the temporal profiles constructed to evaluate the kinetic behavior of cod and so4 2 removal are shown in fig 2 table 3 shows the parameters obtained the kinetic constants and the adjustment coefficients the theoretical residual sulfate concentration ssr decreased with the exception of the adaptation phase as the sulfate removal increased comparing the model with the real values of sulfate effluent a similarity is observed mainly when considering the standard deviation indicating that the model well represented the data considering the parameter k s a p as an indicator of the reaction rate it can be observed that from the addition of the metals fe2 zn2 and cu2 phase i to phase iv there was a decrease in the reaction rate which may have been due to the high concentration of metals added into the system this decrease in the reaction rate did not impair the sulfate removal for the 48 h cycle as seen in fig 2 since the reaction rate became stable after a certain time within the expected cycle time further according to table 2 sulfate removal increased with increasing metals concentrations with lower concentrations of metals it was observed that the sulfate removal rate was higher note that for each profile there was a characteristic time for the stabilization of sulfate removal as an example the profile of phases iii and iv shows that the stabilization of the removal occurs near the end of the cycle time approximately 45 h which may be related to the high metals concentrations present in these phases and the lower k s a p values caused by a longer time required for sulfate removal for the adaptation phase i and ii stabilization was observed at approximately 20 30 and 33 h respectively characterizing higher k s a p values as compared to phases iii and iv the comparison of the kinetic constant with other research is complex due to variations in experimental conditions inoculum characteristics and bioreactor configuration nonetheless some previous works have shown similarity to some of our operating conditions inoculum cod so4 2 ratio time cycle and electron donors 12 26 27 however even so the k s a p values were not similar the k s a p values obtained here were 0 44 0 04 0 4 0 1 and 0 000235 h 1 respectively highlighting an obstacle to true comparisons of sulfate kinetic behavior our results suggest a connection between the stoichiometry and the kinetics of the srb process 28 the cod kinetics analysis employed a first order model since data showed no evidence of residues in contrast with models that describe a non zero plateau the use of a simpler model releases an extra degree of freedom for the fit which is harmless here since no conclusion is drawn from the likelihood of this model the k c o d a p values showed a decrease in the cod removal rate with an increase in the metals concentration which did not compromise the total removal since there was stabilization of the removal after 48 h the cod kinetics were modified by the presence of metals which did not present a perfect fit since the previous studies that considered the presence of residual did not use wastewater containing sulfate and metals 20 21 4 conclusions the results obtained in this study are crucial to understand the biological kinetics of amd treatment and to optimize bioreactor operation procedures biological sludge was a suitable option for the amd treatment with high metals concentration the kinetic behavior of cod and sulfate removal through kinetic adjustment of the first order was representative apart from the increase in metals concentration the cod k c o d a p and sulfate k s a p apparent kinetic constant showed that there was a decrease in the reaction rate at the same time that cod and sulfate removal increased this may have been due to the high metals concentration throughout the phases resulting in a longer time required for cod and so4 2 removal it was verified that the increase of fe2 concentration from 100 to 400 mg l 1 favored sulfidogenesis with a flow of electrons used by srb from 34 7 to 63 12 for the 48 h cycle time the sulfate and cod removal rates were stable in all phases which shows that the metals concentration applied was not toxic to the microbial consortium acknowledgments this study was supported by cnpq conselho nacional

14321,in this study the semiconductor powder zinc oxide zno and magnetite fe3o4 powder were either separately or together entrapped in calcium alginate ca alg beads to form hybrid photocatalyst the synergic effect of hybrid zno fe3o4 ca alg beads was investigated for both photocatalytic oxidation of azo dye reactive red 180 rr 180 and photoreduction of hexavalent chromium cr vi in aqueous solutions the effect of zno and fe3o4 powder amount in ca alg beads bead loading and solution ph were systematically evaluated a maximum 100 rr180 decolorization 25 mg l initial dye concentration and 15 5 cr vi photoreduction 10 mg l initial cr vi concentration were obtained by zno ca alg beads with 15 zno powder in ca alg at 20 g l bead loading and ph 7 0 in 180 min however at the same initial dye and cr vi concentration 55 2 rr 180 decolorization and 85 4 cr vi reduction were attained by fe3o4 ca alg beads with 15 powder in ca alg at 20 g l bead loading and ph 4 0 in 180 min meanwhile using zno fe3o4 ca alg beads with 15 each powder in ca alg at 20 g l bead loading 100 rr180 decolorization at ph 10 in 60 min and 87 2 cr vi photoreduction at ph 4 0 in 180 min were achieved hybrid zno fe3o4 ca alg beads reusability was also tested during 10 cycles and hybrid beads showed good stability for removal of azo dye manufactured beads were characterized by scanning electron microscopy

introduction textile dyes contribute to environmental pollution since textile industrial wastewater discharge contains large amount of dye chemicals 1 some of the dyes are often difficult to decompose in water as they have composite molecular structures that turn them to be more stable toward light and resistant to biodegradation 2 the existence of dyes even at low concentration can affect transparency and gas solubility in water their role in absorbing and reflecting the sunlight has adverse effects on aquatic life 3 highly carcinogenic or mutagenic compounds can arise during the reduction of dyes and their intermediates human consumption of dye contaminated water can cause a variety of adverse health effects such as wide ranging immune suppression breathing problems central nervous system disorders behavioral problems allergic reactions tissue necrosis and infections of the skin and eyes 4 various techniques have been proposed to remove dyes from textile wastewaters including chemical coagulation precipitation 5 physical adsorption 6 electrochemical oxidation 7 chemical oxidation 8 and biological anaerobic aerobic degradation and or conversion 9 ultra nano filtration processes 10 and advanced oxidation processes such as fenton 11 photo fenton 12 and photocatalysis 13 photocatalysis is an effective technique for degradation of dye pollutants because it can mineralize organic dyes completely into h2o co2 and mineral acids 14 metal semiconductor materials such as tio2 zno fe2o3 fe3o4 cds and zns are efficiently used as photocatalyst among which tio2 and zno exhibit higher efficiency 15 18 another serious problem in textile industry is the cr vi discharge with waste water to the receiving environment moreover chrome plating automobiles steel and alloys paints leather tanning ammunition factories electroplating wood preservation and mining industries are also potential sources for cr vi output 19 20 cr vi emissions through waste streams are prohibited by regulations various techniques were investigated to remove cr vi from waste streams such as membrane separation 21 precipitation 22 liquid membrane electro dialysis 23 biological treatment 24 adsorption 25 etc among these methods reduction followed by precipitation has been preferred most commonly in industrial applications because of the ease of application to high volume streams at any concentration 26 however economical reasons such as high cost of plant installation and environmental aspects of the solid waste management encourage researchers to develop more sustainable purification processes researchers have studied for cr vi removal from aqueous solution such as commercial activated carbons 27 ion exchange resins 28 29 metal organic frameworks mof template 30 semiconductor photocatalysis 31 33 and metal cross linked alginate beads 34 35 alginate which is widely distributed in natural organisms and obtained from marine brown algae is a hetero polysaccharide that comprises a linear anionic copolymer of 1 4 linked β d mannuronic and α l guluronic acid residues that contain one carboxylate group per monosaccharide unit 36 calcium alginate which is prepared by cross linking alginate and ca2 is a suitable immobilizer for various adsorbants and or reacting agents because it is an environmentally friendly inexpensive porous substrate that can be prepared on a large scale 37 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles have gained massive attention due to the outstanding properties which are low toxicity easy separation and high sensitivity 38 embedding fe3o4 nanoparticles into hydrogels like alginates can serve as a more ideal method because it can not only take advantage of the outstanding properties of fe3o4 but also avoid the shortages such as easy dissolution especially at lower ph of solution 39 calcium alginate bead has ability to adsorb cr iii but not cr vi since the latter has negative ion as chromate 34 therefore an auxiliary agent such as zero valent iron nanoparticles and magnetite embedded in calcium alginate beads provides both adsorption and reduction of cr vi 40 41 furthermore the magnetic property of magnetite enables an alternative way for separation of the beads during continuous processes in the literature either rr180 or cr vi removal studies were presented as solely without using ca alg bead entrapment methods rr180 and cr vi species have different zeta potential values as negative and positive respectively on the other hand one is an organic dye chemical and the other is a metallic ion therefore comparative study of these species carries novel approach and it is a creative effort to compare their removal using a novel catalyst type zno fe3o4 ca alg beads were performed in this study for the comparative removal of rr180 and cr vi species in solutions both adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation as well as photoreduction experiments were performed by zno and fe3o4 catalysts to remove rr180 dye and photoreduction of cr vi repeated use of hybrid zno fe3o4 ca alg beads was also showed very good performance after 10 cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals 2 1 1 chemicals

overnight the beads were separated from the solution washed with distilled water and dried in an oven for 1 h at 40 1 c bare ca alg beads were also synthesized to compare with composite beads the synthesized beads were tested for azo dye and cr vi removal study a photograph of synthesized beads was presented in fig 2 2 1 4 photocatalytic activity experiments batch reactions were performed in a

before acquiring data 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composite calcium alginate beads 3 1 1 sem edx analysis the outer surface morphology of the beads was investigated by sem fig 3 a the sem image indicated that the surface morphology of bare bead was different compared to composite zno ca alg fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads the surface of the bare alginate appeared crack while many zno and fe3o4 powders were dispersed on the bead surface fig 3a the element composition of bare and composite beads after entrapped zno and fe3o4 powder was analyzed by edx and the presence of zno and fe3o4 on the beads was also confirmed see supporting information table s2 the edx spectra of the bare bead is shown in fig 3 b and ca2 and na ions were detected the edx spectra of the zno ca alg fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg composite beads is also shown in fig 3 b and as expected the presence of the element zn and fe approved the entrapping of zno and fe3o4 powders into the ca alg beads the content of cl in bare bead was 27 76 by mass but it decreased after entrapped zno and fe3o4 powder in ca alg bead however zn and fe were not found in bare bead while the content of zn changed from 0 to 86 02 by mass in zno ca alg bead and fe changed from 0 to 59 72 in fe3o4 ca alg bead by mass zn and fe changed from 0 to 61 73 and 26 84 by mass in zno fe3o4 ca alg bead compared to bare bead decrease of calcium content indicated an exchange between ca2 on the bare bead and zn2 and fe2 fe3 in the solution edx results also showed that the affinity of ca alg to zn2 was higher than fe2 fe3 3 1 2 xrd analysis fig 4 shows xrd pattern of the dried composite zno ca alg fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads zno has displayed strong crystalline peaks the xrd pattern of ca alginate beads fig 4a did not show any peaks and this suggests an amorphous phase formation in fig 4b the crystalline peaks at 2θ values of 31 7 34 4 36 2 47 5 56 6 62 8 67 9 and 69 1 corresponding to the crystal planes of 100 002 101 102 110 103 200 and 112 respectively are indicative of the predominant crystalline phase of zno fe3o4 ca alg beads showed three major diffraction peaks at 2θ values 30 9 36 9 and 63 7 due to the reflection of their 220 311 and 440 planes fig 4c 3 1 3 ftir analysis the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the bare calcium alginate and composite beads were recorded and compared with each other fig 5 the peaks present at 3200 3400 cm 1 in the spectra represent the stretching vibration of the oh bonds of alginate the two band peaks observed at 1605 and 1424 cm 1 were attributed to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the co bond of the coo group respectively the bands obtained at 1079 cm 1 was attributed to the c o stretching vibration of pyranosyl ring bare calcium alginate beads show differences in band positions when compared to the ftir spectrum of composite beads asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxylate ion decreased to lower wave numbers after embedded zno and fe3o4 powders 3 1 4 zeta potential analysis initially rr 180 cr vi zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 powders were dissolved in deionized water 1 l and zeta potentials were measured at broad ph range from 2 to 10 by a zeta meter malvern zeta sizer nano zs and depicted by dots in fig 6 results clearly indicated that rr 180 dye solutions were on the negative side for all ph range on the other hand fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 surface charge were on the positive side up to ph 7 and above this ph zeta potential turned on negative side for pristine zno surface charge zeta potential was positive value between ph 6 8 and below this ph zeta potential was around zero because of the soluble zno to zn 2 ions at acidic conditions however change of ph did not affect zeta potential of cr vi aftabtalab et al 46 studied the cr vi adsorption by magnetite nanoparticle and found that the charge of magnetite nanoparticle is 17 3 mv where the cr vi charge is 0 1 mv at ph 8 2 3 2 photocatalytic oxidation of rr180 and photoreduction of cr vi by composite ca alg beads 3 2 1 the effect of powder amount in ca alg beads for rr 180 and cr vi removal photocatalytic experiments were initially performed using different powder amount of zno and fe3o4 in ca alg beads loading amounts from 5 7 5 10 15 w w for decolorization of rr 180 and reduction of cr vi results in fig 7 indicated that increasing powder amount in ca alg beads increased color removal efficiency and reduction of cr vi however color removal efficiency for zno ca alg beads fig 7a was much higher than fe3o4 ca alg beads fig 8 c for photocatalytic oxidation of rr180 azo dye color removal efficiency of zno ca alg beads was 100 for all powder amount for 180 min fig 7a increasing catalyst amount in ca alg beads increased available active sites on the bead surface for dye molecules and increased photocatalytic efficiency the effect of zno powder amount in ca alg beads did not affect photoreduction of cr vi and maximum reduction was obtained 11 7 at 15 w w zno powder amount in ca alg beads fig 7b however fe3o4 powder amount slightly affected reduction efficiency of cr vi and increased from 6 7 17 5 when powder amount was increased from 2 5 15 in ca alg beads fig 7d the synergic effect of zno and fe3o4 powders were also tested for decolorization of rr 180 and reduction of cr vi the results showed that both color removal efficiency fig 7e and reduction of cr vi fig 7f increased when hybrid zno fe3o4 ca alg beads were used the usual proposed oxidation pathway on the surface of semiconductor powders is the generation of a hole electron pair upon irradiation with uv light and the hole is responsible for oxidation and the electron is responsible for reduction 31 organic degradation is performed by the formation of either oh or superoxide radicals generated by the holes however reduction is developed by released electrons on the conduction band of semiconductor surface in this study oxidation of dye chemicals was performed either by oh or superoxide radicals generated by the holes and reduction of cr vi by released electrons on zno in the ca alg beads the semiconductor zno and its amount effect obviously indicated stronger yield than magnetite fe3o4 for photocatalytic color removal this is a well known indication of semiconductor photocatalysis 14 16 however magnetite was only responsible for surface adsorption rather than oxidation 3 2 2 the effect of bead loading for rr 180 and cr vi removal different catalyst loading amounts from 2 5 20 g l with zno ca alg fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads were proceeded for decolorization of rr 180 and reduction of cr vi for photocatalytic experiments fig 8 results in fig 8 showed that increasing catalyst loading improved rr180 dye removal efficiency and cr vi reduction for all composite beads except zno ca alg catalyst for cr vi reduction the highest decolorization as well as cr vi reduction were obtained at 20 g l bead loading better color removal efficiency was achieved for zno ca alg beads fig 8a compared to fe3o4 ca alg beads fig 8c on the other hand fe3o4 ca alg beads have given better cr vi reduction fig 8d compared to zno ca alg beads fig 8b catalyst loading with zno ca alg beads did not increased cr vi reduction efficiency and it was between 11 7 12 5 after 180 min at 20 g l catalyst loading fig 8b however cr vi reduction efficiency was significantly increased from 20 2 82 2 by increasing of composite beads zno fe3o4 ca alg loading from 2 5 20 g l fig 8f increasing semiconductor amount like zno has increased color removal in most of the previous studies 47 49 3 2 3 adsorption experiments for rr 180 dye and cr vi removal adsorption experiments were also performed to depict the adsorption effect of all catalyst types on the removal of rr180 dye and cr vi solutions 200 ml for 20 g l bead loading initial rr 180 dye 25 mg l and cr vi 10 mg l concentration were kept constant for all adsorption experiments results in fig 9 indicated that rr 180 dye and cr vi molecules were effectively adsorbed on fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads due to strong positive zeta potential of fe3o4 powders at working ph however adsorption of rr 180 dye and cr vi molecules was negligible for bare and zno ca alg beads the reason might be due to less negative values of rr180 dye and cr vi solutions were not significantly attracted to the negative surface charge of bare and zno ca alg bead surfaces 44 negative zeta potential effect of ca alg beads 50 suppresses the positive zeta potential of zno semiconductor powders 51 in the working solution ph therefore the adsorption of rr180 dye and cr vi solutions by zno ca alg catalyst was not occurred due to negative zeta potential meanwhile photocatalytic oxidation was also negatively affected by the surface to surface weak attractions between dye and cr vi molecules and catalyst particles aftabtalab et al 46 stated that magnetite nanoparticles were strong adsorbents for cr vi removal since fe3o4 was negatively charged and cr vi was slightly positively charged at ph 8 therefore magnetite acts as strong adsorbent material and the surface phenomena performs thorough adsorption whereas zno acts as cr vi reduction by oxidation as well as surface adsorption 3 2 4 the effect of ph for rr 180 and cr vi removal the effect of ph for decolorization of rr180 and reduction of cr vi were also evaluated using composite beads fig 10 the maximum dye removal efficiency 100 was obtained with ph 7 0 by zno ca alg beads fig 10a it was observed that solution ph did not either affect cr vi reduction and it was measured as 15 5 fig 10b however decolorization of dye decreased dramatically to 10 9 at ph 4 0 for 180 min because of increasing zno solubility at acidic ph on the other hand the maximum dye removal efficiency 55 2 and reduction of cr vi 85 4 were obtained with ph 4 0 by fe3o4 ca alg beads fig 10c and 10d besides hybrid zno fe3o4 ca alg beads enhanced complete dye removal at all ph ranges fig 10e whereas maximum cr vi reduction was obtained at ph 4 0 87 2 fig 10f the results clearly show that at low ph the cr vi removal was quite high but it decreased with increasing the solution ph the effect of ph on the removal of cr vi ions on magnetic alginate fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 composite beads can be attributed to the two main phenomena adsorption and photoreduction the adsorption phenomena result from the electrostatic interaction between the composite ca alg beads and cr vi wang et al 52 reported rhb in solution could be removed 99 3 by fe3o4 zno photocatalyst after 60 min uv irradiation while zno alone could eliminate 92 6 rhb in aqueous solutions under the same uv irradiation time 3 3 reuse stability of composite alginate beads reuse stability of zno ca alg fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads were evaluated for both rr180 dye decolorization and reduction of cr vi fig 11 the results showed that no decrease in the rr 180 dye removal efficiency was observed up to 10 cycles for zno ca alg beads fig 11a and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads fig 11b however efficient reusability of fe3o4 ca alg fig 11c and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads fig 11d significantly dropped during 10 cycles for cr vi reduction since cr vi reduction by magnetite hybrid catalysts was significantly affected by adsorption surface vacancies of magnetite were occupied by repeated cycles and reuse capacity was decreased during the repeated cycles however zno hybrid catalyst effect enhanced reduction by oxidation and reuse capacity of this hybrid catalyst was not significantly decreased compared to magnetite wang et al 52 reported that almost no decrease in photocatalytic efficiency was observed even after recycling six times for degradation of rhb fig 12 shows a time dependent uv vis absorption spectra of aqueous solution of rr 180 dye during irradiation by uva light in the presence of zno fe3o4 ca alg beads the decolorization of rr180 dye was increased with time which indicates that all the prepared materials containing zno and fe3o4 powders have a photocatalytic and photoreduction activity respectively the complete disappearance of the band at 520 nm for rr180 dye indicates the complete destruction of chromophore group no additional bands were detected in the analyzed wavelength range after 60 min of irradiation for rr 180 dye fig 12 4 conclusion semiconductor zno and magnetite fe3o4 powders were successfully entrapped in ca alg bead for decolorization of rr 180 dye and reduction of cr vi solutions respectively adsorption experiments approved that fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads effectively adsorbed dye molecules and cr vi since the positive zeta potential charge of fe3o4 powders however adsorption of rr 180 dye and cr vi molecules was negligible for bare and zno ca alg beads increasing zno or fe3o4 loading improved color removal efficiency and cr vi reduction for all composite beads except zno ca alg catalyst for cr vi reduction the repeated use of zno ca alg beads and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads were also enhanced for 10 successive runs for dye solutions on the other hand fe3o4 ca alg beads and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads did not maintain reduction of cr vi for 10 runs they lost their activity dramatically after 2nd runs acknowledgment the authors acknowledge

synergic effect of hybrid zno fe3o4 ca alg beads was investigated for both photocatalytic oxidation of azo dye reactive red 180 rr 180 and photoreduction of hexavalent chromium cr vi in aqueous

15 5 cr vi photoreduction 10 mg l initial cr vi concentration were obtained by zno ca alg beads with 15 zno powder in ca alg at 20 g l bead loading and ph 7 0 in 180 min however at the same initial dye and cr vi concentration 55 2 rr 180 decolorization and 85 4 cr vi reduction were attained by fe3o4 ca alg beads with 15 powder in ca alg at 20 g l bead loading and ph 4 0 in 180 min meanwhile

introduction textile dyes contribute to environmental pollution since textile industrial wastewater discharge contains large amount of dye chemicals 1 some of the dyes are often difficult to decompose in water as they have composite molecular structures that turn them to be more stable toward light and resistant to biodegradation 2 the existence of dyes even at low concentration can affect transparency and gas solubility in water their role in absorbing and reflecting the sunlight has adverse effects on aquatic life 3 highly carcinogenic or mutagenic compounds can arise during the reduction of dyes and their intermediates human consumption of dye contaminated water can cause a variety of adverse health effects such as wide ranging immune suppression breathing problems central nervous system disorders behavioral problems allergic reactions tissue necrosis and infections of the skin and eyes 4 various techniques have been proposed to remove dyes from textile wastewaters including chemical coagulation precipitation 5 physical adsorption 6 electrochemical oxidation 7 chemical oxidation 8 and biological anaerobic aerobic degradation and or conversion 9 ultra nano filtration processes 10 and advanced oxidation processes such as fenton 11 photo fenton 12 and photocatalysis 13 photocatalysis is an effective technique for degradation of dye pollutants because it can mineralize organic dyes completely into h2o co2 and mineral acids 14 metal semiconductor materials such as tio2 zno fe2o3 fe3o4 cds and zns are efficiently used as photocatalyst among which tio2 and zno exhibit higher efficiency 15 18 another serious problem in textile industry is the cr vi discharge with waste water to the receiving environment moreover chrome plating automobiles steel and alloys paints leather tanning ammunition factories electroplating wood preservation and mining industries are also potential sources for cr vi output 19 20 cr vi emissions through waste streams are prohibited by regulations various techniques were investigated to remove cr vi from waste streams such as membrane separation 21 precipitation 22 liquid membrane electro dialysis 23 biological treatment 24 adsorption 25 etc among these methods reduction followed by precipitation has been preferred most commonly in industrial applications because of the ease of application to high volume streams at any concentration 26 however economical reasons such as high cost of plant installation and environmental aspects of the solid waste management encourage researchers to develop more sustainable purification processes researchers have studied for cr vi removal from aqueous solution such as commercial activated carbons 27 ion exchange resins 28 29 metal organic frameworks mof template 30 semiconductor photocatalysis 31 33 and metal cross linked alginate beads 34 35 alginate which is widely distributed in natural organisms and obtained from marine brown algae is a hetero polysaccharide that comprises a linear anionic copolymer of 1 4 linked β d mannuronic and α l guluronic acid residues that contain one carboxylate group per monosaccharide unit 36 calcium alginate which is prepared by cross linking alginate and ca2 is a suitable immobilizer for various adsorbants and or reacting agents because it is an environmentally friendly inexpensive porous substrate that can be prepared on a large scale 37 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles have gained massive attention due to the outstanding properties which are low toxicity easy separation and high sensitivity 38 embedding fe3o4 nanoparticles into hydrogels like alginates can serve as a more ideal method because it can not only take advantage of the outstanding properties of fe3o4 but also avoid the shortages such as easy dissolution especially at lower ph of solution 39 calcium alginate bead has ability to adsorb cr iii but not cr vi since the latter has negative ion as chromate 34 therefore an auxiliary agent such as zero valent iron nanoparticles and magnetite embedded in calcium alginate beads provides both adsorption and reduction of cr vi 40 41 furthermore the magnetic property of magnetite enables an alternative way for separation of the beads during continuous processes in the literature either rr180 or cr vi removal studies were presented as solely without using ca alg bead entrapment methods rr180 and cr vi species have different zeta potential values as negative and positive respectively on the other hand one is an organic dye chemical and the other is a metallic ion therefore comparative study of these species carries novel approach and it is a creative effort to compare their removal using a novel catalyst type zno fe3o4 ca alg beads were performed in this study for the comparative removal of rr180 and cr vi species in solutions both adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation as well as photoreduction experiments were performed by zno and fe3o4 catalysts to remove rr180 dye and photoreduction of cr vi repeated use of hybrid zno fe3o4 ca alg beads was also showed very good performance after 10 cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals 2 1 1 chemicals

plastic syringe size 50 needle into aqueous cacl2 solution 100 ml 2 w v stirred at 500 rpm the stirring was continued for one hour and the composite ca alg beads were stored in the cacl2 solution overnight the beads were separated from the solution washed with distilled water and dried in an oven for 1 h at 40 1 c bare ca alg beads were also synthesized to compare with composite beads the synthesized beads were tested for azo dye and cr vi removal study a photograph of synthesized beads was presented in fig 2 2 1 4 photocatalytic activity experiments batch reactions were performed in a column shaped batch pyrex photo reactor with 500 ml capacity the details of the reactor assembly were given elsewhere 44 ambient air was blown into the reactor at a flow rate of 150 ml min to feed and accelerate the oxidation process the pyrex column photo reactor was surrounded by six uva type lamps philips tl8w actinic bl emitting wavelengths at 365 nm lamps were placed in a hexagonal position

of cr vi and maximum reduction was obtained 11 7 at 15 w w zno powder amount in ca alg beads fig 7b however fe3o4 powder amount slightly affected reduction efficiency of cr vi and increased from 6 7

degradation is performed by the formation of either oh or superoxide radicals generated by the holes however reduction is developed by released electrons on the conduction band of semiconductor surface in this study oxidation of dye chemicals was performed either by oh or superoxide radicals generated by the holes and reduction of cr vi by released electrons on zno in the ca alg beads the semiconductor zno and its amount effect obviously indicated stronger yield than magnetite fe3o4 for photocatalytic color removal this is a well known indication of semiconductor photocatalysis 14 16 however magnetite was only responsible for surface adsorption rather than oxidation 3 2 2 the effect of bead loading for rr 180 and cr vi removal different catalyst loading amounts from 2 5 20 g l with zno ca alg fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads were proceeded for decolorization of rr 180 and reduction of cr vi for photocatalytic experiments fig 8 results in fig 8 showed that increasing catalyst loading improved rr180 dye removal efficiency and cr vi reduction for all composite beads except zno ca alg catalyst for cr vi reduction the highest decolorization as well as cr vi reduction were obtained at 20 g l bead loading better color removal efficiency was achieved for zno ca alg beads fig 8a compared to fe3o4 ca alg beads fig 8c on the other hand fe3o4 ca alg beads have given better cr vi reduction fig 8d compared to zno ca alg beads fig 8b catalyst loading with zno ca alg beads did not increased cr vi reduction efficiency and it was between 11 7 12 5 after 180 min at 20 g l catalyst loading fig 8b however cr vi reduction efficiency was significantly increased from 20 2 82 2 by increasing of composite beads zno fe3o4 ca alg loading from 2 5 20 g l fig 8f increasing semiconductor amount like zno has increased color removal in most of the previous studies 47 49 3 2 3 adsorption experiments for rr 180 dye and cr vi removal adsorption experiments were also performed to depict the adsorption effect of all catalyst types on the removal of rr180 dye and cr vi solutions 200 ml for 20 g l bead loading initial rr 180 dye 25 mg l and cr vi 10 mg l concentration were kept constant for all adsorption experiments results in fig 9 indicated that rr 180 dye and cr vi molecules were effectively adsorbed on fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads due to strong positive zeta potential of fe3o4 powders at working ph however adsorption of rr 180 dye and cr vi molecules was negligible for bare and zno ca alg beads the reason might be due to less negative values of rr180 dye and cr vi solutions were not significantly attracted to the negative surface charge of bare and zno ca alg bead surfaces 44 negative zeta potential effect of ca alg beads 50 suppresses the positive zeta potential of zno semiconductor powders 51 in the working solution ph therefore the adsorption of rr180 dye and cr vi solutions by zno ca alg catalyst was not occurred due to negative zeta potential meanwhile photocatalytic oxidation was also negatively affected by the surface to surface weak attractions between dye and cr vi molecules and catalyst particles aftabtalab et al 46 stated that magnetite nanoparticles were strong adsorbents for cr vi removal since fe3o4 was negatively charged and cr vi was slightly positively charged at ph 8 therefore magnetite acts as strong adsorbent material and the surface phenomena performs thorough adsorption whereas zno acts as cr vi reduction by oxidation as well as surface adsorption 3 2 4 the effect of ph for rr 180 and cr vi removal the effect of ph for decolorization of rr180 and reduction of cr vi were also evaluated using composite beads fig 10 the maximum dye removal efficiency 100 was obtained with ph 7 0 by zno ca alg beads fig 10a it was observed that solution ph did not either affect cr vi reduction and it was measured as 15 5 fig 10b however decolorization of dye decreased dramatically to 10 9 at ph 4 0 for 180 min because of increasing zno solubility at acidic ph on the other hand the maximum dye removal efficiency 55 2 and reduction of cr vi 85 4 were obtained with ph 4 0 by fe3o4 ca alg beads fig 10c and 10d besides hybrid zno fe3o4 ca alg beads enhanced complete dye removal at all ph ranges fig 10e whereas maximum cr vi reduction was obtained at ph 4 0 87 2 fig 10f the results clearly show that at low ph the cr vi removal was quite high but it decreased with increasing the solution ph the effect of ph on the removal of cr vi ions on magnetic alginate fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 composite beads can be attributed to the two main phenomena adsorption and photoreduction the adsorption phenomena result from the electrostatic interaction between the composite ca alg beads and cr vi wang et al 52 reported rhb in solution could be removed 99 3 by fe3o4 zno photocatalyst after 60 min uv irradiation while zno alone could eliminate 92 6 rhb in aqueous solutions under the same uv irradiation time 3 3 reuse stability of composite alginate beads reuse stability of zno ca alg fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads were evaluated for both rr180 dye decolorization and reduction of cr vi fig 11 the results showed that no decrease in the rr 180 dye removal efficiency was observed up to 10 cycles for zno ca alg beads fig 11a and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads fig 11b however efficient reusability of fe3o4 ca alg fig 11c and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads fig 11d significantly dropped during 10 cycles for cr vi reduction since cr vi reduction by magnetite hybrid catalysts was significantly affected by adsorption surface vacancies of magnetite were occupied by repeated cycles and reuse capacity was decreased during the repeated cycles however zno hybrid catalyst effect enhanced reduction by oxidation and reuse capacity of this hybrid catalyst was not significantly decreased compared to magnetite wang et al 52 reported that almost no decrease in photocatalytic efficiency was observed even after recycling six times for degradation of rhb fig 12 shows a time dependent uv vis absorption spectra of aqueous solution of rr 180 dye during irradiation by uva light in the presence of zno fe3o4 ca alg beads the decolorization of rr180 dye was increased with time which indicates that all the prepared materials containing zno and fe3o4 powders have a photocatalytic and photoreduction activity respectively the complete disappearance of the band at 520 nm for rr180 dye indicates the complete destruction of chromophore group no additional bands were detected in the analyzed wavelength range after 60 min of irradiation for rr 180 dye fig 12 4 conclusion semiconductor zno and magnetite fe3o4 powders were successfully entrapped in ca alg bead for decolorization of rr 180 dye and reduction of cr vi solutions respectively adsorption experiments approved that fe3o4 ca alg and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads effectively adsorbed dye molecules and cr vi since the positive zeta potential charge of fe3o4 powders however adsorption of rr 180 dye and cr vi molecules was negligible for bare and zno ca alg beads increasing zno or fe3o4 loading improved color removal efficiency and cr vi reduction for all composite beads except zno ca alg catalyst for cr vi reduction the repeated use of zno ca alg beads and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads were also enhanced for 10 successive runs for dye solutions on the other hand fe3o4 ca alg beads and zno fe3o4 ca alg beads did not maintain reduction of cr vi for 10 runs they lost their activity dramatically after 2nd runs acknowledgment the authors acknowledge

14322,the performance of electrocoagulation ec process via aluminium and iron plate anodes were evaluated for removal of aquatic natural organic matter nom the effect of current density j operation time tec initial ph phi charge loading and electrode types were investigated the nom removal efficiencies were measured with respect to dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 vis436 and specific uv absorbance suva with initial value 6 58 mg doc l 0 1363 1 cm 0 004 1 cm and 2 07 l m mg respectively the experimental results showed that the effective removal of nom 63 7 for doc 79 7 for uv254 and 76 7 for vis436 color was obtained by iron electrode at original phi of lake water 7 74 0 02 at 60 min the adsorption capacity qt mg doc per g produced al and fe or coulomb were calculated at a specific electrolysis time at 6 ma cm2 of optimum current density 8 2 mg of doc was removed per g in situ produced fe at original phi of water in addition the zeta potential and floc size analysis were used to explicate the removal mechanism of nom the results of the size exclusion chromatography showed that the affinity of ec process is higher for the aromatic fraction of nom during electrolysis time keywords natural organic matter nom electrocoagulation ec zeta potential floc size high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec 1 introduction natural organic matters noms are a ubiquitous component of the lithosphere and hydrosphere that constitutes one of the largest reservoirs of the carbon 1 natural organic matter nom plays an important role in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems cycles 2 a significant portion of the nom in lakes rivers and surface water comes from deteriorated animal and plant residual 3 the physicochemical structure reactivity and quantity of nom in an aquatic system depend on the vegetation type season climate hydrology and disturbance in the surrounding watershed 4 7 nom consists of a heterogeneous mixture of aliphatic and aromatic polymers containing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur functional groups cooh oh och3 nh2 and hs 8 three categories represent together the most important part of nom in surface waters humic substances humic and fulvic acids polysaccharides and proteins these categories have highly different molecular properties such as weight surface charge size affinity and solubility in water 9 3 nom is measured as dissolved organic carbon doc or total organic carbon toc in surface waters and typically presence in the range of 0 5 and 50 mg c l 10 which is necessary for ecosystems normal functioning the presence of noms in drinking water influences water quality color turbidity taste and odor and the fate transport of organic inorganic contaminants in water for this reason there is a raising concern about the effect of nom on public health 11 12 the most serious public health concern regarding with nom is the formation potential of toxic by products during drinking water disinfection by chlorination noms act as a major precursor to the forming of disinfection by products dbps some of which are mutagenic and carcinogenic 12 13 other serious public health concerns arise from the fact that nom is a food source for microbial growth nom causes fouling of resins membranes and equipment by bio film formation in distribution system and this bacterial formation increases usage of water treatment chemicals 14 16 also the excess amount of organic matter in water can lead to undesirable effect on ecosystems such as decrease in permeability of light in this way high nom concentrations decrease the rate of oxygen production in lakes through inhibiting the photosynthesis 17 briefly nom alters oxygen cycling may increase toxicity and cause a great number of problem regarding to treatment systems thus the control of nom in drinking water and surface water is significant for the sustainability of aquatic ecosystem as well as public health the most common and economically feasible method is coagulation and flocculation for nom removal however conventional water purification techniques such as chemical coagulation are not effective against some toxic and refractory organic pollutants for instance lin et al 18 found that conventional water treatment processes could not effectively remove dbps precursors other treatment options for nom removal adsorption membrane filtration methods and oxidation processes are placed in literature various adsorbents such as oxides activated carbon natural minerals and anion exchange resins are used in removing nom 19 21 activated carbon ac is an effective adsorbent commonly used in drinking water treatment alone or in combination with other treatment systems for instance it was suggested that if coagulation is insufficient in the decreasing of nom the additional treatment with granular or powdered ac gac pac can be efficient in order to maintain required water quality in terms of dbps formation 22 23 however in most of the cases a part of noms with low molecular weight is not removed even after ac filtration 22 ac can also be colonized by a heterotrophic biomass creating biological ac bac thus reducing the proportion of easily assimilated and biodegradable elements another treatment system which suggested to nom removal is ion exchange processes however using resins have some disadvantages such as requirement of regeneration 24 as well as the lost of resins during regeneration these disadvantages increase the operational costs and cause operating difficulties at the end of process the resin waste usually has high salt concentration and needs treatment disposal in addition a decreasing in the doc and dbps precursors were reported in combination of magnetic ion exchange resin and coagulation 25 27 even though this has not been evident in all cases 28 although the application of membrane filtration in removal of nom is the one of the most promising technology in the past decades 29 membrane separation is facing important problems such as high cost the fouling mechanisms and declining of flux 30 34 other suggested treatment methods for removal of nom are advanced oxidation processes aops which provide organic compounds degradation 35 37 although present a great of advantages such as high removal efficiencies and complete mineralization of pollutant aops has the drawbacks during aops the by products may form 29 and the strong removal conditions may not be economically feasible in commercial applications 38 briefly the further studies regarding to removal of noms are required since surface water typically have high particles concentrations i e turbidity pathogenic microorganisms and precursors which may form carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps at this point electrochemical techniques can be a good alternative means of treating toxic and resistant organic matters 39 among electrochemical techniques electrooxidation eo electro fenton ef and electrocoagulation ec are the most promising processes inside these techniques electrocoagulation ec has been seen as an effective and promising alternative as compared with conventional technologies such as chemical coagulation cc in purifying wastewater freshwater 40 44 it may also be called green technology because little or no chemical are needed during ec therefore ec treatment process produces fewer by products and less sludge 45 studies demonstrate that ec technology achieves effectively removal of nom by electrolytic oxidation of sacrificial anodes typically aluminium or iron 46 48 however there is limited information about the nom removal in surface waters which has low suva value in the literature these waters may be characterized by having nom of hydrophilic character less aromaticity and low molecular weight also the existing methods spectroscopic methods specialty of nom have slightly been investigated during ec this study focused on removal of aquatic noms via ec reactor cell that comprised of aluminium and iron electrodes to improve performance of ec process different electrode arrangement was designed the hybrid system in this study can be together advantages of al and fe anode electrodes the effect of main operating parameters such as current density operating time initial ph phi and electrode types on process was investigated the efficiency of the treatment was measured by doc uv254 nm and color parameters another purpose of this investigation was to make explicit the removal mechanism during ec and the structure of nom in this manner the effect of phi on zeta potential ζ and floc size was analyzed by zeta size meter the suva at 254 nm that is an effective indicator of nom aromaticity was determined the molecular weight distribution of aquatic nom was investigated by high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials surface water samples were obtained from lake terkos which is the one of the biggest drinking water supplies 142 000 000 m3 year in istanbul turkey lake terkos provides 25 of the water demand of this metropolitan area 49 lake terkos has a 39 km² water area and a maximum depth of 11 m lake terkos being rich in terms of feeding from rivers has fresh water characteristics despite its proximity to the black sea raw water samples from lake terkos ltw were collected and transported to the laboratory and kept at 4 c the physicochemical properties of the raw water at original ph were determined immediately and presented in table 1 besides anion and cation concentration of ltw were shown in table 2 al ion concentration was lower than detection limit of instrument icp oes perkin elmer the residual concentration of al ion was 2 693 mg l fe ion concentration was 0 001 mg l in raw water the residual concentration of iron ion was 0 079 mg l at optimum condition at the end of process all of used inorganic chemicals were analytical grade and all reagents were prepared in millipore milli q deionized water 3 methods 3 1 experimental set up and procedure the ec process experiments were conducted in laboratory scale an ec batch cell consisted of a plexiglas reactor that had dimensions of 150 mm x 100 mm x100 mm the electrodes were made of high purity aluminium and iron plates with dimensions of 130 mm x 80 mm the performances of sacrificial electrodes were compared via using aluminum iron and hybrid electrodes when one pair of al or fe electrodes was used separately two plate electrodes one anode and one cathode were placed vertically in the ec reactor the schematic representation of ec process was given in sm1 the total immersed active surface area of one pair of al or fe was 70 cm2 hybrid system was designed via two pairs of al and fe electrodes which were placed simultaneously into reactor these four electrodes immersed active surface area was 182 cm2 due to the current density was held constant for comparison of performance of electrodes the applied current i was changed in the hybrid system in each run all water samples were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature before experiments in the preliminary experimental studies 1000 ml of water was placed in the ec reactor samples were taken from each 5 min and the experiment was carried out 25 min the samples were drawn from centre of the reactor with a depth of almost 5 cm below the water surface without filtration since the treatment results from preliminary experiment showed that the 25 minute was not enough the duration of the experiment was increased to 60 min and the amount of the water was increased to 1300 ml by this means the effect of the amount of samples taken at certain intervals on the test results was kept to a minimum prior to experiments electrodes were washed with 0 25 m h2so4 solution for 2 min and rinsed with deionized water then dried in the drying oven and placed in a desiccator to cool down electrodes were connected to a digital power supply gw instek psp 405 programmable dc at monopolar parallel mode and currents were held constant for each run during operating time water was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at a speed of 150 rpm the samples were taken at the different operating times from the ec reactor and filtered through 0 45 μm pore size membrane before uv vis doc and hplc analysis the experiments were repeated for zeta and particle size measurement at optimum conditions the produced coagulant dosage c e mg l was theoretically calculated by faraday s law and defined as 1 c e i t m z f v where m g mol is the molecular weight of aluminium or fe and z is the number of electrons involved in the oxidation decrease reaction z al 3 and z fe 2 i is the applied current a t is the ec operating time min f is the faraday s constant 1 f 96487 c and v is the solution volume l in the ec reactor on the other hand charge loading q coulomb l is defined as the charges transferred in electrochemical reactions for a given amount of treated water and calculated as 2 q c l i t v in this study the removal efficiency of ha were evaluated in terms of adsorption capacity qt qt is the amount of adsorbed ha mg doc g by the produced coagulant

calculated as mg doc coulomb using eq 2 3 2 analytical methods the ph and initial conductivity were determined using wtw inolab multi 9310 ids ph meter and con6 conductivity meter ecoscan respectively the initial turbidity of samples was measured with hach lange turbidimeter al and fe ion concentration was measured icp oes perkin elmer the absorbance values at 254 and 436 nm were recorded by perkin elmer lambda 45 uv vis spectrophotometer vis436 indicates color of water samples doc content of samples was measured using a toc analyzer tocvcph shimadzu japan as non purgeable organic carbon npoc the zeta potential and floc size measurements of the particles were determined using a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern usa each result was an average of three readings the ltw samples were characterized using hpsec technique apparent molecular weight was derived by calibration with standard protein characterization studies were carried out by an agilent hplc high performance liquid chromatography 1260 series consisting of uv vis and refrective index ri detectors the used columns are pl aquagel oh 30 100 60 000 mw and pl aquagel oh mixed h 6 000 10 000 000 mw the columns have a ph range 2 10 compatibility with organic solvent up to 50 methanol mechanical stability up to 140 bar 4 results and discussion 4 1 the effect of current density operating time and charge loading on removal of aquatic nom the effect of current density on doc uv254 and color removal efficiencies were determined at original ph of ltw by using al fe and hybrid anode electrodes as seen in fig 1 when al electrodes were used doc removal efficiencies as 27 2 35 3 34 8 and 70 7 and the removal of uv254 as 63 7 69 8 70 4 and 87 4 were measured at the 3 0 6 0 10 0 and 15 0 ma cm2 of current density and the 25 min of operating time respectively the results showed that the increasing of current density and operating time increased the removal efficiencies although the highest removal efficiencies was obtained at 15 ma cm2 of current density the temperature of solution increased during 25 min and reached 32 8 c temperature has a significant effect on the dissolving speed of al 47 and the rising temperature of water is another variable thus this current density 15 ma cm2 was eliminated on the other hand it was clear that 25 min operating time was not enough for removal of nom at other current densities 3 0 6 0 and 10 0 therefore the experiments were re done as 60 min in order to increase removal efficiency of doc at 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 of current density as it is seen in fig 2 at 60 min the removal efficiency of doc was 52 4 effluent doc doceff 3 13 mg l 50 2 doceff 3 28 mg l and 40 3 doceff 3 93 mg l for 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 respectively al dosage at 60 min was calculated as 235 mg for 10 ma cm2 and 157 mg for 6 ma cm2 fig 2b thus the amount of removed nom was calculated as 21 mg doc g al or 0 0026 mg doc c at 6 ma cm2 and 14 7 mg of doc g al at 10 ma cm2 table 3 as seen in fig 2c the removal efficiency of uv254 was obtained as 78 7 uv254eff 0 029 cm 1 76 1 uv254eff 0 034 cm 1 and 60 6 uv254eff 0 056 cm 1 at 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 of current density by al electrode respectively at optimum current density that was 6 ma cm2 the suva value was determined as 1 04 l mg m at the end of the process at 3 ma cm2 the suva reduced to 1 42 l m mg suva 4 indicates mainly hydrophobic and especially high mw fraction while 2 suva 4 indicates both hydrophobic and hydrophilic and suva 2 illustrates mainly hydrophilic and low mw substances 50 the calculated suva values were under 2 indicating removal of high mw fractions fig 3 shows the effect of current density on doc removal efficiency when fe electrodes were used at the original phi of sample the maximum removal efficiencies were 63 7 doceff 2 39 mg l 60 5 doceff 2 61 mg l and 40 1 doceff 3 97 mg l at 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 respectively at original ph of water fe dosages were 729 and 487 mg at 10 ma cm2 and 6 ma cm2 respectively at 60 min fig 3b thus at optimum current density 6 ma cm2 8 2 mg of doc was removed per g fe the amount of removed doc per g fe was found to decrease 10 8 5 8 mg g with increase in fe dosage table 3 it seemed that adsorption site of iron hydroxides for iron complexes organic molecules interaction was increased by increased the amount of fe dosage due to increased available surface charges which favored functional sides of organic matter for attachment however the removal of mg doc per g fe dosage did not increase with increasing produced fe the reason of this phenomenon can be explained as affinity of pollutants it is assumed that some parts of the nom components have a weak affinity for the produced coagulants and thus the qt did not increased although amount of produced coagulant increased as seen in fig 4 the removal efficiency of uv254 was similar at 6 ma cm2 and 10 ma cm2 during process the absorbance unit at uv254 was higher than initial values at 10 min of treatment for all operating current density the reason of this phenomenon may be explained by dissolved iron at anode which caused a yellowish color and result in increase in 254 of wavelength 45 until precipitations of flocs fe oh 3 has a shape of yellowish small particles and its sedimentation is difficult 51 according to uv abs 254 values and a certain time is necessary for sedimentation of occurred monomeric fe nom polymeric fe nom and nom fe oh 3 s flocs the removal efficiency of uv254 was determined as 73 5 0 036 cm 1 and 79 7 0 0277 cm 1 at the end of the operating time for 6 ma cm2 and 10 ma cm2 respectively the removal efficiencies of uv254 were reached to almost a stabilizing stage after 30 min at 3 ma cm2 of current density the decrease in uv254 was 61 0 0 053 cm 1 at the end of the operating time and suva was 1 38 l m mg at 6 ma cm2 it can be concluded that the hydrophobic fraction was mainly removed the generated both al3 and fe2 fe3 ions occur hydroxides and polyhydroxides complexes depending on ph simultaneously electrode passivation by formation of an inhibiting layer usually an oxide on the electrode surface reduces coagulant addition to solution in reactor this formation occur different degree for each electrode type using hybrid electrode arrangement passivation effect on removal efficiency of pollutant can be decreased fig 5 a shows the effect of current density on the removal efficiency of doc by using hybrid electrode at 10 ma cm2 of current density after 30 min the rate of decrease in doc was slow the highest removal efficiency was obtained with 58 4 at 60 min at current density of 10 ma cm2 the decrease in doc was 25 9 and 28 6 at 3 ma cm2 and 6 ma cm2 of current density at 10 min respectively the removal efficiency at lowest current density closed to doc decrease at 6 ma cm2 of current density after 40 min the removal efficiency was 52 4 doceff 3 13 mg l and 53 0 doceff 3 09 mg l at 3 ma cm2 and 6 ma cm2 respectively at the end of the process as seen in fig 5b the decrease of uv254 was obtained as 72 5 uv254eff 0 0374 cm 1 63 5 uv254eff 0 0497 cm 1 and 62 4 uv254eff 0 0511 cm 1 at 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 respectively charge loading is the quantity of electricity per unit volume it designates the amount of transferred electron and thereby the amount of the al3 or fe2 fe3 ions produced in solution during the electrolysis the effects of different electrodes on doc removal efficiency was determined by charge loading in fig 6 doc removal efficiency attained almost a stabile phase after 2000 of charge loading 30 min electrolysis by hybrid electrodes the end of ec process the doc removal efficiency was 58 4 52 2 63 7 for hybrid al fe respectively the highest doc removal efficiencies were observed by fe electrodes at the lowest consumption of electricity when the results in chapter 4 are evaluated it is clear that the fe electrode is the most effective electrode for doc removal for this reason only the fe electrode was used in the studies after this part 4 2 the effect of initial ph on removal of aquatic nom zeta potential and floc size in ec process the initial ph phi is one of the most important parameter due to the impact on both metal species and structure of organic substance in wastewater the fig 7 a and b show the effect of phi on removal efficiency of nom in terms of the decrease in doc at 6 ma cm2 of current density using fe electrode at 4 8 and original ph of raw water the original ph of water was the best for effective removal of nom with 60 5 doceff 2 61 mg l fig 7b shows fe dosage was 488 mg for all phs at 60 min and the removed mg nom per fe dosage g was 8 2 at alkaline ph the removal efficiency of doc was 51 4 doceff 3 22 mg l at acidic conditions while the removal efficiency of doc was 45 4 doceff 3 61 mg l at 60 min the decrease in doc appeared similar with phi 8 until 40 min qt was calculated as 6 1 and 6 9 mg g for 4 and 8 of phi respectively table 4 the effect of initial ph on floc size and zeta potential zp was studied for lake terkos water at optimum conditions in order to investigate removal mechanism of aquatic nom during ec process the fig 8 a shows the changes in zp and phi during ec process at different phi by using fe electrode at different ph values there are three basic phenomena that will change the zeta potential of raw water during ec treatment the first is that the ph changes affect the functional groups of the pollutants and change the zp of the water it is well known that zeta potential of humic substance decrease with increased ph due to the some functional groups in humic substances 52 the second phenomenon is that the zeta potential reduces due to the o h produced at the cathode during ec the results obtained indicate that the first and second phenomina are particularly acceptable for ph 7 7 and 8 however at ph 4 a rise in the zeta potential till the ph level of 6 was obtained and then it was fallen this fluctuation at ph 4 may be due to the third phenomina which is that the positive iron ions dissolved in the anode effect the zeta potential of the water the zeta potential of fe ii hydroxide was reported as more negative in compared with fe iii and the zeta potential of fe ii hydroxide decreased with increased ph in addition it was reported that fe ii is more negative in basic middle than in acidic one and the iso electric point is observed at a ph 6 53 these results showed that the formed flocs in ec are probably fe ii hydroxide thus it can be concluded that removal mechanism depend on i the hydrogen bonding and the van der waals interaction ii the enmeshment of pollutants in the pore of porous iron hydroxide precipitate and iii the sweep coagulation by the formation of fe ii hydroxide fig 8b shows that breakage and re growth of flocs was observed at all phi of 4 7 7 and 8 the highest growth rate floc formation was observed at phi 8 floc growth rate was similar until 10 min at 4 0 7 7 and 8 0 of phi after 10 min of electrolysis time at phi 8 and 4 growth of the floc size acceleration was faster than 7 7 of phi there was not a certain correlation about growth rate of particle size at acidic or alkaline conditions but the breakage of flocs was observed at all ph values after a certain particle size with fe electrodes after 25 min floc size was diminished the sedimention of coagulated flocs me iii organic matter was occured while increasing in removal efficiency of doc fig 7 after 45 min re growth of colloids can result from hydrolyzed fe ii iii species hydrolyzed fe ii iii species would be expected to exhibit restabilization by overdosing the overdosing wouldn t effect on decrease in doc the removal efficiency of doc could move towards stabilizing phase after almost 50 min the zeta and size measurement with standard deviation at different phi during ec process time at j 6 ma cm2 with fe electrode was given in sm2 4 3 the characterization of aquatic nom by hpsec the molecular weight distributions of raw and treated ltw were determined via hpsec with rid and dad it should be kept in mind that rid are sensitive to all components in the water but have low precision whereas dad are only sensitive to components with absorbance at 254 nm but high precision in addition in the rid results the decrease in the y axis indicates that the nom component in the water decreases quantitatively and the increase in the x axis indicates the decrease in molecular weight as it is seen in fig 9 after electrolysis time of 25 min the high mw fraction of raw water obviously reduced the decreasing in response of rid was observed after 45 min while mw decrease was not so much at 60 min electrolysis the response of rid was not almost changed as mw the higher mw was 3 3 10 5 da in the ec effluent water while the highest mw was 8 8 10 5 da of raw water as it is seen fig 10 the raw water had three peak that shows aromatic structure of organic matter after the end of the process all peaks reduced initial 25 min of electrolysis showed faster removal of aromatic structure rid and dad results showed that water contains low medium and high molecular weight nom components but high molecular weight components are predominant and the ec system removes the higher molecular weight components faster even though it is effective in the removal of all components these results are consistent with the suva results obtained in this study in addition the dad results indicate that the removal of noms is faster at the beginning of process these results are consistent with the doc removal efficiencies within the scope of this study 5 conclusion in this study natural organic matters in a lake were removed by electrocoagulation ec technique the effect of operational parameters such as initial ph current density operation time charge loading and electrode type were investigated the experimental results showed that the 63 7 for doc 79 7 for uv254 and 76 7 for color vis436 were possible by iron electrode at original phi of lake water 7 74 0 02 at 60 min it is determined that nom is removed by three different mechanisms during ec process three mechanisms are the hydrogen bonding and the vander waals interaction precipitation and sweep coagulation the suva measurement shows that raw water predominantly contains high molecular weight compounds and is a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic nom as well as a mixture of humic acids and other noms in water according to suva results it can be concluded that at optimum treatment conditions ec system can achieve to remove predominantly humics hydrophobic and high molecular weight compounds the hpsec results in the study show that in accordance with suva water contains different molecular weights components but primarily removes high molecular weight components acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from

14322,the performance of electrocoagulation ec process via aluminium and iron plate anodes were evaluated for removal of aquatic natural organic matter nom the effect of current density j operation time tec initial ph phi charge loading and electrode types were investigated the nom removal efficiencies were measured with respect to dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 vis436 and specific uv absorbance suva with initial value 6 58 mg doc l 0 1363 1 cm 0 004 1 cm and 2 07 l m mg respectively the experimental results showed that the effective removal of nom 63 7 for doc 79 7 for uv254 and 76 7 for vis436 color was obtained by iron electrode at original phi of lake water 7 74 0 02 at 60 min the adsorption capacity qt mg doc per g produced al and fe or coulomb were calculated at a specific electrolysis time at 6 ma cm2 of optimum current density 8 2 mg of doc was removed per g in situ produced fe at original phi of water in addition the zeta potential and floc size analysis were used to explicate the removal mechanism of nom the results of the size exclusion chromatography showed that the affinity of ec process is higher for the aromatic fraction of nom during electrolysis time keywords natural organic matter nom electrocoagulation ec zeta potential floc size high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec 1 introduction natural organic matters noms are a ubiquitous component of the lithosphere and hydrosphere that constitutes one of the largest reservoirs of the carbon 1 natural organic matter nom plays an important role in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems cycles 2 a significant portion of the nom in lakes rivers and surface water comes from deteriorated animal and plant residual 3 the physicochemical structure reactivity and quantity of nom in an aquatic system depend on the vegetation type season climate hydrology and disturbance in the surrounding watershed 4 7 nom consists of a heterogeneous mixture of aliphatic and aromatic polymers containing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur functional groups cooh oh och3 nh2 and hs 8 three categories represent together the most important part of nom in surface waters humic substances humic and fulvic acids polysaccharides and proteins these categories have highly different molecular properties such as weight surface charge size affinity and solubility in water 9 3 nom is measured as dissolved organic carbon doc or total organic carbon toc in surface waters and typically presence in the range of 0 5 and 50 mg c l 10 which is necessary for ecosystems normal functioning the presence of noms in drinking water influences water quality color turbidity taste and odor and the fate transport of organic inorganic contaminants in water for this reason there is a raising concern about the effect of nom on public health 11 12 the most serious public health concern regarding with nom is the formation potential of toxic by products during drinking water disinfection by chlorination noms act as a major precursor to the forming of disinfection by products dbps some of which are mutagenic and carcinogenic 12 13 other serious public health concerns arise from the fact that nom is a food source for microbial growth nom causes fouling of resins membranes and equipment by bio film formation in distribution system and this bacterial formation increases usage of water treatment chemicals 14 16 also the excess amount of organic matter in water can lead to undesirable effect on ecosystems such as decrease in permeability of light in this way high nom concentrations decrease the rate of oxygen production in lakes through inhibiting the photosynthesis 17 briefly nom alters oxygen cycling may increase toxicity and cause a great number of problem regarding to treatment systems thus the control of nom in drinking water and surface water is significant for the sustainability of aquatic ecosystem as well as public health the most common and economically feasible method is coagulation and flocculation for nom removal however conventional water purification techniques such as chemical coagulation are not effective against some toxic and refractory organic pollutants for instance lin et al 18 found that conventional water treatment processes could not effectively remove dbps precursors other treatment options for nom removal adsorption membrane filtration methods and oxidation processes are placed in literature various adsorbents such as oxides activated carbon natural minerals and anion exchange resins are used in removing nom 19 21 activated carbon ac is an effective adsorbent commonly used in drinking water treatment alone or in combination with other treatment systems for instance it was suggested that if coagulation is insufficient in the decreasing of nom the additional treatment with granular or powdered ac gac pac can be efficient in order to maintain required water quality in terms of dbps formation 22 23 however in most of the cases a part of noms with low molecular weight is not removed even after ac filtration 22 ac can also be colonized by a heterotrophic biomass creating biological ac bac thus reducing the proportion of easily assimilated and biodegradable elements another treatment system which suggested to nom removal is ion exchange processes however using resins have some disadvantages such as requirement of regeneration 24 as well as the lost of resins during regeneration these disadvantages increase the operational costs and cause operating difficulties at the end of process the resin waste usually has high salt concentration and needs treatment disposal in addition a decreasing in the doc and dbps precursors were reported in combination of magnetic ion exchange resin and coagulation 25 27 even though this has not been evident in all cases 28 although the application of membrane filtration in removal of nom is the one of the most promising technology in the past decades 29 membrane separation is facing important problems such as high cost the fouling mechanisms and declining of flux 30 34 other suggested treatment methods for removal of nom are advanced oxidation processes aops which provide organic compounds degradation 35 37 although present a great of advantages such as high removal efficiencies and complete mineralization of pollutant aops has the drawbacks during aops the by products may form 29 and the strong removal conditions may not be economically feasible in commercial applications 38 briefly the further studies regarding to removal of noms are required since surface water typically have high particles concentrations i e turbidity pathogenic microorganisms and precursors which may form carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps at this point electrochemical techniques can be a good alternative means of treating toxic and resistant organic matters 39 among electrochemical techniques electrooxidation eo electro fenton ef and electrocoagulation ec are the most promising processes inside these techniques electrocoagulation ec has been seen as an effective and promising alternative as compared with conventional technologies such as chemical coagulation cc in purifying wastewater freshwater 40 44 it may also be called green technology because little or no chemical are needed during ec therefore ec treatment process produces fewer by products and less sludge 45 studies demonstrate that ec technology achieves effectively removal of nom by electrolytic oxidation of sacrificial anodes typically aluminium or iron 46 48 however there is limited information about the nom removal in surface waters which has low suva value in the literature these waters may be characterized by having nom of hydrophilic character less aromaticity and low molecular weight also the existing methods spectroscopic methods specialty of nom have slightly been investigated during ec this study focused on removal of aquatic noms via ec reactor cell that comprised of aluminium and iron electrodes to improve performance of ec process different electrode arrangement was designed the hybrid system in this study can be together advantages of al and fe anode electrodes the effect of main operating parameters such as current density operating time initial ph phi and electrode types on process was investigated the efficiency of the treatment was measured by doc uv254 nm and color parameters another purpose of this investigation was to make explicit the removal mechanism during ec and the structure of nom in this manner the effect of phi on zeta potential ζ and floc size was analyzed by zeta size meter the suva at 254 nm that is an effective indicator of nom aromaticity was determined the molecular weight distribution of aquatic nom was investigated by high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials surface water samples were obtained from lake terkos which is the one of the biggest drinking water supplies 142 000 000 m3 year in istanbul turkey lake terkos provides 25 of the water demand of this metropolitan area 49 lake terkos has a 39 km² water area and a maximum depth of 11 m lake terkos being rich in terms of feeding from rivers has fresh water characteristics despite its proximity to the black sea raw water samples from lake terkos ltw were collected and transported to the laboratory and kept at 4 c the physicochemical properties of the raw water at original ph were determined immediately and presented in table 1 besides anion and cation concentration of ltw were shown in table 2 al ion concentration was lower than detection limit of instrument icp oes perkin elmer the residual concentration of al ion was 2 693 mg l fe ion concentration was 0 001 mg l in raw water the residual concentration of iron ion was 0 079 mg l at optimum condition at the end of process all of used inorganic chemicals were analytical grade and all reagents were prepared in millipore milli q deionized water 3 methods 3 1 experimental set up and procedure the ec process experiments were conducted in laboratory scale an ec batch cell consisted of a plexiglas reactor that had dimensions of 150 mm x 100 mm x100 mm the electrodes were made of high purity aluminium and iron plates with dimensions of 130 mm x 80 mm the performances of sacrificial electrodes were compared via using aluminum iron and hybrid electrodes when one pair of al or fe electrodes was used separately two plate electrodes one anode and one cathode were placed vertically in the ec reactor the schematic representation of ec process was given in sm1 the total immersed active surface area of one pair of al or fe was 70 cm2 hybrid system was designed via two pairs of al and fe electrodes which were placed simultaneously into reactor these four electrodes immersed active surface area was 182 cm2 due to the current density was held constant for comparison of performance of electrodes the applied current i was changed in the hybrid system in each run all water samples were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature before experiments in the preliminary experimental studies 1000 ml of water was placed in the ec reactor samples were taken from each 5 min and the experiment was carried out 25 min the samples were drawn from centre of the reactor with a depth of almost 5 cm below the water surface without filtration since the treatment results from preliminary experiment showed that the 25 minute was not enough the duration of the experiment was increased to 60 min and the amount of the water was increased to 1300 ml by this means the effect of the amount of samples taken at certain intervals on the test results was kept to a minimum prior to experiments electrodes were washed with 0 25 m h2so4 solution for 2 min and rinsed with deionized water then dried in the drying oven and placed in a desiccator to cool down electrodes were connected to a digital power supply gw instek psp 405 programmable dc at monopolar parallel mode and currents were held constant for each run during operating time water was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at a speed of 150 rpm the samples were taken at the different operating times from the ec reactor and filtered through 0 45 μm pore size membrane before uv vis doc and hplc analysis the experiments were repeated for zeta and particle size measurement at optimum conditions the produced coagulant dosage c e mg l was theoretically calculated by faraday s law and defined as 1 c e i t m z f v where m g mol is the molecular weight of aluminium or fe and z is the number of electrons involved in the oxidation decrease reaction z al 3 and z fe 2 i is the applied current a t is the ec operating time min f is the faraday s constant 1 f 96487 c and v is the solution volume l in the ec reactor on the other hand charge loading q coulomb l is defined as the charges transferred in electrochemical reactions for a given amount of treated water and calculated as 2 q c l i t v in this study the removal efficiency of ha were evaluated in terms of adsorption capacity qt qt is the amount of adsorbed ha mg doc g by the produced coagulant and calculated by the using eq 3 3 q t c o c t v w s where co and ct are the concentrations of ha mg doc l at the initial and at a specific time t respectively ws is the al or fe dosage g also qt was calculated as mg doc coulomb using eq 2 3 2 analytical methods the ph and initial conductivity were determined using wtw inolab multi 9310 ids ph meter and con6 conductivity meter ecoscan respectively the initial turbidity of samples was measured with hach lange turbidimeter al and fe ion concentration was measured icp oes perkin elmer the absorbance values at 254 and 436 nm were recorded by perkin elmer lambda 45 uv vis spectrophotometer vis436 indicates color of water samples doc content of samples was measured using a toc analyzer tocvcph shimadzu japan as non purgeable organic carbon npoc the zeta potential and floc size measurements of the particles were determined using a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern usa each result was an average of three readings the ltw samples were characterized using hpsec technique apparent molecular weight was derived by calibration with standard protein characterization studies were carried out by an agilent hplc high performance liquid chromatography 1260 series consisting of uv vis and refrective index ri detectors the used columns are pl aquagel oh 30 100 60 000 mw and pl aquagel oh mixed h 6 000 10 000 000 mw the columns have a ph range 2 10 compatibility with organic solvent up to 50 methanol mechanical stability up to 140 bar 4 results and discussion 4 1 the effect of current density operating time and charge loading on removal of aquatic nom the effect of current density on doc uv254 and color removal efficiencies were determined at original ph of ltw by using al fe and hybrid anode electrodes as seen in fig 1 when al electrodes were used doc removal efficiencies as 27 2 35 3 34 8 and 70 7 and the removal of uv254 as 63 7 69 8 70 4 and 87 4 were measured at the 3 0 6 0 10 0 and 15 0 ma cm2 of current density and the 25 min of operating time respectively the results showed that the increasing of current density and operating time increased the removal efficiencies although the highest removal efficiencies was obtained at 15 ma cm2 of current density the temperature of solution increased during 25 min and reached 32 8 c temperature has a significant effect on the dissolving speed of al 47 and the rising temperature of water is another variable thus this current density 15 ma cm2 was eliminated on the other hand it was clear that 25 min operating time was not enough for removal of nom at other current densities 3 0 6 0 and 10 0 therefore the experiments were re done as 60 min in order to increase removal efficiency of doc at 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 of current density as it is seen in fig 2 at 60 min the removal efficiency of doc was 52 4 effluent doc doceff 3 13 mg l 50 2 doceff 3 28 mg l and 40 3 doceff 3 93 mg l for 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 respectively al dosage at 60 min was calculated as 235 mg for 10 ma cm2 and 157 mg for 6 ma cm2 fig 2b thus the amount of removed nom was calculated as 21 mg doc g al or 0 0026 mg doc c at 6 ma cm2 and 14 7 mg of doc g al at 10 ma cm2 table 3 as seen in fig 2c the removal efficiency of uv254 was obtained as 78 7 uv254eff 0 029 cm 1 76 1 uv254eff 0 034 cm 1 and 60 6 uv254eff 0 056 cm 1 at 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 of current density by al electrode respectively at optimum current density that was 6 ma cm2 the suva value was determined as 1 04 l mg m at the end of the process at 3 ma cm2 the suva reduced to 1 42 l m mg suva 4 indicates mainly hydrophobic and especially high mw fraction while 2 suva 4 indicates both hydrophobic and hydrophilic and suva 2 illustrates mainly hydrophilic and low mw substances 50 the calculated suva values were under 2 indicating removal of high mw fractions fig 3 shows the effect of current density on doc removal efficiency when fe electrodes were used at the original phi of sample the maximum removal efficiencies were 63 7 doceff 2 39 mg l 60 5 doceff 2 61 mg l and 40 1 doceff 3 97 mg l at 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 respectively at original ph of water fe dosages were 729 and 487 mg at 10 ma cm2 and 6 ma cm2 respectively at 60 min fig 3b thus at optimum current density 6 ma cm2 8 2 mg of doc was removed per g fe the amount of removed doc per g fe was found to decrease 10 8 5 8 mg g with increase in fe dosage table 3 it seemed that adsorption site of iron hydroxides for iron complexes organic molecules interaction was increased by increased the amount of fe dosage due to increased available surface charges which favored functional sides of organic matter for attachment however the removal of mg doc per g fe dosage did not increase with increasing produced fe the reason of this phenomenon can be explained as affinity of pollutants it is assumed that some parts of the nom components have a weak affinity for the produced coagulants and thus the qt did not increased although amount of produced coagulant increased as seen in fig 4 the removal efficiency of uv254 was similar at 6 ma cm2 and 10 ma cm2 during process the absorbance unit at uv254 was higher than initial values at 10 min of treatment for all operating current density the reason of this phenomenon may be explained by dissolved iron at anode which caused a yellowish color and result in increase in 254 of wavelength 45 until precipitations of flocs fe oh 3 has a shape of yellowish small particles and its sedimentation is difficult 51 according to uv abs 254 values and a certain time is necessary for sedimentation of occurred monomeric fe nom polymeric fe nom and nom fe oh 3 s flocs the removal efficiency of uv254 was determined as 73 5 0 036 cm 1 and 79 7 0 0277 cm 1 at the end of the operating time for 6 ma cm2 and 10 ma cm2 respectively the removal efficiencies of uv254 were reached to almost a stabilizing stage after 30 min at 3 ma cm2 of current density the decrease in uv254 was 61 0 0 053 cm 1 at the end of the operating time and suva was 1 38 l m mg at 6 ma cm2 it can be concluded that the hydrophobic fraction was mainly removed the generated both al3 and fe2 fe3 ions occur hydroxides and polyhydroxides complexes depending on ph simultaneously electrode passivation by formation of an inhibiting layer usually an oxide on the electrode surface reduces coagulant addition to solution in reactor this formation occur different degree for each electrode type using hybrid electrode arrangement passivation effect on removal efficiency of pollutant can be decreased fig 5 a shows the effect of current density on the removal efficiency of doc by using hybrid electrode at 10 ma cm2 of current density after 30 min the rate of decrease in doc was slow the highest removal efficiency was obtained with 58 4 at 60 min at current density of 10 ma cm2 the decrease in doc was 25 9 and 28 6 at 3 ma cm2 and 6 ma cm2 of current density at 10 min respectively the removal efficiency at lowest current density closed to doc decrease at 6 ma cm2 of current density after 40 min the removal efficiency was 52 4 doceff 3 13 mg l and 53 0 doceff 3 09 mg l at 3 ma cm2 and 6 ma cm2 respectively at the end of the process as seen in fig 5b the decrease of uv254 was obtained as 72 5 uv254eff 0 0374 cm 1 63 5 uv254eff 0 0497 cm 1 and 62 4 uv254eff 0 0511 cm 1 at 10 ma cm2 6 ma cm2 and 3 ma cm2 respectively charge loading is the quantity of electricity per unit volume it designates the amount of transferred electron and thereby the amount of the al3 or fe2 fe3 ions produced in solution during the electrolysis the effects of different electrodes on doc removal efficiency was determined by charge loading in fig 6 doc removal efficiency attained almost a stabile phase after 2000 of charge loading 30 min electrolysis by hybrid electrodes the end of ec process the doc removal efficiency was 58 4 52 2 63 7 for hybrid al fe respectively the highest doc removal efficiencies were observed by fe electrodes at the lowest consumption of electricity when the results in chapter 4 are evaluated it is clear that the fe electrode is the most effective electrode for doc removal for this reason only the fe electrode was used in the studies after this part 4 2 the effect of initial ph on removal of aquatic nom zeta potential and floc size in ec process the initial ph phi is one of the most important parameter due to the impact on both metal species and structure of organic substance in wastewater the fig 7 a and b show the effect of phi on removal efficiency of nom in terms of the decrease in doc at 6 ma cm2 of current density using fe electrode at 4 8 and original ph of raw water the original ph of water was the best for effective removal of nom with 60 5 doceff 2 61 mg l fig 7b shows fe dosage was 488 mg for all phs at 60 min and the removed mg nom per fe dosage g was 8 2 at alkaline ph the removal efficiency of doc was 51 4 doceff 3 22 mg l at acidic conditions while the removal efficiency of doc was 45 4 doceff 3 61 mg l at 60 min the decrease in doc appeared similar with phi 8 until 40 min qt was calculated as 6 1 and 6 9 mg g for 4 and 8 of phi respectively table 4 the effect of initial ph on floc size and zeta potential zp was studied for lake terkos water at optimum conditions in order to investigate removal mechanism of aquatic nom during ec process the fig 8 a shows the changes in zp and phi during ec process at different phi by using fe electrode at different ph values there are three basic phenomena that will change the zeta potential of raw water during ec treatment the first is that the ph changes affect the functional groups of the pollutants and change the zp of the water it is well known that zeta potential of humic substance decrease with increased ph due to the some functional groups in humic substances 52 the second phenomenon is that the zeta potential reduces due to the o h produced at the cathode during ec the results obtained indicate that the first and second phenomina are particularly acceptable for ph 7 7 and 8 however at ph 4 a rise in the zeta potential till the ph level of 6 was obtained and then it was fallen this fluctuation at ph 4 may be due to the third phenomina which is that the positive iron ions dissolved in the anode effect the zeta potential of the water the zeta potential of fe ii hydroxide was reported as more negative in compared with fe iii and the zeta potential of fe ii hydroxide decreased with increased ph in addition it was reported that fe ii is more negative in basic middle than in acidic one and the iso electric point is observed at a ph 6 53 these results showed that the formed flocs in ec are probably fe ii hydroxide thus it can be concluded that removal mechanism depend on i the hydrogen bonding and the van der waals interaction ii the enmeshment of pollutants in the pore of porous iron hydroxide precipitate and iii the sweep coagulation by the formation of fe ii hydroxide fig 8b shows that breakage and re growth of flocs was observed at all phi of 4 7 7 and 8 the highest growth rate floc formation was observed at phi 8 floc growth rate was similar until 10 min at 4 0 7 7 and 8 0 of phi after 10 min of electrolysis time at phi 8 and 4 growth of the floc size acceleration was faster than 7 7 of phi there was not a certain correlation about growth rate of particle size at acidic or alkaline conditions but the breakage of flocs was observed at all ph values after a certain particle size with fe electrodes after 25 min floc size was diminished the sedimention of coagulated flocs me iii organic matter was occured while increasing in removal efficiency of doc fig 7 after 45 min re growth of colloids can result from hydrolyzed fe ii iii species hydrolyzed fe ii iii species would be expected to exhibit restabilization by overdosing the overdosing wouldn t effect on decrease in doc the removal efficiency of doc could move towards stabilizing phase after almost 50 min the zeta and size measurement with standard deviation at different phi during ec process time at j 6 ma cm2 with fe electrode was given in sm2 4 3 the characterization of aquatic nom by hpsec the molecular weight distributions of raw and treated ltw were determined via hpsec with rid and dad it should be kept in mind that rid are sensitive to all components in the water but have low precision whereas dad are only sensitive to components with absorbance at 254 nm but high precision in addition in the rid results the decrease in the y axis indicates that the nom component in the water decreases quantitatively and the increase in the x axis indicates the decrease in molecular weight as it is seen in fig 9 after electrolysis time of 25 min the high mw fraction of raw water obviously reduced the decreasing in response of rid was observed after 45 min while mw decrease was not so much at 60 min electrolysis the response of rid was not almost changed as mw the higher mw was 3 3 10 5 da in the ec effluent water while the highest mw was 8 8 10 5 da of raw water as it is seen fig 10 the raw water had three peak that shows aromatic structure of organic matter after the end of the process all peaks reduced initial 25 min of electrolysis showed faster removal of aromatic structure rid and dad results showed that water contains low medium and high molecular weight nom components but high molecular weight components are predominant and the ec system removes the higher molecular weight components faster even though it is effective in the removal of all components these results are consistent with the suva results obtained in this study in addition the dad results indicate that the removal of noms is faster at the beginning of process these results are consistent with the doc removal efficiencies within the scope of this study 5 conclusion in this study natural organic matters in a lake were removed by electrocoagulation ec technique the effect of operational parameters such as initial ph current density operation time charge loading and electrode type were investigated the experimental results showed that the 63 7 for doc 79 7 for uv254 and 76 7 for color vis436 were possible by iron electrode at original phi of lake water 7 74 0 02 at 60 min it is determined that nom is removed by three different mechanisms during ec process three mechanisms are the hydrogen bonding and the vander waals interaction precipitation and sweep coagulation the suva measurement shows that raw water predominantly contains high molecular weight compounds and is a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic nom as well as a mixture of humic acids and other noms in water according to suva results it can be concluded that at optimum treatment conditions ec system can achieve to remove predominantly humics hydrophobic and high molecular weight compounds the hpsec results in the study show that in accordance with suva water contains different molecular weights components but primarily removes high molecular weight components acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from

14323,the aim of this study is to analyse the fouling behaviour of polyethersulfone pes polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp titanium oxide tio2 mixed matrix mm hollow fiber hf membrane with varying tio2 loadings for humic acid ha treatment the mm hf membrane was fabricated using dry jet wet phase inversion method by blending varying amount of tio2 nanoparticles 1 2 3 and 4 wt into the pes dope solution the fabricated hf membrane was characterised in terms of their surface and cross section morphology contact angle pore size and porosity these characteristics can highly affect the membrane antifouling behaviour as well as membrane flux the membrane was tested using 50 mg l of ha solution adjusted to ph 7 7 all mm hf membranes suggested better antifouling with s2 sample at 2 wt tio2 having optimal antifouling and flux performance with the lowest value for resistance by fouling and less than 5 difference from the best permeate flux and rejection values under this formulation ha permeation test has registered an improved membrane flux at 23 851 kg m2 h and ha rejection of 97 89 an improvement of 28 9 and 3 8 respectively as compared to the neat pes membrane ha rejection increased drastically due to higher surface hydrophilicity of tio2 blended membranes which repels the hydrophobic ha and prevented the adsorption of ha onto the membrane surface this also minimize the formation of reversible and irreversible fouling by ha which increases its antifouling abilities keywords antifouling polyethersulfone titanium oxide mixed matrix membrane humic acid 1 introduction humic acid ha is one of the major components of humic substances which can be found abundantly in soil humus peat upland streams dystrophic lakes and ocean water 1 the presence of ha in soil is essential for plant growth through accelerating respiration affecting photosynthesis increasing water nutrient uptake and increasing plant yield 2 however present of ha in water stream can be harmful to human being as it will promote adsorption and migration transformation of metal ion some organic inorganic pollution in water via complexation through the formation of ha metal complexes 3 the situation will become worse if ha enters a water treatment plant as ha is a precursor for the formation of disinfection by product through the reaction with chlorine and has been associated with some endemic diseases 4 hence removal of ha prior to chlorination process in wastewater treatment plant is important to eliminate the carcinogenesis potential in accordance to this various ha removal methodologies have been investigated which includes coagulation 5 electrocoagulation 6 electromagnetic treatment 7 adsorption 8 9 and oxidation process 10 however these methods are prone to electrode fouling high operating cost high maintenance cost and high energy requirement 11 looking at this situation a relatively simple advance and cost effective method utilizing membrane technology has appeared as a better approach for ha removal polymeric membranes are normally composed of hydrophobic polymer such as polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf and polysulfone psf out of these polymers pes has been chosen by most of the researchers due to its excellent chemical mechanical and thermal strength besides pes also exhibit good performance in term of environmental endurance and easy to be processed 12 pes environmental endurance particularly allows it to withstand process at varying ph condition or those that may require harsh chemical cleaning the unpredictable nature of wastewater treatment feed and the need for periodical cleaning maintenance makes pes based membrane a good choice for this purpose despite of the various advantages of pes excellent and consistent ha removal by using pristine pes membrane cannot be achieved due to its hydrophobic nature 13 14 this makes it prone to fouling due to the hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic organic solute such as ha and the membrane s material 15 the interaction causes ha to easily adsorb on the membrane s surface declining the flux across the membrane with time and hinders the stability of the membrane s performance 16 18 one of the best ways to mitigate the fouling problem of pes membrane is by increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane improvement to the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces will pave the way for easier adsorption of water molecule to the surface this will hence form a thin layer of water between the membrane surface and the organic molecules foulants such as ha particles minimizing foulant attachment moreover as majority of foulants such as ha and oil are hydrophobic in nature a more hydrophilic surface will repel these hydrophobic foulants instead of adsorbing them 19 to date various physical and chemical modifications have been employed to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface one of the most promising one is by blending the polymers with nanoparticles prior to membrane fabrication over the past 10 years blending has attracted a lot of interest due to their relatively convenient operation and the need for mild preparation condition 20 coined as mixed matrix mm membrane extensive studies have been conducted by various researchers to improve membrane s hydrophilicity through this method some of the most studied nanoparticles that has been used to modify pes membrane includes titanium oxide tio2 21 23 zinc oxide zno 14 24 silica sio2 25 26 and zirconium dioxide zro2 27 out of these nanoparticles tio2 is one of the main contenders for membrane nano additive due to its stability high hydrophilicity antibacterial properties availability low toxicity and cost effectiveness 28 29 additionally it has also been proven that the preparation method of pes tio2 membrane assembles the nanoparticles near to the pores 21 this would further help in repelling the hydrophobic foulants from passing through the membrane reducing the chance for ha to approach the membrane surface minimize pore blocking and attributing to the sustainable antifouling property of the membrane so far most of the tio2 blended mm membranes studied as mentioned before are fabricated in flat sheet configuration which has rather limited real world application hollow fiber hf one of the alternative dimensional configuration for polymeric membrane has been so far the favourite with more demand for industrial application as proven by the availability of supplier for hf membrane as compared to flat sheet 30 therefore in this work the fouling evaluation of pes pvp tio2 mm hf membrane with various tio2 loadings will be conducted this work would hence give a clear indication on the applicability of tio2 mm hf membrane for real ultrafiltration application as well as the fouling resistance of the membranes towards ha 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyethersulfone pes ultrason e6020 p with mw 58 000 g mol was purchased

nanoparticles were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 70 c deionized water was used for permeation test and ha solution preparation while distilled water was used for membrane washing cycle filtered tap water was used during membrane spinning and phase inversion process 2 2 membrane preparation in this study hf membranes were fabricated via non solvent induced phase separation nips dope solution was firstly prepared by blending the pes pvp and tio2 nanoparticles 300 g of the dope solution was made by dispersing various amount of tio2 nanoparticles 0 1 2 3 and 4 wt in the dmac solvent the solution was then mechanically stirred at 600 rpm for 3 h at room temperature then the mixture was sonicated for 15 min followed by stirring for another 3 min at 600 rpm to disperse the nanoparticle added to the dope solution subsequently 4 wt of pvp a pore forming agent and hydrophilic polymer was added and stirring was continued for another 3 h at 60 c finally the predetermined amount of dried pes polymer was added over a period of 2 h the dope solution was kept stirred with speed of 500 rpm at temperature of 60 c for 24 h the composition of the dope solution was shown in table 1 to remove bubbles in the solution the dope solution was degassed for 1 h by placing the solution in an ultrasonic bath next pes pvp tio2 mm hf membranes were fabricated via dry jet wet phase inversion the degassed dope solution was filled into the polymer tank then the dope solution and bore fluid were extruded through the spinneret at a fixed speed of 15 278 cm s with an air gap of 15 cm before entering the coagulation bath filtered tap water the hf membrane was spun using distilled water as the bore fluid to flow the dope solution purified nitrogen at 1 5 bar was applied from the nitrogen cylinder into the polymer tank details of the spinning condition is shown in table 2 spinning conditions were similar for all the dope solutions the produced hf membranes were then kept in water for 4 days the water will be changed daily to remove any residual solvent next the hf membranes were immersed in 50 glycerol water mixture for 24 h at room temperature and then dried for 5 days the fabricated membranes need to be immersed in glycerol solution to preserve the membrane structure prior to permeation test and to avoid membrane pore collapse 2 3 hollow fiber module preparation six fibers were cut 53 cm in length and potted together in the module holder using epoxy resin after a complete curing of the resin the prepared samples were immersed in ethanol for 1 h followed by distilled water for 1 days noted that the effective length per membrane fiber is 47 cm while the effective area varies with outer diameter of the hf membranes 2 4 membrane characterization 2 4 1 membrane s chemistry fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed to determine the functional groups on the membrane surface fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflection ftir atr thermo scientific nicolet nexus 670 was employed for this purpose all samples were scanned over the wavenumber range of 650 to 4000 cm 1 resolution 4 cm 1 using omni diamond accessory an average spectrum of 32 scans were recorded per sample characterized 2 4 2 cross sectional and outer surface morphologies surface and cross sectional images for each membrane samples were observed under scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm 3000 tabletop membrane samples were coated with thin layer of gold palladium using sputter coater quorum sc7620 for 90 s as for the cross sectional morphology the membranes were cracked using liquid nitrogen prior to characterization 2 4 3 elemental mapping energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was utilised to analyse the elemental properties of the hf membrane edx analysis was performed using field emission sem fesem equipped with an edx spectroscopy edax inc usa under 5000 magnification 2 4 4 water contact angle ca measurements the surface hydrophilicity of membrane was characterized using the contact angle goniometer model oca15plus dataphysics hf membrane was mounted horizontally on the glass slide by using double sided tape and pressed using another piece of glass slide to flatten it a water droplet 0 2 μl was dropped onto each membrane surface through a needle tip attached to the goniometer a magnified image of water droplet was observed by a digital camera and the ca readings were obtained after 10 s of water drop 2 4 5 rheological properties of membrane dope solution the rheological properties of different dope solution were determined by measuring their individual viscosity the viscosity of the dope solution with various tio2 loading was measured using brookfield digital rheometer model dv iii usa at temperature of 25 2 c and shear rate of 10 s 1 the average viscosities of five samples were reported 2 4 6 porosity and pore size the porosity of the hf membrane was determined through its dry wet weight the pes pvp tio2 hf membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h then the weight of the wet membrane was measured after wiping off excess water on the outer membrane surface using filter paper the wet membranes were then dried in an oven for 10 h before they were reweighted as water fully occupies the membrane s pore structure and the lumen area during the wetting the porosity can then be calculated using the eq 1 1 ε w w w d ρ w π r i 2 h f w w w d ρ w π r i 2 h f w d ρ p 100 where ε is the membrane porosity w w is the wet membrane weight g w d is the dry membrane weight g ρ w is the pure water density 1 00 g cm3 r i is the membrane lumen s radius fiber s inner radius h f is the length of the fibers 8 cm and ρ p is the polymer density 1 37 g cm3 the mean pore radius size rm was calculated based of the pure water flux pwf and porosity data obtained previously using the guereout elford ferry equation as shown in eq 2 31 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p where η is the water viscosity 8 9 10 4 pa s l is the membrane thickness m q is the pure water flux m3 s a is the area m2 and δ p is the operating pressure 1 bar 2 5 performance testing 2 5 1 humic acid ha feed solution ha solution was prepared by dispersing 0 05 g of ha in 1 l of deionized water to aid the ha dispersion in water the solution was first sonicated for 1 h the solution was then stirred vigorously before used for membrane testing ha solution is slightly acidic in nature and has reduced solubility in water at this condition 46 size of ha is also inconsistent and can vary with ph 32 hence to prevent the result variation when different volume of stock solution was prepared a fixed ph was used the ph of the prepared solution was adjusted to be slightly basic ph 7 7 by adding 1 m of naoh a relatively high concentration 50 mg l was chosen to test the performance of the membrane in term of antifouling since at that high concentration fouling will be more likely to happen however the concentration selected was still within the range normally selected by other researchers when studying ha removal from water or the influence of ha in wastewater system such as feng et al 33 koparal et al 34 hou et al 35 2 5 2 separation test hf membrane permeation test was carried out using cross flow filtration unit shown schematically in fig 1 with outside in configuration initially the hf membrane sample was compressed using pure water for 20 min at a pressure of 1 5 bar then the pure water flux measurement was performed at a pressure of 1 bar for 1 h the initial pure water flux was calculated using the eq 3 3 j w f v a m t where j w f is the pure water flux kg m2 h v is the permeate volume l a m is the effective filtration area m2 and t is the measurement time h the filtration was then continued by replacing the pure water with the prepared ha solution at a pressure of 1 bar the filtration was performed for 1 h and the concentration of the permeate was measured at the end of the experiment using uv vis spectrophotometer uv vis cary 60 at 254 nm with 10 mm quartz cuvette the flux was then calculated using eq 3 to evaluate the fouling resistance of mm hf membrane relative flux reduction rfr was calculated using eq 4 4 r f r 1 j t s j w f 100 where j t s is the tested solution ha solution permeate flux kg m2 h and j w f is the initial water flux kg m2 h after that the membrane was washed using distilled water for 15 min then the testing was continued by charging in pure water in the feed tank the pure water flux measurement was performed again at a pressure of 1 bar for 1 h the second pure water flux was evaluated using eq 3 this was intended to evaluate the flux recovery ratio frr of the membrane using eq 5 5 f r r j w f 2 j w f 100 where j w f 2 is the second pure water flux or pure water flux after the washing step kg m2 h 2 5 3 membrane fouling resistance analysis since fouling is normally categorised based on various form of resistance during filtration hence the fouling resistance can be calculated using the darcy s law as shown in eq 6 6 j w f t m p μ r t where t m p is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the permeate viscosity pa s and r t is the total resistance of the membrane cm 1 which is defined as in eq 7 7 r t r m r f r m r r r i r where r m is the membrane intrinsic resistance and r f is resistance caused by fouling which can be further divided into reversible r r and irreversible r i r fouling resistance under no fouling condition e g pure water permeation of new membrane only membrane s intrinsic resistance will be present hence eq 6 can be rewritten and reorganized as eq 8 8 r m t m p μ j w f in actual condition the term r f would consist of both the fouling and concentration polarisation effect in the current case these two effects will be combined due to the difficulty to differentiate them if a fouled membrane that undergo cleaning would retain its irreversible fouling a second pure water flux would hence suggest the addition of r i r on top of r m for the membrane the concept is summarised in the eqs 9 11 9 r f t m p μ j t s r m 10 r i r t m p μ j w f 2 r m 11 r r r f r i r 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface functional groups ftir spectroscopy studies were carried out to characterize the membrane s surface functional groups besides the neat and mixed matrix membrane samples ftir analysis has also been done on raw pes pvp and tio2 to identify the functional groups found on the membrane is attributed to which materials fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of all the analysed material the stretching of ftir band between 3135 3687 cm 1 corresponds to the oh stretching peak in which this peak can be found on raw tio2 and pes pvp tio2 blended membrane but absent in raw pes 36 the stretching of this band can be seen more clearly in fig 3 the presence of oh group on tio2 has also been noted by other researcher 37 which may covered the nanoparticle surfaces during the synthesis period this indirectly indicate that raw tio2 has been blended into the membrane although further characterization should be made to justify this according to teow et al 11 the presence of oh group can improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane and aid in improving anti fouling properties of the membrane on the other hand the presence of another stretching at 1662 89 cm 1 in raw pvp pes pvp blended membrane and pes pvp tio2 blended membrane can also be found which corresponds to the carbonyl group of pvp 38 the appearance of this stretching in the membrane suggested the entrapment of pvp in the membrane structure this is contrary to the literature where pvp is to be leached out from the dope solution during the phase inversion process 47 it is possible that higher compatibility of pes and pvp caused some interactions that further retains pvp from fully leaching out moreover oh group is also present in the pvp ftir band hence it can be justified that the blending of pvp would also aid in improving the hydrophilicity of the membrane 3 2 morphology and dope viscosity sem analysis was used to characterize the cross section and surface morphology of all hf membranes as presented in fig 5 generally two distinctive layers were found on the cross sectional morphology of all membranes regardless of the presence of tio2 the inner layer which is made up of small finger like structure and the outer layers that made up of long finger like structure the structure is displayed and explained in fig 4 the presence of two distinctive layers are due to the phase inversion that occurred from both outside due to coagulation bath and inside due to bore fluid of the membrane for multilayer hf membrane the outer layer will be responsible for the separation process in which the presence of nanoparticle in this layer is said to be able to enhance the separation performance meanwhile the inner layer act as the barrier for mass transfer in which a thin inner layer is desired to minimize the mass transfer resistance 38 based on fig 5 with increasing tio2 loading the outer layer thickness of the hf membrane increased with little effect on the inner layer this is tightly related to the viscosity of the dope solution the thickness of the outer and inner layer of the hf membrane together with their dope solution viscosity is presented in table 3 high viscosity dope solution slows down the exchange rate between the solvent and the coagulant and hence increases the gelation time and delays the demixing of the dope solution this expected to lead to thicker membrane 40 this can be confirmed with the increasing outer layer thickness from s1 to s4 as the viscosity of the dope solution increased nevertheless different trend was observed for inner layer thickness due to rapid phase exchange and the thermodynamic instability of the dope as the inner layer was extruded out from the spinneret simultaneously with water bore fluid it did not experience any dry phase solvent evaporation hence rapid phase inversion happened in the inner layer moreover with the addition of high concentration tio2 the dope viscosity and thermodynamic instability increased significantly through these factors enhanced phase separation caused by the aforementioned effect could happen accordingly 39 besides from the morphological observations it is also interesting to note on the presence of white dots on the membrane surface as well as on the cross section micrograph for tio2 containing samples the presence of these white dots could be corresponded to the entrapped tio2 nanoparticles on the other hand the quantity and size of the white dots were noted to be increased as the tio2 loading increased it is expected that the size increment is due to the agglomeration of tio2 the agglomeration of tio2 was further emphasized in the sem image by the red circle as in fig 5 to further support this claim image analysis has been conducted on the surface sem images though imagej software by setting the band pass filter and statistically determine the dispersion of the white dots on the membrane surfaces only dots larger than 1 μm2 was considered to avoid errors from the image s background the analysis is represented in table 4 from this analysis the average size of the white dots presumably tio2 and its standard deviations were increasing with tio2 content suggesting a broader distribution of particle sizes supporting our previous claim on agglomeration nevertheless it is interesting to note that s4 sample exhibit smaller particle size with the lowest standard deviation one hypothesis would be due to the increased agglomeration of tio2 which sediment the large particles during the fiber spinning due to the vertical fabrication methodology for hollow fiber membrane as compared to its flat sheet counterpart hence smaller average particle size and distribution was registered despite of this analysis it is impossible to verify that the white dot corresponds to the tio2 which has been embedded into the membrane just from the sem image hence edx analysis was conducted to verify this claim 3 3 surface elemental analysis edx analysis was used to confirm the presence of chemical elements on the membrane surface edx analysis was done on the outer surface of the hf membrane since the element present on the surface will affect the permeation performance of the hf membrane the result of the analysis is shown in table 5 as tio2 loading in the dope solution increased the ti element weight percent detected on the membrane surface were noted to increase too confirming its retention in the membrane matrix however the amount of ti was noted to increase in an unsteady rate suggesting some agglomeration or nanoparticle leaching occurred during the fabrication process on the other hand bulk majority of the elemental analysis wt can be noted which corresponds for c and o which could originate from the pes or pvp 3 4 contact angle porosity and mean pore radius contact angle was used to determine the hydrophilicity of the hf membrane outer surface since outside in filtration was carried out the results are presented in table 6 hydrophilicity of the membrane increased with the decrease of water contact angle the reduction in contact angle is not proportional with the tio2 loading but all the mm hf membranes have a lower contact angle compared to neat hf membrane this proven that all the mm membrane samples are more hydrophilic compared to the neat pes membrane thanks to the incorporation of tio2 reduction of water contact angle by tio2 incorporation can be explained through two possibilites increase in surface roughness due to tio2 incorporation and intrinsic hydrophilicity of tio2 nanoparticles for the first possibility roughness would induce lower apparent contact angle on material with contact angle lower than 90 while inducing higher apparent contact angle on material with contact angle higher than 90 in this work the contact angle for neat pes sample was found to be 72 9 0 1 suggesting that surface roughness would cause the membrane to exhibit hydrophilic improvements nevertheless it has also been pointed out that the theory s practicality breaks down on material with intrinsic contact angle higher than 65 due to the high roughness needed for any effect to take place 41 as all the samples exhibit contact angle higher than the limit the influence of roughness in improving hydrophilicity might be minimal in this case on the other hand the hydrophilicity of the membrane is suggested to be improved as tio2 itself is hydrophilic in nature 42 the hydroxyl group present on tio2 as detected by ftir is expected to aid the interactions by increasing the water droplet s contact with the membrane surface containing nanoparticles 43 hence the incorporation of it into the membrane matrix will eventually produce composite which has greater hydrophilicity than the neat samples the porosity and the mean pore radius calculated by eqs 1 and 2 is also presented in table 6 the porosity results presented in the table agrees with the observation that was obtained from the sem image in fig 5 where the porosity of the fabricated membranes varies slightly with the addition of tio2 with minimum and maximum differences between 2 41 and 11 15 for s3 and s2 with neat s0 respectively on the other hand the pore size increased with the addition of tio2 at 1 wt equivalent to 29 45 increase from s0 sample but started to decrease at higher tio2 percentage however relative to the neat membrane all the mm samples exhibit larger mean pore sizes compared to the neat sample despite of its decrement with the lowest differences are between s0 and s4 at 10 74 increment both porosity and mean pore radius are defined during the phase inversion period which were influenced by the thermodynamics and viscosities of the dope solution 44 45 differences in tio2 incorporation percentage can influence both factors as noted in table 3 and in literature 44 it is unclear which factors contribute the most in this case due to the complex interactions between the mixture and coagulant from both the outer and inner surfaces however it is expected that kinetic resistance by increased viscosities may have a greater influence overall on the porosity and mean pore radius value during phase inversion due to lower porosity of mm membrane samples compared to neat s0 sample nevertheless more in depth studies need to be done before definite conclusion can be made 3 5 filtration performance the ha permeate flux j h a and ha rejection har were used to evaluate the membrane performance the evaluated results are shown in table 7 the filtration experiment was performed using outside in cross flow filtration configuration with transmembrane pressure tmp of 1 bar generally the neat membrane would have a much lower permeate flux compared to mm membrane this is due to the enhanced membrane hydrophilicity with blending of tio2 in the mixed matrix membrane based on the results all mm samples exhibit higher fluxes compared to the neat membrane just as predicted however as the tio2 loading in the membrane increased from s2 to s4 the ha permeate flux reduced even though the membrane hydrophilicity is proven to be increased it can be concluded that at higher tio2 loading agglomeration of tio2 on the membrane pore started to occur and eventually plugged the pore partially this makes it harder for the passage of water through the membrane pore however it can be observed that there is a trade off between the selectivity and flux of the membrane in which membrane with higher flux resulted in lower har out of the 5 fabricated membranes s1 has the highest j h a even though its har is lower compared to other mm hf membranes the high permeate flux may be attributed to the well distribution of tio2 particles at low concentration the nanoparticle blended to the membrane distributed itself well in the membrane matrix with minimal agglomeration as previously noted in table 4 well distribution of the particles enhanced the membrane surface hydrophilicity evenly on the surface and hence improved its water and permeate flux without blocking the pores as discussed earlier 3 6 membrane fouling evaluation membrane fouling evaluation was done to evaluate the antifouling properties of the membrane two parameters used for the evaluation are flux recovery ratio frr and relative flux reduction rfr the calculated result is tabulated in table 8 frr compared the pure water flux before and after the membrane fouling while rfr describes how severe the membrane has been fouled by the foulant via comparing the permeate flux and initial pure water flux as frr increased and rfr decreased it means that the membrane fouling was less severe hence a membrane with greater anti fouling properties will have a lower rfr value and higher frr value based on table 8 all tio2 incorporated mm membranes have high frr compared to neat pes membrane meanwhile rfr was lower for all mm hf membranes even though its variation is negligible at higher tio2 loadings based on these data it can be concluded that mm hf membranes have greater anti fouling properties this is highly related to the membrane hydrophilicity in which higher hydrophilicity membrane surface induced the formation of hydrophilic water layer this creates a protective layer that repels the ha from attaching to the membrane surface and foul the membrane as the incorporation of tio2 increases higher hydrophilicity was registered for the membrane samples which minimize its fouling tendencies to have an in depth overview on the membrane fouling phenomena various type of resistances including the intrinsic membrane resistance rm fouling resistance rf reversible resistance rr and irreversible resistance rir for the membrane samples were evaluated using eqs 8 11 the results are presented in fig 6 for better clarity rf rr and rir were also presented in fig 7 based on these figures rm was shown to be reduced with blending of tio2 especially at low concentration the hydrophilicity of tio2 facilitates the water flow across the membranes hence minimizing the membrane s intrinsic resistance on the other hand rf and its component resistance rr and rir was noted to be relatively low compared to rm this is expected relative to the shorter permeation time tested in this experiment which maintain most of the resistance on the membrane rather than the fouling nevertheless the fouling resistance registered is enough to give an insight on the antifouling performance of the samples before long term testing to be conducted rir which is due to irreversible fouling by ha deposition was noted to be reduced as the tio2 loading increased similar trend can also be observed on rr interestingly however the reversible fouling resistance was noted to become the dominant fouling component at and above the 2 wt tio2 content while the overall fouling resistance maintained at a relatively similar level this is important as it is expected that the reversible fouling will be able to be removed easily through proper process parameter and occasional cleaning making them attractive with longer operating lifetime nevertheless it is also important to note that once the ha formed a reversible cake on the surface of mm hf membrane it will be adsorbed easily onto the membrane and contribute to the irreversible fouling resistance hence these values may change upon longer permeation test time notwithstanding this possible drawback lower overall foulant resistance rf which was noted to be the lowest for membrane s2 will be an added advantage due to its lower tendency of fouling this improved antifouling properties can be justified by the improved hydrophilicity of the membrane which prevented the ha to be deposited onto the membrane surface as supported by the previous results it is suggested that this membrane sample has a well distributed tio2 on the surface with minimal agglomeration effect and improved surface hydrophilicity well distributed and dispersed tio2 can enhance the overall membrane surface hydrophilicity evenly and equally thus reduce the fouling of ha this is also supported by the slight increase in the overall fouling resistance at higher tio2 content which may caused by the tio2 agglomeration by justifying the antifouling properties based on membrane fouling resistance of the membrane s2 sample with 2 wt of tio2 would be the optimum mm hf membrane with the best anti fouling properties 4 conclusion in this study tio2 have been blended with pes pvp to further improve the membrane s antifouling properties the modified membrane has shown better separation performance towards ha with separation up to 98 46 0 23 for sample s3 while also improving the permeate flux as high as 25 104 2 364 kg m2 h for sample s1 on the other hand sample s2 exhibit the lowest fouling resistance among the samples based on these analyses the presence of 2 wt of tio2 s2 membrane has been chosen as the optimum pes based hf membrane with the lowest fouling resistance high permeate flux at 23 851 2 412 kg m2 h and high ha rejection at 97 89 0 07 acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support by fundamental research grant

14323,the aim of this study is to analyse the fouling behaviour of polyethersulfone pes polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp titanium oxide tio2 mixed matrix mm hollow fiber hf membrane with varying tio2 loadings for humic acid ha treatment the mm hf membrane was fabricated using dry jet wet phase inversion method by blending varying amount of tio2 nanoparticles 1 2 3 and 4 wt into the pes dope solution the fabricated hf membrane was characterised in terms of their surface and cross section morphology contact angle pore size and porosity these characteristics can highly affect the membrane antifouling behaviour as well as membrane flux the membrane was tested using 50 mg l of ha solution adjusted to ph 7 7 all mm hf membranes suggested better antifouling with s2 sample at 2 wt tio2 having optimal antifouling and flux performance with the lowest value for resistance by fouling and less than 5 difference from the best permeate flux and rejection values under this formulation ha permeation test has registered an improved membrane flux at 23 851 kg m2 h and ha rejection of 97 89 an improvement of 28 9 and 3 8 respectively as compared to the neat pes membrane ha rejection increased drastically due to higher surface hydrophilicity of tio2 blended membranes which repels the hydrophobic ha and prevented the adsorption of ha onto the membrane surface this also minimize the formation of reversible and irreversible fouling by ha which increases its antifouling abilities keywords antifouling polyethersulfone titanium oxide mixed matrix membrane humic acid 1 introduction humic acid ha is one of the major components of humic substances which can be found abundantly in soil humus peat upland streams dystrophic lakes and ocean water 1 the presence of ha in soil is essential for plant growth through accelerating respiration affecting photosynthesis increasing water nutrient uptake and increasing plant yield 2 however present of ha in water stream can be harmful to human being as it will promote adsorption and migration transformation of metal ion some organic inorganic pollution in water via complexation through the formation of ha metal complexes 3 the situation will become worse if ha enters a water treatment plant as ha is a precursor for the formation of disinfection by product through the reaction with chlorine and has been associated with some endemic diseases 4 hence removal of ha prior to chlorination process in wastewater treatment plant is important to eliminate the carcinogenesis potential in accordance to this various ha removal methodologies have been investigated which includes coagulation 5 electrocoagulation 6 electromagnetic treatment 7 adsorption 8 9 and oxidation process 10 however these methods are prone to electrode fouling high operating cost high maintenance cost and high energy requirement 11 looking at this situation a relatively simple advance and cost effective method utilizing membrane technology has appeared as a better approach for ha removal polymeric membranes are normally composed of hydrophobic polymer such as polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf and polysulfone psf out of these polymers pes has been chosen by most of the researchers due to its excellent chemical mechanical and thermal strength besides pes also exhibit good performance in term of environmental endurance and easy to be processed 12 pes environmental endurance particularly allows it to withstand process at varying ph condition or those that may require harsh chemical cleaning the unpredictable nature of wastewater treatment feed and the need for periodical cleaning maintenance makes pes based membrane a good choice for this purpose despite of the various advantages of pes excellent and consistent ha removal by using pristine pes membrane cannot be achieved due to its hydrophobic nature 13 14 this makes it prone to fouling due to the hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic organic solute such as ha and the membrane s material 15 the interaction causes ha to easily adsorb on the membrane s surface declining the flux across the membrane with time and hinders the stability of the membrane s performance 16 18 one of the best ways to mitigate the fouling problem of pes membrane is by increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane improvement to the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces will pave the way for easier adsorption of water molecule to the surface this will hence form a thin layer of water between the membrane surface and the organic molecules foulants such as ha particles minimizing foulant attachment moreover as majority of foulants such as ha and oil are hydrophobic in nature a more hydrophilic surface will repel these hydrophobic foulants instead of adsorbing them 19 to date various physical and chemical modifications have been employed to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface one of the most promising one is by blending the polymers with nanoparticles prior to membrane fabrication over the past 10 years blending has attracted a lot of interest due to their relatively convenient operation and the need for mild preparation condition 20 coined as mixed matrix mm membrane extensive studies have been conducted by various researchers to improve membrane s hydrophilicity through this method some of the most studied nanoparticles that has been used to modify pes membrane includes titanium oxide tio2 21 23 zinc oxide zno 14 24 silica sio2 25 26 and zirconium dioxide zro2 27 out of these nanoparticles tio2 is one of the main contenders for membrane nano additive due to its stability high hydrophilicity antibacterial properties availability low toxicity and cost effectiveness 28 29 additionally it has also been proven that the preparation method of pes tio2 membrane assembles the nanoparticles near to the pores 21 this would further help in repelling the hydrophobic foulants from passing through the membrane reducing the chance for ha to approach the membrane surface minimize pore blocking and attributing to the sustainable antifouling property of the membrane so far most of the tio2 blended mm membranes studied as mentioned before are fabricated in flat sheet configuration which has rather limited real world application hollow fiber hf one of the alternative dimensional configuration for polymeric membrane has been so far the favourite with more demand for industrial application as proven by the availability of supplier for hf membrane as compared to flat sheet 30 therefore in this work the fouling evaluation of pes pvp tio2 mm hf membrane with various tio2 loadings will be conducted this work would hence give a clear indication on the applicability of tio2 mm hf membrane for real ultrafiltration application as well as the fouling resistance of the membranes towards ha 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyethersulfone pes ultrason e6020 p with mw 58 000 g mol was purchased from basf polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 10 000 g mol tio2 nanoparticles 21 nm n n dimethylacetamide dmac and humic acid ha were supplied by sigma aldrich usa prior to usage pes flakes and tio2 nanoparticles were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 70 c deionized water was used for permeation test and ha solution preparation while distilled water was used for membrane washing cycle filtered tap water was used during membrane spinning and phase inversion process 2 2 membrane preparation in this study hf membranes were fabricated via non solvent induced phase separation nips dope solution was firstly prepared by blending the pes pvp and tio2 nanoparticles 300 g of the dope solution was made by dispersing various amount of tio2 nanoparticles 0 1 2 3 and 4 wt in the dmac solvent the solution was then mechanically stirred at 600 rpm for 3 h at room temperature then the mixture was sonicated for 15 min followed by stirring for another 3 min at 600 rpm to disperse the nanoparticle added to the dope solution subsequently 4 wt of pvp a pore forming agent and hydrophilic polymer was added and stirring was continued for another 3 h at 60 c finally the predetermined amount of dried pes polymer was added over a period of 2 h the dope solution was kept stirred with speed of 500 rpm at temperature of 60 c for 24 h the composition of the dope solution was shown in table 1 to remove bubbles in the solution the dope solution was degassed for 1 h by placing the solution in an ultrasonic bath next pes pvp tio2 mm hf membranes were fabricated via dry jet wet phase inversion the degassed dope solution was filled into the polymer tank then the dope solution and bore fluid were extruded through the spinneret at a fixed speed of 15 278 cm s with an air gap of 15 cm before entering the coagulation bath filtered tap water the hf membrane was spun using distilled water as the bore fluid to flow the dope solution purified nitrogen at 1 5 bar was applied from the nitrogen cylinder into the polymer tank details of the spinning condition is shown in table 2 spinning conditions were similar for all the dope solutions the produced hf membranes were then kept in water for 4 days the water will be changed daily to remove any residual solvent next the hf membranes were immersed in 50 glycerol water mixture for 24 h at room temperature and then dried for 5 days the fabricated membranes need to be immersed in glycerol solution to preserve the membrane structure prior to permeation test and to avoid membrane pore collapse 2 3 hollow fiber module preparation six fibers were cut 53 cm in length and potted together in the module holder using epoxy resin after a complete curing of the resin the prepared samples were immersed in ethanol for 1 h followed by distilled water for 1 days noted that the effective length per membrane fiber is 47 cm while the effective area varies with outer diameter of the hf membranes 2 4 membrane characterization 2 4 1

sectional morphology the membranes were cracked using liquid nitrogen prior to characterization 2 4 3 elemental mapping energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was utilised to analyse the elemental properties of the hf membrane edx analysis was performed using field emission sem fesem equipped with an edx spectroscopy edax inc usa under 5000 magnification 2 4 4 water contact angle ca measurements the surface hydrophilicity of membrane was characterized using the contact angle goniometer model oca15plus dataphysics hf membrane was mounted horizontally on the glass slide by using double sided tape and pressed using another piece of glass slide to flatten it a water droplet 0 2 μl was dropped onto each membrane surface through a needle tip attached to the goniometer a magnified image of water droplet was observed by a digital camera and the ca readings were obtained after 10 s of water drop 2 4 5 rheological properties of membrane dope solution the rheological properties of different dope solution were determined by measuring their individual viscosity the viscosity of the dope solution with various tio2 loading was measured using brookfield digital rheometer model dv iii usa at temperature of 25 2 c and shear rate of 10 s 1 the average viscosities of five samples were reported 2 4 6 porosity and pore size the porosity of the hf membrane was determined through its dry wet weight the pes pvp tio2 hf membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h then the weight of the wet membrane was measured after wiping off excess water on the outer membrane surface using filter paper the wet membranes were then dried in an oven for 10 h before they were reweighted as water fully occupies the membrane s pore structure and the lumen area during the wetting the porosity can then be calculated using the eq 1 1 ε w w w d ρ w π r i 2 h f w w w d ρ w π r i 2 h f w d ρ p 100 where ε is the membrane porosity w w is the wet membrane weight g w d is the dry membrane weight g ρ w is the pure water density 1 00 g cm3 r i is the membrane lumen s radius fiber s inner radius h f is the length of the fibers 8 cm and ρ p is the polymer density 1 37 g cm3 the mean pore radius size rm was calculated based of the pure water flux pwf and porosity data obtained previously using the guereout elford ferry equation as shown in eq 2 31 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p where η is the water viscosity 8 9 10 4 pa s l is the membrane thickness m q is the pure water flux m3 s a is the area m2 and δ p is the operating pressure 1 bar 2 5 performance testing 2 5 1 humic acid ha feed solution ha solution was prepared by dispersing 0 05 g of ha in 1 l of deionized water to aid the ha dispersion in water the solution was first sonicated for 1 h the solution was then stirred vigorously before used for membrane testing ha solution is slightly acidic in nature and has reduced solubility in water at this condition 46 size of ha is also inconsistent and can vary with ph 32 hence to prevent the result variation when different volume of stock solution was prepared a fixed ph was used the ph of the prepared solution was adjusted to be slightly basic ph 7 7 by adding 1 m of naoh a relatively high concentration 50 mg l was chosen to test the performance of the membrane in term of antifouling since at that high concentration fouling will be more likely to happen however the concentration selected was still within the range normally selected by other researchers when studying ha removal from water or the influence of ha in wastewater system such as feng et al 33 koparal et al 34 hou et al 35 2 5 2 separation test hf membrane permeation test was carried out using cross flow filtration unit shown schematically in fig 1 with outside in configuration initially the hf membrane sample was compressed using pure water for 20 min at a pressure of 1 5 bar then the pure water flux measurement was performed at a pressure of 1 bar for 1 h the initial pure water flux was calculated using the eq 3 3 j w f v a m t where j w f is the pure water flux kg m2 h v is the permeate volume l a m is the effective filtration area m2 and t is the measurement time h the filtration was then continued by replacing the pure water with the prepared ha solution at a pressure of 1 bar the filtration was performed for 1 h and the concentration of the permeate was measured at the end of the experiment using uv vis spectrophotometer uv vis cary 60 at 254 nm with 10 mm quartz cuvette the flux was then calculated using eq 3 to evaluate the fouling resistance of mm hf membrane relative flux reduction rfr was calculated using eq 4 4 r f r 1 j t s j w f 100 where j t s is the tested solution ha solution permeate flux kg m2 h and j w f is the initial water flux kg m2 h after that the membrane was washed using distilled water for 15 min then the testing was continued by charging in pure water in the feed tank the pure water flux measurement was performed again at a pressure of 1 bar for 1 h the second pure water flux was evaluated using eq 3 this was intended to evaluate the flux recovery ratio frr of the membrane using eq 5 5 f r r j w f 2 j w f 100 where j w f 2 is the second pure water flux or pure water flux after the washing step kg m2 h 2 5 3 membrane fouling resistance analysis since fouling is normally categorised based on various form of resistance during filtration hence the fouling resistance can be calculated using the darcy s law as shown in eq 6 6 j w f t m p μ r t where t m p is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the permeate viscosity pa s and r t is the total resistance of the membrane cm 1 which is defined as in eq 7 7 r t r m r f r m r r r i r where r m is the membrane intrinsic resistance and r f is resistance caused by fouling which can be further divided into reversible r r and irreversible r i r fouling resistance under no fouling condition e g pure water permeation of new membrane only membrane s intrinsic resistance will be present hence eq 6 can be rewritten and reorganized as eq 8 8 r m t m p μ j w f in actual condition the term r f would consist of both the fouling and concentration polarisation effect in the current case these two effects will be combined due to the difficulty to differentiate them if a fouled membrane that undergo cleaning would retain its irreversible fouling a second pure water flux would hence suggest the addition of r i r on top of r m for the membrane the concept is summarised in the eqs 9 11 9 r f t m p μ j t s r m 10 r i r t m p μ j w f 2 r m 11 r r r f r i r 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface functional groups ftir spectroscopy studies were carried out to characterize the membrane s surface functional groups besides the neat and mixed matrix membrane samples ftir analysis has also been done on raw pes pvp and tio2 to identify the functional groups found on the membrane is attributed to which materials fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of all the analysed material the stretching of ftir band between 3135 3687 cm 1 corresponds to the oh stretching peak in which this peak can be found on raw tio2 and pes pvp tio2 blended membrane but absent in raw pes 36 the stretching of this band can be seen more clearly in fig 3 the presence of oh group on tio2 has also been noted by other researcher 37 which may covered the nanoparticle surfaces during the synthesis period this indirectly indicate that raw tio2 has been blended into the membrane although further characterization should be made to justify this according to teow et al 11 the presence of oh group can improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane and aid in improving anti fouling properties of the membrane on the other hand the presence of another stretching at 1662 89 cm 1 in raw pvp pes pvp blended membrane and pes pvp tio2 blended membrane can also be found which corresponds to the carbonyl group of pvp 38 the appearance of this stretching in the membrane suggested the entrapment of pvp in the membrane structure this is contrary to the literature where pvp is to be leached out from the dope solution during the phase inversion process 47 it is possible that higher compatibility of pes and pvp caused some interactions that further retains pvp from fully leaching out moreover oh group is also present in the pvp ftir band hence it can be justified that the blending of pvp would also aid in improving the hydrophilicity of the membrane 3 2 morphology and dope viscosity sem analysis was used to characterize the cross section and surface morphology of all hf membranes as presented in fig 5 generally two distinctive layers were found on the cross sectional morphology of all membranes regardless of the presence of tio2 the inner layer which is made up of small finger like structure and the outer layers that made up of long finger like structure the structure is displayed and explained in fig 4 the presence of two distinctive layers are due to the phase inversion that occurred from both outside due to coagulation bath and inside due to bore fluid of the membrane for multilayer hf membrane the outer layer will be responsible for the separation process in which the presence of nanoparticle in this layer is said to be able to enhance the separation performance meanwhile the inner layer act as the barrier for mass transfer in which a thin inner layer is desired to minimize the mass transfer resistance 38 based on fig 5 with increasing tio2 loading the outer layer thickness of the hf membrane increased with little effect on the inner layer this is tightly related to the viscosity of the dope solution the thickness of the outer and inner layer of the hf membrane together with their dope solution viscosity is presented in table 3 high viscosity dope solution slows down the exchange rate between the solvent and the coagulant and hence increases the gelation time and delays the demixing of the dope solution this expected to lead to thicker membrane 40 this can be confirmed with the increasing outer layer thickness from s1 to s4 as the viscosity of the dope solution increased nevertheless different trend was observed for inner layer thickness due to rapid phase exchange and the thermodynamic instability of the dope as the inner layer was extruded out from the spinneret simultaneously with water bore fluid it did not experience any dry phase solvent evaporation hence rapid phase inversion happened in the inner layer moreover with the addition of high concentration tio2 the dope viscosity and thermodynamic instability increased significantly through these factors enhanced phase separation caused by the aforementioned effect could happen accordingly 39 besides from the morphological observations it is also interesting to note on the presence of white dots on the membrane surface as well as on the cross section micrograph for tio2 containing samples the presence of these white dots could be corresponded to the entrapped tio2 nanoparticles on the other hand the quantity and size of the white dots were noted to be increased as the tio2 loading increased it is expected that the size increment is due to the agglomeration of tio2 the agglomeration of tio2 was further emphasized in the sem image by the red circle as in fig 5 to further support this claim image analysis has been conducted on the surface sem images though imagej software by setting the band pass filter and statistically determine the dispersion of the white dots on the membrane surfaces only dots larger than 1 μm2 was considered to avoid errors from the image s background the analysis is represented in table 4 from this analysis the average size of the white dots presumably tio2 and its standard deviations were increasing with tio2 content suggesting a broader distribution of particle sizes supporting our previous claim on agglomeration nevertheless it is interesting to note that s4 sample exhibit smaller particle size with the lowest standard deviation one hypothesis would be due to the increased agglomeration of tio2 which sediment the large particles during the fiber spinning due to the vertical fabrication methodology for hollow fiber membrane as compared to its flat sheet counterpart hence smaller average particle size and distribution was registered despite of this analysis it is impossible to verify that the white dot corresponds to the tio2 which has been embedded into the membrane just from the sem image hence edx analysis was conducted to verify this claim 3 3 surface elemental analysis edx analysis was used to confirm the presence of chemical elements on the membrane surface edx analysis was done on the outer surface of the hf membrane since the element present on the surface will affect the permeation performance of the hf membrane the result of the analysis is shown in table 5 as tio2 loading in the dope solution increased the ti element weight percent detected on the membrane surface were noted to increase too confirming its retention in the membrane matrix however the amount of ti was noted to increase in an unsteady rate suggesting some agglomeration or nanoparticle leaching occurred during the fabrication process on the other hand bulk majority of the elemental analysis wt can be noted which corresponds for c and o which could originate from the pes or pvp 3 4 contact angle porosity and mean pore radius contact angle was used to determine the hydrophilicity of the hf membrane outer surface since outside in filtration was carried out the results are presented in table 6 hydrophilicity of the membrane increased with the decrease of water contact angle the reduction in contact angle is not proportional with the tio2 loading but all the mm hf membranes have a lower contact angle compared to neat hf membrane this proven that all the mm membrane samples are more hydrophilic compared to the neat pes membrane thanks to the incorporation of tio2 reduction of water contact angle by tio2 incorporation can be explained through two possibilites increase in surface roughness due to tio2 incorporation and intrinsic hydrophilicity of tio2 nanoparticles for the first possibility roughness would induce lower apparent contact angle on material with contact angle lower than 90 while inducing higher apparent contact angle on material with contact angle higher than 90 in this work the contact angle for neat pes sample was found to be 72 9 0 1 suggesting that surface roughness would cause the membrane to exhibit hydrophilic improvements nevertheless it has also been pointed out that the theory s practicality breaks down on material with intrinsic contact angle higher than 65 due to the high roughness needed for any effect to take place 41 as all the samples exhibit contact angle higher than the limit the influence of roughness in improving hydrophilicity might be minimal in this case on the other hand the hydrophilicity of the membrane is suggested to be improved as tio2 itself is hydrophilic in nature 42 the hydroxyl group present on tio2 as detected by ftir is expected to aid the interactions by increasing the water droplet s contact with the membrane surface containing nanoparticles 43 hence the incorporation of it into the membrane matrix will eventually produce composite which has greater hydrophilicity than the neat samples the porosity and the mean pore radius calculated by eqs 1 and 2 is also presented in table 6 the porosity results presented in the table agrees with the observation that was obtained from the sem image in fig 5 where the porosity of the fabricated membranes varies slightly with the addition of tio2 with minimum and maximum differences between 2 41 and 11 15 for s3 and s2 with neat s0 respectively on the other hand the pore size increased with the addition of tio2 at 1 wt equivalent to 29 45 increase from s0 sample but started to decrease at higher tio2 percentage however relative to the neat membrane all the mm samples exhibit larger mean pore sizes compared to the neat sample despite of its decrement with the lowest differences are between s0 and s4 at 10 74 increment both porosity and mean pore radius are defined during the phase inversion period which were influenced by the thermodynamics and viscosities of the dope solution 44 45 differences in tio2 incorporation percentage can influence both factors as noted in table 3 and in literature 44 it is unclear which factors contribute the most in this case due to the complex interactions between the mixture and coagulant from both the outer and inner surfaces however it is expected that kinetic resistance by increased viscosities may have a greater influence overall on the porosity and mean pore radius value during phase inversion due to lower porosity of mm membrane samples compared to neat s0 sample nevertheless more in depth studies need to be done before definite conclusion can be made 3 5 filtration performance the ha permeate flux j h a and ha rejection har were used to evaluate the membrane performance the evaluated results are shown in table 7 the filtration experiment was performed using outside in cross flow filtration configuration with transmembrane pressure tmp of 1 bar generally the neat membrane would have a much lower permeate flux compared to mm membrane this is due to the enhanced membrane hydrophilicity with blending of tio2 in the mixed matrix membrane based on the results all mm samples exhibit higher fluxes compared to the neat membrane just as predicted however as the tio2 loading in the membrane increased from s2 to s4 the ha permeate flux reduced even though the membrane hydrophilicity is proven to be increased it can be concluded that at higher tio2 loading agglomeration of tio2 on the membrane pore started to occur and eventually plugged the pore partially this makes it harder for the passage of water through the membrane pore however it can be observed that there is a trade off between the selectivity and flux of the membrane in which membrane with higher flux resulted in lower har out of the 5 fabricated membranes s1 has the highest j h a even though its har is lower compared to other mm hf membranes the high permeate flux may be attributed to the well distribution of tio2 particles at low concentration the nanoparticle blended to the membrane distributed itself well in the membrane matrix with minimal agglomeration as previously noted in table 4 well distribution of the particles enhanced the membrane surface hydrophilicity evenly on the surface and hence improved its water and permeate flux without blocking the pores as discussed earlier 3 6 membrane fouling evaluation membrane fouling evaluation was done to evaluate the antifouling properties of the membrane two parameters used for the evaluation are flux recovery ratio frr and relative flux reduction rfr the calculated result is tabulated in table 8 frr compared the pure water flux before and after the membrane fouling while rfr describes how severe the membrane has been fouled by the foulant via comparing the permeate flux and initial pure water flux as frr increased and rfr decreased it means that the membrane fouling was less severe hence a membrane with greater anti fouling properties will have a lower rfr value and higher frr value based on table 8 all tio2 incorporated mm membranes have high frr compared to neat pes membrane meanwhile rfr was lower for all mm hf membranes even though its variation is negligible at higher tio2 loadings based on these data it can be concluded that mm hf membranes have greater anti fouling properties this is highly related to the membrane hydrophilicity in which higher hydrophilicity membrane surface induced the formation of hydrophilic water layer this creates a protective layer that repels the ha from attaching to the membrane surface and foul the membrane as the incorporation of tio2 increases higher hydrophilicity was registered for the membrane samples which minimize its fouling tendencies to have an in depth overview on the membrane fouling phenomena various type of resistances including the intrinsic membrane resistance rm fouling resistance rf reversible resistance rr and irreversible resistance rir for the membrane samples were evaluated using eqs 8 11 the results are presented in fig 6 for better clarity rf rr and rir were also presented in fig 7 based on these figures rm was shown to be reduced with blending of tio2 especially at low concentration the hydrophilicity of tio2 facilitates the water flow across the membranes hence minimizing the membrane s intrinsic resistance on the other hand rf and its component resistance rr and rir was noted to be relatively low compared to rm this is expected relative to the shorter permeation time tested in this experiment which maintain most of the resistance on the membrane rather than the fouling nevertheless the fouling resistance registered is enough to give an insight on the antifouling performance of the samples before long term testing to be conducted rir which is due to irreversible fouling by ha deposition was noted to be reduced as the tio2 loading increased similar trend can also be observed on rr interestingly however the reversible fouling resistance was noted to become the dominant fouling component at and above the 2 wt tio2 content while the overall fouling resistance maintained at a relatively similar level this is important as it is expected that the reversible fouling will be able to be removed easily through proper process parameter and occasional cleaning making them attractive with longer operating lifetime nevertheless it is also important to note that once the ha formed a reversible cake on the surface of mm hf membrane it will be adsorbed easily onto the membrane and contribute to the irreversible fouling resistance hence these values may change upon longer permeation test time notwithstanding this possible drawback lower overall foulant resistance rf which was noted to be the lowest for membrane s2 will be an added advantage due to its lower tendency of fouling this improved antifouling properties can be justified by the improved hydrophilicity of the membrane which prevented the ha to be deposited onto the membrane surface as supported by the previous results it is suggested that this membrane sample has a well distributed tio2 on the surface with minimal agglomeration effect and improved surface hydrophilicity well distributed and dispersed tio2 can enhance the overall membrane surface hydrophilicity evenly and equally thus reduce the fouling of ha this is also supported by the slight increase in the overall fouling resistance at higher tio2 content which may caused by the tio2 agglomeration by justifying the antifouling properties based on membrane fouling resistance of the membrane s2 sample with 2 wt of tio2 would be the optimum mm hf membrane with the best anti fouling properties 4 conclusion in this study tio2 have been blended with pes pvp to further improve the membrane s antifouling properties the modified membrane has shown better separation performance towards ha with separation up to 98 46 0 23 for sample s3 while also improving the permeate flux as high as 25 104 2 364 kg m2 h for sample s1 on the other hand sample s2 exhibit the lowest fouling resistance among the samples based on these analyses the presence of 2 wt of tio2 s2 membrane has been chosen as the optimum pes based hf membrane with the lowest fouling resistance high permeate flux at 23 851 2 412 kg m2 h and high ha rejection at 97 89 0 07 acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support by fundamental research grant

14324,in this study the physical and chemical characterization of produced water was done followed by treatment through sand filtration coupled with activated carbon microemulsion modified activated carbon techniques the results of characterization showed that the produced water had high chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc values i e 10 496 and 2405 mg l respectively as well as high concentration of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex and various metals after the sand filtration considerable reduction in tss and cod was achieved furthermore btex as volatile organic compounds were also removed by more than 93 except for toluene however sand filtration was not enough to remove most of the metals and ions therefore further treatment was done through activated carbon and modified activated carbon and their treatment efficiency was compared both techniques were able to achieve higher removal efficiencies for btex metals and ions thus the treated water was free from all major pollutants of produced water and can be considered suitable for reuse at industrial or domestic level this study aims to promote the reuse of produced water to reduce reliance on limited clean water resources keywords produced water sand filtration activated carbon microemulsions benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex remediation 1 introduction the extraction of natural gas is on the rise it is expected that it will be one of the main fossil fuel energy resource because of its abundance and clean burning emissions 1 the production of high quantity of wastewater in natural gas industry is one of the main challenges associated with this industry 2 qatar owns total of 14 of the world gas reserves and ranks only third after russia and iran 3 and accordingly produce huge amount of wastewater known as produced water from its gas industries it has been reported that the ratio of produced water to gas is 1 2 in qatar s north offshore field and more than 23 thousand barrels of waste water day was produced in 2014 4 the ph of produced water is generally acidic and the major components include benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylene btex oil and grease organic acids and various ions and metals metals such as cadmium iron chromium molybdenum vanadium selenium zinc and nickel are commonly found in produced water 2 5 the presence of volatile organic compounds and btex in produced water can be proved toxic for environment and health 5 according to al ghouti et al 5 produced water characteristics varies widely depending upon geographical features age and chemical composition of the reservoirs and extraction methods therefore detailed characterization from the source of produced water needs to be studied and cost effective environment friendly treatment techniques should be tested for the particular produced water to evaluate treatment efficiencies and decide reuse options considering the water stress situation and limited water resources of the arid country like qatar 6 it is now dire need to characterize its produced water and test different treatment techniques for the management of produced water one of the common management options for produced water i e its reinjection back to the environment is becoming an environmental concern and not being regarded as suitable measure 7 therefore other management measures including their treatment and reuse needs to be explored the north field of natural gas in qatar is one of the largest sources of produced water generation therefore this study is based on the characterization and treatment of one of the largest produced water streams in qatar to ensure its treatment and reuse to cope with rising clean water demands in the country many different treatment techniques have been utilized for the treatment of produced water such as adsorption using organic inorganic adsorbents 8 biological treatment using activated sludge 9 attached growth processes 10 and membrane distillation filtration 11 however the removal of recalcitrant pollutants from produced water using biological techniques is generally low 12 furthermore membrane fouling and associated cost of the overall technique makes membrane filtration less favorable for produced water treatment therefore adsorption techniques such as using sand filtration and activated carbon was explored for their efficiency of treatment of produced water used in this study hence three types of filtration media were used i e sand activated carbon and modified activated carbon sand filtration is relatively simple and cost effective technique as it uses only sand as media and has been proved to remove many pollutants such as fine solids 13 activated carbon commonly used media in commercial and industrial sectors consists of carbon suitably treated to obtain low volume with high surface area for adsorption 14 due to its unique properties such as higher surface reactivity adsorption capacity microporous structure 15 thermal stability and low acid base reactivity makes it an excellent choice as media in filtration systems 16 activated carbon has been used to remove btex and free hydrocarbons that contributes to total petroleum hydrocarbons tph in produced water effluent 7 activated carbon is sometimes modified to yield modified activated carbon mac to impart desired characteristics for enhanced removal of pollutants mac is produced by treating activated carbon with suitable surfactants for example to give rise to positive negative charge on the activated carbon which results in better removal of anions cations from water thus modified activated carbon with both positive and negative charge was produced using sodium dodecyl sulphate sds as anionic and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab as cationic surfactant for better removal of cadmium from aqueous solution it was found that the modified activated carbon had higher porosity and surface area with both positive and negative charges and proved to have higher removal efficiency 98 of cadmium as compared to its counterparts 17 in this study samples of produced water from gas production process located in qatar north field were collected characterized and treated the research objectives of this study are i to characterize the produced water from north offshore gas field of qatar in terms of physical and chemical parameters and ii treatment of produced water through combination of proposed treatment technologies i e sand filtration and activated carbon or sand filtration and microemulsion modified activated carbon techniques while the mechanisms of adsorption and associated parameters such as breakthrough volume adsorption capacity characterization studies are important for investigation as previously done by the research team 18 19 the main aim of this research was to characterize the selected source of produced water and test cost effective treatment techniques for its treatment and decide reuse option in depth investigations in terms of adsorption capacity kinetics and characterization of adsorbents will be done in the future if the suggested combination of technique meets the international standards in terms of effluent quality 2 methodology 2 1 sampling 2 1 1 produced water sampling produced water samples were collected from north offshore gas field over the time period of 10 days total of 20 liters of sample were collected during each day of water sampling thus at the end of sampling period 200 liters of produced water was collected and mixed together and considered as representative of produced water characteristics from north offshore gas field this collected water sample was used both for characterization and treatment 2 1 2 sand and clay sampling for the purpose of preparation of sand filtration column the sand was collected from sand dunes located in umm saied qatar the clay samples were collected from local farm the sand samples were washed and

leaching of sand or clay to the filtered water containers placed at the bottom the columns were filled with approximately 10 kg of the mixture of sand clay the column was washed twice with deionized water the sand filtration was done at a flow rate of 0 3m3 h the filtered samples were collected for characterization to measure the efficiency of treatment using equation 1 and for further treatment with activated carbon or modified activated carbon 2 3 activated carbon filtration column preparation granular activated carbon was acquired commercially from hobby company and was washed with deionized water and subsequently dried overnight at 110 c in an oven 250 ml glass columns with 7 87 in length and 1 96 in diameter were filled with 100 g of activated carbon glass wool was placed in the bottom to prevent leaching of activated carbon the washing of column was done with deionized water the filtration was done at the rate of 0 3m3 h the filtered water from sand filtration column stage 1 was used as feed water for activated carbon filtration the deionized water was used as a control the filtered water from this stage was collected for characterization and estimating the efficiency of treatment using eq 1 1 r e m o v a l c f c o c o where cf denotes the concentration of pollutants in filtered water and co represents its concentration in the feed water 2 4 modified activated carbon filtration column preparation the commercially acquired granular activated carbon was first washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 110 c in an oven the activated carbon was modified through preparing microemulsions using procedure adopted from nadeem et al 17 briefly surfactant triton x 100 non ionic iso octylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol was placed in an orbital shaker fisher scientific at 160 rpm 80 0 5 c for the period of 6 h followed by placing it at room temperature 100 g of granular activated carbon was ﬁltered by whattman filter and dried in an oven overnight at 110 c 17 similar to procedure mentioned in section 3 4 glass columns of 250 ml capacity with length and diameter of 7 87 and 1 96 in respectively were filled with 100 g of modified activated carbon glass wools were kept at the bottom to prevent leaching the columns were washed with deionized water the filtration was done at the rate of 0 3m3 h the filtered water from sand filtration column stage 1 was used as feed water for modified activated carbon filtration the deionized water was used as a control the filtered water from this stage was collected for characterization and estimating the efficiency of treatment using eq 1 the treatment stages are depicted in fig 2 2 5 chemical and physical characterization the characterization of produced water and treated water was done using standard instruments and methods the total organic carbon toc analysis was done using toc analyzer shimadzu instrument the ph and conductivity were measured using multifunction meter toa dka co gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms hp5973 was employed for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex analysis whereas inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkin elmer optima 5300dv was used for metals and ion chromatography ic was used for measuring cations and anions in water 3 results and discussions 3 1 produced water characterization initially produced water samples were collected and characterized in terms of physical and chemical parameters the average values of the measured parameters are present in table 1 the results of ph measurement showed that the produced water is acidic in nature i e ph 4 43 table 1 this value is consistent with what has been reported earlier for produced water from gas platform production ph range 3 5 5 5 18 conductivity of the produced water reflects total dissolved ions present in the water the mean conductivity was found to be 7035 μs cm which is within the conductivity range 4200 180 000 μs cm reported by ahmadun et al 5 for produced water from gas fields the mean value of the tss in produced water was 21 33 mg l which is also in consistent with previous studies 5 the results of organic compounds such as the benzene was present in highest concentration 11 170 ppb followed by ethylbenzene 4648 6 ppb xylenes 1156 8 ppb and toluene 378 1 ppb previous studies have also shown the presence of benzene at highest concentrations in comparison with other three volatile organics as shown in table 2 19 21 the results also show that btex concentration was more than phenol mean value for the phenol was 1 96 ppb this is in consistence with previous studies 8 9 as btex are more soluble in water as compared to phenol 22 the most abundant metals and cations found were sodium 1198 mg l potassium 100 9 mg l calcium 285 mg l strontium 13 1 mg l iron 4 1 mg l boron 5 7 mg l and magnesium 45 mg l table 1 the concentration of organic acids such as formate 1 mg l propionate 17 5 mg l and acetate 370 mg l in produced water found in this research are also in consistent with the previously reported values 23 the total organic carbon toc in north field produced water was 2405 6 mg l which is somewhat quite higher than the previously reported range of 67 620 mg l for formation produced water from louisiana production wells 18 the cod and bod of produced water was found to be 10496 6 and 1034 mg l respectively it has been reported that the bod content in produced water from natural gas wells is higher than oil production platforms in the range of 75 2870 mg l 5 the oil and grease content found in north field produced water was 40 5 mg l which is also in consistent with the literature in which the range of 40 2000 mg l 24 has been reported since the samples were collected before the scheduled injection period of chemical additives the concentration of khi and meg in produced water samples was very low there is not much published literature about the characterization of produced water from gas fields therefore this research helps to fill the gap about the composition of such produced waters however it is worth noting that the nature of geographical site as well as the operational technologies used for gas production will affect the composition of produced water in the area 3 2 treatment of produced water 3 2 1 sand filtration stage 1 the results of sand filtered water with calculated removal efficiency are present in table 3 it was noted that the ph of water after sand filtration increased from mean value 4 4 acidic media to mean value 7 5 neutral media as shown in table 3 the ph results of filtered water are mostly greater than that of the wastewater which is due to the presence of alkaline salts in the later similarly the water conductivity also increased after sand filtration it has been demonstrated that the conductivity of treated water after sand filtration usually increases in the beginning due to the leaching of salts from sand and therefore it also depends upon the salt content of the sand however after certain period the conductivity starts reducing due to the removal of salts as a result of filtration 25 the cod removal was found to be relatively low i e only 10 3 as compared to previous research 26 this could be due to the higher initial cod values of the produced water and its complicated chemical composition as compared to previous studies which was focused on domestic wastewater and greywater respectively toc concentration indeed increased in the filtered water as compared to produced water possibly due to the presence and leaching of organic compounds present in sand however previous studies have demonstrated to achieve high toc removal 94 of wastewater using sand filtration 27 therefore it is important to develop and adopt suitable cleaning protocols for sand filtration before being used for the treatment as the leaching of organics and minerals may affect the removal efficiency of the treatment technique using sand filtration high removal efficiencies were achieved for oil and grease content 97 04 in line with previously obtained removal values i e 95 8 28 in addition high removal efficiencies for benzene 93 14 ethyl benzene 99 86 and xylene 96 7 and for some metals such as aluminum 100 chromium 97 53 iron 99 46 and manganese 95 83 were achieved using sand filtration for some other metals and ions such as arsenic potassium sodium phosphate and boron insignificant removal efficiencies were achieved which shows that sand filtration may not be suitable alone for the treatment of produced water for its re injection or reuse therefore the filtered water was then used as influent for further polishing and treatment using activated carbon or modified activated carbon techniques there could be several different mechanisms of removal through sand filtration such as mechanical straining chemical and biological activity sedimentation and adsorption 29 30 high removal efficiency i e 77 for the total suspended solids using sand filtration was achieved which can be attributed to straining mechanism as the large suspended matter that cannot pass through the pores within sand grains gets filtered out similarly as a result of straining mechanism the complex macromolecules like khi and corrosion inhibitors were removed by 62 9 and 94 1 respectively it has also been reported that the coarser suspended solids being removed because of sand filtration give rise to additional filtration layer that helps to trap more suspended solids resulting in less turbid filtered water the technique showed high removal efficiency for cations and metals containing positive charge such as chromium 97 5 iron 99 5 and manganese 95 8 which could be due to the electrostatic interaction between sand particles and these cations the sand consists of silica silicon dioxide or sio2 usually in the form of quartz the quartz crystals are negatively charged and attracts positive particles in the water consequently achieving higher removal efficiencies for these particles 31 furthermore the silica contains silanol and hydroxyl functional groups which helps to make the surface hydrophilic fig 3 this in turn helps in removal of certain pollutants from water through various interactions the hydroxyl group acts as center for adsorption and forms hydrogen bond with different pollutants present in water the combination of sand filtration and ozonation was used for the treatment of produced water it was noted that 68 of the cod was removed and oil removal up to 20 mg l was obtained 32 3 2 2 activated carbon or modified activated carbon stage 02 the treatment of filtered water was then performed through both activated carbon ac and modified activated carbon mac and then treatment efficiency was compared removal efficiency of various pollutants for both treatment techniques are shown in tables 4 and 5 the clarity of water after each filtration step can be visualized from fig 4 the ph of water increased from 7 59 to 8 23 after filtration through ac which is in consistent with previous observations 33 this increase in ph after activated carbon filtration has been attributed to the sorption of anions on activated carbon surface the results of cod showed that the 23 7 reduction in cod was achieved after treatment with ac which is slightly lower than the previously obtained results for sugar industry wastewater 34 however difference in composition of both wastewaters sugar industry and produced wastewater can significantly affect the performance of these treatment systems on the other hand treatment with mac showed increase in cod values of treated water this could be due to the leaching of triton 100 surfactant and chlorides from the filtration columns as the control samples also showed higher cod concentration after the mac filtration the results also showed that toc reduction from both ac and mac techniques were almost similar i e 30 66 and 31 07 respectively ac technique has been utilized previously for other type of wastewaters such as make up water of power plant 35 and industrial wastewater 36 and relatively higher toc removal was obtained i e 44 8 and 54 9 respectively the organic acids such as acetate and propionate were removed by 83 6 and 88 7 respectively using activated carbon whereas only 24 removal was achieved for acetate and negligible removal for propionate was achieved when modified activated carbon was used in the case of metals 100 removal efficiency was obtained for arsenic cadmium cobalt chromium iron nickel and vanadium after activated carbon filtration in addition to above mentioned metals 100 removal efficiency was also achieved for molybdenum and zinc when modified activated carbon was used similarly both treatment techniques were effective in removing btex compounds from produced water as 95 removal efficiency was achieved for all of them except ethylbenzene the activated carbon was not effective against removing ethylbenzene and therefore only 76 9 removal was achieved granular activated carbon has been used previously to remove btex from diethanolamine solution with satisfactory performance and it was noted that the adsorption followed both langmuir and freundlich model isotherms 36 a combination of bentonite or organoclay and activated carbon was used to treat produced water 37 the researchers reported that their system could eliminate hydrocarbons steadily and effectively resulting in reduced total petroleum hydrocarbons and soluble hydrocarbons such as btex to non detectable limits the adsorption capacity of activated carbon was also investigated and compared with composite material combination of zeolite limestone activated carbon and rice husk carbon and zeolite adsorbents 38 it was found that the activated carbon had highest adsorption capacity i e 37 88 mg g followed by composite media 22 99 mg g and zeolite adsorbent 2 35 mg g fig 4 shows the difference in water quality between produced water and treated water using sand filtration activated carbon and modified activated carbon techniques activated carbon has been proved to be efficient in eliminating variety of organic compounds and heavy metals from wastewater 14 due to its microporous structure with high surface area and higher surface reactivity 15 there is combination of different mechanisms responsible for adsorption by activated carbon such as chemical physical and exchange interactions physical adsorption is due to relatively weak intra molecular attractive forces van der waals while chemical adsorption occurs by chemical interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent and the exchange adsorption results due to charged sites on the surface 14 therefore activated carbons have been widely used adsorbents for efficient removal of undesirable substances from liquids and gases at industrial level the physicochemical and catalytic properties of activated carbon results from the presence of different functional groups present on the surface of the carbon atoms or anchored within them 39 the surface chemistry of activated carbon is governed by the heteroatom of carbon surface which possesses nitrogen halogen oxygen and hydrogen chemically bonded to it 40 the presence of these functional groups mainly oxygen atoms also known as surface oxides are most commonly found species found at the surface of activated carbon and they took significant role in its application 41 previously the adsorption of color from wastewaters through calcined dolomite through modification with microemulsions was studied 42 the results of ftir showed that the predominant removal mechanism was the electrostatic interaction between the dye and the carboxylate anion that causes removal of reactive yellow dye molecules furthermore the adsorption of methylene blue and reactive black dyes was found to be a combination of different interactions such as electrostatic attraction hydrophobic interactions and entrainment by microemulsion micelles in the pores of the calcined diatomite the adsorption capacities were higher than unmodified calcined diatomite thus it can be deduced that modified activated carbon can ensure various mechanisms of removal through different type of interactions with the pollutants 4 conclusions following conclusions can be drawn from this paper chemical and physical composition of the formation produced water from north field offshore gas production platform in qatar showed that the produced water contains variety of pollutants including btex and metals at high concentrations overall the composition of produced water was found to be similar to what has been reported previously in the literature for other fields sand filtration showed higher removal efficiency for tss 77 5 and corrosion inhibitors 94 1 which is attributed to the straining mechanisms the highest metals removal was for iron and manganese and was also able to remove btex however the cod removal efficiency after sand filtration was only 10 2 and therefore further treatment with activated carbon or modified activated carbon was necessary to ensure reuse of produced water both activated carbon and modified activated carbon techniques were able to achieve high removal efficiencies for most of the pollutants since 100 removal was achieved for most of the metals and more than 95 removal was obtained for btex therefore thus the treated water was free from all major contaminants of water and can be considered for reuse in irrigation or for any other suitable reuse option it is suggested to perform reuse tests for the treated water to ensure and promote the reuse of such wastewaters for various purposes and to reduce the reliance on limited clean water resources

14324,in this study the physical and chemical characterization of produced water was done followed by treatment through sand filtration coupled with activated carbon microemulsion modified activated carbon techniques the results of characterization showed that the produced water had high chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc values i e 10 496 and 2405 mg l respectively as well as high concentration of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex and various metals after the sand filtration considerable reduction in tss and cod was achieved furthermore btex as volatile organic compounds were also removed by more than 93 except for toluene however sand filtration was not enough to remove most of the metals and ions therefore further treatment was done through activated carbon and modified activated carbon and their treatment efficiency was compared both techniques were able to achieve higher removal efficiencies for btex metals and ions thus the treated water was free from all major pollutants of produced water and can be considered suitable for reuse at industrial or domestic level this study aims to promote the reuse of produced water to reduce reliance on limited clean water resources keywords produced water sand filtration activated carbon microemulsions benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex remediation 1 introduction the extraction of natural gas is on the rise it is expected that it will be one of the main fossil fuel energy resource because of its abundance and clean burning emissions 1 the production of high quantity of wastewater in natural gas industry is one of the main challenges associated with this industry 2 qatar owns total of 14 of the world gas reserves and ranks only third after russia and iran 3 and accordingly produce huge amount of wastewater known as produced water from its gas industries it has been reported that the ratio of produced water to gas is 1 2 in qatar s north offshore field and more than 23 thousand barrels of waste water day was produced in 2014 4 the ph of produced water is generally acidic and the major components include benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylene btex oil and grease organic acids and various ions and metals metals such as cadmium iron chromium molybdenum vanadium selenium zinc and nickel are commonly found in produced water 2 5 the presence of volatile organic compounds and btex in produced water can be proved toxic for environment and health 5 according to al ghouti et al 5 produced water characteristics varies widely depending upon geographical features age and chemical composition of the reservoirs and extraction methods therefore detailed characterization from the source of produced water needs to be studied and cost effective environment friendly treatment techniques should be tested for the particular produced water to evaluate treatment efficiencies and decide reuse options considering the water stress situation and limited water resources of the arid country like qatar 6 it is now dire need to characterize its produced water and test different treatment techniques for the management of produced water one of the common management options for produced water i e its reinjection back to the environment is becoming an environmental concern and not being regarded as suitable measure 7 therefore other management measures including their treatment and reuse needs to be explored the north field of natural gas in qatar is one of the largest sources of produced water generation therefore this study is based on the characterization and treatment of one of the largest produced water streams in qatar to ensure its treatment and reuse to cope with rising clean water demands in the country many different treatment techniques have been utilized for the treatment of produced water such as adsorption using organic inorganic adsorbents 8 biological treatment using activated sludge 9 attached growth processes 10 and membrane distillation filtration 11 however the removal of recalcitrant pollutants from produced water using biological techniques is generally low 12 furthermore membrane fouling and associated cost of the overall technique makes membrane filtration less favorable for produced water treatment therefore adsorption techniques such as using sand filtration and activated carbon was explored for their efficiency of treatment of produced water used in this study hence three types of filtration media were used i e sand activated carbon and modified activated carbon sand filtration is relatively simple and cost effective technique as it uses only sand as media and has been proved to remove many pollutants such as fine solids 13 activated carbon commonly used media in commercial and industrial sectors consists of carbon suitably treated to obtain low volume with high surface area for adsorption 14 due to its unique properties such as higher surface reactivity adsorption capacity microporous structure 15 thermal stability and low acid base reactivity makes it an excellent choice as media in filtration systems 16 activated carbon has been used to remove btex and free hydrocarbons that contributes to total petroleum hydrocarbons tph in produced water effluent 7 activated carbon is sometimes modified to yield modified activated carbon mac to impart desired characteristics for enhanced removal of pollutants mac is produced by treating activated carbon with suitable surfactants for example to give rise to positive negative charge on the activated carbon which results in better removal of anions cations from water thus modified activated carbon with both positive and negative charge was produced using sodium dodecyl sulphate sds as anionic and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab as cationic surfactant for better removal of cadmium from aqueous solution it was found that the modified activated carbon had higher porosity and surface area with both positive and negative charges and proved to have higher removal efficiency 98 of cadmium as compared to its counterparts 17 in this study samples of produced water from gas production process located in qatar north field were collected characterized and treated the research objectives of this study are i to characterize the produced water from north offshore gas field of qatar in terms of physical and chemical parameters and ii treatment of produced water through combination of proposed treatment technologies i e sand filtration and activated carbon or sand filtration and microemulsion modified activated carbon techniques while the mechanisms of adsorption and associated parameters such as breakthrough volume adsorption capacity characterization studies are important for investigation as previously done by the research team 18 19 the main aim of this research was to characterize the selected source of produced water and test cost effective treatment techniques for its treatment and decide reuse option in depth investigations in terms of adsorption capacity kinetics and characterization of adsorbents will be done in the future if the suggested combination of technique meets the international standards in terms of effluent quality 2 methodology 2 1 sampling 2 1 1 produced water sampling produced water samples were collected from north offshore gas field over the time period of 10 days total of 20 liters of sample were collected during each day of water sampling thus at the end of sampling period 200 liters of produced water was collected and mixed together and considered as representative of produced water characteristics from north offshore gas field this collected water sample was used both for characterization and treatment 2 1 2 sand and clay sampling for the

activated carbon filtration column preparation the commercially acquired granular activated carbon was first washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 110 c in an oven the activated carbon was modified through preparing microemulsions using procedure adopted from nadeem et al 17 briefly surfactant triton x 100 non ionic iso octylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol was placed in an orbital shaker fisher scientific at 160 rpm 80 0 5 c for the period of 6 h followed by placing it at room temperature 100 g of granular activated carbon was ﬁltered by whattman filter and dried in an oven overnight at 110 c 17 similar to procedure mentioned in section 3 4 glass columns of 250 ml capacity with length and diameter of 7 87 and 1 96 in respectively were filled with 100 g of modified activated carbon glass wools were kept at the bottom to prevent leaching the columns were washed with deionized water the filtration was done at the rate of 0 3m3 h the filtered water from sand filtration column stage 1 was used as feed water for modified activated carbon filtration the deionized water was used as a control the filtered water from this stage was collected for characterization and estimating the efficiency of treatment using eq 1 the treatment stages are depicted in fig 2 2 5 chemical and physical characterization the characterization of produced water and treated water was done using standard instruments and methods the total organic carbon toc analysis was done using toc analyzer shimadzu instrument the ph and conductivity were measured using multifunction meter toa dka co gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms hp5973 was employed for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex analysis whereas inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkin elmer optima 5300dv was used for metals and ion chromatography ic was used for measuring cations and anions in water 3 results and discussions 3 1 produced water characterization initially produced water samples were collected and characterized in terms of physical and chemical parameters the average values of the measured parameters are present in table 1 the results of ph measurement showed that the produced water is acidic in nature i e ph 4 43 table 1 this value is consistent with what has been reported earlier for produced water from gas platform production ph range 3 5 5 5 18 conductivity of the produced water reflects total dissolved ions present in the water the mean conductivity was found to be 7035 μs cm which is within the conductivity range 4200 180 000 μs cm reported by ahmadun et al 5 for produced water from gas fields the mean value of the tss in produced water was 21 33 mg l which is also in consistent with previous studies 5 the results of organic compounds such as the benzene was present in highest concentration 11 170 ppb followed by ethylbenzene 4648 6 ppb xylenes 1156 8 ppb and toluene 378 1 ppb previous studies have also shown the presence of benzene at highest concentrations in comparison with other three volatile organics as shown in table 2 19 21 the results also show that btex concentration was more than phenol mean value for the phenol was 1 96 ppb this is in consistence with previous studies 8 9 as btex are more soluble in water as compared to phenol 22 the most abundant metals and cations found were sodium 1198 mg l potassium 100 9 mg l calcium 285 mg l strontium 13 1 mg l iron 4 1 mg l boron 5 7 mg l and magnesium 45 mg l table 1 the concentration of organic acids such as formate 1 mg l propionate 17 5 mg l and acetate 370 mg l in produced water found in this research are also in consistent with the previously reported values 23 the total organic carbon toc in north field produced water was 2405 6 mg l which is somewhat quite higher than the previously reported range of 67 620 mg l for formation produced water from louisiana production wells 18 the cod and bod of produced water was found to be 10496 6 and 1034 mg l respectively it has been reported that the bod content in produced water from natural gas wells is higher than oil production platforms in the range of 75 2870 mg l 5 the oil and grease content found in north field produced water was 40 5 mg l which is also in consistent with the literature in which the range of 40 2000 mg l 24 has been reported since the samples were collected before the scheduled injection period of chemical additives the concentration of khi and meg in produced water samples was very low there is not much published literature about the characterization of produced water from gas fields therefore this research helps to fill the gap about the composition of such produced waters however it is worth noting that the nature of geographical site as well as the operational technologies used for gas production will affect the composition of produced water in the area 3 2 treatment of produced water 3 2 1 sand filtration stage 1 the results of sand filtered water with calculated removal efficiency are present in table 3 it was noted that the ph of water after sand filtration increased from mean value 4 4 acidic media to mean value 7 5 neutral media as shown in table 3 the ph results of filtered water are mostly greater than that of the wastewater which is due to the presence of alkaline salts in the later similarly the water conductivity also increased after sand filtration it has been demonstrated that the conductivity of treated water after sand filtration usually increases in the beginning due to the leaching of salts from sand and therefore it also depends upon the salt content of the sand however after certain period the conductivity starts reducing due to the removal of salts as a result of filtration 25 the cod removal was
