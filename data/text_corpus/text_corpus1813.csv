9065,the optimized agricultural water schedule and management especially in the large irrigation district along the river basins were closely related to the spatial and temporal runoff variations however the impacts of climate change and human activities leads to non linear and non stationary monthly runoffs under this condition effectively capturing the variation of the runoff time series and improving the accuracy of the prediction model are of vital importance however some existing monthly data driven prediction studies mainly focus on the model structure and calculation load ignoring the influence of each frequency component of runoff and the fluctuation of runoff series caused by meteorological factors which may not effectively capture the potential change process in this paper a novel method ceemd mpe emd gru for the non stationary monthly runoff prediction was proposed it fully took advantages of the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd multi scale permutation entropy mpe empirical mode decomposition emd and gated recurrent unit gru the combined model in general is a data driven model and compared with the traditional mechanism model its most notable advantage is that it successfully overcomes the redundant information of the prediction model in addition atmospheric input factor analysis is added on the basis of fully decomposing and identifying non stationary pseudo components the hydrological runoff data 1956 2014 obtained from the manas river locating at xinjiang china were used for prediction the results indicated that the new ceemd mpe emd gru model reached higher accuracy as its nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient 0 960 was significantly larger than those of the gru model 0 813 and the ceemd gru model 0 889 meanwhile the root mean square error and the absolute relative error of the ceemd mpe emd gru model decreased to 0 279 and 0 195 respectively the new runoff prediction model established in this paper would provide more precise evaluation of the monthly runoff prediction and better guidelines for high efficiency agricultural water scheduling in the irrigation district abbreviation ceemd complementary

keywords monthly runoff prediction hybrid model model precision oasis irrigation area data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction accurate runoff prediction on monthly basis is crucial for the schedule and management of agricultural water resources in the irrigation districts especially for those along the river basins aouissi et al 2016 sang et al 2012 however runoff is easily affected by numerous factors such as precipitation evaporation underlying surface and atmospheric circulation resulting in strong non linear characteristic and high uncertainty deb et al 2015 feng et al 2019 especially nowadays the consistency of runoff is increasingly disturbed by the impact of climate changes and human activities li et al 2009 therefore accurately capturing the dynamic variations of the monthly runoff for the references of agricultural irrigation schedule is becoming much more difficult under current conditions with the influence of environmental changes and human activities the instability volatility and randomness of runoff time series are significantly strengthened which directly leads to the increase in the difficulty of prediction loyeh and bavani 2021 he et al 2021 therefore it is very necessary to obtain accurate runoff forecast results by multi scale analysis of runoff time series based on decomposition and reconstruction hybrid prediction model the premise of runoff prediction based on data driven neural network model is to decompose the runoff time series at multiple scales so that the non stationary series tend to be stabilized and each sub sequence is brought into the model separately to meet the requirements of improving the prediction accuracy among them the most representative decomposition methods are wavelet analysis tang et al 2020 emd huang et al 1998 daubechies et al 2011 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 and variational mode decomposition dragomiretskiy zosso 2014 however wavelet basis functions need to be pre defined and have adaptive properties emd adaptively decomposes a complex series into several intrinsic mode functions imfs which is suitable for nonlinear and non stationary signal processing huang et al 1998 yeh et al 2008 proposed an improved algorithm called ceemd which adds positive and negative paired white noise to the original signal to mix problem of emd humeau heurtier et al 2015a recently ceemd has been successfully applied to analyze hydrological time series and it is an effective method to decompose non linear and non stationary series however ceemd has very strict requirements on the number of decomposition iterations and auxiliary white noise improper selection will not only produces false components but also makes imf residual auxiliary noise from normal decomposition which will affect the final feature extraction accuracy therefore in order to reasonably select the number of decomposition iterations and effectively reduce the auxiliary white noise this paper adds mpe to optimize the detection based on the combination of multiple decomposition of emd and ceemd series in order to achieve a reasonable selection of sequences over the past few decades scholars have successfully developed numerous hydrological forecasting models the models used in runoff prediction can be divided in two categories physical based models and data based models zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2021 physical based models mainly simulate or reflect the mechanism of rainfall runoff process xu et al 2013 however the physical based hydrological model requires multiple sources such as soil underlying surface solar radiation etc therefore the parameters are difficult to determine and optimize thus the lack of data will limit its predictive ability to a large extent yang et al 2017 data driven models are constructed without considering the internal physical mechanisms of the hydrological process huang et al 2019 among them machine learning is one of the most commonly used methods to explore the digital connections between input and target data at the same time with the vigorous development of computer science and algorithms artificial intelligence has received great attention from scholars in the field of hydrology thus many data based methods such as auto regressive integrated moving average model arima artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and deep learning have been employed in monthly hydrological runoff forecasting he et al 2019 fan et al 2018 lenin et al 2020 wang et al 2019 as one of the most important data based models ann method has been widely used in the hydrological forecasting due to its strong self adaptation and self study ability feng et al 2020 wang et al 2015b xie et al 2018 wang et al 2015a and ren et al 2016 combined the ann models with integrated empirical mode decomposition to predict mid and long term runoff time series tayyab et al 2019 merged anns with discrete wavelet transform dwt to establish a rainfall runoff model in jinsha river basin however the ann method was trained by the conventional gradient based algorithms it suffers from the disadvantage of slow convergence and the local minimum value and overfitting limitations taormina and chau 2015 wen et al 2018 lin et al 2006 proposed svm as a promising hydrological prediction model which was verified by long term observation of monthly flow of manwan hydropower station however the svm model requires to carefully select the kernel function which further increases the prediction steps feizizadeh et al 2017 to overcome these disadvantages a deep neural network is developed to focus on the processing time sequences data and selectively handling the information it is a typical representative of data based prediction models deep learning combines low level features by training neural networks to form more abstract high level attribute categories or features so as to explore the distributed feature representation of data and achieve a deep understanding of data van et al 2020 the advantages of deep learning in preliminary feature learning and long sequence processing makes up for the shortcomings of the existing medium term and long term runoff prediction methods gru is a special type of recurrent neural networks it is evolved from lstm long short term memory network which overcomes the gradients disappearance issue of the traditional recurrent neural network while learning the long term dependencies it is suitable for simulating the correlation of time series data at the same time it requires less calculation than lstm cells and has higher training efficiency alex and j√ºrgen 2005 zhang et al 2018 which better solves the problem of long term correlation of time series although gru is able to predict the majority of the hydrological time series it is difficult to obtain satisfactory predictions effect for strong non linear and volatility time series liu et al 2019 therefore the ceemd mpe emd gru model is introduced and the hydrological and meteorological elements in the time series are optimized as the input items of the model on the basis of fully decomposing and identifying the unstable pseudo components a large number of steps caused by the redundant information of the prediction model are overcome and the accuracy of nonlinear and non stationary flow simulation is effectively improved which provides reliable information support for water use planning in an oasis irrigation area the specific objectives are 1 optimize the hydrometeorological elements in time series as the input items 2 establish a hybrid approach integrating ceemd mpe emd and gru for monthly runoff prediction 3 verify the advantages in prediction accuracy of the new hybrid model by quantitatively comparing with the gru and the ceemd gru models 2 studying area and dataset collected the manas river oasis irrigation area in xinjiang china is located in the alluvial plain of the manas river basin it is adjacent to the gurbantunggut desert the second largest desert in china and is the throat of china s northwest frontier the irrigation area uses surface water as the main irrigation method which is a typical desert oasis water diversion agricultural irrigation area accounting for 93 of the total water consumption the irrigation water mainly comes from manas river runoff and groundwater manas river oasis irrigation area is an important agricultural production area including shihezi irrigation area xiayedi irrigation area and mosuowan irrigation area in 2015 the total cultivated land area is about 25 13 104 hkm2 the development and utilization of water resources in the irrigation area is relatively high ling et al 2013 therefore this area is also one of the areas with rapid economic development in the northern slope of the tianshan mountains and even northwest china it is a crucial cultural and economic core area in xinjiang the manas river where the irrigation area is located is the largest snow melt river which originates from the northern slope of the tianshan mountain in china the kenswat hydrological station in the study area controls a watershed area of 4637 km2 fig 1 at an altitude of above 3600 m it is covered with snow all the year round there are glaciers with an area of 608 25 km2 which is the main source of supply for various rivers the annual average runoff is 12 21 108 m3 at the kenswat hydrological station the study area has a typical temperate continental climate with average annual temperature of 5 9 the annual average rainfall of 338 2 mm and the average annual evaporation of 1550 6 mm he et al 2021 in this paper the measured monthly scale data of runoff precipitation and temperature from the kenswat hydrometric station over the period 1956 2014 were used runoff was used as the prediction target and rainfall evaporation and previous runoff were used as inputs to the model due to the increasing influence of atmospheric circulation anomalies on runoff especially nino3 4 arctic oscillation ao and pacific decadal oscillation pdo had a strong correlation with runoff in the manas river basin at the same time the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo had a significant impact on the climate of the asian monsoon region therefore in order to obtain higher runoff prediction accuracy rich input factors are also one of the key approaches in this paper the monthly scale data of the above four atmospheric circulation factors are selected as input items to increase the data from january 1956 to december 2010 were used for model training and the data from january 2010 to december 2014 were used for model verification the hydrological data comes from the hydrological bureau of shihezi city xinjiang china and the atmospheric circulation anomaly factor data comes from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov 3 methods and overall concepts 3 1 empirical mode decomposition emd emd decomposes the signal into multiple imfs in physically meaning according to specific conditions huang et al 1998 the calculation steps are as follows 1 determine all local extrema of the original sequence x t and use the cubic spline interpolation function to fit the upper envelope x max t and the lower envelope x min t 2 calculate the mean of the envelopes by m t x max t x min t 2 3 obtain the detail h t x t m t 4 check the details of h t if h t is an imfs then repeat above steps with residual r t x t h t replacing x t otherwise h t instead of x t to continue above steps 5 repeat the above steps to decompose all the intrinsic modal functions until the monotonic residual term appears 3 2 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd eemd is a noise assisted time frequency analysis method which effectively suppress the modal aliasing of emd method according to the characteristics of frequency average distribution of gaussian white noise with the addition of white gaussian noise the signal has continuity on different scales which can reduce the degree of modal aliasing tan et al 2018 the calculation steps are as follows 1 add m white noise signals with an average value of 0 and the same standard deviation to the original sequence x t 2 perform emd decomposition on the target signal to obtain m groups of imf components and m groups of margins 3 repeat steps 1 2 calculate the average value of m groups of imf components and the average value r of the margin 3 3 complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd ceemd is an improved algorithm based on eemd yeh et al 2008 made further improvements to eemd by adding random gaussian white noise to the original signal in positive and negative pairs humeau heurtier et al 2015a this can eliminate the residual auxiliary noise effectively in the reconstructed signal as indicated by experience while making the final decomposition more complete the steps for ceemd decomposition are as follows 1 by adding pairs of positive and negative gaussian white noise to the original signal the signal set is denoted by 1 m 1 m 2 1 1 1 1 s n where s is the original signal n is the gaussian white noise and m 1 m 2 are the sum of original signals with the positive and negative gaussian white noise respectively 2 emd decomposition is performed on the target signal and each signal obtains a set of imf components in which the i th component of the j th imf is expressed as imf ij 3 obtain the results of each imf after averaging the overall ensemble which can be formulated by 2 i m f j 1 2 n i 1 2 n i m f i j hence the final decomposition result x t of ceemd can be denoted as 3 x t j 1 k i m f j t r e s 3 4 multi scale permutation entropy mpe mpe is a method to detect the random and dynamic mutation of signals yin and shang 2014 it calculates the permutation entropy by coarse grained time series specific steps are as follows 1 suppose the time series x x 1 x 2 x l is processed by multi scale coarsening 4 y j 2 1 s i j 1 s 1 j s x i 1 j l where s is the scale factor y j s is a multi scale time series when the scale factor s is 1 its time series y j 1 is the original time series and the calculation result is the permutation entropy 2 to reconstruct the time series y j s 5 y t s y t s y t œÑ 2 y t m 1 œÑ 2 where œÑ is the time delay m is the embedding dimension 3 the sequence of time reconstruction y t s is arranged in ascending order there are m kinds of permutations in the sequence the number of occurrences of each permutation type is n l and the corresponding probability of occurrence is p l s 6 y t j 1 1 œÑ 2 y t j 2 1 œÑ s y t j m 1 œÑ s 7 p p s n l n s m 1 4 calculate the permutation entropy of time series signal y t s when the scale factor is s 8 h p s l 1 m p l s ln p l s 5 normalize the permutation entropy of the time series at scale s to get the normalized multi scale permutation entropy 9 h p s h p s ln m 3 5 gated recurrent unit neural network gru gru neural network is an improved model based on lstm neural network alex and j√ºrgen 2005 zhang et al 2018 lstm neural network proposes forget gates input gates and output gates the gur removes or enhances the input information into the neural unit cells to control the cell state the gru neural network merges the forget gate and input gate in lstm into an update gate which merges and improves the cell state the gru network has fast convergence speed and is not prone to gradient disappearance the gating unit adjusts the input of the activation function in real time through bias and related parameters so as to control the opening and closing of the door saving and updating useful information since there is one less gate than the lstm network when the number of training samples is large it will reduce the overall prediction time without significantly reducing the prediction effect the neural network structure of the internal structure of a gru unit is shown in fig 2 at time t the update gate z t defines the proportion of the previous memory save to the current state in fig 1 the input of the gru unit includes the hidden layer state variable of the previous time h t 1 and the input information at the current time x t then the model uses reset gate r t and update gate z t in turn to calculate the hidden layer state variable h t finally h t will be used as the unit s calculation result at time t and passed to the next time for calculation the larger the threshold value of update gate the more state information will be brought at the previous time which is helpful to capture the long term dependence of time series the smaller the threshold of the reset gate the more information is ignored which is helpful to capture the short term dependencies in the timing sequence the update formula of the weight parameter of the network forward propagation is as follows 10 z t œÉ w z h t 1 x t 11 r t œÉ w r h t 1 x t 12 h t tan h w r t h t 1 x t 13 h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where z t and r t are the reset gate and the update gate respectively x t is the input at time t h t 1 is the hidden state input at t 1 h t is the candidate hidden state and w z represents the weight of the update gate œÉ represents the sigmoid function 3 6 overall procedure of the hybrid ceemd mpe emd gru model to improve the accuracy of monthly runoff prediction we proposed a neoteric hybrid ceemd mpe emd gru model by integrating the advantages of the models above the overall procedure of the proposed model is shown in fig 3 based on the decomposition of emd and ceemd series the model adds mpe optimization detection so as to use gru to complete runoff prediction it not only fully decomposes and identifies unstable pseudo components but also successfully overcomes the large number of steps brought by redundant information of the prediction model 1 input factor optimization in this study the lag characteristics of the factors causing runoff generation are fully considered and the model input items are optimized based on pearson s correlation coefficient analyze and select the reasonable factors by calculating the correlation at different lag times between the runoff and the anomaly factors such as the previous runoff precipitation temperature and atmospheric circulation 2 decomposition ceemd is utilized to decompose the original runoff sequence into sub sequences of different frequencies 3 secondary decomposition of pseudo components among the components obtained by decomposition in step 1 mpe is used to extract unstable pseudo components perform secondary decomposition based on emd to obtain the final sub sequence based on the secondary decomposition of emd this state can effectively avoid modal mixing so as to achieve the optimal decomposition state of the hydrological time series thereby obtaining the final sub sequence 4 prediction the sub series normalized to 0 1 can be divided into a training set and a testing set through learning the training set of each sub sequence using trial and error method to determine the best hyper parameters of the gru model the trained gru model is used to predict each sub sequence and the cumulative sum of each sub sequence is the final prediction result the gru model efficiently models training time and captures nonlinear patterns hidden in monthly runoff 3 7 evaluation index in order to objectively evaluate the accuracy of the model nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse mean absolute relative error mare and the determination coefficient r2 are used as performance metrics to estimate the forecast accuracy the larger the nse and r2 the better the fitting effect and the maximum value is 1 the value range of rmse and mae is 0 and the smaller the value the better the model effect these four performances metrics are defined as follows 14 n s e 1 i 1 n q 0 i q f i 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 2 15 r 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 q f i q f 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 2 i 1 n q f i q f 2 16 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q f i q 0 i 2 17 m a r e 1 n i 1 n q f i q 0 i q 0 i 100 where n denotes the number of test samples for the prediction model q 0 i represents the actual value of the monthly runoff series q f i represents the corresponding forecast value q 0 is the average values of the actual value and q f is the average values of the forecast value 4 results and discussion 4 1 determining forecasting factors generally the set of input variables directly affects the final prediction results therefore it is necessary to fully consider the timeliness of influencing factors to improve the accuracy of the model runoff generation and sinkflow are two important processes for the generation of runoff but in this process precipitation temperature and atmospheric circulation factors have a certain time lag effect on runoff due to the influence of distance topography and underlying surface and different factors have different effects on runoff due to the hysteresis effect of hydrometeorological factors such as precipitation runoff and temperature on runoff the factors affecting runoff are different in order to reduce the influence of time lag effect this study optimizes the input items of the model based on the correlation coefficient for the lag time of different months the pearson correlation coefficient analysis method is used to select reasonable input items and the results are shown in fig 4 through the calculation of the correlation between each factor and the target factor under different delay times the analysis and selection of reasonable factors are crucial to the prediction of runoff the input items of runoff prediction model require highly informative and strongly correlated factors it can be found from the figure that since pdo and ao have no correlation with runoff these factors cannot work together with other factors to affect runoff and the result may reduce the prediction accuracy so they are excluded liu et al 2021 therefore the pre runoff lag time of 12 months the rainfall lag time of 2 months the amo lag time of 12 months and the nimo3 4 lag time of 2 months are selected as the optimal factors for model input 4 2 runoff time series decomposition the runoff time series of kenswat hydrological station from january 2010 to december 2014 are decomposed into different frequency sub sequences by ceemd by calculating the relative error of each sequence and analyzing the contribution rate of each sub sequence to the runoff sequence the results show that the relative error of the sub sequence is the relative error affecting the runoff since the high frequency components have the characteristics of modal confusion and non stationarity mpe is used to detect whether the high frequency components are abnormal signals after repeated tests when the noise logarithm is 30 the noise amplitude is 0 2 the maximum decomposition is 6 the pe threshold is 0 45 and the time delay is 1 the decomposition effect of the runoff series is the best it can be seen from the decomposition results in fig 5 that the runoff time series can be decomposed into 6 natural mode components and 1 trend term from high frequency to low frequency the original signal can be obtained by adding cimfs and trend r between both of them the cimf1 and cimf2 components have the lowest stationarity which is characterized by greater volatility and higher frequency the amplitude and frequency of cimf3 cimf6 components decrease sequentially through the pre treatment of decomposition technology the variation range of each component is significantly lower than the original sequence which significantly reduces the fluctuation and trend of the original sequence and effectively overcome modal aliasing white noise interference however due to the characteristics of extreme non stationarity and randomness of individual components and its greater complexity mohammad et al 2019 the mpe method is used to study separately based on the decomposition results of ceemd mpe is used to identify the complexity of runoff time series components due to the high frequency components have the characteristics of modal confusion and instability mpe is used to detect whether their components are abnormal signals after repeated trial calculations it is the most suitable condition when the embedding dimension is 7 the scale factor is 2 the delay factor is 1 and the threshold is 4 5 if the mpe value of the component is greater than the threshold value Œ∏ 0 4 5 it is determined that the component is a pseudo component otherwise it is an almost static component it can be seen from fig 6 that the permutation entropy values of the runoff sequence components cimf1 and cimf2 decomposed by ceemd are significantly higher than the other components greater than the threshold 0 45 the permutation entropy of the cimf2 r component gradually decreased and the permutation entropy of the cr component is 0 11 cimf1 and cimf2 have the highest complexity and the most difficult to predict this is consistent with the feature that the cimf1 component fluctuates greatly when zhang et al 2021 uses ceemd to decompose time series the results show that the frequency of imf1 in the runoff sequence is significantly higher than the other components which is the high frequency component the complexity of cimf2 cimf4 is the second which is the intermediate frequency component the complexity of cimf5 cr is the lowest which is the low frequency component it is confirmed that the decomposition can provide stationarity for model prediction thereby improving the predictability of the series wu et al 2019 to avoid an infinite decomposition cycle the cimf1 and cimf2 sequences are superimposed as a pseudo component and decomposed twice by emd decomposition method the decomposition result of the pseudo component is shown in fig 7a it can be seen from fig 7b that the mpe values of the components after re decomposition are all less than the threshold value of 4 5 which can be judged as a stationary signal the average mpe value of the pseudo component after decomposition is 0 25 which is 50 less than the average mpe of cimf1 and cimf2 to reduce the instability and nonlinearity of high frequency components and improve the predictability of high frequency components therefore the ceemd mpe emd decomposition method can well overcome the occurrence of modal aliasing and make the time series more fully decomposed 4 3 comparison between gru ceemd gru and ceemd map emd gru the optimal predictors at different time lags are used as model inputs items the trained gru model is used to predict each sub sequence and the ensemble forecasting result is generated by adding all the prediction results of each sub sequence construct a combined model of ceemd mpe emd gru to test the effectiveness of pseudo component processing based on multi scale permutation entropy in the model the r2 nse mape rmse and mpe are used to evaluate the performance of the prediction accuracy the single gru model and ceemd gru are comparative forecast models for predicting the monthly runoff using the same dataset the evaluation indicators of the three models are presented in table 1 it can be seen from table 1 that the nse and r2 of the three models are all greater than 0 8 it can be known from the principle of the model that the gru model has advantages in dealing with long term sequences through a unique gate structure design it greatly retains the integrity of hydrometeorological elements and has a strong generalization ability gao et al 2020 the hybrid ceemd map emd gru model has the best performance with the largest r2 and nse and the lowest mare and rmse the quantitative evaluation indicators of the three models show that the predictive performance of a single gru model is lower than the remaining two combined models compared with the results of the gru model the nse value of the hybrid ceemd map emd gru model increased by 18 1 r2 increased by 18 4 mare decreased by 39 3 and rmse decreased by 60 2 the performance of the ceemd gru model is better than that of the gru model but the performance of the ceemd map emd gru model is better than that of the gru model research shows that the ceemd decomposition method based on permutation entropy can effectively filter out the noise of the original runoff sequence the combined model has better non linear processing capabilities and improves the stability and predictability of the runoff sequence in terms of quantitative assessment the forecasting performances of the three models fall in the order of ceemd map emd gru ceemd gru gru in order to effectively compare the performance of the models we analyzed the combined models an et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 gao et al 2020 feng et al 2021 found that non stationary time series decomposition is essential in many combination prediction models but in the research workers often ignore the decomposition pseudo components that does not satisfy the stability and do not conduct in depth research and processing so it often causes a large error in single subsequence prediction at the same time for the selection of prediction model the optimized gur model bid farewell to the time step problem of ann svm etc in the case of the same performance as the lstm model the gru model has fewer parameters and less complex structure the reference of atmospheric factors in the ceemd map emd gru model is also one of the reasons for the significant improvement of model prediction accuracy this is because researchers have paid more attention to the relationship between runoff and rainfall in the past fig 8 displays the forecasting results and scatter plots respectively generated by the ceemd map emd gru ceemd gru and gru models during the validation period for one thing in accordance with both the general tendency and forecasting capacities of the peak runoff the proposed ceemd map emd gru model exhibits the most accurate performance compared to the other models for another it can be seen from the scatter points that the ceemd map emd gru scatter plot clustering is the closest to the ideal fitting and has the highest accuracy the gru results generally follow the runoff trend but weaken the forecasting ability for observed peak runoff at the same time the results from the ceemd gru model perform a reasonable fit with observed changes in runoff in conclusion the extreme values of all models in comparative trend research are relatively poor the analysis may be due to the increasing impact of human activities climate change and other factors on runoff chen et al 2015 leading to increased uncertainty and further increasing the difficulty of forecasting the gru results generally follow the runoff trend but weaken the forecasting ability for observed peak runoff at the same time the results from the ceemd gru model perform a reasonable fit with observed changes in runoff in conclusion the extreme values of all models in comparative trend research are relatively poor the analysis may be due to the increasing impact of human activities climate change and other factors on runoff chen et al 2015 leading to increased uncertainty and further increasing the difficulty of forecasting in addition we further discuss the reasons why ceemd map emd gru is better than ceemd gru the metric performances of each component in calibration validation ceemd map emd gru and ceemd gru models are listed in tables 2 3 respectively it can be seen from table 2 that the nse and r2 of each component perform relatively well the relative percentage errors of cimf1 and cimf2 are 335 4 and 43 8 respectively the rmse of cimf1 and cimf2 are about 0 3 which is larger than the others the component error indicates that the overall error is mainly concentrated in the two components of cimf1 and cimf2 for cimf3 6 and the trend item cr rmse is lower than 0 03 which is significantly smaller than cimf1 and cimf2 due to the extreme irregularity of the high frequency components the accuracy of the prediction results is poor rezaei et al 2020 wu et al 2019 it can be seen that cimf1 and cimf2 contribute a lot to the error of the ceemd gru model and the ceemd gru model does not perform well in retaining high frequency information and accumulating the generated sequence to further reduce the prediction error of false components the components are judged by permutation entropy and the poorly simulated false components cimf1 and cimf2 are decomposed again using emd the specific evaluation results are shown in table 3 the prediction effect after decomposition based on permutation entropy is better than that after ceemd decomposition after the second decomposition the mare and rmse values are greatly reduced among them the permutation entropy of eimf2 with the highest complexity in eimf is 16 98 and 8 33 lower than cimf1 and cimf2 respectively which reduces the complexity to a certain extent and obtains better fitting results manas river basin is a typical arid and semi arid region in china its oasis development model is representative with water resources utilization as the core issue feng et al 2011 sensitive ecological zones of irrigated agriculture and climatic drought are widespread in the basin ling et al 2011 with the increasing area of oasis irrigation in recent years the area has increased by 129 56 in the past 40 years 98 of surface water has been used and 58 of groundwater has been developed ling et al 2010 due to the limitation of the total amount of water resources the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources in the basin will become increasingly tense the manas river green irrigation area starts from water storage and diversion irrigation in march to the end of the irrigation period in september when considering the inflow situation the guarantee rates of dry and normal years are generally selected to be 50 and 75 respectively to plan the balance of irrigation and demand in the current year therefore the high standard water use plan makes runoff prediction particularly important previous studies have shown that there is a significant nonlinear correlation between runoff and temperature runoff and precipitation in the manas river basin ling et al 2011 on the basis of fully exploring the actual situation of the irrigation area the secondary decomposition has a significant effect on improving the accuracy of runoff series prediction combining the advantages of ceemd and mpe ali et al 2020 humeau heurtier et al 2015b the pseudo component is decomposed twice to reduce the complexity of high frequency components and make them more stable to a certain extent the prediction accuracy of the sub sequence is optimized to capture the potential characteristics of runoff more deeply the combination method can provide ideas for runoff time series prediction under changing environment and play a very supportive role for rational allocation of water resources in irrigated areas 5 conclusions in order to improve the accuracy of nonlinear and non stationary flow simulation this study proposes a new monthly runoff prediction method ceemd mpe emd gru then the method is applied to runoff time series of manas river this study draws the following conclusions 1 the prediction accuracy of the combined model based on decomposition is better than that of a single model and the decomposition prediction reconstruction method is suitable for non stationary time series with obvious trend changes 2 the ceemd mpe emd gru model has a good effect on the overall trend and extreme value prediction and has good generalization ability the combined method overcomes the shortcomings of a single gru model in strong non linear and fluctuating multi frequency sequence simulation 3 the quadratic decomposition can reduce the complexity of runoff series and better captures the internal characteristics of the cycle and trend of the runoff series thereby optimizing the prediction and fitting effects compared with the traditional method of direct runoff series prediction and the single decomposition model prediction the prediction accuracy of the hybrid model based on quadratic decomposition is improved by 15 3 and 7 4 respectively the proposed combined ceemd mpe emd gru prediction model has convenient and efficient ability in modeling time series data it can also be applied to other fields such as weather flood traffic etc at the same time combined with various data analysis methods it can not only improve the prediction accuracy of the corresponding fields but also achieve multidisciplinary intersection which plays a positive role in promoting the development of the prediction model for the prediction of the model the selection of parameters is crucial and the selection of internal parameters of the model is based on the comparison of effects which makes the determination of parameters with great uncertainty therefore the optimization algorithm of model parameters should be further improved at the same time due to the increasing influence of human activities on runoff in recent years it is the focus of our future research to consider integrating human activities and physical factors deeply capture the potential law of runoff and improve the combination prediction theory

9065,the optimized agricultural water schedule and management especially in the large irrigation district along the river basins were closely related to the spatial and temporal runoff variations however the impacts of climate change and human activities leads to non linear and non stationary monthly runoffs under this condition effectively capturing the variation of the runoff time series and improving the accuracy of the prediction model are of vital importance however some existing monthly data driven prediction studies mainly focus on the model structure and calculation load ignoring the influence of each frequency component of runoff and the fluctuation of runoff series caused by meteorological factors which may not effectively capture the potential change process in this paper a novel method ceemd mpe emd gru for the non stationary monthly runoff prediction was proposed it fully took advantages of the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd multi scale permutation entropy mpe empirical mode decomposition emd and gated recurrent unit gru the combined model in general is a data driven model and compared with the traditional mechanism model its most notable advantage is that it successfully overcomes the redundant information of the prediction model in addition atmospheric input factor analysis is added on the basis of fully decomposing and identifying non stationary pseudo components the hydrological runoff data 1956 2014 obtained from the manas river locating at xinjiang china were used for prediction the results indicated that the new ceemd mpe emd gru model reached higher accuracy as its nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient 0 960 was significantly larger than those of the gru model 0 813 and the ceemd gru model 0 889 meanwhile the root mean square error and the absolute relative error of the ceemd mpe emd gru model decreased to 0 279 and 0 195 respectively the new runoff prediction model established in this paper would provide more precise evaluation of the monthly runoff prediction and better guidelines for high efficiency agricultural water scheduling in the irrigation district abbreviation ceemd complementary

monthly basis is crucial for the schedule and management of agricultural water resources in the irrigation districts especially for those along the river basins aouissi et al 2016 sang et al 2012 however runoff is easily affected by numerous factors such as precipitation evaporation underlying surface and atmospheric circulation resulting in strong non linear characteristic and high uncertainty deb et al 2015 feng et al 2019 especially nowadays the consistency of runoff is increasingly disturbed by the impact of climate changes and human activities li et al 2009 therefore accurately capturing the dynamic variations of the monthly runoff for the references of agricultural irrigation schedule is becoming much more difficult under current conditions with the influence of environmental changes and human activities the instability volatility and randomness of runoff time series are significantly strengthened which directly leads to the increase in the difficulty of prediction loyeh and bavani 2021 he et al 2021 therefore it is very necessary to obtain accurate runoff forecast results by multi scale analysis of runoff time series based on decomposition and reconstruction hybrid prediction model the premise of runoff prediction based on data driven neural network model is to decompose the runoff time series at multiple scales so that the non stationary series tend to be stabilized and each sub sequence is brought into the model separately to meet the requirements of improving the prediction accuracy among them the most representative decomposition methods are wavelet analysis tang et al 2020 emd huang et al 1998 daubechies et al 2011 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 and variational mode decomposition dragomiretskiy zosso 2014 however wavelet basis functions need to be pre defined and have adaptive properties emd adaptively decomposes a complex series into several intrinsic mode functions imfs which is suitable for nonlinear and non stationary signal processing huang et al 1998 yeh et al 2008 proposed an improved algorithm called ceemd which adds positive and negative paired white noise to the original signal to mix problem of emd humeau heurtier et al 2015a recently ceemd has been successfully applied to analyze hydrological time series and it is an effective method to decompose non linear and non stationary series however ceemd has very strict requirements on the number of decomposition iterations and auxiliary white noise improper selection will not only produces false components but also makes imf residual auxiliary noise from normal decomposition which will affect the final feature extraction accuracy therefore in order to reasonably select the number of decomposition iterations and effectively reduce the auxiliary white noise this paper adds mpe to optimize the detection based on the combination of multiple decomposition of emd and ceemd series in order to achieve a reasonable selection of sequences over the past few decades scholars have successfully developed numerous hydrological forecasting models the models used in runoff prediction can be divided in two categories physical based models and data based models zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2021 physical based models mainly simulate or reflect the mechanism of rainfall runoff process xu et al 2013 however the physical based hydrological model requires multiple sources such as soil underlying surface solar radiation etc therefore the parameters are difficult to determine and optimize thus the lack of data will limit its predictive ability to a large extent yang et al 2017 data driven models are constructed without considering the internal physical mechanisms of the hydrological process huang et al 2019 among them machine learning is one of the most commonly used methods to explore the digital connections between input and target data at the same time with the vigorous development of computer science and algorithms artificial intelligence has received great attention from scholars in the field of hydrology thus many data based methods such as auto regressive integrated moving average model arima artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and deep learning have been employed in monthly hydrological runoff forecasting he et al 2019 fan et al 2018 lenin et al 2020 wang et al 2019 as one of the most important data based models ann method has been widely used in the hydrological forecasting due to its strong self adaptation and self study ability feng et al 2020 wang et al 2015b xie et al 2018 wang et al 2015a and ren et al 2016 combined the ann models with integrated empirical mode decomposition to predict mid and long term runoff time series tayyab et al 2019 merged anns with discrete wavelet transform dwt to establish a rainfall runoff model in jinsha river basin however the ann method was trained by the conventional gradient based algorithms it suffers from the disadvantage of slow convergence and the local minimum value and overfitting limitations taormina and chau 2015 wen et al 2018 lin et al 2006 proposed svm as a promising hydrological prediction model which was verified by long term observation of monthly flow of manwan hydropower station however the svm model requires to carefully select the kernel function which further increases the prediction steps feizizadeh et al 2017 to overcome these disadvantages a deep neural network is developed to focus on the processing time sequences data and selectively handling the information it is a typical representative of data based prediction models deep learning combines low level features by training neural networks to form more abstract high level attribute categories or features so as to explore the distributed feature representation of data and achieve a deep understanding of data van et al 2020 the advantages of deep learning in preliminary feature learning and long sequence processing makes up for the shortcomings of the existing medium term and long term runoff prediction methods gru is a special type of recurrent neural networks it is evolved from lstm long short term memory network which overcomes the gradients disappearance issue of the traditional recurrent neural network while learning the long term dependencies it is suitable for simulating the correlation of time series data at the same time it requires less calculation than lstm cells and has higher training efficiency alex and j√ºrgen 2005 zhang et al 2018 which better solves the problem of long term correlation of time series although gru is able to predict the majority of the hydrological time series it is difficult to obtain satisfactory predictions effect for strong non linear and volatility time series liu et al 2019 therefore the ceemd mpe emd gru model is introduced and the hydrological and meteorological elements in the time series are optimized as the input items of the model on the basis of fully decomposing and identifying the unstable pseudo components a large number of steps caused by the redundant information of the prediction model are overcome and the accuracy of nonlinear and non stationary flow simulation is effectively improved which provides reliable information support for water use planning in an oasis irrigation area the specific objectives are 1 optimize the hydrometeorological elements in time series as the input items 2 establish a hybrid approach integrating ceemd mpe emd and gru for monthly runoff prediction 3 verify the advantages in prediction accuracy of the new hybrid model by quantitatively comparing with the gru and the ceemd gru models 2 studying area and dataset collected the manas river oasis irrigation area in xinjiang china is located in the alluvial plain of the manas river basin it is adjacent to the gurbantunggut desert the second largest desert in china and is the throat of china s northwest frontier the irrigation area uses surface water as the main irrigation method which is a typical desert oasis water diversion agricultural irrigation area accounting for 93 of the total water consumption the irrigation water mainly comes from manas river runoff and groundwater manas river oasis irrigation area is an important agricultural production area including shihezi irrigation area xiayedi irrigation area and mosuowan irrigation area in 2015 the total cultivated land area is about 25 13 104 hkm2 the development and utilization of water resources in the irrigation area is relatively high ling et al 2013 therefore this area is also one of the areas with rapid economic development in the northern slope of the tianshan mountains and even northwest china it is a crucial cultural and economic core area in xinjiang the manas river where the irrigation area is located is the largest snow melt river which originates from the northern slope of the tianshan mountain in china the kenswat hydrological station in the study area controls a watershed area of 4637 km2 fig 1 at an altitude of above 3600 m it is covered with snow all the year round there are glaciers with an area of 608 25 km2 which is the main source of supply for various rivers the annual average runoff is 12 21 108 m3 at the kenswat hydrological station the study area has a typical temperate continental climate with average annual temperature of 5 9 the annual average rainfall of 338 2 mm and the average annual evaporation of 1550 6 mm he et al 2021 in this paper the measured monthly scale data of runoff precipitation and temperature from the kenswat hydrometric station over the period 1956 2014 were used runoff was used as the prediction target and rainfall evaporation and previous runoff were used as inputs to the model due to the increasing influence of atmospheric circulation anomalies on runoff especially nino3 4 arctic oscillation ao and pacific decadal oscillation pdo had a strong correlation with runoff in the manas river basin at the same time the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo had a significant impact on the climate of the asian monsoon region therefore in order to obtain higher runoff prediction accuracy rich input factors are also one of the key approaches in this paper the monthly scale data of the above four atmospheric circulation factors are selected as input items to increase the data from january 1956 to december 2010 were used for model training and the data from january 2010 to december 2014 were used for model verification the hydrological data comes from the hydrological bureau of shihezi city xinjiang china and the atmospheric circulation anomaly factor data comes from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov 3 methods and overall concepts 3 1 empirical mode decomposition emd emd decomposes the signal into multiple imfs in physically meaning according to specific conditions huang et al 1998 the calculation steps are as follows 1 determine all local extrema of the original sequence x t and use the cubic spline interpolation function to fit the upper envelope x max t and the lower envelope x min t 2 calculate the mean of the envelopes by m t x max t x min t 2 3 obtain the detail h t x t m t 4 check the details of h t if h t is an imfs then repeat above steps with residual r t x t h t replacing x t otherwise h t instead of x t to continue above steps 5 repeat the above steps to decompose all the intrinsic modal functions until the monotonic residual term appears 3 2 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd eemd is a noise assisted time frequency analysis method which effectively suppress the modal aliasing of emd method according to the characteristics of frequency average distribution of gaussian white noise with the addition of white gaussian noise the signal has continuity on different scales which can reduce the degree of modal aliasing tan et al 2018 the calculation steps are as follows 1 add m white noise signals with an average value of 0 and the same standard deviation to the original sequence x t 2 perform emd decomposition on the target signal to obtain m groups of imf components and m groups of margins 3 repeat steps 1 2 calculate the average value of m groups of imf components and the average value r of the margin 3 3 complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd ceemd is an improved algorithm based on eemd yeh et al 2008 made further improvements to eemd by adding random gaussian white noise to the original signal in positive and negative pairs humeau heurtier et al 2015a this can eliminate the residual auxiliary noise effectively in the reconstructed signal as indicated by experience while making the final decomposition more complete the steps for ceemd decomposition are as follows 1 by adding pairs of positive and negative gaussian white noise to the original signal the signal set is denoted by 1 m 1 m 2 1 1 1 1 s n where s is the original signal n is the gaussian white noise and m 1 m 2 are the sum of original signals with the positive and negative gaussian white noise respectively 2 emd decomposition is performed on the target signal and each signal obtains a set of imf components in which the i th component of the j th imf is expressed as imf ij 3 obtain the results of each imf after averaging the overall ensemble which can be formulated by 2 i m f j 1 2 n i 1 2 n i m f i j hence the final decomposition result x t of ceemd can be denoted as 3 x t j 1 k i m f j t r e s 3 4 multi scale permutation entropy mpe mpe is a method to detect the random and dynamic mutation of signals yin and shang 2014 it calculates the permutation entropy by coarse grained time series specific steps are as follows 1 suppose the time series x x 1 x 2 x l is processed by multi scale coarsening 4 y j 2 1 s i j 1 s 1 j s x i 1 j l where s is the scale factor y j s is a multi scale time series when the scale factor s is 1 its time series y j 1 is the original time series and the calculation result is the permutation entropy 2 to reconstruct the time series y j s 5 y t s y t s y t œÑ 2 y t m 1 œÑ 2 where œÑ is the time delay m is the embedding dimension 3 the sequence of time reconstruction y t s is arranged in ascending order there are m kinds of permutations in the sequence the number of occurrences of each permutation type is n l and the corresponding probability of occurrence is p l s 6 y t j 1 1 œÑ 2 y t j 2 1 œÑ s y t j m 1 œÑ s 7 p p s n l n s m 1 4 calculate the permutation entropy of time series signal y t s when the scale factor is s 8 h p s l 1 m p l s ln p l s 5 normalize the permutation entropy of the time series at scale s to get the normalized multi scale permutation entropy 9 h p s h p s ln m 3 5 gated recurrent unit neural network gru gru neural network is an improved model based on lstm neural network alex and j√ºrgen 2005 zhang et al 2018 lstm neural network proposes forget gates input gates and output gates the gur removes or enhances the input information into the neural unit cells to control the cell state the gru neural network merges the forget gate and input gate in lstm into an update gate which merges and improves the cell state the gru network has fast convergence speed and is not prone to gradient disappearance the gating unit adjusts the input of the activation function in real time through bias and related parameters so as to control the opening and closing of the door saving and updating useful information since there is one less gate than the lstm network when the number of training samples is large it will reduce the overall prediction time without significantly reducing the prediction effect the neural network structure of the internal structure of a gru unit is shown in fig 2 at time t the update gate z t defines the proportion of the previous memory save to the current state in fig 1 the input of the gru unit includes the hidden layer state variable of the previous time h t 1 and the input information at the current time x t then the model uses reset gate r t and update gate z t in turn to calculate the hidden layer state variable h t finally h t will be used as the unit s calculation result at time t and passed to the next time for calculation the larger the threshold value of update gate the more state information will be brought at the previous time which is helpful to capture the long term dependence of time series the smaller the threshold of the reset gate the more information is ignored which is helpful to capture the short term dependencies in the timing sequence the update formula of the weight parameter of the network forward propagation is as follows 10 z t œÉ w z h t 1 x t 11 r t œÉ w r h t 1 x t 12 h t tan h w r t h t 1 x t 13 h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where z t and r t are the reset gate and the update gate respectively x t is the input at time t h t 1 is the hidden state input at t 1 h t is the candidate hidden state and w z represents the weight of the update gate œÉ represents the sigmoid function 3 6 overall procedure of the hybrid ceemd mpe emd gru model to improve the accuracy of monthly runoff prediction we proposed a neoteric hybrid ceemd mpe emd gru model by integrating the advantages of the models above the overall procedure of the proposed model is shown in fig 3 based on the decomposition of emd and ceemd series the model adds mpe optimization detection so as to use gru to complete runoff prediction it not only fully decomposes and identifies unstable pseudo components but also successfully overcomes the large number of steps brought by redundant information of the prediction model 1 input factor optimization in this study the lag characteristics of the factors causing runoff generation are fully considered and the model input items are optimized based on pearson s correlation coefficient analyze and select the reasonable factors by calculating the correlation at different lag times between the runoff and the anomaly factors such as the previous runoff precipitation temperature and atmospheric circulation 2 decomposition ceemd is utilized to decompose the original runoff sequence into sub sequences of different frequencies 3 secondary decomposition of pseudo components among the components obtained by decomposition in step 1 mpe is used to extract unstable pseudo components perform secondary decomposition based on emd to obtain the final sub sequence based on the secondary decomposition of emd this state can effectively avoid modal mixing so as to achieve the optimal decomposition state of the hydrological time series thereby obtaining the final sub sequence 4 prediction the sub series normalized to 0 1 can be divided into a training set and a testing set through learning the training set of each sub sequence using trial and error method to determine the best hyper parameters of the gru model the trained gru model is used to predict each sub sequence and the cumulative sum of each sub sequence is the final prediction result the gru model efficiently models training time and captures nonlinear patterns hidden in monthly runoff 3 7 evaluation index in order to objectively evaluate the accuracy of the model nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse mean absolute relative error mare and the determination coefficient r2 are used as performance metrics to estimate the forecast accuracy the larger the nse and r2 the better the fitting effect and the maximum value is 1 the value range of rmse and mae is 0 and the smaller the value the better the model effect these four performances metrics are defined as follows 14 n s e 1 i 1 n q 0 i q f i 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 2 15 r 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 q f i q f 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 2 i 1 n q f i q f 2 16 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q f i q 0 i 2 17 m a r e 1 n i 1 n q f i q 0 i q 0 i 100 where n denotes the number of test samples for the prediction model q 0 i represents the actual value of the monthly runoff series q f i represents the corresponding forecast value q 0 is the average values of the actual value and q f is the average values of the forecast value 4 results and discussion 4 1 determining forecasting factors generally the set of input variables directly affects the final prediction results therefore it is necessary to fully consider the timeliness of influencing factors to improve the accuracy of the model runoff generation and sinkflow are two important processes for the generation of runoff but in this process precipitation temperature and atmospheric circulation factors have a certain time lag effect on runoff due to the influence of distance topography and underlying surface and different factors have different effects on runoff due to the hysteresis effect of hydrometeorological factors such as precipitation runoff and temperature on runoff the factors affecting runoff are different in order to reduce the influence of time lag effect this study optimizes the input items of the model based on the correlation coefficient for the lag time of different months the pearson correlation coefficient analysis method is used to select reasonable input items and the results are shown in fig 4 through the calculation of the correlation between each factor and the target factor under different delay times the analysis and selection of reasonable factors are crucial to the prediction of runoff the input items of runoff prediction model require highly informative and strongly correlated factors it can be found from the figure that since pdo and ao have no correlation with runoff these factors cannot work together with other factors to affect runoff and the result may reduce the prediction accuracy so they are excluded liu et al 2021 therefore the pre runoff lag time of 12 months the rainfall lag time of 2 months the amo lag time of 12 months and the nimo3 4 lag time of 2 months are selected as the optimal factors for model input 4 2 runoff time series decomposition the runoff time series of kenswat hydrological station from january 2010 to december 2014 are decomposed into different frequency sub sequences by ceemd by calculating the relative error of each sequence and analyzing the contribution rate of each sub sequence to the runoff sequence the results show that the relative error of the sub sequence is the relative error affecting the runoff since the high frequency components have the characteristics of modal confusion and non stationarity mpe is used to detect whether the high frequency components are abnormal signals after repeated tests when the noise logarithm is 30 the noise amplitude is 0 2 the maximum decomposition is 6 the pe threshold is 0 45 and the time delay is 1 the decomposition effect of the runoff series is the best it can be seen from the decomposition results in fig 5 that the runoff time series can be decomposed into 6 natural mode components and 1 trend term from high frequency to low frequency the original signal can be obtained by adding cimfs and trend r between both of them the cimf1 and cimf2 components have the lowest stationarity which is characterized by greater volatility and higher frequency the amplitude and frequency of cimf3 cimf6 components decrease sequentially through the pre treatment of decomposition technology the variation range of each component is significantly lower than the original sequence which significantly reduces the fluctuation and trend of the original sequence and effectively overcome modal aliasing white noise interference however due to the characteristics of extreme non stationarity and randomness of individual components and its greater complexity mohammad et al 2019 the mpe method is used to study separately based on the decomposition results of ceemd mpe is used to identify the complexity of runoff time series components due to the high frequency components have the characteristics of modal confusion and instability mpe is used to detect whether their components are abnormal signals after repeated trial calculations it is the most suitable condition when the embedding dimension is 7 the scale factor is 2 the delay factor is 1 and the threshold is 4 5 if the mpe value of the component is greater than the threshold value Œ∏ 0 4 5 it is determined that the component is a pseudo component otherwise it is an almost static component it can be seen from fig 6 that the permutation entropy values of the runoff sequence components cimf1 and cimf2 decomposed by ceemd are significantly higher than the other components greater than the threshold 0 45 the permutation entropy of the cimf2 r component gradually decreased and the permutation entropy of the cr component is 0 11 cimf1 and cimf2 have the highest complexity and the most difficult to predict this is consistent with the feature that the cimf1 component fluctuates greatly when zhang et al 2021 uses ceemd to decompose time series the results show that the frequency of imf1 in the runoff sequence is significantly higher than the other components which is the high frequency component the complexity of cimf2 cimf4 is the second which is the intermediate frequency component the complexity of cimf5 cr is the lowest which is the low frequency component it is confirmed that the decomposition can provide stationarity for model prediction thereby improving the predictability of the series wu et al 2019 to avoid an infinite decomposition cycle the cimf1 and cimf2 sequences are superimposed as a pseudo component and decomposed twice by emd decomposition method the decomposition result of the pseudo component is shown in fig 7a it can be seen from fig 7b that the mpe values of the components after re decomposition are all less than the threshold value of 4 5 which can be judged as a stationary signal the average mpe value of the pseudo component after decomposition is 0 25 which is 50 less than the average mpe of cimf1 and cimf2 to reduce the instability and nonlinearity of high frequency components and improve the predictability of high frequency components therefore the ceemd mpe emd decomposition method can well overcome the occurrence of modal aliasing and make the time series more fully decomposed 4 3 comparison between gru ceemd gru and ceemd map emd gru the optimal predictors at different time lags are used as model inputs items the trained gru model is used to predict each sub sequence and the ensemble forecasting result is generated by adding all the prediction results of each sub sequence construct a combined model of ceemd mpe emd gru to test the effectiveness of pseudo component processing based on multi scale permutation entropy in the model the r2 nse mape rmse and mpe are used to evaluate the performance of the prediction accuracy the single gru model and ceemd gru are comparative forecast models for predicting the monthly runoff using the same dataset the evaluation indicators of the three models are presented in table 1 it can be seen from table 1 that the nse and r2 of the three models are all greater than 0 8 it can be known from the principle of the model that the gru model has advantages in dealing with long term sequences through a unique gate structure design it greatly retains the integrity of hydrometeorological elements and has a strong generalization ability gao et al 2020 the hybrid ceemd map emd gru model has the best performance with the largest r2 and nse and the lowest mare and rmse the quantitative evaluation indicators of the three models show that the predictive performance of a single gru model is lower than the remaining two combined models compared with the results of the gru model the nse value of the hybrid ceemd map emd gru model increased by 18 1 r2 increased by 18 4 mare decreased by 39 3 and rmse decreased by 60 2 the performance of the ceemd gru model is better than that of the gru model but the performance of the ceemd map emd gru model is better than that of the gru model research shows that the ceemd decomposition method based on permutation entropy can effectively filter out the noise of the original runoff sequence the combined model has better non linear processing capabilities and improves the stability and predictability of the runoff sequence in terms of quantitative assessment the forecasting performances of the three models fall in the order of ceemd map emd gru ceemd gru gru in order to effectively compare the performance of the models we analyzed the combined models an et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 gao et al 2020 feng et al 2021 found that non stationary time series decomposition is essential in many combination prediction models but in the research workers often ignore the decomposition pseudo components that does not satisfy the stability and do not conduct in depth research and processing so it often causes a large error in single subsequence prediction at the same time for the selection of prediction model the optimized gur model bid farewell to the time step problem of ann svm etc in the case of the same performance as the lstm model the gru model has fewer parameters and less complex structure the reference of atmospheric factors in the ceemd map emd gru model is also one of the reasons for the significant improvement of model prediction accuracy this is because researchers have paid more attention to the relationship between runoff and rainfall in the past fig 8 displays the forecasting results and scatter plots respectively generated by the ceemd map emd gru ceemd gru and gru models during the validation period for one thing in accordance with both the general tendency and forecasting capacities of the peak runoff the proposed ceemd map emd gru model exhibits the most accurate performance compared to the other models for another it can be seen from the scatter points that the ceemd map emd gru scatter plot clustering is the closest to the ideal fitting and has the highest accuracy the gru results generally follow the runoff trend but weaken the forecasting ability for observed peak runoff at the same time the results from the ceemd gru model perform a reasonable fit with observed changes in runoff in conclusion the extreme values of all models in comparative trend research are relatively poor the analysis may be due to the increasing impact of human activities climate change and other factors on runoff chen et al 2015 leading to increased uncertainty and further increasing the difficulty of forecasting the gru results generally follow the runoff trend but weaken the forecasting ability for observed peak runoff at the same time the results from the ceemd gru model perform a reasonable fit with observed changes in runoff in conclusion the extreme values of all models in comparative trend research are relatively poor the analysis may be due to the increasing impact of human activities climate change and other factors on runoff chen et al 2015 leading to increased uncertainty and further increasing the difficulty of forecasting in addition we further discuss the reasons why ceemd map emd gru is better than ceemd gru the metric performances of each component in calibration validation ceemd map emd gru and ceemd gru models are listed in tables 2 3 respectively it can be seen from table 2 that the nse and r2 of each component perform relatively well the relative percentage errors of cimf1 and cimf2 are 335 4 and 43 8 respectively the rmse of cimf1 and cimf2 are about 0 3 which is larger than the others the component error indicates that the overall error is mainly concentrated in the two components of cimf1 and cimf2 for cimf3 6 and the trend item cr rmse is lower than 0 03 which is significantly smaller than cimf1 and cimf2 due to the extreme irregularity of the high frequency components the accuracy of the prediction results is poor rezaei et al 2020 wu et al 2019 it can be seen that cimf1 and cimf2 contribute a lot to the error of the ceemd gru model and the ceemd gru model does not perform well in retaining high frequency information and accumulating the generated sequence to further reduce the prediction error of false components the components are judged by permutation entropy and the poorly simulated false components cimf1 and cimf2 are decomposed again using emd the specific evaluation results are shown in table 3 the prediction effect after decomposition based on permutation entropy is better than that after ceemd decomposition after the second decomposition the mare and rmse values are greatly reduced among them the permutation entropy of eimf2 with the highest complexity in eimf is 16 98 and 8 33 lower than cimf1 and cimf2 respectively which reduces the complexity to a certain extent and obtains better fitting results manas river basin is a typical arid and semi arid region in china its oasis development model is representative with water resources utilization as the core issue feng et al 2011 sensitive ecological zones of irrigated agriculture and climatic drought are widespread in the basin ling et al 2011 with the increasing area of oasis irrigation in recent years the area has increased by 129 56 in the past 40 years 98 of surface water has been used and 58 of groundwater has been developed ling et al 2010 due to the limitation of the total amount of water resources the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources in the basin will become increasingly tense the manas river green irrigation area starts from water storage and diversion irrigation in march to the end of the irrigation period in september when considering the inflow situation the guarantee rates of dry and normal years are generally selected to be 50 and 75 respectively to plan the balance of irrigation and demand in the current year therefore the high standard water use plan makes runoff prediction particularly important previous studies have shown that there is a significant nonlinear correlation between runoff and temperature runoff and precipitation in the manas river basin ling et al 2011 on the basis of fully exploring the actual situation of the irrigation area the secondary decomposition has a significant effect on improving the accuracy of runoff series prediction combining the advantages of ceemd and mpe ali et al 2020 humeau heurtier et al 2015b the pseudo component is decomposed twice to reduce the complexity of high frequency components and make them more stable to a certain extent the prediction accuracy of the sub sequence is optimized to capture the potential characteristics of runoff more deeply the combination method can provide ideas for runoff time series prediction under changing environment and play a very supportive role for rational allocation of water resources in irrigated areas 5 conclusions in order to improve the accuracy of nonlinear and non stationary flow simulation this study proposes a new monthly runoff prediction method ceemd mpe emd gru then the method is applied to runoff time series of manas river this study draws the following conclusions 1 the prediction accuracy of the combined model based on decomposition is better than that of a single model and the decomposition prediction reconstruction method is suitable for non stationary time series with obvious trend changes 2 the ceemd mpe emd gru model has a good effect on the overall trend and extreme value prediction and has good generalization ability the combined method overcomes the shortcomings of a single gru model in strong non linear and fluctuating multi frequency sequence simulation 3 the quadratic decomposition can reduce the complexity of runoff series and better captures the internal characteristics of the cycle and trend of the runoff series thereby optimizing the prediction and fitting effects compared with the traditional method of direct runoff series prediction and the single decomposition model prediction the prediction accuracy of the hybrid model based on quadratic decomposition is improved by 15 3 and 7 4 respectively the proposed combined ceemd mpe emd gru prediction model has convenient and efficient ability in modeling time series data it can also be applied to other fields such as weather flood traffic etc at the same time combined with various data analysis methods it can not only improve the prediction accuracy of the corresponding fields but also achieve multidisciplinary intersection which plays a positive role in promoting the development of the prediction model for the prediction of the model the selection of parameters is crucial and the selection of internal parameters of the model is based on the comparison of effects which makes the determination of parameters with great uncertainty therefore the optimization algorithm of model parameters should be further improved at the same time due to the increasing influence of human activities on runoff in recent years it is the focus of our future research to consider integrating human activities and physical factors deeply capture the potential law of runoff and improve the combination prediction theory

9066,orchards consist of complex agricultural systems with a variety of characteristics planting density tree height training system canopy cover irrigation method interrow management influencing crop evapotranspiration etc thus irrigation water management requires finding crop coefficients kc that represent the characteristics of local orchards evidencing the need for site specific data the main objective of this study was to derive the kc of almond olive citrus and pomegranate orchards in alentejo southern portugal wherein they became dominant over the last decade monitoring was carried out in nine orchards which management decisions were performed by the farmers the etc was estimated from the soil water balance computed for each orchard using the fao56 dual kc approach with the simdualkc model the model successfully simulated the soil water contents measured in the various fields along two growing seasons with root mean square error values lower than 0 005 m3 m 3 and modeling efficiencies from 0 363 to 0 782 the estimated basal crop coefficients kcb for the initial mid and end seasons were respectively 0 22 0 58 and 0 50 for almond 0 32 0 33 0 35 0 36 and 0 33 0 34 for olive 0 40 0 40 41 and 0 40 0 41 for citrus and 0 24 0 60 and 0 52 for pomegranate small variations in olive and citrus kcb values were found to be related to differences in the fraction of the ground covered by trees canopies and tree height the single kc values which included the component relative to soil evaporation were also estimated furthermore evaluation of the soil water balance in the nine case studies showed salinity effects in one almond orchard mild irrigation water deficits in olive systems and large non consumptive water use in citrus and pomegranate orchards these results evidence the need for better management of orchards irrigation water in the region and the current study provides for reliable information on the kc of tree crops to support improving the management of local orchard systems and the preservation of soil and water resources aimed at these resources and the sustainability of their use simulated alternative irrigation schedules were performed which identified possible water savings of 20 mm in case of olives up to 855 mm for citrus keywords crop coefficients crop evapotranspiration dual kc approach orchards almond olive citrus and pomegranate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the expansion of the irrigated area over the past century has provided the means for agricultural production in regions of the world where scarcity prevails in these regions mostly afflicted by arid semi arid and dry sub humid climates irrigation is fundamental to fulfill crop water requirements diversify crop production increase food production meet the growing food demand ensure food stability and increase the prosperity of rural areas pereira et al 2009 this most times comes with costs to the environment as the pressure on freshwater resources builds up irrigation is today responsible for 70 of all freshwater withdrawals in the world and 90 in the least developed regions unesco 2020 irrigation is also considered a key source of land degradation namely by contributing to the contamination or depletion of water resources promotion of soil erosion and soil salinization being also associated with biodiversity loss climate change only further exacerbates the scarcity issue and future uncertainty mitigating the environmental problems referred to above as well as climate uncertainty can only be achieved by improving agricultural water management namely water use and performance of irrigation systems pereira et al 2002 jovanovic et al 2020 this requires an accurate estimate of crop water requirements and irrigation schedules irrigation timing duration and quantity namely by following the fao56 method allen et al 1998 widely used this method estimates crop evapotranspiration etc as the product of a crop coefficient kc and the grass reference evapotranspiration eto the latter being calculated with the fao penman monteith fao pm equation allen et al 1998 kc values are defined for each crop stage by using the single crop coefficient approach which assumes a single value for including both the soil evaporation and crop transpiration processes or the dual crop coefficient approach kc kcb ke which separately considers the basal transpiration coefficient kcb and the soil evaporation coefficient ke the methodology is straightforward with standard kc and kcb values available for most field and vegetable crops pereira et al 2021a 2021b for trees and vines rallo et al 2021 also provided standard kc values for the most common agricultural species and management options however the complexity of orchard systems is great because surfaces are heterogenous and the soil is incompletely covered and differences in the planting density canopy height training system interrow management and irrigation method influence the amount of energy available for both the transpiration and soil evaporation processes it results that the collected literature information may be rather insufficient for selecting from the reported kc and kcb values for those to be efficiently used in irrigation water management rallo et al 2021 pereira et al 2020a volschenk 2020 fereres et al 2012 that knowledge gap is particularly relevant for the alentejo region of southern portugal where orchards systems have become dominant over the last decade the implementation of the alqueva project in 2002 which progressively added 120 000 ha of newly irrigated land to the already existing 35 000 ha included in different collective systems provided conditions for the fast expansion of olive orchards and other perennial crops ramos et al 2019 olive 87 500 ha and other orchards 22 000 ha dgadr 2021 from which almond stands out now extend throughout the landscape replacing the traditional crops mainly irrigated and rainfed cereals in the alqueva irrigation district alone olives and almonds cover today 56 7 and 21 3 of the equipped area respectively edia 2022 these orchards mostly consist of high 300 trees ha 1 and very high density 1500 trees ha 1 orchard systems which require high to very high input factors pa√ßo et al 2019 the abrupt landscape change has naturally raised doubts about the sustainability of the new production systems with local populations often raising concerns about respective environmental impacts as often reported by the traditional and social media expresso 2018 dinheiro vivo 2021 publico 2021 this social unrest is per se pressing on the viability of those systems resulting in the need for a throughout and clear quantification of the main environmental risks associated with the new cropping reality in the alentejo region while some studies already exist to address improved crop water use pa√ßo et al 2019 2014 santos 2018 concei√ß√£o et al 2017 and decrease soil salinization risks ramos et al 2019 and non point source pollution due to fertigation practices cameira et al 2014 these studies imply further assessing crop water use to better control environmental impacts meanwhile studies are limited to olive and are insufficient to provide guidelines for improving irrigation and fertigation practices to local farmers the current study follows the need to increase knowledge on the water use and environmental impacts of the new orchard systems dominating the landscape in the alentejo region southern portugal the first part of the study aims to assess local irrigation practices through the accurate estimate of evapotranspiration and crop coefficients in different orchards systems the selected tool was the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 which adopts the fao 56 dual kc approach for computing etc fluxes when partitioning into crop transpiration and soil evaporation a review on water balance models justifies that option pereira et al 2020b the reasons for choosing this model further lay on i the acknowledged more accurate estimates of the evapotranspiration processes provided by the fao 56 dual kc approach as compared to other methods pereira et al 2015a kool et al 2014 l√≥pez urrea et al 2009 ii the adequacy in adopting the estimated potential transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes thus defining atmospheric boundary conditions in mechanistic vadose zone modeling aimed at evaluating soil salinization and fertigation risks chen et al 2022 phogat et al 2017 gonz√°lez et al 2015 ramos et al 2012 minhas et al 2020 and iii the extensive testing already performed with the simdualkc model in orchards grown under diverse management options and climate conditions namely for olive puig sirera et al 2021 pa√ßo et al 2019 2014 peach pa√ßo et al 2012 grapevine darouich et al 2022a silva et al 2021 cancela et al 2015 fandi√±o et al 2012 and citrus darouich et al 2022b the objectives of this study therefore consist of i to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model in various almond olive citrus orange clementine and mandarin and pomegranate orchards of alentejo using field data of the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons ii with support by the model to derive the kc and kcb standard and actual crop coefficients for those crops using the dual kc approach iii to evaluate the components of the soil water balance from a water saving perspective and iv using the model to develop alternative water saving irrigation schedules and management issues results of this study will also be used as input to mechanistic models aimed at predicting soil salinization and crop fertigation risks which assessment shall be the object of companion papers to be published later as such this study aims to contribute to improve irrigation water use in the alentejo region considering the sustainability and response to climate change of local production systems a few novelties must be referred the adoption of a dual kc model to assess the irrigation and related water balance of six different crops and nine fields the gain of further data on standard basal crop coefficients for mediterranean tree crops which is still very limited the use for the first time of a dual kc model for almond mandarin and pomegranate orchards and not limiting the assessment to discussions on possible issues but proposing quantified predictions of water saving for all nine plots through model simulations considering mild deficit irrigation for the crop stages when the crop and yields are not affected 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area this study was conducted in the roxo irrigation district rid montes velhos aljustrel portugal from january 1st 2019 to december 31st 2020 the rid is a collective system with 5041 ha built during stage i of the irrigation plan for alentejo in 1968 since 2016 the rid is connected to the alqueva system which provides an extra water supply during drier seasons the climate in the region is semi arid the mean annual air temperature is 16 3¬∫c ranging from a minimum of 9 8¬∫c in january to a maximum of 23 1¬∫c in august the mean annual precipitation is 454 mm which occurs mostly between october and may the mean annual reference evapotranspiration eto computed with the fao pm equation allen et al 1998 is 1363 mm for the period 1979 2020 hersbach et al 2018 the main soil units are classified as luvisols 40 fluvisols and regosols 20 gleysols and planosols 20 and vertisols 10 iuss working group wrb 2014 soil salinization problems have long been reported in the region alexandre et al 2018 martins et al 2005 resulting from the use of poor quality soil drainage and irrigation water prior to the connection of the rid to the alqueva system salinization may have also been aggravated due to less percolating water resulting from a decreasing precipitation trend as reported by portela et al 2020 in 2019 the dominant land uses were rainfed cereals 46 sunflower 14 olive 21 almond 5 and maize 4 this distribution was explained by drought conditions which limited irrigation in that season nonetheless olive and almond areas have been expanding despite drought conditions observed over the last decade drip is the most common irrigation method but sprinkler and surface methods are also used the latter in farms of smaller dimensions the groundwater table depth averaged 5 5 m with maximum and minimum depths of 7 6 and 4 2 m respectively snirh 2022 2 2 experimental plots and measurements irrigation practices were monitored in nine commercial orchards located in the rid fig 1 the selected crops were almond prunus amygdalus batsch olive olea europaea l citrus citrus spp and pomegranate punica granatum l covering the most representative perennials grown in the region table 1 presents the main characteristics of the selected orchards including location plant variety crop density and age training system and soil type in five locations orchards were on ridges mostly trapezoidal shaped with 0 25 0 70 m height and 1 2 1 6 m wide at the top and 2 3 2 8 m wide at the bottom table 2 gives the main physical and chemical properties of soils in the nine study sites the soil classification follows the iuss working group 2014 the particle size distribution was determined following the international soil science society isss particle limits atterberg scale with particles of diameter 0 002 mm clay and 0 02 0 002 mm silt obtained using the pipette method and particles 0 2 0 02 mm fine sand and 2 0 2 mm coarse sand obtained through sieving the organic matter om content was estimated from the organic carbon oc content determined by the walkley black method using the relation om 1 724 oc nelson and sommers 1982 dry bulk density œÅb was determined by drying volumetric soil samples 100 cm3 at 105¬∫c for 48 h soil hydraulic properties were measured also in 100 cm3 undisturbed soil cores the soil water content at saturation Œ∏s was determined from the maximum holding capacity of the soil cores on a volumetric basis the soil water content at field capacity Œ∏fc was measured using suction tables at 10 kpa matric potential romano et al 2002 the soil water content at the wilting point Œ∏wp was measured with a pressure plate extractor at 1500 kpa matric potential dane and hopmans 2002 measured depths were assumed representative of the entire root zone layer including with ridges the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece was determined potentiometrically meteorological data for the

variability for most variables except for rainfall at every site drip irrigation systems were used with management practices performed according to standard practices in the region and decided by farmers i e applying daily small irrigation depths drippers were spaced 0 7 1 0 m apart placed under tree canopies in a single line in almond and olive plots and two lines in citrus and pomegranate plots table 3 shows the main characteristics of irrigation events namely initiation and end dates depths per event the fraction of the soil surface wetted by irrigation fw and the total seasonal application depths irrigation depths per irrigation event averaged between 2 7 p6 and 7 4 mm p8 the season irrigation depths per cropped fields averaged 658 mm in almond 320 mm in olive 830 mm in citrus and 791 mm in pomegranate depths were monitored using a flowmeter inserted in the drip lines irrigation was carried out nearly every day during the summer dry season and less frequently during spring and autumn soil water contents were continuously monitored at depths of 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 m using enviropro mt capacitance probes mait industries australia probes were installed in the crop rows with varying distances from emitters but always less than 0 3 m fig 3 presents as an example the monitoring area in p1 showing the relative positions of the almond trees the emitters and the soil water monitoring points soil moisture data were subjected to calibration by comparing measured values with gravimetric soil water contents measured in disturbed soil samples taken periodically from each plot and multiplied by the respective œÅb values the soil water retention data determined in the laboratory was also considered in the calibration process the continuous readings of soil water contents measured at different depths were then averaged for a daily value representing the entire soil profile ece was periodically measured in each field by collecting disturbed soil samples below emitters using an auger the monitored layer depths were 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 0 8 m but reaching the deeper depths depended on the stoniness of soils of each plot and of soil moisture at sampling measured ece values were then averaged to get representative values of the rootzone salinity in the different fields the electrical conductivity of irrigation water eciw was periodically monitored in the rid irrigation channel with values averaging 0 72 ds m 1 this value contrasts with the previous range of eciw values from 1 05 to 1 67 ds m 1 measured in the rdi channels between 2003 and 2006 martins et al 2005 before the rdi was connected to alqueva the crops were monitored for the crop stage dates crop height h the fraction of the ground covered by the canopies fc active root depth zr and interrow management the dates of crop stages and respective growing degree days gdd are given in table 4 the dates of crop stages approach those reported in the literature for almond bellvert et al 2018 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 espadafor et al 2015 olive garrido et al 2021 2020 pa√ßo et al 2019 sanz cort√©s et al 2002 citrus darouich et al 2022b garc√≠a tejero et al 2010 garc√≠a tejero et al 2011 gonz√°lez altozano and castel 2000 and pomegranate intrigliolo et al 2011 melgarejo et al 1997 grown in other locations also having a mediterranean type of climate the base temperatures considered for computing the gdd were 7 0 ¬∫c for almond egea et al 2003 degrandi hoffman et al 1996 8 8 ¬∫c for olive melo abreu et al 2004 12 8 c for citrus darouich et al 2022b luo 2011 coops et al 2001 and 10¬∫c for pomegranate melgarejo et al 1997 again in line with the respective literature tree height table 5 and mean canopy width were monitored using a tape at the beginning of the initial mid season and late season as well as the non growing season the fc values are presented in table 5 and refer to the average values observed in each crop stage since no significant differences were found between the two monitored seasons trees in plots p1 and p2 almond fields were subjected to a light pruning at the beginning of january 2020 trees in plots p3 and p4 olive fields were pruned more intensively in february 2020 zr was assessed from observations in soil profiles lastly the interrow were monitored for the periods with active groundcover and for residues mulching when those plants dried out by the early summer the density and height of the interrow plants was assessed by visual analysis and the fraction of the ground covered by those plants fc cover was defined accordingly 2 3 modeling approach 2 3 1 model description the soil water balance simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 has been extensively described in several publications namely relative to its use e g pereira et al 2015a 2020b pa√ßo et al 2019 darouich et al 2022a 2022b therefore only the main features of the modeling approach are given here the soil water balance at the field scale is performed daily as follows 1 d r i d r i 1 p ro i i i cr i dp i et c act i where dr is the root zone depletion mm given by the difference between soil water content at field capacity and actual soil moisture conditions p is the rainfall mm ro is the runoff mm i is the net irrigation depth mm cr is the capillary rise from the groundwater table mm dp is the deep percolation mm and etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm all referring to day i or i 1 in this application cr was not considered as the groundwater table was too deep 4 2 m to contribute to crop evapotranspiration following the fao56 dual kc approach allen et al 1998 2005 pereira et al 2020b the etc mm is estimated by computing the components relative to crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm separately 2 t c k s k cb et o 3 e s k e et o where kcb is the standard basal crop coefficient that refers primarily to crop transpiration although some diffusive soil evaporation may also be included particularly during the initial crop stage ke is the evaporation coefficient that describes direct evaporation from the surface soil layer of depth ze cm eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm computed with the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and ks is a multiplier stress coefficient describing the impact of water and salinity stressors on crop evapotranspiration ks 1 when no stress occurs and actual crop transpiration rates tc act mm match their potential values tc mm ks 1 and tc act tc when crops are subjected to water and or salinity stress in this application the ks was computed following pereira et al 2007 and minhas et al 2020 4 k s taw salt d r taw salt raw salt 1 b k y 100 ec e ec e threshold where tawsalt and rawsalt are the total and readily available water mm corrected for salinity relative to the root zone soil depth zr m ece threshold is the crop tolerance salinity threshold value ds m 1 where crop growth and production starts to decline b is the percentage of crop yield reduction per unit increase in ece above the ece threshold ds m 1 and ky is the yield response factor that describes the relationship between the relative yield decrease and the relative evapotranspiration deficit stewart et al 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 parameter values were updated by minhas et al 2020 the first term on the right side of the previous equation corresponds to the water matric stress when dr i rawsalt the second one is used to correct the former for the effects of salinity osmotic stress i e when ece ece threshold relative to the considered crop as follows 5 taw salt Œ∏ fc Œ∏ wp salt 1000 z r 6 raw salt p salt taw and 7 Œ∏ wp salt Œ∏ wp b 100 ec e ec e threshold 10 Œ∏ fc Œ∏ wp 8 p salt p b ec e ec e threshold p where Œ∏fc is the soil water content at the field capacity m3 m 3 Œ∏wp is the soil water content at the wilting point m3 m 3 zr is the crop root depth m and Œ∏wp salt and psalt are respectively the soil water content at the wilting point and the depletion fraction for no stress p after correction for salinity successful applications of this approach can be found in rosa et al 2016 for maize and sorghum in portugal and liu et al 2022a 2022b for maize in china soil evaporation is computed through consideration of the energy available at the soil surface and water availability in the evaporative soil layer the two stage evaporation model of ritchie 1972 is adopted with the first stage corresponding to the energy limited stage and the second to the water limited stage allen et al 1998 2005 pereira et al 2020b in this approach the ke is computed as 9 k e k r k c max k cb min f ew k c max and kr as follows 10 k r 1 for d e i 1 rew 11 k r tew d e i 1 tew rew for d e i 1 rew where kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient kc max is the maximum value of kc i e kcb ke following rain or irrigation events few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to solar radiation and wetted by rain or irrigation and which depends upon the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation near solar noon fc eff tew is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the evaporation soil layer when it has been completely wetted mm rew is the depth of water that can be easily evaporated without water availability restrictions mm and de is the evaporation layer depletion at the end of day i 1 mm the computation of de implies computing the daily soil water balance for the evaporative soil layer deep percolation dp is estimated using a time decay function relating the soil water storage near saturation with the time after the occurrence of heavy rain or irrigation liu et al 2006 12 w a a d t b d where wa is the actual soil water storage in the root zone mm ad is the soil water storage comprised between Œ∏s and Œ∏fc bd is an empirical dimensionless parameter and t is the time after irrigation or rain that produces storage above field capacity days surface runoff is estimated using the widely used curve number cn approach allen et al 2007 usda scs 1972 for tree crops and vineyards the kcb values include the characteristics of the main crop and the understory vegetation while they are obtained from model calibration the kcb values can be divided into their components as follows pereira et al 2020a 2021c allen and pereira 2009 13 k cb k cb gcover k d max k cb full k cb gcover k cb full k cb gcover 2 where kcb gcover is the kcb of the ground cover vegetation in the absence of tree foliage kcb full is the estimated basal kc during peak plant growth for conditions having nearly full ground cover and kd is the crop density coefficient the second term of the max function reduces the estimate for kcb during the mid season stage by half the difference between kcb full and kcb cover when this difference is negative this accounts for impacts of the shading of the surface cover by overstory vegetation having a kcb that is lower than that of the ground cover due to differences in stomatal conductance when no ground cover exists or when the cover crop dries out becoming a less dense residual mulch the previous equation is simplified by replacing kcb cover with the minimum kc for bare soil kc min 0 15 the kcb full is estimated primarily as a function of crop height and then adjusted for tree crops using a reduction factor fr estimated from the mean leaf stomatal resistance pereira et al 2020a the density coefficient kd is estimated from the fraction of ground cover as follows 14 k d min 1 m l f c eff f c eff 1 1 h where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation near solar noon ml is a multiplier on fc eff 1 5 2 0 describing the effect of the canopy density on shading and on maximum relative evapotranspiration per fraction of ground shaded to simulate the physical limits imposed on water flux through the plant root stem and leaf systems and h is the mean height of trees m successful applications of this approach can be found in darouich et al 2022a 2022b for grapevine and citrus and pa√ßo et al 2019 2014 for olive 2 3 2 model setup the computation of the soil water balance in each study orchard required comprehensive data on weather conditions soil properties crop phenology ground conditions active ground cover and or mulch irrigation events and performance of irrigation systems to feed the simdualkc model soil data included the particle size distribution and Œ∏fc and Œ∏wp of the different layers in each soil profile as well as the mean ece of the entire rootzone table 2 tawsalt was then computed as the sum of the product of the difference between Œ∏fc and Œ∏wp relative to the different soil layers of the rootzone of depth zr table 5 while adjusting to salinity conditions when ece ece threshold minhas et al 2020 rosa et al 2016 this adjustment was specified for the initial conditions and the dates when ece data was available from sampling then tawsalt and the corresponding rawsalt varied linearly between two successive dates depending on whether salinity levels were above crop tolerance thresholds along the growing seasons if these conditions were not observed no salinity adjustment was required the tew rew and the depth of the evaporative soil layer ze m were set up according to the textural and hydraulic properties of the surface soil layer allen et al 1998 2005 the deep percolation parameters ad and bd were defined according to soil texture and soil hydraulic properties liu et al 2006 the cn values for computing runoff were set up based on the texture of the surface soil layer soil surface conditions and land use usda scs 1972 lastly the initial soil water depletion values in both the root zone and the evaporative soil layer corresponded to field measurements table 6 crop data included the observed dates of the initial development mid season and late season stages as well as the non growing periods table 4 also included were the corresponding kcb values for the initial kcb ini mid season kcb mid end season kcb end and non growing periods kcb non growing the kcb default values were computed following pereira et al 2021c by considering the management system in each orchard and the fc and h measured in each crop stage table 5 for each management class the central fr value of the proposed range of values was selected the soil water depletion fraction values for no stress for the same crop stages pini pmid pend were set up following allen et al 1998 crop state variables such as h fc and zr were defined for each crop stage according to observations table 5 lastly the ky ece threshold and b values were taken from the literature ayers and westcot 1985 allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 for almonds the ky was 0 70 the ece threshold was 1 5 ds m 1 and b was 19 ds m 1 for olive and pomegranate the ky was 0 75 the ece threshold was 4 0 ds m 1 and b was 16 ds m 1 for citrus ky was 1 20 the ece threshold was 1 7 ds m 1 and b was 16 ds m 1 ground cover conditions were defined based on observations and included the periods with active ground cover usually during the rainy season i e from october to may and with residues mulching due to falling leaves or when the row and interrow weeds dried out in almond plots p1 and p2 the active ground cover was present only in the interrow with a density of 20 a fraction of ground cover fc cover of 0 30 and a maximum height hcover of 0 15 m in olive plots p3 and p4 the density of the active ground cover in the interrow ranged from 20 to 30 and the fc cover varied from 0 20 to 0 30 with hcover of 0 25 lower values were always observed in p3 in both fields there was only a residual presence of active ground cover along the trees row no active ground cover was observed in the p5 olive plot in citrus p6 p7 and p8 and pomegranate p9 plots the density of the active ground cover in the row and interrow varied from 20 to 50 the fc cover was from 0 20 to 0 50 and the hcover was from 0 20 m p7 to 0 50 m p9 in all fields the evaporation reduction due to the residues mulch was ranging from 40 p1 and p2 to 60 p9 the dates of irrigation events and depths applied were input according to observations the fractions of the soil surface wetted by irrigation fw were also defined according to field measurements table 3 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the simdualkc model followed the same iterative trial and error procedure described in pereira et al 2015b which consists of adjusting groups of combined model parameters one at a time and within reasonable ranges of values until deviations between model simulations and field measurements of soil water contents in the rootzone are minimized calibration was carried out for each of the studied orchards using the 2019 dataset validation was then performed using the calibrated parameters and the 2020 dataset model calibration started by first adjusting the kcb and the corresponding p values for each crop stage then the ad and bd parameters of liu et al 2006 parametric functions followed by ze tew and rew and lastly the cn value the ece threshold b and ky model parameters did not require adjustment model calibration ended when the best fit was reached i e when the errors of prediction did not change from one iteration to the next if that goal was not achieved at the end of a modification cycle the calibration process restarted again the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between observed oi and predicted pi soil water

the observed mean is a better estimator than model predictions 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization table 7 presents the calibrated model parameters relative to the nine case studies the default kcb values for the initial mid and end of season stages were set up following pereira et al 2021c by considering the characteristics that most approached crop management in each field as well as the fc and h values measured in each crop stage however as the kcb values are much dependent on observed values of fc and h pereira et al 2020a 2021c as well as on interrow management darouich et al 2022a the calibrated ones ended up varying to a greater or lesser extent from the default values in olive trees the calibrated fractions of soil water depletion for no stress p values were always below those proposed by allen et al 1998 for the different crop stages they were also lower than those in pa√ßo et al 2019 but higher than in santos 2018 in almonds only the pini and pmid values differed from allen et al 1998 larger in both cases on the other hand the calibrated p values in citrus and pomegranate orchards always matched those in allen et al 1998 the remaining calibrated parameters i e the soil evaporation parameters ze tew and rew the percolation parameters ad and bd from liu s et al 2006 parametric equations and the cn value for computing runoff were found to have values in agreement with the soil textural and the soil hydraulic characteristics of each case study field 3 2 model performance fig 4 and fig 5 show the fitting of the daily measured soil water contents swc by the simdualkc simulated values in the nine commercial orchards during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons the figures also include the depths and dates of irrigation and rainfall events the figures further reflect the diverse management applied in the monitored fields in the almond fields fig 4 the swc dynamics differed between sites with swc in p1 dropping below Œ∏p in both seasons soil salinity was monitored in 2019 a dry year which partially explains that swc drop below Œ∏p in p2 the measured ece values were never above the ece threshold for almonds and the swc values were always kept within the raw limits in the olive fields fig 4 the swc also dropped to values below Œ∏p for extended periods during both irrigation seasons which indicates that trees were subjected to mild water stress during most of the mid and late season stages no salinity stress was ever noticed in these sites contrastingly swc in citrus fields fig 5 were systematically above Œ∏fc during irrigation periods thus clearly showing that over irrigation was practiced this assumption was confirmed when observing table 3 which shows that high water depths were applied over both seasons especially in the mandarin field p8 the same was observed in the pomegranate case in 2020 where swc was continuously monitored above Œ∏fc during the irrigation season the results above indicate that farmers adopt a poor irrigation scheduling and that there is the need to develop and propose to farmers the adoption of water saving schedules as the ones presented later the box plots in fig 6 present the mean ece values measured in all fields along the two seasons results differ from a plot to another and their variability is supposed to differently influence soil water availability p1 was greatly affected by soil salinity mainly during the 2019 season so affecting the almond crop which is sensitive to soil salinity ece threshold 1 5 ds m 1 in this field ece measurements performed along the season were systematically higher than the crop tolerance salinity threshold 3 62 ds m 1 on may 24th 2019 2 80 ds m 1 on october 31st 2019 and 1 90 ds m 1 on december 12th 2019 resulting in an increase of the osmotic stress and decrease of soil water availability in all other fields soil salinity did not increase to levels above the crop tolerance thresholds except for some short periods in case of p2 1 69 ds m 1 on august 24th 2020 p7 2 42 ds m 1 on december 11th 2019 and p8 2 81 ds m 1 on december 11th 2019 and 2 06 ds m 1 on may 5th 2020 p9 in a luvic planosol i e where the soil has the poorest drainage conditions among all case studies registered the highest salinity levels 4 04 ds m 1 on december 11th 2019 but because pomegranate is highly tolerant to salinity stress there was no noticeable impact on swc the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between simulated and measured swc values are presented in table 8 for the calibration year 2019 the regression coefficients b0 were all close to the 1 0 target ranging from 0 98 p1 to 1 02 p8 indicating that the simulated values were close to the observed ones the value of r2 varied from 0 53 p6 to 0 84 p7 showing that generally the model could explain most of the variance of the observed data the errors of the estimates were always small 0 001 rmse 0 005 m3 m 3 and 0 004 nrmse 0 019 in agreement with b0 the pbias values were quite small 1 43 pbias 2 04 with no particular over or under estimation trend in simulating the measured data lastly the nse values were relatively high ranging from 0 408 p4 to 0 782 p5 thus indicating that the variance of the residuals was smaller than the measured data variance for validation with 2020 data the goodness of fit indicators showed generally the same trend and similar range of values as observed for calibration the worst statistics were obtained in p2 while the best indicators were in p3 hence overall the simdualkc model performed well when simulating swc in the nine case studies relative to the four tree crops the resulting goodness of fit indicators were also within the ranges of values reported in the literature for simdualkc applications to perennial crops e g pa√ßo et al 2019 and puig sirera et al 2021 for olive darouich et al 2022b for clementine rosa 2018 for lemon and peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 for orange thus the obtained results may be considered appropriate for the analysis reported herein 3 3 assessing crop coefficients and crop water use 3 3 1 almond orchards for almond the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end were calibrated to 0 22 0 58 and 0 50 respectively table 7 no differences were noticed between the two locations p1 and p2 which were nearby trees were 5 years old table 1 thus corresponding to the mature stage in almond trees drechsler et al 2022 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 garc√≠a tejero et al 2015 mid season fc and h values of 0 41 0 42 and 4 0 m respectively and end season fc and h values of 0 20 and 4 0 m were observed table 5 the calibrated kcb mid was close to the indicative value 0 60 tabulated by pereira et al 2021c which correspond to a fc of 0 40 0 50 and h of 4 0 5 0 m the kcb mid was also close to the kcb mid of 0 60 reported by espadafor et al 2015 with 4 years old trees fc of 0 60 and h of 4 8 m likewise l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 reported kcb mid of 0 55 and 0 68 for 6 and 7 years old almond trees with fc of 0 55 and 0 59 respectively and h of 4 8 m in s√°nchez et al 2021 the low fc of 0 41 observed corresponded to a small kcb mid of 0 36 however rallo et al 2021 reported similar kcb mid for almond orchards with fc of 0 40 0 50 and h of 4 0 5 0 m these comparisons indicate that the orchards have a canopy and height smaller than expected for mature almonds orchard which may be due to short trees spacing heavy pruning and less appropriate training the previously referred salinity occurrence is nevertheless small and is not sufficient to justify the low development of the almond orchards which likely also result from poor soil fertility for the end season the calibrated kcb end 0 50 was higher than expected e g the values 0 40 proposed by rallo et al 2021 and corresponding to fc of 0 50 0 60 as tabulated by pereira et al 2021c the calibrated kcb end was also higher than in espadafor et al 2015 and l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 the large kcb end is likely due to irrigation applied much longer after harvesting which relates with the observed dryness of october november fig 7 shows the dynamics of the potential not stressed basal crop coefficients kcb in the two almond fields during both seasons in p1 the large drop observed in the kcb act in 2019 which translates the reduction of the tc act relative to tc was likely explained by water and salinity stress when measured ece was higher than the ece threshold in the next year 2020 no salinity stress occurred but the kcb act failed again to reach the potential kcb values due to deficient irrigation scheduling during the dry summer season water stress in almond trees is reported to reduce vegetative growth and canopy size also affecting the accumulation of reserves during the growing season water shortages during the kernel filling stage may reduce nut weight and may affect fruit loads in the next season l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 goldhamer and girona 2012 this likely occurred in p1 while in p2 the kcb act matched the kcb values throughout both seasons i e no water or salinity stresses were observed fig 7 further shows the dynamics of the soil evaporation coefficients ke in both fields and seasons the ke could only be indirectly influenced by the salinity stress if fc would be affected and consequently increase the soil surface exposure to solar radiation rosa et al 2016 as salinity stress was only transient likely resulting from some more intensive fertigation events rather than soil groundwater or irrigation water quality related causes the fc was apparently not affected the dynamics of the ke values were the same in both p1 and p2 fields showing multiple high peaks during the rainfall seasons when the entire soil surface was wet fw 1 and quite low values during the irrigation seasons when the resulting soil wetted fraction was small fw 0 12 because of drip irrigation the kc curves as well as the kcb curves fig 7 resulted similar to those for olives with kcb higher in spring summer when transpiration is higher and kc high in fall and winter when rain occurs and small in summer when rain is rare 3 3 2 olive orchards the calibrated kcb for each crop stage of olive varied only slightly in the three fields p3 p4 and p5 with kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end assuming values of 0 32 0 33 0 35 0 36 and 0 33 0 34 respectively table 7 trees were 11 12 years old with mid season fc and h values of 0 23 0 27 and 3 0 4 1 m respectively and end season fc and h values of 0 20 0 23 and 2 8 4 0 m respectively table 5 the calibrated kcb mid values were slightly lower than the indicative value 0 40 tabulated by pereira et al 2021c for olive orchards with fc of 0 35 and h of 3 5 m they were also lower than the proposed value 0 40 in rallo et al 2021 for orchards with fc of 0 20 0 30 and h of 3 0 3 5 m apparently when compared with existing reviews fc and h values were expected to be larger thus values now reported may be due to excessive pruning and less good training more adequate values were obtained when applying the allen pereira a p approach allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020a 2021c using observed fc and h values on the other hand the calibrated kcb end was consistent with the indicative values in pereira et al 2021c and rallo et al 2021 yet the existing literature shows a wide range of variation of the kcb in mature olive orchards with calibrated kcb mid values approaching those in villalobos et al 2000 for a traditional orchard cv picual in southern spain with 278 trees ha 1 fc 0 3 and h 4 0 while the kcb end values were relatively higher likely because irrigation in the study orchards was extended until the end of october beginning of november differently the calibrated kcb mid were lower while the kcb end approached the values reported in puig sirera et al 2021 for a traditional orchard in sicily italy with 250 trees ha 1 fc 0 35 and h 3 5 kcb values in concei√ß√£o et al 2017 and santos 2018 were also comparable to those in this study these authors estimated the kcb of olive orchards with similar characteristics trees 8 10 years old 300 trees ha 1 fc 0 25 h 3 5 3 7 m in the alentejo region using sap flow measurements the major contrast between olive and almond fields was in the dynamics of the kcb act with daily values in olive departing from the potential kcb between may all plots in 2019 and july p5 in 2020 maintaining this condition up to the september fig 8 this agreed with various reports available in the literature addressing the relationship between olive oil yields and water application and confirming that oil yields are maximized at water application rates below 100 of full irrigation ahumada orellana et al 2018 hern√°ndez et al 2018 rosecrance et al 2015 ramos and santos 2010 moriana et al 2007 2003 grattan et al 2006 moderated water stress can also significantly reduce tree growth thus reducing shoot growth trunk growth and pruning weights these are however objectives for super intensive olive systems but likely too much stress has been imposed in the studied orchards which ended up limiting canopy development and fc values the dynamics of the ke were similar to that in the almond fields higher ke values were again noticed during winter when the entire soil surface was wetted decreasing during the irrigation season as the wetted area reduced since drip irrigation was wetting the soil mostly under the canopies the kc curves fig 8 are therefore similar to those reported by pa√ßo et al 2019 and puig sirera et al 2021 3 3 3 citrus orchards the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end for citrus were set to 0 40 0 41 and 0 41 respectively for the orange field p6 and to 0 40 0 40 and 0 40 respectively for the clementine p7 and mandarin p8 fields table 7 only minor differences were found between fields trees were 5 years old with fc varying from 0 25 to 0 29 along the growing seasons and relatively short with heights ranging from 2 4 m in p6 to 2 8 m in p8 table 5 the calibrated kcb values were comparable to those computed using the a p approach allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020a 2021c using the fc and h values listed in table 5 for the different crop stages however when compared to the indicative values in pereira et al 2021c and rallo et al 2021 the calibrated kcb mid were found to be lower than those tabulated by for citrus orchards with fc of 0 25 0 40 and h of 2 3 4 5 m citrus trees were thus likely trained small for easy harvesting which also resulted in small fc closer values kcb 0 45 were given in allen and pereira 2009 for citrus orchards with fc eff of 0 25 but with no ground cover which was not the case in p6 p7 and p8 the calibrated kcb values were also in close agreement with villalobos et al 2013 for 7 years old citrus trees fc of 0 27 and h equal to 2 30 m the remaining dedicated literature was carried out in larger citrus trees thus with larger fc and h showing consistently higher kcb values darouich et al 2022b jafari et al 2021 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 rallo et al 2017 taylor et al 2017 er raki et al 2009 in citrus fields p6 p7 and p8 irrigation was characterized by large application depths with seasonal values summing 548 mm p6 in 2019 to 1170 mm p8 in 2020 mm table 3 these depths were more than enough to meet tc values as a result no water stress was ever observed with the kcb act matching always kcb values in the three sites except when a slight salinity stress was noticed this succeeded in p7 and p8 when the measured ece was above the ece threshold of citrus for a short period december 2019 causing the respective kcb act values to slightly dropping from kcb fig 9 the dynamics of the ke followed also the same trends reported above considering that rainfall occurs in fall and winter but not in summer and that most of transpiration occurs in summer it resulted that kc curves are similar to those of olives differently because citrus trees are active throughout the season if not heavy stressed the kcb curve has a constant value as already detected in a previous application with clementine darouich et al 2022b 3 3 4 pomegranate the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end for pomegranate p9 were calibrated to 0 24 0 60 and 0 52 respectively table 7 trees were also 5 years old with mid season fc and h values of 0 41 and 2 5 m and end season fc and h values of 0 30 and 2 3 m respectively table 5 the calibrated kcb mid and kcb end were found to be higher than the indicative values in rallo et al 2021 for pomegranate orchards with fc of 0 35 0 45 and h of 2 5 3 5 m however a better agreement was noticed between the calibrated kcb mid and the upper class values given in rallo et al 2021 when fc is above 0 45 differently from the other crops results for kcb mid fitted well those tabulated by pereira et al 2021c but the kcb end was larger in the current study which may be due to excess irrigation during the late season kcb mid values reported by niu et al 2021 and noory et al 2021 likely were larger than in the current study but those authors did not provide for fc values intrigliolo et al 2021 reported also similar kcb mid but with a fc of 0 58 which was much larger than the observed one fig 10 shows the kcb act always equaling kcb values in the studied orchard despite high salinity ece values monitored in different dates along both growing seasons as such no water or salinity stress ever affected crop development nonetheless research has shown that moderate water deficits during flowering and fruit set may increase aril red for some cultivars without detrimental effects on marketable yield fruit size and chemical composition in addition for some cultivars during ripening and throughout the growing season moderate water deficits may improve the red color of the fruit peel and or juice but negatively affecting fruit weight and economic income volschenk 2020 mart√≠nez nicol√°s et al 2019 galindo et al 2017 intrigliolo et al 2013 yet more research is needed for the acco cultivar grown in p9 the kc and kcb curves fig 10 are similar to those of almonds also a deciduous tree since transpiration and soil evaporation have contrary dynamics due to summer dryness 3 4 single crop coefficients as indicators of crop water use table 9 summarizes the mean kc values computed from the sum of the computed kcb act and ke during the crop stages of each case study using the simdualkc model as already stated the crop coefficients developed for different irrigation systems and different cultivars in different countries cannot be simply transferred to local management due to the complex characteristics of orchard systems evidencing the necessity of conducting field research under local conditions rallo et al 2021 volschenk 2020 fereres et al 2012 the kc mean values depicted in table 9 follow typical trends observed in drip systems as already discussed in darouich et al 2022b for citrus and pa√ßo et al 2019 for olive orchards the kcb curves figs 7 10 result in fao segmented curves with generally higher kcb during the mid season when irrigation is applied spring and summer naturally curves have smaller kcb in the non growing period when transpiration is low or much low thus with the single kc segmented curve showing a dynamic opposed to that of kcb as discussed before relative to each crop because it also depends on soil evaporation and thus on the fraction of the wetted soil surface kc kcb ke is smaller during the active growing period when es and ke are low due to negligeable precipitation and irrigation water applied directly along the trees row in small areas shaded by the canopies contrarily kc is larger in fall and winter non growing season and initial and end season crop stages when rainfall occurs and the entire soil surface contributes to soil evaporation the adequacy of the kcb was already discussed in section 3 3 in the analysis it was evident that studies addressing the partition of the etc into its components are quite limited for some of the studied crops namely almond and pomegranate however more information is available regarding the kc values of these two crops for almond garc√≠a tejero et al 2018 provided a review of kc values published in the literature with many of their references reporting kc values for the mid season above 1 05 these values highly contrast with those in table 9 and the tabulated values in pereira et al 2021c and rallo et al 2021 such differences can be attributed to several factors i in those studies irrigation was delivered through micro sprinklers thus increasing the ke component in the kc ii most orchards were located in more fertile soils with trees exhibiting larger canopies that resulted in higher transpiration rates and a larger weight of the kcb component in kc goldhamer and fereres 2017 girona 2006 while soils in p1 and p2 luvisols are less fertile with a very high fraction of coarse elements 70 and iii yields in p1 and p2 were barely above 1 0 mg ha 1 while several publications report yields ranging from 1 8 to 4 0 mg ha 1 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 goldhamer and fereres 2017 girona 2006 fruit load may also impact kc and kcb values in almonds as observed by l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 who measured differences in the canopy conductance of trees with higher fruit load during the third year of observations despite the same canopy size as the previous years for olive kc mid values in table 9 were comparable to those reported by er raki et al 2008 for an orchard in morocco fc 0 6 h 6 0 and by l√≥pez olivari et al 2016 in chile fc 0 29 0 31 h 3 2 m yet those orchards characteristics differed considerably from those in the alentejo cases for citrus the kc mid values were in the range of values reported by castel 2000 consoli et al 2006 and er raki et al 2009 for orchards with fc ranging from 0 2 to 0 3 however the kc ini and kc end differ considerably from the available literature for pomegranate the mean kc values for the mid season approached those in intrigliolo et al 2011 and buesa et al 2012 for southern spain but were below those in ayars et al 2017 for california hence table 9 includes kc values adequate for irrigation water management of orchards in the alentejo region of southern portugal the approach adopted combines information provided by soil water content measurements and simulated with the state of the art simdualkc model to overcome the limitations of data collection and the impact of the three dimensionality of drip irrigation on soil measurements it is one of the most widely used methods for measuring crop evapotranspiration as reported in pereira et al 2020b and allen et al 2011 being validated against other methodologies namely sap flow pa√ßo et al 2019 2014 puig sirera et al 2020 still the proposed kc values need to be used with care with proper consideration of the specific characteristics of local orchards 3 5 evaluation of the soil water balance in the studied orchards 3 5 1 almond table 10 presents the soil water balance computed by simdualkc for the almond orchards p1 and p2 during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons seasonal net irrigation depths ranged from 596 to 772 mm with less water applied always in p1 than in p2 particularly in 2020 seasonal tc values were naturally equal or very close in both fields corresponding to 72 8 74 5 of the etc 880 907 mm however tc act values were remarkably different in p1 tc act values were always below the potential tc values amounting to 377 and 613 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively in p2 tc act values practically matched the potential tc values during both seasons 660 655 mm seasonal soil evaporation ranged from 224 to 237 mm corresponding to 25 5 27 2 of the etc and 26 6 38 1 of the etc act 609 837 mm in p1 907 892 mm in p2 while seasonal etc act values depend on tree age and size climate conditions interrow management and irrigation methods in p2 where no stress was observed etc act values were within the range of values reported in the literature for mature almond orchards they were comparable to the etc act values of 946 mm for a mature almond orchard 7 years old with 7 3 m 7 3 m tree spacing in arbuckle california usa in the early 1980 s fereres et al 1982 yet they were far below more recent records which refer to the need of 1250 mm for fully satisfying mature almond trees water needs and reaching maximum yields in the southern san joaquin valley of california usa goldhamer and fereres 2017 seasonal percolation differed also between fields in p1 the impact of the salinity stress on transpiration rates resulted in an increase in percolation losses in the drier season of 2019 compared to 2020 as shown in fig 11 in that year most of the estimated percolation values occurred during the irrigation season about 73 because of the osmotic stress impact on root water uptake obviously the percolated water could have helped leach salts away from the rootzone thus decreasing the impact of the salinity stress on crop transpiration this cannot be simulated in simdualkc except by providing inputs of the ece in the rootzone throughout the crop growing season however field measurements of the ece in 2019 were always higher than the crop tolerance salinity threshold in 2020 percolation resulted mostly from rainfall also noticeable was that about 10 and 36 of percolation losses occurred in the late season stage of 2019 and 2020 seasons respectively because of late irrigation events often combined with rainfall depths above the soil s water holding capacity in p2 higher percolation values were found as expected in the 2020 rainier season when also some losses from irrigation events were noticed likely the farmer of p1 adopted a more adequate irrigation schedule 3 5 2 olive soil water dynamics in olive fields p3 p4 and p5 were remarkably different than in the almonds cases seasonal irrigation depths were smaller ranging from 266 to 357 mm table 10 seasonal tc values were also lower than for almonds summing 427 445 mm during both growing seasons 65 4 69 9 of the etc which evidence the lower water requirements of olives compared to almonds differences between olive plots were related to planting densities and lengths of crop stages of the different varieties the major contrast between olive and almond fields was in the dynamics of the tc act and kcb act as discussed in section 3 3 2 tc reductions due to water stress ended up varying from 4 0 p3 in 2020 to 23 6 p5 in 2019 no salinity stress was ever registered with the monitored ece always below the crop s salinity tolerance threshold seasonal soil evaporation ranged from 192 to 226 mm corresponding to 30 1 34 6 of the etc 626 655 mm and 33 2 37 7 of the etc act 532 619 mm the weight of soil evaporation on crop evapotranspiration was thus slightly higher than in the almond fields runoff 10 50 mm and percolation 9 174 mm resulted mostly from rainfall events fig 12 it is likely that olive farmers skills are better since irrigation of olives is practiced for a longer time than in almonds 3 5 3 citrus in citrus fields p6 p7 and p8 irrigation was characterized by large application depths with seasonal values summing from 548 mm p6 in 2019 to 1170 mm p8 in 2020 mm table 10 these depths were more than enough to meet tc values which only ranged from 499 p7 in 2020 to 516 mm p6 in 2019 corresponding to 66 4 74 1 of the etc no water stress was ever observed while the salinity stress was only minor and affecting p7 and p8 for a very short period december 2019 fig 9 seasonal soil evaporation ranged from 180 to 258 mm corresponding to 25 9 33 6 of the etc deep percolation had a large weight compared to the other outputs of the soil water balance the large percolation values which the simdualkc estimated to range from 177 to 526 mm in the orange field p6 to 517 899 mm in the mandarin field p8 confirmed the excess water application contrarily to observations in almond and olive orchards the percolation in citrus fields mainly occurred during the irrigation season fig 13 when 66 0 p6 in 2020 to 84 4 p8 in 2020 of the seasonal percolation amounts were computed it also corresponded to 32 3 p6 in 2019 to 76 8 p8 in 2020 of the total irrigation water applied the results of the water balance in the citrus fields have obviously no other justification than complete mismanagement of irrigation water it is known that citrus trees can endure mild moderate water stress except for the most critical growth stages which are the flowering and fruit growth periods garc√≠a tejero et al 2012 for this reason deficit irrigation practices have long been evaluated in the main citrus production areas due to limited water resource availability pag√°n et al 2022 rallo et al 2017 ballester et al 2011 garc√≠a tejero et al 2011 better management practices need thus to be implemented in the three commercial orchards 3 5 4 pomegranate pomegranate is far less studied than the crops above which highlights the importance of the respective monitoring p9 the seasonal irrigation depth reached 654 mm in 2019 and 694 mm in 2020 table 10 these values are below the 848 and 932 mm applied by surface drip in trees of similar age of the cultivar wonderful in california ayars et al 2017 their totals are also within the range of depths 392 776 mm reported for cultivars mollar de elche and wonderful 7 13 years old grown in soils with different textures in southern spain as reviewed by volschenk 2020 seasonal tc values amounted 649 2019 and 637 mm 2020 corresponding respectively to 74 8 and 74 2 of the etc these seasonal values were lower than those reported in ayars et al 2017 for trees of the same age 912 953 mm grown in california no water or salinity stresses were noticed in the pomegranate orchard even if the monitored ece values were in general the highest of all cases seasonal soil evaporation corresponded to 25 2 219 mm and 25 8 222 mm of the etc in 2019 and 2020 respectively more significant percolation was computed in 2020 with approximately 37 of the seasonal amount occurring during the irrigation season which corresponded to 39 of the water applied fig 14 thus despite better than for citrus there is room for improvement and water saving 3 6 searching improved water use with simdualkc fig 15 exemplifies the evolution of the kcb act ke and kc act in selected plots p1 p5 p8 and p9 when considering a mild deficit irrigation scheduling scenario the soil water balance is then presented for all plots in table 11 the mild deficit scenario included the same dates of the crop stages in each growing season as well as the previously calibrated model parameters irrigation triggering was set for a management allowable depletion mad of 1 05 Œ∏p while irrigation depths were set to 5 mm following the observed data in table 3 no salinity effects were considered due to its transient nature table 11 shows a reduction of the tc act values of 3 0 p5 p7 and p8 in 2020 to 5 2 p1 in 2019 relative to the tc values thus with no effect on crop yields considering the tolerance of the study crops to mild water deficits as explained above percolation estimates returned the greatest contrast when compared with the farmers schedules with reductions reaching 63 98 in the almond fields 17 58 in the olive fields 82 100 in the citrus fields and 70 98 in the pomegranate field this confirms that most of percolation losses were due to poor irrigation scheduling all other components of the water balance showed similar estimates as those obtained when analysing the farmers schedules as such the mild deficit irrigation scheduling scenario shows possible water savings of 20 mm in case of olives up to 855 mm for citrus yet for olive water savings were naturally only possible when the observed water stress was less pronounced than the one considered in the modeling scenario 4 conclusions the current paper presents and discusses estimates of crop evapotranspiration in nine commercial orchards in the alentejo region of southern portugal the crops addressed were almonds olive citrus orange clementine and mandarin and pomegranate in all case studies crop evapotranspiration was estimated by computing the soil water balance following the fao56 dual kc approach adopted in the simdualkc model i e through the partition of crop evapotranspiration into its components crop transpiration and soil evaporation the model may be considered one of the most adequate solutions for computing the water balance in such complex agricultural systems it is able to estimate the kcb at various crop stages taking into consideration the crop density through a density coefficient kd which is a function of fc and h in addition it accounts for the effects of interrow management active ground cover and mulching namely dried understory plants and falling leaves and soil conditions mainly soil salinity on actual transpiration rates the model successfully simulated the soil water contents measured in the different fields along two growing seasons with root mean square error values lower than 0 005 m3 m 3 and modeling efficiencies from 0 363 to 0 782 for almonds differences to the literature were noticed especially for the kc and when compared to almond orchards from california which were mainly attributed to the irrigation management soil fertility fruit load training and crop height and canopy size salinity levels in one of the fields during the 2019 growing season led to significant water uptake reductions resulting most likely from intensive fertigation mismanagement for olive small differences in the kcb and kc values were noticed between the three case studies which were related to the fraction of the ground covered by the trees canopies and height mild water stress conditions were noticed in the three monitored fields generally corresponding to a water saving strategy with no impact on oil yields in citrus fields the estimated kcb and kc values were relatively small when compared with the existing literature which was justified by orchards training monitoring of irrigation practices in the three case studies showed a large excess irrigation water application with translated into large percolation losses lastly for pomegranate information on the partition of the etc was quite limited and as far as we know this is one of the first studies assessing separately the dynamics of the kcb and ke in this crop like in the citrus fields excess application of irrigation water was observed but without the same magnitude of losses estimated for the clementine and mandarin fields this study provides more accurate kc values for the orchard systems in the roxo irrigation district thus also providing for improving irrigation water management in the alentejo region a proper characterization of evapotranspiration fluxes and dynamics was needed for further studies namely the assessment of soil salinization and nutrient leaching risks resulting from current agricultural practices with these aims data and parameterization obtained in this study were used with the calibrated model simdualkc to develop alternative irrigation management issues mainly improved schedules results show a potential water saving of 82 292 mm for almond 20 mm for olive 193 855 mm for citrus particularly for mandarin and 144 220 mm for pomegranate however modeling tools are insufficient for improving irrigation and it is desirable that farmers are trained including in their computing skills and that

9066,orchards consist of complex agricultural systems with a variety of characteristics planting density tree height training system canopy cover irrigation method interrow management influencing crop evapotranspiration etc thus irrigation water management requires finding crop coefficients kc that represent the characteristics of local orchards evidencing the need for site specific data the main objective of this study was to derive the kc of almond olive citrus and pomegranate orchards in alentejo southern portugal wherein they became dominant over the last decade monitoring was carried out in nine orchards which management decisions were performed by the farmers the etc was estimated from the soil water balance computed for each orchard using the fao56 dual kc approach with the simdualkc model the model successfully simulated the soil water contents measured in the various fields along two growing seasons with root mean square error values lower than 0 005 m3 m 3 and modeling efficiencies from 0 363 to 0 782 the estimated basal crop coefficients kcb for the initial mid and end seasons were respectively 0 22 0 58 and 0 50 for almond 0 32 0 33 0 35 0 36 and 0 33 0 34 for olive 0 40 0 40 41 and 0 40 0 41 for citrus and 0 24 0 60 and 0 52 for pomegranate small variations in olive and citrus kcb values were found to be related to differences in the fraction of the ground covered by trees canopies and tree height the single kc values which included the component relative to soil evaporation were also estimated furthermore evaluation of the soil water balance in the nine case studies showed salinity effects in one almond orchard mild irrigation water deficits in olive systems and large non consumptive water use in citrus and pomegranate orchards these results evidence the need for better management of orchards irrigation water in the region and the current study provides for reliable information on the kc of tree crops to support improving the management of local orchard systems and the preservation of soil and water resources aimed at these resources and the sustainability of their use simulated alternative irrigation schedules were performed which identified possible water savings of 20 mm in case of olives up to 855 mm for citrus keywords crop coefficients crop evapotranspiration dual kc approach orchards almond olive citrus and pomegranate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the expansion of the irrigated area over the past century has provided the means for agricultural production in regions of the world where scarcity prevails in these regions mostly afflicted by arid semi arid and dry sub humid climates irrigation is fundamental to fulfill crop water requirements diversify crop production increase food production meet the growing food demand ensure food stability and increase the prosperity of rural areas pereira et al 2009 this most times comes with costs to the environment as the pressure on freshwater resources builds up irrigation is today responsible for 70 of all freshwater withdrawals in the world and 90 in the least developed regions unesco 2020 irrigation is also considered a key source of land degradation namely by contributing to the contamination or depletion of water resources promotion of soil erosion and soil salinization being also associated with biodiversity loss climate change only further exacerbates the scarcity issue and future uncertainty mitigating the environmental problems referred to above as well as climate uncertainty can only be achieved by improving agricultural water management namely water use and performance of irrigation systems pereira et al 2002 jovanovic et al 2020 this requires an accurate estimate of crop water requirements and irrigation schedules irrigation timing duration and quantity namely by following the fao56 method allen et al 1998 widely used this method estimates crop evapotranspiration etc as the product of a crop coefficient kc and the grass reference evapotranspiration eto the latter being calculated with the fao penman monteith fao pm equation allen et al 1998 kc values are defined for each crop stage by using the single crop coefficient approach which assumes a single value for including both the soil evaporation and crop transpiration processes or the dual crop coefficient approach kc kcb ke which separately considers the basal transpiration coefficient kcb and the soil evaporation coefficient ke the methodology is straightforward with standard kc and kcb values available for most field and vegetable crops pereira et al 2021a 2021b for trees and vines rallo et al 2021 also provided standard kc values for the most common agricultural species and management options however the complexity of orchard systems is great because surfaces are heterogenous and the soil is incompletely covered and differences in the planting density canopy height training system interrow management and irrigation method influence the amount of energy available for both the transpiration and soil evaporation processes it results that the collected literature information may be rather insufficient for selecting from the reported kc and kcb values for those to be efficiently used in irrigation water management rallo et al 2021 pereira et al 2020a volschenk 2020 fereres et al 2012 that knowledge gap is particularly relevant for the alentejo region of southern portugal where orchards systems have become dominant over the last decade the implementation of the alqueva project in 2002 which progressively added 120 000 ha of newly irrigated land to the already existing 35 000 ha included in different collective systems provided conditions for the fast expansion of olive orchards and other perennial crops ramos et al 2019 olive 87 500 ha and other orchards 22 000 ha dgadr 2021 from which almond stands out now extend throughout the landscape replacing the traditional crops mainly irrigated and rainfed cereals in the alqueva irrigation district alone olives and almonds cover today 56 7 and 21 3 of the equipped area respectively edia 2022 these orchards mostly consist of high 300 trees ha 1 and very high density 1500 trees ha 1 orchard systems which require high to very high input factors pa√ßo et al 2019 the abrupt landscape change has naturally raised doubts about the sustainability of the new production systems with local populations often raising concerns about respective environmental impacts as often reported by the traditional and social media expresso 2018 dinheiro vivo 2021 publico 2021 this social unrest is per se pressing on the viability of those systems resulting in the need for a throughout and clear quantification of the main environmental risks associated with the new cropping reality in the alentejo region while some studies already exist to address improved crop water use pa√ßo et al 2019 2014 santos 2018 concei√ß√£o et al 2017 and decrease soil salinization risks ramos et al 2019 and non point source pollution due to fertigation practices cameira et al 2014 these studies imply further assessing crop water use to better control environmental impacts meanwhile studies are limited to olive and are insufficient to provide guidelines for improving irrigation and fertigation practices to local farmers the current study follows the need to increase knowledge on the water use and environmental impacts of the new orchard systems dominating the landscape in the alentejo region southern portugal the first part of the study aims to assess local irrigation practices through the accurate estimate of evapotranspiration and crop coefficients in different orchards systems the selected tool was the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 which adopts the fao 56 dual kc approach for computing etc fluxes when partitioning into crop transpiration and soil evaporation a review on water balance models justifies that option pereira et al 2020b the reasons for choosing this model further lay on i the acknowledged more accurate estimates of the evapotranspiration processes provided by the fao 56 dual kc approach as compared to other methods pereira et al 2015a kool et al 2014 l√≥pez urrea et al 2009 ii the adequacy in adopting the estimated potential transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes thus defining atmospheric boundary conditions in mechanistic vadose zone modeling aimed at evaluating soil salinization and fertigation risks chen et al 2022 phogat et al 2017 gonz√°lez et al 2015 ramos et al 2012 minhas et al 2020 and iii the extensive testing already performed with the simdualkc model in orchards grown under diverse management options and climate conditions namely for olive puig sirera et al 2021 pa√ßo et al 2019 2014 peach pa√ßo et al 2012 grapevine darouich et al 2022a silva et al 2021 cancela et al 2015 fandi√±o et al 2012 and citrus darouich et al 2022b the objectives of this study therefore consist of i to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model in various almond olive citrus orange clementine and mandarin and pomegranate orchards of alentejo using field data of the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons ii with support by the model to derive the kc and kcb standard and actual crop coefficients for those crops using the dual kc approach iii to evaluate the components of the soil water balance from a water saving perspective and iv using the model to develop alternative water saving irrigation schedules and management issues results of this study will also be used as input to mechanistic models aimed at predicting soil salinization and crop fertigation risks which assessment shall be the object of companion papers to be published later as such this study aims to contribute to improve irrigation water use in the alentejo region considering the sustainability and response to climate change of local production systems a few novelties must be referred the adoption of a dual kc model to assess the irrigation and related water balance of six different crops and nine fields the gain of further data on standard basal crop coefficients for mediterranean tree crops which is still very limited the use for the first time of a dual kc model for almond mandarin and pomegranate orchards and not limiting the assessment to discussions on possible issues but proposing quantified predictions of water saving for all nine plots through model simulations considering mild deficit irrigation for the crop stages when the crop and yields are not affected 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area this study was conducted in the roxo irrigation district rid montes velhos aljustrel portugal from january 1st 2019 to december 31st 2020 the rid is a collective system with 5041 ha built during stage i of the irrigation plan for alentejo in 1968 since 2016 the rid is connected to the alqueva system which provides an extra water supply during drier seasons the climate in the region is semi arid the mean annual air temperature is 16 3¬∫c ranging from a minimum of 9 8¬∫c in january to a maximum of 23 1¬∫c in august the mean annual precipitation is 454 mm which occurs mostly between october and may the mean annual reference evapotranspiration eto computed with the fao pm equation allen et al 1998 is 1363 mm for the period 1979 2020 hersbach et al 2018 the main soil units are classified as luvisols 40 fluvisols and regosols 20 gleysols and planosols 20 and vertisols 10 iuss working group wrb 2014 soil salinization problems have long been reported in the region alexandre et al 2018 martins et al 2005 resulting from the use of poor quality soil drainage and irrigation water prior to the connection of the rid to the alqueva system salinization may have also been aggravated due to less percolating water resulting from a decreasing precipitation trend as reported by portela et al 2020 in 2019 the dominant land uses were rainfed cereals 46 sunflower 14 olive 21 almond 5 and maize 4 this distribution was explained by drought conditions which limited irrigation in that season nonetheless olive and almond areas have been expanding despite drought conditions observed over the last decade drip is the most common irrigation method but sprinkler and surface methods are also used the latter in farms of smaller dimensions the groundwater table depth averaged 5 5 m with maximum and minimum depths of 7 6 and 4 2 m respectively snirh 2022 2 2 experimental plots and measurements irrigation practices were monitored in nine commercial orchards located in the rid fig 1 the selected crops were almond prunus amygdalus batsch olive olea europaea l citrus citrus spp and pomegranate punica granatum l covering the most representative perennials grown in the region table 1 presents the main characteristics of the selected orchards including location plant variety crop density and age training system and soil type in five locations orchards were on ridges mostly trapezoidal shaped with 0 25 0 70 m height and 1 2 1 6 m wide at the top and 2 3 2 8 m wide at the bottom table 2 gives the main physical and chemical properties of soils in the nine study sites the soil classification follows the iuss working group 2014 the particle size distribution was determined following the international soil science society isss particle

sieving the organic matter om content was estimated from the organic carbon oc content determined by the walkley black method using the relation om 1 724 oc nelson and sommers 1982 dry bulk density œÅb was determined by drying volumetric soil samples 100 cm3 at 105¬∫c for 48 h soil hydraulic properties were measured also in 100 cm3 undisturbed soil cores the soil water content at saturation Œ∏s

romano et al 2002 the soil water content at the wilting point Œ∏wp was measured with a pressure plate extractor at 1500 kpa matric potential dane and hopmans 2002 measured depths were assumed representative of the entire root zone layer including with ridges the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece was determined potentiometrically meteorological data for the

variability for most variables except for rainfall at every site drip irrigation systems were used with management practices performed according to standard practices in the region and decided by farmers i e applying daily small irrigation depths drippers were spaced 0 7 1 0 m apart placed under tree canopies in a single line in almond and olive plots and two lines in citrus and pomegranate plots table 3 shows the main characteristics of irrigation events namely initiation and end dates depths per event the fraction of the soil surface wetted by irrigation fw and the total seasonal application depths irrigation depths per irrigation event averaged between 2 7 p6 and 7 4 mm p8 the season irrigation depths per cropped fields averaged 658 mm in almond 320 mm in olive 830 mm in citrus and 791 mm in pomegranate depths were monitored using a flowmeter inserted in the drip lines irrigation was carried out nearly every day during the summer dry season and less frequently during spring and autumn soil water contents were continuously monitored at depths of 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 m using enviropro mt capacitance probes mait industries australia probes were installed in the crop rows with varying distances from emitters but always less than 0 3 m fig 3 presents as an example the monitoring area in p1 showing the relative positions of the almond trees the emitters and the soil water monitoring points soil moisture data were subjected to calibration by comparing measured values with gravimetric soil water contents measured in disturbed soil samples taken periodically from each plot and multiplied by the respective œÅb values the soil water retention data determined in the laboratory was also considered in the calibration process the continuous readings of soil water contents measured at different depths were then averaged for a daily value representing the entire soil profile ece was periodically measured in each field by collecting disturbed soil samples below emitters using an auger the monitored layer depths were 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 0 8 m but reaching the deeper depths depended on the stoniness of soils of each plot and of soil moisture at sampling measured ece values were then averaged to get representative values of the rootzone salinity in the different fields the electrical conductivity of irrigation water eciw was periodically monitored in the rid irrigation channel with values averaging 0 72 ds m 1 this value contrasts with the previous range of eciw values from 1 05 to 1 67 ds m 1 measured in the rdi channels between 2003 and 2006 martins et al 2005 before the rdi was connected to alqueva the crops were monitored for the crop stage dates crop height h the fraction of the ground covered by the canopies fc active root depth zr and interrow management the dates of crop stages and respective growing degree days gdd are given in table 4 the dates of crop stages approach those reported in the literature for almond bellvert et al 2018 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 espadafor et al 2015 olive garrido et al 2021 2020 pa√ßo et al 2019 sanz cort√©s et al 2002 citrus darouich et al 2022b garc√≠a tejero et al 2010 garc√≠a tejero et al 2011 gonz√°lez altozano and castel 2000 and pomegranate intrigliolo et al 2011 melgarejo et al 1997 grown in other locations also having a mediterranean type of climate the base temperatures considered for computing the gdd were 7 0 ¬∫c for almond egea et al 2003 degrandi hoffman et al 1996 8 8 ¬∫c for olive melo abreu et al 2004 12 8 c for citrus darouich et al 2022b luo 2011 coops et al 2001 and 10¬∫c for pomegranate melgarejo et al 1997 again in line with the respective literature tree height table 5 and mean canopy width were monitored using a tape at the beginning of the initial mid season and late season as well as the non growing season the fc values are presented in table 5 and refer to the average values observed in each crop stage since no significant differences were found between the two monitored seasons trees in plots p1 and p2 almond fields were subjected to a light pruning at the beginning of january 2020 trees in plots p3 and p4 olive fields were pruned more intensively in february 2020 zr was assessed from observations in soil profiles lastly the interrow were monitored for the periods with active groundcover and for residues mulching when those plants dried out by the early summer the density and height of the interrow plants was assessed by visual analysis and the fraction of the ground covered by those plants fc cover was defined accordingly 2 3 modeling approach 2 3 1 model description the soil water balance simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 has been extensively described in several publications namely relative to its use e g pereira et al 2015a 2020b pa√ßo et al 2019 darouich et al 2022a 2022b therefore only the main features of the modeling approach are given here the soil water balance at the field scale is performed daily as follows 1 d r i d r i 1 p ro i i i cr i dp i et c act i where dr is the root zone depletion mm given by the difference between soil water content at field capacity and actual soil moisture conditions p is the rainfall mm ro is the runoff mm i is the net irrigation depth mm cr is the capillary rise from the groundwater table mm dp is the deep percolation mm and etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm all referring to day i or i 1 in this application cr was not considered as the groundwater table was too deep 4 2 m to contribute to crop evapotranspiration following the fao56 dual kc approach allen et al 1998 2005 pereira et al 2020b the etc mm is estimated by computing the components relative to crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm separately 2 t c k s k cb et o 3 e s k e et o where kcb is the standard basal crop coefficient that refers primarily to crop transpiration although some diffusive soil evaporation may also be included particularly during the initial crop stage ke is the evaporation coefficient that describes direct evaporation from the surface soil layer of depth ze cm eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm computed with the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and ks is a multiplier stress coefficient describing the impact of water and salinity stressors on crop evapotranspiration ks 1 when no stress occurs and actual crop transpiration rates tc act mm match their potential values tc mm ks 1 and tc act tc when crops are subjected to water and or salinity stress in this application the ks was computed following pereira et al 2007 and minhas et al 2020 4 k s taw salt d r taw salt raw salt 1 b k y 100 ec e ec e threshold where tawsalt and rawsalt are the total and readily available water mm corrected for salinity relative to the root zone soil depth zr m ece threshold is the crop tolerance salinity threshold value ds m 1 where crop growth and production starts to decline b is the percentage of crop yield reduction per unit increase in ece above the ece threshold ds m 1 and ky is the yield response factor that describes the relationship between the relative yield decrease and the relative evapotranspiration deficit stewart et al 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 parameter values were updated by minhas et al 2020 the first term on the right side of the previous equation corresponds to the water matric stress when dr i rawsalt the second one is used to correct the former for the effects of salinity osmotic stress i e when ece ece threshold relative to the considered crop as follows 5 taw salt Œ∏ fc Œ∏ wp salt 1000 z r 6 raw salt p salt taw and 7 Œ∏ wp salt Œ∏ wp b 100 ec e ec e threshold 10 Œ∏ fc Œ∏ wp 8 p salt p b ec e ec e threshold p where Œ∏fc is the soil water content at the field capacity m3 m 3 Œ∏wp is the soil water content at the wilting point m3 m 3 zr is the crop root depth m and Œ∏wp salt and psalt are respectively the soil water content at the wilting point and the depletion fraction for no stress p after correction for salinity successful applications of this approach can be found in rosa et al 2016 for maize and sorghum in portugal and liu et al 2022a 2022b for maize in china soil evaporation is computed through consideration of the energy available at the soil surface and water availability in the evaporative soil layer the two stage evaporation model of ritchie 1972 is adopted with the first stage corresponding to the energy limited stage and the second to the water limited stage allen et al 1998 2005 pereira et al 2020b in this approach the ke is computed as 9 k e k r k c max k cb min f ew k c max and kr as follows 10 k r 1 for d e i 1 rew 11 k r tew d e i 1 tew rew for d e i 1 rew where kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient kc max is the maximum value of kc i e kcb ke following rain or irrigation events few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to solar radiation and wetted by rain or irrigation and which depends upon the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation near solar noon fc eff tew is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the evaporation soil layer when it has been completely wetted mm rew is the depth of water that can be easily evaporated without water availability restrictions mm and de is the evaporation layer depletion at the end of day i 1 mm the computation of de implies computing the daily soil water balance for the evaporative soil layer deep percolation dp is estimated using a time decay function relating the soil water storage near saturation with the time after the occurrence of heavy rain or irrigation liu et al 2006 12 w a a d t b d where wa is the actual soil water storage in the root zone mm ad is the soil water storage comprised between Œ∏s and Œ∏fc bd is an empirical dimensionless parameter and t is the time after irrigation or rain that produces storage above field capacity days surface runoff is estimated using the widely used curve number cn approach allen et al 2007 usda scs 1972 for tree crops and vineyards the kcb values include the characteristics of the main crop and the understory vegetation while they are obtained from model calibration the kcb values can be divided into their components as follows pereira et al 2020a 2021c allen and pereira 2009 13 k cb k cb gcover k d max k cb full k cb gcover k cb full k cb gcover 2 where kcb gcover is the kcb of the ground cover vegetation in the absence of tree foliage kcb full is the estimated basal kc during peak plant growth for conditions having nearly full ground cover and kd is the crop density coefficient the second term of the max function reduces the estimate for kcb during the mid season stage by half the difference between kcb full and kcb cover when this difference is negative this accounts for impacts of the shading of the surface cover by overstory vegetation having a kcb that is lower than that of the ground cover due to differences in stomatal conductance when no ground cover exists or when the cover crop dries out becoming a less dense residual mulch the previous equation is simplified by replacing kcb cover with the minimum kc for bare soil kc min 0 15 the kcb full is estimated primarily as a function of crop height and then adjusted for tree crops using a reduction factor fr estimated from the mean leaf stomatal resistance pereira et al 2020a the density coefficient kd is estimated from the fraction of ground cover as follows 14 k d min 1 m l f c eff f c eff 1 1 h where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation near solar noon ml is a multiplier on fc eff 1 5 2 0 describing the effect of the canopy density on shading and on maximum relative evapotranspiration per fraction of ground shaded to simulate the physical limits imposed on water flux through the plant root stem and leaf systems and h is the mean height of trees m successful applications of this approach can be found in darouich et al 2022a 2022b for grapevine and citrus and pa√ßo et al 2019 2014 for olive 2 3 2 model setup the computation of the soil water balance in each study orchard required comprehensive data on weather conditions soil properties crop phenology ground conditions active ground cover and or mulch irrigation events and performance of irrigation systems to feed the simdualkc model soil data included the particle size distribution and Œ∏fc and Œ∏wp of the different layers in each soil profile as well as the mean ece of the entire rootzone table 2 tawsalt was then computed as the sum of the product of the difference between Œ∏fc and Œ∏wp relative to the different soil layers of the rootzone of depth zr table 5 while adjusting to salinity conditions when ece ece threshold minhas et al 2020 rosa et al 2016 this adjustment was specified for the initial conditions and the dates when ece data was available from sampling then tawsalt and the corresponding rawsalt varied linearly between two successive dates depending on whether salinity levels were above crop tolerance thresholds along the growing seasons if these conditions were not observed no salinity adjustment was required the tew rew and the depth of the evaporative soil layer ze m were set up according to the textural and hydraulic properties of the surface soil layer allen et al 1998 2005 the deep percolation parameters ad and bd were defined according to soil texture and soil hydraulic properties liu et al 2006 the cn values for computing runoff were set up based on the texture of the surface soil layer soil surface conditions and land use usda scs 1972 lastly the initial soil water depletion values in both the root zone and the evaporative soil layer corresponded to field measurements table 6 crop data included the observed dates of the initial development mid season and late season stages as well as the non growing periods table 4 also included were the corresponding kcb values for the initial kcb ini mid season kcb mid end season kcb end and non growing periods kcb non growing the kcb default values were computed following pereira et al 2021c by considering the management system in each orchard and the fc and h measured in each crop stage table 5 for each management class the central fr value of the proposed range of values was selected the soil water depletion fraction values for no stress for the same crop stages pini pmid pend were set up following allen et al 1998 crop state variables such as h fc and zr were defined for each crop stage according to observations table 5 lastly the ky ece threshold and b values were taken from the literature ayers and westcot 1985 allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 for almonds the ky was 0 70 the ece threshold was 1 5 ds m 1 and b was 19 ds m 1 for olive and pomegranate the ky was 0 75 the ece threshold was 4 0 ds m 1 and b was 16 ds m 1 for citrus ky was 1 20 the ece threshold was 1 7 ds m 1 and b was 16 ds m 1 ground cover conditions were defined based on observations and included the periods with active ground cover usually during the rainy season i e from october to may and with residues mulching due to falling leaves or when the row and interrow weeds dried out in almond plots p1 and p2 the active ground cover was present only in the interrow with a density of 20 a fraction of ground cover fc cover of 0 30 and a maximum height hcover of 0 15 m in olive plots p3 and p4 the density of the active ground cover in the interrow ranged from 20 to 30 and the fc cover varied from 0 20 to 0 30 with hcover of 0 25 lower values were always observed in p3 in both fields there was only a residual presence of active ground cover along the trees row no active ground cover was observed in the p5 olive plot in citrus p6 p7 and p8 and pomegranate p9 plots the density of the active ground cover in the row and interrow varied from 20 to 50 the fc cover was from 0 20 to 0 50 and the hcover was from 0 20 m p7 to 0 50 m p9 in all fields the evaporation reduction due to the residues mulch was ranging from 40 p1 and p2 to 60 p9 the dates of irrigation events and depths applied were input according to observations the fractions of the soil surface wetted by irrigation fw were also defined according to field measurements table 3 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the simdualkc model followed the same iterative trial and error procedure described in pereira et al 2015b which consists of adjusting groups of combined model parameters one at a time and within reasonable ranges of values until deviations between model simulations and field measurements of soil water contents in the rootzone are minimized calibration was carried out for each of the studied orchards using the 2019 dataset validation was then performed using the calibrated parameters and the 2020 dataset model calibration started by first adjusting the kcb and the corresponding p values for each crop stage then the ad and bd parameters of liu et al 2006 parametric functions followed by ze tew and rew and lastly the cn value the ece threshold b and ky model parameters did not require adjustment model calibration ended when the best fit was reached i e when the errors of prediction did not change from one iteration to the next if that goal was not achieved at the end of a modification cycle the calibration process restarted again the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between observed oi and predicted pi soil water content values were also those proposed and described by pereira et al 2015b the regression coefficient of the linear regression through the origin b0 the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression between observed and predicted values the root mean square error rmse the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of the observed data nrmse the percent bias of estimation pbias and the modeling efficiency nse the full description of these indicators can be found in moriasi et al 2007 legates and mccabe 1999 and nash and sutcliffe 1970 in general b0 equal to 1 indicates that the predicted values are statistically identical to field measurements r2 values close to 1 show that the model well explains the variance of the observations rmse and nrmse values close to zero indicate that estimation errors are small and model predictions are excellent pbias values close to zero describe accurate model simulations while negative or positive values indicate over or under estimation bias respectively nse values close to 1 mean that model predictions are good because the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance contrarily if nse 0 the observed mean is a better estimator than model predictions 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization table 7 presents the calibrated model parameters relative to the nine case studies the default kcb values for the initial mid and end of season stages were set up following pereira et al 2021c by considering the characteristics that most approached crop management in each field as well as the fc and h values measured in each crop stage however as the kcb values are much dependent on observed values of fc and h pereira et al 2020a 2021c as well as on interrow management darouich et al 2022a the calibrated ones ended up varying to a greater or lesser extent from the default values in olive trees the calibrated fractions of soil water depletion for no stress p values were always below those proposed by allen et al 1998 for the different crop stages they were also lower than those in pa√ßo et al 2019 but higher than in santos 2018 in almonds only the pini and pmid values differed from allen et al 1998 larger in both cases on the other hand the calibrated p values in citrus and pomegranate orchards always matched those in allen et al 1998 the remaining calibrated parameters i e the soil evaporation parameters ze tew and rew the percolation parameters ad and bd from liu s et al 2006 parametric equations and the cn value for computing runoff were found to have values in agreement with the soil textural and the soil hydraulic characteristics of each case study field 3 2 model performance fig 4 and fig 5 show the fitting of the daily measured soil water contents swc by the simdualkc simulated values in the nine commercial orchards during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons the figures also include the depths and dates of irrigation and rainfall events the figures further reflect the diverse management applied in the monitored fields in the almond fields fig 4 the swc dynamics differed between sites with swc in p1 dropping below Œ∏p in both seasons soil salinity was monitored in 2019 a dry year which partially explains that swc drop below Œ∏p in p2 the measured ece values were never above the ece threshold for almonds and the swc values were always kept within the raw limits in the olive fields fig 4 the swc also dropped to values below Œ∏p for extended periods during both irrigation seasons which indicates that trees were subjected to mild water stress during most of the mid and late season stages no salinity stress was ever noticed in these sites contrastingly swc in citrus fields fig 5 were systematically above Œ∏fc during irrigation periods thus clearly showing that over irrigation was practiced this assumption was confirmed when observing table 3 which shows that high water depths were applied over both seasons especially in the mandarin field p8 the same was observed in the pomegranate case in 2020 where swc was continuously monitored above Œ∏fc during the irrigation season the results above indicate that farmers adopt a poor irrigation scheduling and that there is the need to develop and propose to farmers the adoption of water saving schedules as the ones presented later the box plots in fig 6 present the mean ece values measured in all fields along the two seasons results differ from a plot to another and their variability is supposed to differently influence soil water availability p1 was greatly affected by soil salinity mainly during the 2019 season so affecting the almond crop which is sensitive to soil salinity ece threshold 1 5 ds m 1 in this field ece measurements performed along the season were systematically higher than the crop tolerance salinity threshold 3 62 ds m 1 on may 24th 2019 2 80 ds m 1 on october 31st 2019 and 1 90 ds m 1 on december 12th 2019 resulting in an increase of the osmotic stress and decrease of soil water availability in all other fields soil salinity did not increase to levels above the crop tolerance thresholds except for some short periods in case of p2 1 69 ds m 1 on august 24th 2020 p7 2 42 ds m 1 on december 11th 2019 and p8 2 81 ds m 1 on december 11th 2019 and 2 06 ds m 1 on may 5th 2020 p9 in a luvic planosol i e where the soil has the poorest drainage conditions among all case studies registered the highest salinity levels 4 04 ds m 1 on december 11th 2019 but because pomegranate is highly tolerant to salinity stress there was no noticeable impact on swc the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between simulated and measured swc values are presented in table 8 for the calibration year 2019 the regression coefficients b0 were all close to the 1 0 target ranging from 0 98 p1 to 1 02 p8 indicating that the simulated values were close to the observed ones the value of r2 varied from 0 53 p6 to 0 84 p7 showing that generally the model could explain most of the variance of the observed data the errors of the estimates were always small 0 001 rmse 0 005 m3 m 3 and 0 004 nrmse 0 019 in agreement with b0 the pbias values were quite small 1 43 pbias 2 04 with no particular over or under estimation trend in simulating the measured data lastly the nse values were relatively high ranging from 0 408 p4 to 0 782 p5 thus indicating that the variance of the residuals was smaller than the measured data variance for validation with 2020 data the goodness of fit indicators showed generally the same trend and similar range of values as observed for calibration the worst statistics were obtained in p2 while the best indicators were in p3 hence overall the simdualkc model performed well when simulating swc in the nine case studies relative to the four tree crops the resulting goodness of fit indicators were also within the ranges of values reported in the literature for simdualkc applications to perennial crops e g pa√ßo et al 2019 and puig sirera et al 2021 for olive darouich et al 2022b for clementine rosa 2018 for lemon and peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 for orange thus the obtained results may be considered appropriate for the analysis reported herein 3 3 assessing crop coefficients and crop water use 3 3 1 almond orchards for almond the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end were calibrated to 0 22 0 58 and 0 50 respectively table 7 no differences were noticed between the two locations p1 and p2 which were nearby trees were 5 years old table 1 thus corresponding to the mature stage in almond trees drechsler et al 2022 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 garc√≠a tejero et al 2015 mid season fc and h values of 0 41 0 42 and 4 0 m respectively and end season fc and h values of 0 20 and 4 0 m were observed table 5 the calibrated kcb mid was close to the indicative value 0 60 tabulated by pereira et al 2021c which correspond to a fc of 0 40 0 50 and h of 4 0 5 0 m the kcb mid was also close to the kcb mid of 0 60 reported by espadafor et al 2015 with 4 years old trees fc of 0 60 and h of 4 8 m likewise l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 reported kcb mid of 0 55 and 0 68 for 6 and 7 years old almond trees with fc of 0 55 and 0 59 respectively and h of 4 8 m in s√°nchez et al 2021 the low fc of 0 41 observed corresponded to a small kcb mid of 0 36 however rallo et al 2021 reported similar kcb mid for almond orchards with fc of 0 40 0 50 and h of 4 0 5 0 m these comparisons indicate that the orchards have a canopy and height smaller than expected for mature almonds orchard which may be due to short trees spacing heavy pruning and less appropriate training the previously referred salinity occurrence is nevertheless small and is not sufficient to justify the low development of the almond orchards which likely also result from poor soil fertility for the end season the calibrated kcb end 0 50 was higher than expected e g the values 0 40 proposed by rallo et al 2021 and corresponding to fc of 0 50 0 60 as tabulated by pereira et al 2021c the calibrated kcb end was also higher than in espadafor et al 2015 and l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 the large kcb end is likely due to irrigation applied much longer after harvesting which relates with the observed dryness of october november fig 7 shows the dynamics of the potential not stressed basal crop coefficients kcb in the two almond fields during both seasons in p1 the large drop observed in the kcb act in 2019 which translates the reduction of the tc act relative to tc was likely explained by water and salinity stress when measured ece was higher than the ece threshold in the next year 2020 no salinity stress occurred but the kcb act failed again to reach the potential kcb values due to deficient irrigation scheduling during the dry summer season water stress in almond trees is reported to reduce vegetative growth and canopy size also affecting the accumulation of reserves during the growing season water shortages during the kernel filling stage may reduce nut weight and may affect fruit loads in the next season l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 goldhamer and girona 2012 this likely occurred in p1 while in p2 the kcb act matched the kcb values throughout both seasons i e no water or salinity stresses were observed fig 7 further shows the dynamics of the soil evaporation coefficients ke in both fields and seasons the ke could only be indirectly influenced by the salinity stress if fc would be affected and consequently increase the soil surface exposure to solar radiation rosa et al 2016 as salinity stress was only transient likely resulting from some more intensive fertigation events rather than soil groundwater or irrigation water quality related causes the fc was apparently not affected the dynamics of the ke values were the same in both p1 and p2 fields showing multiple high peaks during the rainfall seasons when the entire soil surface was wet fw 1 and quite low values during the irrigation seasons when the resulting soil wetted fraction was small fw 0 12 because of drip irrigation the kc curves as well as the kcb curves fig 7 resulted similar to those for olives with kcb higher in spring summer when transpiration is higher and kc high in fall and winter when rain occurs and small in summer when rain is rare 3 3 2 olive orchards the calibrated kcb for each crop stage of olive varied only slightly in the three fields p3 p4 and p5 with kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end assuming values of 0 32 0 33 0 35 0 36 and 0 33 0 34 respectively table 7 trees were 11 12 years old with mid season fc and h values of 0 23 0 27 and 3 0 4 1 m respectively and end season fc and h values of 0 20 0 23 and 2 8 4 0 m respectively table 5 the calibrated kcb mid values were slightly lower than the indicative value 0 40 tabulated by pereira et al 2021c for olive orchards with fc of 0 35 and h of 3 5 m they were also lower than the proposed value 0 40 in rallo et al 2021 for orchards with fc of 0 20 0 30 and h of 3 0 3 5 m apparently when compared with existing reviews fc and h values were expected to be larger thus values now reported may be due to excessive pruning and less good training more adequate values were obtained when applying the allen pereira a p approach allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020a 2021c using observed fc and h values on the other hand the calibrated kcb end was consistent with the indicative values in pereira et al 2021c and rallo et al 2021 yet the existing literature shows a wide range of variation of the kcb in mature olive orchards with calibrated kcb mid values approaching those in villalobos et al 2000 for a traditional orchard cv picual in southern spain with 278 trees ha 1 fc 0 3 and h 4 0 while the kcb end values were relatively higher likely because irrigation in the study orchards was extended until the end of october beginning of november differently the calibrated kcb mid were lower while the kcb end approached the values reported in puig sirera et al 2021 for a traditional orchard in sicily italy with 250 trees ha 1 fc 0 35 and h 3 5 kcb values in concei√ß√£o et al 2017 and santos 2018 were also comparable to those in this study these authors estimated the kcb of olive orchards with similar characteristics trees 8 10 years old 300 trees ha 1 fc 0 25 h 3 5 3 7 m in the alentejo region using sap flow measurements the major contrast between olive and almond fields was in the dynamics of the kcb act with daily values in olive departing from the potential kcb between may all plots in 2019 and july p5 in 2020 maintaining this condition up to the september fig 8 this agreed with various reports available in the literature addressing the relationship between olive oil yields and water application and confirming that oil yields are maximized at water application rates below 100 of full irrigation ahumada orellana et al 2018 hern√°ndez et al 2018 rosecrance et al 2015 ramos and santos 2010 moriana et al 2007 2003 grattan et al 2006 moderated water stress can also significantly reduce tree growth thus reducing shoot growth trunk growth and pruning weights these are however objectives for super intensive olive systems but likely too much stress has been imposed in the studied orchards which ended up limiting canopy development and fc values the dynamics of the ke were similar to that in the almond fields higher ke values were again noticed during winter when the entire soil surface was wetted decreasing during the irrigation season as the wetted area reduced since drip irrigation was wetting the soil mostly under the canopies the kc curves fig 8 are therefore similar to those reported by pa√ßo et al 2019 and puig sirera et al 2021 3 3 3 citrus orchards the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end for citrus were set to 0 40 0 41 and 0 41 respectively for the orange field p6 and to 0 40 0 40 and 0 40 respectively for the clementine p7 and mandarin p8 fields table 7 only minor differences were found between fields trees were 5 years old with fc varying from 0 25 to 0 29 along the growing seasons and relatively short with heights ranging from 2 4 m in p6 to 2 8 m in p8 table 5 the calibrated kcb values were comparable to those computed using the a p approach allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020a 2021c using the fc and h values listed in table 5 for the different crop stages however when compared to the indicative values in pereira et al 2021c and rallo et al 2021 the calibrated kcb mid were found to be lower than those tabulated by for citrus orchards with fc of 0 25 0 40 and h of 2 3 4 5 m citrus trees were thus likely trained small for easy harvesting which also resulted in small fc closer values kcb 0 45 were given in allen and pereira 2009 for citrus orchards with fc eff of 0 25 but with no ground cover which was not the case in p6 p7 and p8 the calibrated kcb values were also in close agreement with villalobos et al 2013 for 7 years old citrus trees fc of 0 27 and h equal to 2 30 m the remaining dedicated literature was carried out in larger citrus trees thus with larger fc and h showing consistently higher kcb values darouich et al 2022b jafari et al 2021 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 rallo et al 2017 taylor et al 2017 er raki et al 2009 in citrus fields p6 p7 and p8 irrigation was characterized by large application depths with seasonal values summing 548 mm p6 in 2019 to 1170 mm p8 in 2020 mm table 3 these depths were more than enough to meet tc values as a result no water stress was ever observed with the kcb act matching always kcb values in the three sites except when a slight salinity stress was noticed this succeeded in p7 and p8 when the measured ece was above the ece threshold of citrus for a short period december 2019 causing the respective kcb act values to slightly dropping from kcb fig 9 the dynamics of the ke followed also the same trends reported above considering that rainfall occurs in fall and winter but not in summer and that most of transpiration occurs in summer it resulted that kc curves are similar to those of olives differently because citrus trees are active throughout the season if not heavy stressed the kcb curve has a constant value as already detected in a previous application with clementine darouich et al 2022b 3 3 4 pomegranate the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end for pomegranate p9 were calibrated to 0 24 0 60 and 0 52 respectively table 7 trees were also 5 years old with mid season fc and h values of 0 41 and 2 5 m and end season fc and h values of 0 30 and 2 3 m respectively table 5 the calibrated kcb mid and kcb end were found to be higher than the indicative values in rallo et al 2021 for pomegranate orchards with fc of 0 35 0 45 and h of 2 5 3 5 m however a better agreement was noticed between the calibrated kcb mid and the upper class values given in rallo et al 2021 when fc is above 0 45 differently from the other crops results for kcb mid fitted well those tabulated by pereira et al 2021c but the kcb end was larger in the current study which may be due to excess irrigation during the late season kcb mid values reported by niu et al 2021 and noory et al 2021 likely were larger than in the current study but those authors did not provide for fc values intrigliolo et al 2021 reported also similar kcb mid but with a fc of 0 58 which was much larger than the observed one fig 10 shows the kcb act always equaling kcb values in the studied orchard despite high salinity ece values monitored in different dates along both growing seasons as such no water or salinity stress ever affected crop development nonetheless research has shown that moderate water deficits during flowering and fruit set may increase aril red for some cultivars without detrimental effects on marketable yield fruit size and chemical composition in addition for some cultivars during ripening and throughout the growing season moderate water deficits may improve the red color of the fruit peel and or juice but negatively affecting fruit weight and economic income volschenk 2020 mart√≠nez nicol√°s et al 2019 galindo et al 2017 intrigliolo et al 2013 yet more research is needed for the acco cultivar grown in p9 the kc and kcb curves fig 10 are similar to those of almonds also a deciduous tree since transpiration and soil evaporation have contrary dynamics due to summer dryness 3 4 single crop coefficients as indicators of crop water use table 9 summarizes the mean kc values computed from the sum of the computed kcb act and ke during the crop stages of each case study using the simdualkc model as already stated the crop coefficients developed for different irrigation systems and different cultivars in different countries cannot be simply transferred to local management due to the complex characteristics of orchard systems evidencing the necessity of conducting field research under local conditions rallo et al 2021 volschenk 2020 fereres et al 2012 the kc mean values depicted in table 9 follow typical trends observed in drip systems as already discussed in darouich et al 2022b for citrus and pa√ßo et al 2019 for olive orchards the kcb curves figs 7 10 result in fao segmented curves with generally higher kcb during the mid season when irrigation is applied spring and summer naturally curves have smaller kcb in the non growing period when transpiration is low or much low thus with the single kc segmented curve showing a dynamic opposed to that of kcb as discussed before relative to each crop because it also depends on soil evaporation and thus on the fraction of the wetted soil surface kc kcb ke is smaller during the active growing period when es and ke are low due to negligeable precipitation and irrigation water applied directly along the trees row in small areas shaded by the canopies contrarily kc is larger in fall and winter non growing season and initial and end season crop stages when rainfall occurs and the entire soil surface contributes to soil evaporation the adequacy of the kcb was already discussed in section 3 3 in the analysis it was evident that studies addressing the partition of the etc into its components are quite limited for some of the studied crops namely almond and pomegranate however more information is available regarding the kc values of these two crops for almond garc√≠a tejero et al 2018 provided a review of kc values published in the literature with many of their references reporting kc values for the mid season above 1 05 these values highly contrast with those in table 9 and the tabulated values in pereira et al 2021c and rallo et al 2021 such differences can be attributed to several factors i in those studies irrigation was delivered through micro sprinklers thus increasing the ke component in the kc ii most orchards were located in more fertile soils with trees exhibiting larger canopies that resulted in higher transpiration rates and a larger weight of the kcb component in kc goldhamer and fereres 2017 girona 2006 while soils in p1 and p2 luvisols are less fertile with a very high fraction of coarse elements 70 and iii yields in p1 and p2 were barely above 1 0 mg ha 1 while several publications report yields ranging from 1 8 to 4 0 mg ha 1 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 goldhamer and fereres 2017 girona 2006 fruit load may also impact kc and kcb values in almonds as observed by l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 who measured differences in the canopy conductance of trees with higher fruit load during the third year of observations despite the same canopy size as the previous years for olive kc mid values in table 9 were comparable to those reported by er raki et al 2008 for an orchard in morocco fc 0 6 h 6 0 and by l√≥pez olivari et al 2016 in chile fc 0 29 0 31 h 3 2 m yet those orchards characteristics differed considerably from those in the alentejo cases for citrus the kc mid values were in the range of values reported by castel 2000 consoli et al 2006 and er raki et al 2009 for orchards with fc ranging from 0 2 to 0 3 however the kc ini and kc end differ considerably from the available literature for pomegranate the mean kc values for the mid season approached those in intrigliolo et al 2011 and buesa et al 2012 for southern spain but were below those in ayars et al 2017 for california hence table 9 includes kc values adequate for irrigation water management of orchards in the alentejo region of southern portugal the approach adopted combines information provided by soil water content measurements and simulated with the state of the art simdualkc model to overcome the limitations of data collection and the impact of the three dimensionality of drip irrigation on soil measurements it is one of the most widely used methods for measuring crop evapotranspiration as reported in pereira et al 2020b and allen et al 2011 being validated against other methodologies namely sap flow pa√ßo et al 2019 2014 puig sirera et al 2020 still the proposed kc values need to be used with care with proper consideration of the specific characteristics of local orchards 3 5 evaluation of the soil water balance in the studied orchards 3 5 1 almond table 10 presents the soil water balance computed by simdualkc for the almond orchards p1 and p2 during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons seasonal net irrigation depths ranged from 596 to 772 mm with less water applied always in p1 than in p2 particularly in 2020 seasonal tc values were naturally equal or very close in both fields corresponding to 72 8 74 5 of the etc 880 907 mm however tc act values were remarkably different in p1 tc act values were always below the potential tc values amounting to 377 and 613 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively in p2 tc act values practically matched the potential tc values during both seasons 660 655 mm seasonal soil evaporation ranged from 224 to 237 mm corresponding to 25 5 27 2 of the etc and 26 6 38 1 of the etc act 609 837 mm in p1 907 892 mm in p2 while seasonal etc act values depend on tree age and size climate conditions interrow management and irrigation methods in p2 where no stress was observed etc act values were within the range of values reported in the literature for mature almond orchards they were comparable to the etc act values of 946 mm for a mature almond orchard 7 years old with 7 3 m 7 3 m tree spacing in arbuckle california usa in the early 1980 s fereres et al 1982 yet they were far below more recent records which refer to the need of 1250 mm for fully satisfying mature almond trees water needs and reaching maximum yields in the southern san joaquin valley of california usa goldhamer and fereres 2017 seasonal percolation differed also between fields in p1 the impact of the salinity stress on transpiration rates resulted in an increase in percolation losses in the drier season of 2019 compared to 2020 as shown in fig 11 in that year most of the estimated percolation values occurred during the irrigation season about 73 because of the osmotic stress impact on root water uptake obviously the percolated water could have helped leach salts away from the rootzone thus decreasing the impact of the salinity stress on crop transpiration this cannot be simulated in simdualkc except by providing inputs of the ece in the rootzone throughout the crop growing season however field measurements of the ece in 2019 were always higher than the crop tolerance salinity threshold in 2020 percolation resulted mostly from rainfall also noticeable was that about 10 and 36 of percolation losses occurred in the late season stage of 2019 and 2020 seasons respectively because of late irrigation events often combined with rainfall depths above the soil s water holding capacity in p2 higher percolation values were found as expected in the 2020 rainier season when also some losses from irrigation events were noticed likely the farmer of p1 adopted a more adequate irrigation schedule 3 5 2 olive soil water dynamics in olive fields p3 p4 and p5 were remarkably different than in the almonds cases seasonal irrigation depths were smaller ranging from 266 to 357 mm table 10 seasonal tc values were also lower than for almonds summing 427 445 mm during both growing seasons 65 4 69 9 of the etc which evidence the lower water requirements of olives compared to almonds differences between olive plots were related to planting densities and lengths of crop stages of the different varieties the major contrast between olive and almond fields was in the dynamics of the tc act and kcb act as discussed in section 3 3 2 tc reductions due to water stress ended up varying from 4 0 p3 in 2020 to 23 6 p5 in 2019 no salinity stress was ever registered with the monitored ece always below the crop s salinity tolerance threshold seasonal soil evaporation ranged from 192 to 226 mm corresponding to 30 1 34 6 of the etc 626 655 mm and 33 2 37 7 of the etc act 532 619 mm the weight of soil evaporation on crop evapotranspiration was thus slightly higher than in the almond fields runoff 10 50 mm and percolation 9 174 mm resulted mostly from rainfall events fig 12 it is likely that olive farmers skills are better since irrigation of olives is practiced for a longer time than in almonds 3 5 3 citrus in citrus fields p6 p7 and p8 irrigation was characterized by large application depths with seasonal values summing from 548 mm p6 in 2019 to 1170 mm p8 in 2020 mm table 10 these depths were more than enough to meet tc values which only ranged from 499 p7 in 2020 to 516 mm p6 in 2019 corresponding to 66 4 74 1 of the etc no water stress was ever observed while the salinity stress was only minor and affecting p7 and p8 for a very short period december 2019 fig 9 seasonal soil evaporation ranged from 180 to 258 mm corresponding to 25 9 33 6 of the etc deep percolation had a large weight compared to the other outputs of the soil water balance the large percolation values which the simdualkc estimated to range from 177 to 526 mm in the orange field p6 to 517 899 mm in the mandarin field p8 confirmed the excess water application contrarily to observations in almond and olive orchards the percolation in citrus fields mainly occurred during the irrigation season fig 13 when 66 0 p6 in 2020 to 84 4 p8 in 2020 of the seasonal percolation amounts were computed it also corresponded to 32 3 p6 in 2019 to 76 8 p8 in 2020 of the total irrigation water applied the results of the water balance in the citrus fields have obviously no other justification than complete mismanagement of irrigation water it is known that citrus trees can endure mild moderate water stress except for the most critical growth stages which are the flowering and fruit growth periods garc√≠a tejero et al 2012 for this reason deficit irrigation practices have long been evaluated in the main citrus production areas due to limited water resource availability pag√°n et al 2022 rallo et al 2017 ballester et al 2011 garc√≠a tejero et al 2011 better management practices need thus to be implemented in the three commercial orchards 3 5 4 pomegranate pomegranate is far less studied than the crops above which highlights the importance of the respective monitoring p9 the seasonal irrigation depth reached 654 mm in 2019 and 694 mm in 2020 table 10 these values are below the 848 and 932 mm applied by surface drip in trees of similar age of the cultivar wonderful in california ayars et al 2017 their totals are also within the range of depths 392 776 mm reported for cultivars mollar de elche and wonderful 7 13 years old grown in soils with different textures in southern spain as reviewed by volschenk 2020 seasonal tc values amounted 649 2019 and 637 mm 2020 corresponding respectively to 74 8 and 74 2 of the etc these seasonal values were lower than those reported in ayars et al 2017 for trees of the same age 912 953 mm grown in california no water or salinity stresses were noticed in the pomegranate orchard even if the monitored ece values were in general the highest of all cases seasonal soil evaporation corresponded to 25 2 219 mm and 25 8 222 mm of the etc in 2019 and 2020 respectively more significant percolation was computed in 2020 with approximately 37 of the seasonal amount occurring during the irrigation season which corresponded to 39 of the water applied fig 14 thus despite better than for citrus there is room for improvement and water saving 3 6 searching improved water use with simdualkc fig 15 exemplifies the evolution of the kcb act ke and kc act in selected plots p1 p5 p8 and p9 when considering a mild deficit irrigation scheduling scenario the soil water balance is then presented for all plots in table 11 the mild deficit scenario included the same dates of the crop stages in each growing season as well as the previously calibrated model parameters irrigation triggering was set for a management allowable depletion mad of 1 05 Œ∏p while irrigation depths were set to 5 mm following the observed data in table 3 no salinity effects were considered due to its transient nature table 11 shows a reduction of the tc act values of 3 0 p5 p7 and p8 in 2020 to 5 2 p1 in 2019 relative to the tc values thus with no effect on crop yields considering the tolerance of the study crops to mild water deficits as explained above percolation estimates returned the greatest contrast when compared with the farmers schedules with reductions reaching 63 98 in the almond fields 17 58 in the olive fields 82 100 in the citrus fields and 70 98 in the pomegranate field this confirms that most of percolation losses were due to poor irrigation scheduling all other components of the water balance showed similar estimates as those obtained when analysing the farmers schedules as such the mild deficit irrigation scheduling scenario shows possible water savings of 20 mm in case of olives up to 855 mm for citrus yet for olive water savings were naturally only possible when the observed water stress was less pronounced than the one considered in the modeling scenario 4 conclusions the current paper presents and discusses estimates of crop evapotranspiration in nine commercial orchards in the alentejo region of southern portugal the crops addressed were almonds olive citrus orange clementine and mandarin and pomegranate in all case studies crop evapotranspiration was estimated by computing the soil water balance following the fao56 dual kc approach adopted in the simdualkc model i e through the partition of crop evapotranspiration into its components crop transpiration and soil evaporation the model may be considered one of the most adequate solutions for computing the water balance in such complex agricultural systems it is able to estimate the kcb at various crop stages taking into consideration the crop density through a density coefficient kd which is a function of fc and h in addition it accounts for the effects of interrow management active ground cover and mulching namely dried understory plants and falling leaves and soil conditions mainly soil salinity on actual transpiration rates the model successfully simulated the soil water contents measured in the different fields along two growing seasons with root mean square error values lower than 0 005 m3 m 3 and modeling efficiencies from 0 363 to 0 782 for almonds differences to the literature were noticed especially for the kc and when compared to almond orchards from california which were mainly attributed to the irrigation management soil fertility fruit load training and crop height and canopy size salinity levels in one of the fields during the 2019 growing season led to significant water uptake reductions resulting most likely from intensive fertigation mismanagement for olive small differences in the kcb and kc values were noticed between the three case studies which were related to the fraction of the ground covered by the trees canopies and height mild water stress conditions were noticed in the three monitored fields generally corresponding to a water saving strategy with no impact on oil yields in citrus fields the estimated kcb and kc values were relatively small when compared with the existing literature which was justified by orchards training monitoring of irrigation practices in the three case studies showed a large excess irrigation water application with translated into large percolation losses lastly for pomegranate information on the partition of the etc was quite limited and as far as we know this is one of the first studies assessing separately the dynamics of the kcb and ke in this crop like in the citrus fields excess application of irrigation water was observed but without the same magnitude of losses estimated for the clementine and mandarin fields this study provides more accurate kc values for the orchard systems in the roxo irrigation district thus also providing for improving irrigation water management in the alentejo region a proper characterization of evapotranspiration fluxes and dynamics was needed for further studies namely the assessment of soil salinization and nutrient leaching risks resulting from current agricultural practices with these aims data and parameterization obtained in this study were used with the calibrated model simdualkc to develop alternative irrigation management issues mainly improved schedules results show a potential water saving of 82 292 mm for almond 20 mm for olive 193 855 mm for citrus particularly for mandarin and 144 220 mm for pomegranate however modeling tools are insufficient for improving irrigation and it is desirable that farmers are trained including in their computing skills and that support on the various orchard management issues namely relative to water and fertility become available thus contributing to better facing global change challenges declaration of competing interest

9067,subsurface drainage is one of the most commonly used water table management practices in the midwest u s subirrigation through the subsurface drainage system using drainage water recycling dwr was developed to meet crop production goals and address environmental concerns the objective of this study was to examine differences in soil properties after seven years of subsurface drainage treatments no drainage nd drainage only do and drainage plus subirrigation dwr in continuous corn production in knox county missouri soil samples were collected at 0 10 11 20 21 40 and 41 60 cm depths periodically from 2015 to 2021 and were analyzed for soil ph cations cation exchange capacity cec nitrate n no3 n phosphorus p organic matter om total carbon tc bulk density bd penetration resistance and soil texture a significant shift in soil texture from 2015 to 2021 was observed with a 26 and 11 increase in the clay content at a 41 60 cm soil depth in dwr and do treatments respectively compared to nd accelerated soil om and tc mineralization was observed with dwr which may be due to soil acidification increased soil moisture and aeration compared to do and nd this was further supported by increased cec at deeper soil depths in addition increased reservoir water ph and electrical conductivity in 2016 and 2017 may have amplified the water table fluctuation effects on soil properties the mean concentration of sodium na potassium k bicarbonate sulfate nitrate and phosphate were in an acceptable range for use as irrigation water in conclusion continuous corn production

management practice throughout the midwestern united states to meet crop production goals fausey et al 1995 blann et al 2009 skaggs et al 1994 the function of a drainage system in floodplain soils is to remove excess water in the soil profile and maintain a sufficient water level in the root zone to maximize crop production a drainage water recycling dwr system includes installation of water level control structures in the outflow pipe to prevent excessive drainage while the reservoir component captures and stores surface and or subsurface runoff for future use as irrigation water frankenberger et al 2017 hay et al 2021 during the crop growing season reservoir water and dissolved nutrients are pumped into subsurface tile drains to provide irrigation water to the crop root zone tan et al 2007 this system utilizes dwr to mitigate drought and reduce agriculture non point source pollution tan et al 1993 drury et al 1996 hay et al 2021 the few existing studies of dwr within tile drained agriculture fields have shown encouraging results in missouri and ohio the implementation of dwr increased corn zea mays l grain yield 14 50 and soybean glycine max l yield between 7 and 29 compared to free drained or non drained treatments nelson et al 2011 nelson and smoot 2012 allred et al 2014 hay et al 2021 kaur et al 2021 singh and nelson 2021 water quality benefits of dwr systems have been documented with average nitrogen n reductions from 40 to 70 drury et al 1996 2009 and phosphorus p reductions between 12 and 36 tan and zhang 2011 tan et al 2007 globally 146 mha of arable land is poorly drained and could benefit from drainage water management to improve soil physical properties and reduce erosion losses nakajima and lal 2014 randall and iragavarapu 1995 in poorly drained soils crop production is adversely affected by a lack of aeration and increased concentration of carbon dioxide and methane lal taylor 1970 therefore drainage water management is important to improve soil physical qualities reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and improve crop growth development and yield the removal of excess soil water with a subsurface drainage system has resulted in improved soil physical properties tan et al 2007 drainage water management systems can impact soil physical and hydrological properties such as aggregate stability pore size distribution and improve soil water content swc frankenberger et al 2017 in addition drainage and subirrigation of soil can increase or decrease the amount of air filled porosity due to the movement and deposition of fine silt and clay particles thus affecting microporosity in subsurface soil fausey and baker 2003 furthermore water table alterations can affect soil structure baker et al 2004 by shifting pore size distribution and changing the soil water air ratio van hoorn 1958 since the water table depth is closer to the soil surface this can result in fewer macropores in the soil chieng and hughes games 1995 subsurface drainage is the most commonly used drainage water management practice but subirrigation using dwr has recently been adopted as a means to enhance crop production resiliency and improve water quality due to widespread concerns about the effect of agricultural management practices on soil and water quality drainage water management effects on soil properties remains a priority research area few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of water table management on soil physical properties chieng and hughes games 1995 fausey et al 1986 lal and fausey 1993 van hoorn 1958 however the effect of drainage water management on soil properties under no till agriculture systems is scarce abid and lal 2008 2009 a limited number of field research studies with drainage and dwr systems have evaluated the impact of these water management practices on soil properties the aim of this study was to examine the effect of free drainage fd and dwr systems on soil properties compared to non drained nd soils in continuous corn production in a floodplain soil of upstate missouri we hypothesize that including different drainage system will lead variation in soil moisture and aeration which can affect mineralization of soil om thus can change soil properties over years 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design this research was conducted at the university of missouri drainage and subirrigation site muds near novelty in knox county missouri usa between 2015 and 2021 the soil series at the site was a blackoar silt loam fine silty mixed superactive mesic

content in 2017 2018 and 2019 in 2016 data were collected in june september and december data were divided into three seasons based on drainage water management season 1 included the period from december 1 march 31 when dwr was in controlled drainage mode during season 2 dwr was in free drainage mode from april 1 may 31 in season 3 june 1 october 31 dwr was in subirrigation and free drainage mode depending on precipitation monitoring was carried out throughout the year with the soil moisture sensors that were installed between surface tile lines in the fd and dwr treatments and randomly in the nd treatment of both replications differences in soil volumetric water content between treatments were demonstrated by calculating the cumulative soil volumetric content for each season cumulative soil volumetric content was calculated for each replication in every treatment average soil volumetric water content from december to october in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 is presented in fig 1 this data helped determine differences in soil moisture content in different seasons under different treatments and how it interacted with soil properties between years 2 3 statistical analysis the average standard deviation standard error median and range were determined for irrigation water quality data using the univariate procedure in sas sas institute inc cary n c the values for these parameters are presented in table 1 the values of different water quality parameters over years are reported in fig 2 the cumulative soil volumetric water content were analyzed separately for each season using the glimmix model in sas with treatment as a fixed effect and replication as a random effect the average cumulative soil volumetric content by season along with p values are reported in table 2 differences in soil properties in response to the effects of drainage water management and soil sampling depth were analyzed using the glimmix model in sas treatment year and soil sampling depth were considered as fixed effects and replication was a random effect treatment means and interactions were separated using t grouping of the least square means at p 0 05 due to a lower number of replications soil health data were analyzed at Œ± 0 1 the p values for dependent variables are presented in tables 3 and 4 soil volumetric water content was analyzed separately for season and depth for each year 3 results and discussion 3 1 reservoir water quality 2016 2019 the water quality parameters in the dwr reservoir varied over years fig 2 the ph average across years was 7 5 with a range of 6 8 7 8 table 1 the ph was lowest in 2016 ph 6 8 and highest in 2019 ph 7 8 representing a continuous increasing trend over the years samples were collected the university of missouri extension recommended a ph range for irrigation water from 6 5 to 8 4 salinity of water is measured as electrical conductivity ec bauder et al 2011 in the literature water salinity has been reported as decisiemens per meter ds m 1 or as total dissolved solids in milligrams per liter tds mg l 1 electrical conductivity of irrigation water was between 0 15 and 0 22 ds m 1and tds was in the range of 99 149 mg l 1 electrical conductivity of water below 0 25 ds m 1 is considered good for irrigation purposes the mean concentration of soluble ions over the study years were cl at 9 mg l 1 no3 n at 1 1 mg l 1 so4 s at 6 6 mg l 1 po4 p at 0 15 mg l 1 k at 7 5 mg l 1 and na at 0 6 mg l 1 overall there was a decreasing trend in ion concentrations except in 2017 and 2018 fig 2 the increase in ion concentrations in the reservoir may have occurred due to the high volume of water used for irrigation for this research and other on site research specifically kaur et al 2021 reported that the amount of irrigation water applied during the growing season in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 45 77 137 and 30 mm respectively similarly hco3 in water followed the same pattern with an average concentration of 74 5 mg l 1 and the highest concentration of 92 mg l 1 in 2017 in missouri hco3 90 mg l 1 in water is considered safe for irrigation water use with a slight to moderate risk at hco3 90 520 mg l 1 schultheis 2017 3 2 soil volumetric water content 2016 2019 the total precipitation amounts during 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were 787 878 851 and 1297 mm respectively fig 3 the 2019 water year was wetter compared to the others the daily average soil volumetric water content from different treatments at the 10 20 40 and 60 cm soil depths is presented in fig 3 the average cumulative soil volumetric water content and p values for each season and different soil depths are reported in table 2 no significant difference in soil volumetric water content among treatments at different depths was observed in 2018 data not presented significant differences among treatments were observed at the 20 cm depth in 2016 and 2017 and at the 40 cm depth in 2019 table 2 during the crop growing season season 3 in 2016 cumulative soil volumetric water content was significantly higher p 0 0078 at the 20 cm soil depth in nd plots compared to dwr and do treatments this was expected because of increased water infiltration rates in dwr and do treatments resulting in rapid drying of soil in 2017 cumulative soil volumetric water content was significantly higher at 20 cm depth p 0 0227 with dwr and do compared to nd kaur et al 2021 reported no difference among treatments in the plant population over the six year 2015 2020 study period thus the differences in soil volumetric water content might have resulted from increased infiltration in tile drained plots whereas nd plots p 0 0025 had increased soil volumetric water content at the 40 cm depth than dwr and do treatments in season 3 of 2019 table 2 in 2019 precipitation was higher than the other years thus subsurface drainage had greater water removal from the soil resulting in lower cumulative soil volumetric water content fig 3 moreover in this study sensors were installed in between subsurface tile lines in do and dwr treatments and randomly in nd soils could have influenced the variability in soil volumetric content at different depths therefore careful consideration is required while selecting the sensor location particularly in drainage treatments 3 3 soil health analysis 2017 and 2021 soil health analysis was evaluated in spring 2017 and 2021 which showed the variation in soil health properties over years table 3 soils managed with drainage practices resulted in significantly lower soil ph in the topsoil layer 0 10 cm the phcacl2 was ranked nd 6 1 dwr 5 7 do 5 3 while the phh2o was nd 6 5 dwr 6 do 5 7 the ph values were 0 5 0 8 units lower in drainage treatments compared to the non drained control this could be attributed to reduced ca in do 2556 kg ha 1 treatment compared to dwr 2871 kg ha 1 or nd 3785 kg ha 1 increased ca adsorption or losses caused a shift in soil ph values ng et al 2022 also continuous n fertilizer application over years could have enhanced soil acidification this change in soil ph can also be attributed to a change in soil texture among drainage treatments that resulted in reduced clay content in dwr 213 g kg 1 and do 217 g kg 1 treatments compared to the nd 263 g kg 1 soil clay content could affect the buffering capacity of soil and reduced proportion of clay in drained soils affected the soil ph through relatively less buffering capacity there was no effect of drainage treatment on soil bd mg k bray i p pmn oc active c water stable aggregates sand and silt content in the surface samples collected for soil health assessment table 3 data not presented over the years bd and silt content have increased and sand has reduced in the topsoil layer table 5 soil pmn and bray i p content increased by 4 and 3 times respectively in 2021 compared to 2017 this could be due to a buildup in fertility due to continuous n and p fertilizer application in the topsoil layer similarly cec and cations ca mg and k increased significantly in 2021 compared to 2017 organic c and active c increased by 27 and 24 respectively in 2021 compared to 2017 increased bd values over years indicates farm tillage machinery and grazing cattle during the autumn and winter months which induced soil compaction in the top layer of soil in other research grazing cover crops during this period with cattle has increased penetrometer resistance in the top 20 cm of soil dhakal et al 2022 3 4 soil fertility analysis by depth 2015 2018 2021 the particle size analysis showed a soil textural discontinuity at different soil depths and years table 4 averaged over years there was a significant depth effect on silt p 0 0002 and clay p 0001 content with an increase in clay content in deeper soil layers and higher silt content in the top soil during the duration of the study there was a decline in the proportion of sand and clay while there was an increase in silt content over years table 6 a significant treatment x depth interaction p 0 0027 was observed in soil clay content with a 16 reduction at the 0 10 cm depth in the drainage treatments compared to nd table 7 at the 41 60 cm soil depth clay content increased 26 and 11 in the dwr and do treatments respectively compared to nd soils prolonged saturated soils in winter and early spring with dwr can lead to dispersion of soil aggregates and this research indicates a movement of clay particles to deeper soil depths in addition increased ec in irrigation water may have amplified the shift in soil texture due to a change in the number of cations and anions in the soil fig 2 chieng and hughes games 1995 reported a decrease in drainable porosity with an increase in subirrigation due to the movement and deposition of fine silt and clay particles a significant drainage treatment x year interaction showed an increase in sand p 0 0047 and silt p 0 0125 content in the do treatment compared to dwr and nd this could be due to reduced loading of fine soil particles such as clay with dwr in subsurface drainage water compared to do nash et al 2020 while texture changes could be due to soil disturbance during drain tile installation we feel this disturbance was isolated to a small area in the field above the tile lines and all of the pipes were installed with a plow in 2009 or 2015 a soil disturbance was minimal drainage treatments significantly impacted p 0 05 soil ph neutralizable acidity na ca mg k no3 n om toc tn tables 4 5 and 6 soil ph was reduced by 0 5 0 6 units in dwr ph 5 2 and do ph 5 1 treatments compared to nd ph 5 7 table 6 a significant year x treatment interaction showed a more prominent variation in soil ph with dwr over years compared to do or nd table 8 water table movement and quality of recycled irrigation water can influence soil chemical properties by changing the soil redox potential at different times of the year vadas and sims 1998 during wet conditions soils may become reduced resulting in increased soil ph because of reductive reactions loeb et al 2008 after water is removed during drainage mode soils can reoxidize and soil ph can be reduced this can be explained with a reduction in cations ca mg and k in dwr compared to do and nd in dwr soil test ca was reduced by 33 and 44 compared to do and nd respectively table 6 similarly soil test k was lowered with dwr by 24 and 31 compared to do and nd respectively soil test mg was significantly reduced by 19 and 13 in dwr and do treatments respectively compared to nd this could be due to 52 and 53 higher overall k and mg grain removal with dwr compared to the nd in this study kaur et al 2021 in addition elevated levels of bicarbonates in irrigation water in the dwr treatment may combine with ca or mg and precipitate out of the soil solution as ca or mg carbonates zaman et al 2018 the cec soil test ca and k decreased while soil test mg increased significantly with soil depth table 6 significant variation in cec ca mg and k was observed over years a significant depth x treatment p 0 05 interaction showed variation in cec and k at the water table depth 41 60 cm table 7 a lower cec and soil test k was observed with dwr at the 41 60 cm depth compared to do and nd this suggests that water table fluctuations and subirrigation water quality along with increased plant uptake probably resulted in reduced content of cations in the subsoil fig 3 thus changes in soil oxidation and reduction affected by water table variation and quality of recycled subirrigation water can change soil chemical composition over time marwanto et al 2008 soil tn and no3 n content decreased in soils with the dwr treatment over the study period compared to do and nd soils table 6 this can be attributed to the increased soil aeration with the regular management of the water table during the growing season which resulted in increased nutrient uptake grain yield and n removal during this study period reduced soil tn in this study could be attributed to 36 higher tn grain removal with dwr compared to nd due to improved water utilization and reduced waterlogging stress kaur et al 2021 there was no significant interaction p 0 05 between drainage treatment depth and year for soil tn content however a significant treatment x depth p 0 0389 interaction was observed in soil no3 n values table 7 soil no3 n content was 46 56 higher at a 21 40 cm and 41 60 cm soil depth in do than dwr and nd this could be due to greater leaching with the do system and saturated soils at deeper depths lower denitrification rates with nd and dwr this makes conditions less suitable for bacteriological processes such as nitrification and nitrogen fixation deeper in the soil profile van hoorn 1958 organic matter is a primary source of soil n a significant p 0 0137 drainage treatment effect was observed on soil om content which changed significantly with soil depth p 0 001 table 6 regular water table management in the dwr treatment during the growing season improved aeration and increased soil water content in the dwr treatment which may have resulted in accelerated organic matter decomposition thus om content was reduced by 2 g kg 1 with dwr compared to nd and do in addition increased crop production in dwr provided more substrate for microbial activity which could result in increased mineralization of passive om content over years 2015 2021 om was reduced by 20 in 2021 compared to 2015 this could represent the effect of tillage on om over time since the field had been in annual forage production in the prior 6 years this might have resulted from a shift in soil texture with reduced clay content at 0 10 cm soil depth in dwr and do treatments clay has been found to affect the stability of soil om in previous studies enhanced soil om was observed in soils with higher clay content lal 2009 similarly in a soil column study rezanezhad et al 2014 reported a significant change in biological and geochemical functioning of soil with water table fluctuations they observed that water table fluctuations caused transient redox conditions which resulted in higher microbial oxidation of soil om in addition changes in soil temperature and moisture regimes lead to depletion of the om pool due to accelerated mineralization lal 2009 which could explain the observation in this study seasonal variations in soil moisture and temperature over years could have contributed to variation in om content among different treatments which has been observed in other research nearby belknap et al 2022 soil total organic carbon was reduced 19 in dwr compared to do and nd treatments table 6 water holding capacity was higher in non drained soils with fine pores than in soils with macro pores nimmo 2004 in contrast the transport of water containing nutrients and aeration is poorer in non drained soils the activity of soil microorganisms is highly dependent on soil moisture nutrients temperature and soil aeration van gestel et al 1993 increased transport of soil water in dwr after rainfall with narrower 9 1 m subsurface drainage spacing compared to do 18 3 m which could have improved overall soil aeration fig 3 in contrast nd and do may have remained saturated for longer periods of time as a consequence enhanced soil aeration and increased water and nutrient availability with the dwr treatment may induce the biodegradation of soil oc resulting in leaching or gaseous losses of soil c jeanneau et al 2019 among the various ways in which soil om is lost soil moisture affects leaching and transportation of dissolved organic and inorganic c and co2 fluxes the dwr treatment was in controlled drainage mode during the non growing season which increased soil water availability in the soil profile fig 3 high soil volumetric water content with dwr might have stimulated soil c cycling during warm periods soil organic carbon is correlated with several soil processes such as denitrification respiration and phosphorus sorption ahn and jones 2013 also water saturated soils increase the availability of dissolved oc in soil macropores due to the release of om adsorbed to iron oxide knorr 2013 loeb et al 2008 lambert et al 2013 in iowa continuous corn production along with n application has been found to increase the om decay rate with its shortened turnover time which resulted in no change in soil oc with different n fertilizer rates russell et al 2009 in this study increased corn yield and residue production kaur et al 2021 with dwr did not increase soil om but it did increase soil acidification and improve soil moisture conditions which increased soil om and oc mineralization kaur et al 2021 there was no treatment p 0 0987 effect on soil bulk density among drainage management systems 1 02 g cm 3 1 1 g cm 3 a significant depth p 0 0001 effect showed increase in bd with soil depth at 0 10 cm 0 92 g cm 3 11 20 cm 1 1 g cm 3 21 40 cm

455 to 1641 kpa a significant treatment x year p 0 0158 and depth x year p 0 0425 interaction showed variation in treatments over years which was probably due to soil moisture fluctuations tables 8 9 in 2017 penetration resistance was reduced by 46 kpa in the do treatment compared to 2016 table 8 higher precipitation in 2017 might have improved soil moisture resulting in reduced penetration resistance fig 3 in addition treatment x depth p 0 2369 and treatment x depth x year p 0 9737 interactions were not significant penetration resistance is strongly influenced by soil texture moisture content bulk density and soil om thus penetration resistance increases with an increase in bd and clay content and decreases with increased om and moisture content canarache 1990 quraishi and mouazen 2010 unger and jones 1998 kuang et al 2012 therefore increased clay content lower soil moisture and reduced soil om helps explain the increase in soil penetration resistance in the dwr treatment thus increased penetration resistance and change in texture with drainage and subirrigation dwr treatment further support the change in soil penetration resistance with dwr compared to do and nd treatments these results were in agreement with other research studies showing a change in mean weight diameter and a shift in pore size distribution with drainage and subirrigation baker 2002 van hoorn 1958 baker et al 2004 4 conclusion the investigation of soil properties along with volumetric soil water content was used to highlight the key role of water table dynamics between different drainage treatments in a continuous corn production system six years after drainage installation soil properties changed significantly with dwr compared to do and nd drainage and subirrigation of soils caused a shift in soil texture with an increase in clay content and reduced silt content in addition improved soil moisture and aeration with dwr triggered om decomposition resulting in om and oc losses therefore this further increased cation concentrations and cec in dwr at deeper soil depths continuous water table fluctuations with dwr affected soil structure through a disruption of aggregates which caused increased penetration resistance compared to do and nd treatments in addition surface water runoff and subsurface water was recycled for irrigation in dwr which might have aggravated these effects due to increased content of bicarbonates in the water detected in 2017 and 2018 similarly a long term study in northeast missouri showed a change in soil texture with higher clay and reduced silt after 17 years of dwr recycled surface and subsurface runoff compared to do and nd kaur et al 2023 however authors reported increased salt and dissolved nutrients in the water reservoir during the initial years of the study in addition the implementation of other irrigation methods such as drip or sprinkler systems might have an interactive effect on soil properties these results have implications for producers balancing corn production goals with environmental outcome thus more long term studies are needed to quantify if these changes are associated with drainage

9067,subsurface drainage is one of the most commonly used water table management practices in the midwest u s subirrigation through the subsurface drainage system using drainage water recycling dwr was developed to meet crop production goals and address environmental concerns the objective of this study was to examine differences in soil properties after seven years of subsurface drainage treatments no drainage nd drainage only do and drainage plus subirrigation dwr in continuous corn production in knox county missouri soil samples were collected at 0 10 11 20 21 40 and 41 60 cm depths periodically from 2015 to 2021 and were analyzed for soil ph cations cation exchange capacity cec nitrate n no3 n phosphorus p organic matter om total carbon tc bulk density bd penetration resistance and soil texture a significant shift in soil texture from 2015 to 2021 was observed with a 26 and 11 increase in the clay content at a 41 60 cm soil depth in dwr and do treatments respectively compared to nd accelerated soil om and tc mineralization was observed with dwr which may be due to soil acidification increased soil moisture and aeration compared to do and nd this was further supported by increased cec at deeper soil depths in addition increased reservoir water ph and electrical conductivity in 2016 and 2017 may have amplified the water table fluctuation effects on soil properties the mean concentration of sodium na potassium k bicarbonate sulfate nitrate and phosphate were in an acceptable range for use as irrigation water in conclusion continuous corn production

properties soil organic matter data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction subsurface drainage systems with perforated plastic pipe is a commonly used agriculture management practice throughout the midwestern united states to meet crop production goals fausey et al 1995 blann et al 2009 skaggs et al 1994 the function of a drainage system in floodplain soils is to remove excess water in the soil profile and maintain a sufficient water level in the root zone to maximize crop production a drainage water recycling dwr system includes installation of water level control structures in the outflow pipe to prevent excessive drainage while the reservoir component captures and stores surface and or subsurface runoff for future use as irrigation water frankenberger et al 2017 hay et al 2021 during the crop growing season reservoir water and dissolved nutrients are pumped into subsurface tile drains to provide irrigation water to the crop root zone tan et al 2007 this system utilizes dwr to mitigate drought and reduce agriculture non point source pollution tan et al 1993 drury et al 1996 hay et al 2021 the few existing studies of dwr within tile drained agriculture fields have shown encouraging results in missouri and ohio the implementation of dwr increased corn zea mays l grain yield 14 50 and soybean glycine max l yield between 7 and 29 compared to free drained or non drained treatments nelson et al 2011 nelson and smoot 2012 allred et al 2014 hay et al 2021 kaur et al 2021 singh and nelson 2021 water quality benefits of dwr systems have been documented with average nitrogen n reductions from 40 to 70 drury et al 1996 2009 and phosphorus p reductions between 12 and 36 tan and zhang 2011 tan et al 2007 globally 146 mha of arable land is poorly drained and could benefit from drainage water management to improve soil physical properties and reduce erosion losses nakajima and lal 2014 randall and iragavarapu 1995 in poorly drained soils crop production is adversely affected by a lack of aeration and increased concentration of carbon dioxide and methane lal taylor 1970 therefore drainage water management is important to improve soil physical qualities reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and improve crop growth development and yield the removal of excess soil water with a subsurface drainage system has resulted in improved soil physical properties tan et al 2007 drainage water management systems can impact soil physical and hydrological properties such as aggregate stability pore size distribution and improve soil water content swc frankenberger et al 2017 in addition drainage and subirrigation of soil can increase or decrease the amount of air filled porosity due to the movement and deposition of fine silt and clay particles thus affecting microporosity in subsurface soil fausey and baker 2003 furthermore water table alterations can affect soil structure baker et al 2004 by shifting pore size distribution and changing the soil water air ratio van hoorn 1958 since the water table depth is closer to the soil surface this can result in fewer macropores in the soil chieng and hughes games 1995 subsurface drainage is the most commonly used drainage water management practice but subirrigation using dwr has recently been adopted as a means to enhance crop production resiliency and improve water quality due to widespread concerns about the effect of agricultural management practices on soil and water quality drainage water management effects on soil properties remains a priority research area few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of water table management on soil physical properties chieng and hughes games 1995 fausey et al 1986 lal and fausey 1993 van hoorn 1958 however the effect of drainage water management on soil properties under no till agriculture systems is scarce abid and lal 2008 2009 a limited number of field research studies with drainage and dwr systems have evaluated the impact of these water management practices on soil properties the aim of this study was to examine the effect of free drainage fd and dwr systems on soil properties compared to non drained nd soils in continuous corn production in a floodplain soil of upstate missouri we hypothesize that including different drainage system will lead variation in soil moisture and aeration which can affect mineralization of soil om thus can change soil properties over years 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design this research was conducted at the university of missouri drainage and subirrigation site muds near novelty in knox county missouri usa between 2015 and 2021 the soil series at the site was a blackoar silt loam fine silty mixed superactive mesic fluvaquentic endoaquolls which is a very deep poorly drained floodplain soil with moderate permeability previously the study site was under a forage production cereal rye secale cereale l and brown midrib forage sorghum sorghum bicolor l rotation with beef cattle bos taurus aberdeen angus that were rotationally grazed from 2009 to 2014 nash et al 2017 2020 an on site 7 1 ha water reservoir captured and stored surface runoff and subsurface drainage from a 145 ha farm area for irrigation the major land use around the water reservoir was agricultural production with corn and soybean as main crops with typical fertilizer and pesticide applications the experiment consisted of three treatments that included drainage water recycling dwr drainage only do and no drainage nd each treatment was replicated two times and arranged in a randomized complete block design fig 1 the plot size was 305 by 37 m in replication 1 and 91 by 37 m in replication 2 the do and dwr treatments had a perforated plastic tubing 10 2 cm diameter installed 0 91 m deep with a hydramaxx 3300 port industries palmyra mo at an 18 3 m do and 9 1 m dwr spacing between pipes respectively an additional tile line for the dwr treatment was installed gold digger stealth zd soil max terra haute in 0 91 m deep in the spring 2015 for a 9 1 m spacing in addition water level control structures agri drain corporation adair ia were installed in the mains of the dwr treatment to regulate drainage water flow during the winter and raise the water table to subirrigate the crop during the growing season a constant water table depth at a 20 25 cm below the soil surface was maintained in the dwr treatment during the growing season using a float valve dare o matic springfield mi mounted parallel to the top slide in the water control structure the research site was under continuous corn production during the study period 2015 2021 with detailed management information reported in kaur et al 2021 corn

best management practice to minimize n loss phosphorus monoammonium phosphate and potassium potassium chloride fertilizers were broadcast applied before planting corn in spring each year the average n p and k amount applied every year was 226 kg ha 1 31 kg ha 1 and 94 kg ha 1 respectively vertical tillage case ih 335 vt racine wisconsin was performed before planting corn and fields were grazed with cattle bos taurus through the fall or winter months while the system was in free drainage mode 2 2 data collection and analysis the surface runoff and subsurface drainage water captured in the

bray and kurtz 1945 and bulk density grossman and reinsch 2002 soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa were installed at 10 20 40 and 60 cm depths to record daily soil volumetric water content in 2017 2018 and 2019 in 2016 data were collected in june september and december data were divided into three seasons based on drainage water management season 1 included the period from december 1 march 31 when dwr was in controlled drainage mode during season 2 dwr was in free drainage mode from april 1 may 31 in season 3 june 1 october 31 dwr was in subirrigation and free drainage mode depending on precipitation monitoring was carried out throughout the year with the soil moisture sensors that were installed between surface tile lines in the fd and dwr treatments and randomly in the nd treatment of both replications differences in soil volumetric water content between treatments were demonstrated by calculating the cumulative soil volumetric content for each season cumulative soil volumetric content was calculated for each replication in every treatment average soil volumetric water content from december to october in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 is presented in fig 1 this data helped determine differences in soil moisture content in different seasons under different treatments and how it interacted with soil properties between years 2 3 statistical analysis the average standard deviation standard error median and range were determined for irrigation water quality data using the univariate procedure in sas sas institute inc cary n c the values for these parameters are presented in table 1 the values of different water quality parameters over years are reported in fig 2 the cumulative soil volumetric water content were analyzed separately for each season using the glimmix model in sas with treatment as a fixed effect and replication as a random effect the average cumulative soil volumetric content by season along with p values are reported in table 2 differences in soil properties in response to the effects of drainage water management and soil sampling depth were analyzed using the glimmix model in sas treatment year and soil sampling depth were considered as fixed effects and replication was a random effect treatment means and interactions were separated using t grouping of the least square means at p 0 05 due to a lower number of replications soil health data were analyzed at Œ± 0 1 the p values for dependent variables are presented in tables 3 and 4 soil volumetric water content was analyzed separately for season and depth for each year 3 results and discussion 3 1 reservoir water quality 2016 2019 the water quality parameters in the dwr reservoir varied over years fig 2 the ph average across years was 7 5 with a range of 6 8 7 8 table 1 the ph was lowest in 2016 ph 6 8 and highest in 2019 ph 7 8 representing a continuous increasing trend over the years samples were collected the university of missouri extension recommended a ph range for irrigation water from 6 5 to 8 4 salinity of water is measured as electrical conductivity ec bauder et al 2011 in the literature water salinity has been reported as decisiemens per meter ds m 1 or as total dissolved solids in milligrams per liter tds mg l 1 electrical conductivity of irrigation water was between 0 15 and 0 22 ds m 1and tds was in the range of 99 149 mg l 1 electrical conductivity of water below 0 25 ds m 1 is considered good for irrigation purposes the mean concentration of soluble ions over the study years were cl at 9 mg l 1 no3 n at 1 1 mg l 1 so4 s at 6 6 mg l 1 po4 p at 0 15 mg l 1 k at 7 5 mg l 1 and na at 0 6 mg l 1 overall there was a decreasing trend in ion concentrations except in 2017 and 2018 fig 2 the increase in ion concentrations in the reservoir may have occurred due to the high volume of water used for irrigation for this research and other on site research specifically kaur et al 2021 reported that the amount of irrigation water applied during the growing season in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 45 77 137 and 30 mm respectively similarly hco3 in water followed the same pattern with an average concentration of 74 5 mg l 1 and the highest concentration of 92 mg l 1 in 2017 in missouri hco3 90 mg l 1 in water is considered safe for irrigation water use with a slight to moderate risk at hco3 90 520 mg l 1 schultheis 2017 3 2 soil volumetric water content 2016 2019 the total precipitation amounts during 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were 787 878 851 and 1297 mm respectively fig 3 the 2019 water year was wetter compared to the others the daily average soil volumetric water content from different treatments at the 10 20 40 and 60 cm soil depths is presented in fig 3 the average cumulative soil volumetric water content and p values for each season and different soil depths are reported in table 2 no significant difference in soil volumetric water content among treatments at different depths was observed in 2018 data not presented significant differences among treatments were observed at the 20 cm depth in 2016 and 2017 and at the 40 cm depth in 2019 table 2 during the crop growing season season 3 in 2016 cumulative soil volumetric water content was significantly higher p 0 0078 at the 20 cm soil depth in nd plots compared to dwr and do treatments this was expected because of increased water infiltration rates in dwr and do treatments resulting in rapid drying of soil in 2017 cumulative soil volumetric water content was significantly higher at 20 cm depth p 0 0227 with dwr and do compared to nd kaur et al 2021 reported no difference among treatments in the plant population over the six year 2015 2020 study period thus the differences in soil volumetric water content might have resulted from increased infiltration in tile drained plots whereas nd plots p 0 0025 had increased soil volumetric water content at the 40 cm depth than dwr and do treatments in season 3 of 2019 table 2 in 2019 precipitation was higher than the other years thus subsurface drainage had greater water removal from the soil resulting in lower cumulative soil volumetric water content fig 3 moreover in this study sensors were installed in between subsurface tile lines in do and dwr treatments and randomly in nd soils could have influenced the variability in soil volumetric content at different depths therefore careful consideration is required while selecting the sensor location particularly in drainage treatments 3 3 soil health analysis 2017 and 2021 soil health analysis was evaluated in spring 2017 and 2021 which showed the variation in soil health properties over years table 3 soils managed with drainage practices resulted in significantly lower soil ph in the topsoil layer 0 10 cm the phcacl2 was ranked nd 6 1 dwr 5 7 do 5 3 while the phh2o was nd 6 5 dwr 6 do 5 7 the ph values were 0 5 0 8 units lower in drainage treatments compared to the non drained control this could be attributed to reduced ca in do 2556 kg ha 1 treatment compared to dwr 2871 kg ha 1 or nd 3785 kg ha 1 increased ca adsorption or losses caused a shift in soil ph values ng et al 2022 also continuous n fertilizer application over years could have enhanced soil acidification this change in soil ph can also be attributed to a change in soil texture among drainage treatments that resulted in reduced clay content in dwr 213 g kg 1 and do 217 g kg 1 treatments compared to the nd 263 g kg 1 soil clay content could affect the buffering capacity of soil and reduced proportion of clay in drained soils affected the soil ph through relatively less buffering capacity there was no effect of drainage treatment on soil bd mg k bray i p pmn oc active c water stable aggregates sand and silt content in the surface samples collected for soil health assessment table 3 data not presented over the years bd and silt content have increased and sand has reduced in the topsoil layer table 5 soil pmn and bray i p content increased by 4 and 3 times respectively in 2021 compared to 2017 this could be due to a buildup in fertility due to continuous n and p fertilizer application in the topsoil layer similarly cec and cations ca mg and k increased significantly in 2021 compared to 2017 organic c and active c increased by 27 and 24 respectively in 2021 compared to 2017 increased bd values over years indicates farm tillage machinery and grazing cattle during the autumn and winter months which induced soil compaction in the top layer of soil in other research grazing cover crops during this period with cattle has increased penetrometer resistance in the top 20 cm of soil dhakal et al 2022 3 4 soil fertility analysis by depth 2015 2018 2021 the particle size analysis showed a soil textural discontinuity at different soil depths and years table 4 averaged over years there was a significant depth effect on silt p 0 0002 and clay p 0001 content with an increase in clay content in deeper soil layers and higher silt content in the top soil during the duration of the study there was a decline in the proportion of sand and clay while there was an increase in silt content over years table 6 a significant treatment x depth interaction p 0 0027 was observed in soil clay content with a 16 reduction at the 0 10 cm depth in the drainage treatments compared to nd table 7 at the 41 60 cm soil depth clay content increased 26 and 11 in the dwr and do treatments respectively compared to nd soils prolonged saturated soils in winter and early spring with dwr can lead to dispersion of soil aggregates and this research indicates a movement of clay particles to deeper soil depths in addition increased ec in irrigation water may have amplified the shift in soil texture due to a change in the number of cations and anions in the soil fig 2 chieng and hughes games 1995 reported a decrease in drainable porosity with an increase in subirrigation due to the movement and deposition of fine silt and clay particles a significant drainage treatment x year interaction showed an increase in sand p 0 0047 and silt p 0 0125 content in the do treatment compared to dwr and nd this could be due to reduced loading of fine soil particles such as clay with dwr in subsurface drainage water compared to do nash et al 2020 while texture changes could be due to soil disturbance during drain tile installation we feel this disturbance was isolated to a small area in the field above the tile lines and all of the pipes were installed with a plow in 2009 or 2015 a soil disturbance was minimal drainage treatments significantly impacted p 0 05 soil ph neutralizable acidity na ca mg k no3 n om toc tn tables 4 5 and 6 soil ph was reduced by 0 5 0 6 units in dwr ph 5 2 and do ph 5 1 treatments compared to nd ph 5 7 table 6 a significant year x treatment interaction showed a more prominent variation in soil ph with dwr over years compared to do or nd table 8 water table movement and quality of recycled irrigation water can influence soil chemical properties by changing the soil redox potential at different times of the year vadas and sims 1998 during wet conditions soils may become reduced resulting in increased soil ph because of reductive reactions loeb et al 2008 after water is removed during drainage mode soils can reoxidize and soil ph can be reduced this can be explained with a reduction in cations ca mg and k in dwr compared to do and nd in dwr soil test ca was reduced by 33 and 44 compared to do and nd respectively table 6 similarly soil test k was lowered with dwr by 24 and 31 compared to do and nd respectively soil test mg was significantly reduced by 19 and 13 in dwr and do treatments respectively compared to nd this could be due to 52 and 53 higher overall k and mg grain removal with dwr compared to the nd in this study kaur et al 2021 in addition elevated levels of bicarbonates in irrigation water in the dwr treatment may combine with ca or mg and precipitate out of the soil solution as ca or mg carbonates zaman et al 2018 the cec soil test ca and k decreased while soil test mg increased significantly with soil depth table 6 significant variation in cec ca mg and k was observed over years a significant depth x treatment p 0 05 interaction showed variation in cec and k at the water table depth 41 60 cm table 7 a lower cec and soil test k was observed with dwr at the 41 60 cm depth compared to do and nd this suggests that water table fluctuations and subirrigation water quality along with increased plant uptake probably resulted in reduced content of cations in the subsoil fig 3 thus changes in soil oxidation and reduction affected by water table variation and quality of recycled subirrigation water can change soil chemical composition over time marwanto et al 2008 soil tn and no3 n content decreased in soils with the dwr treatment over the study period compared to do and nd soils table 6 this can be attributed to the increased soil aeration with the regular management of the water table during the growing season which resulted in increased nutrient uptake grain yield and n removal during this study period reduced soil tn in this study could be attributed to 36 higher tn grain removal with dwr compared to nd due to improved water utilization and reduced waterlogging stress kaur et al 2021 there was no significant interaction p 0 05 between drainage treatment depth and year for soil tn content however a significant treatment x depth p 0 0389 interaction was observed in soil no3 n values table 7 soil no3 n content was 46 56 higher at a 21 40 cm and 41 60 cm soil depth in do than dwr and nd this could be due to greater leaching with the do system and saturated soils at deeper depths lower denitrification rates with nd and dwr this makes conditions less suitable for bacteriological processes such as nitrification and nitrogen fixation deeper in the soil profile van hoorn 1958 organic matter is a primary source of soil n a significant p 0 0137 drainage treatment effect was observed on soil om content which changed significantly with soil depth p 0 001 table 6 regular water table management in the dwr treatment during the growing season improved aeration and increased soil water content in the dwr treatment which may have resulted in accelerated organic matter decomposition thus om content was reduced by 2 g kg 1 with dwr compared to nd and do in addition increased crop production in dwr provided more substrate for microbial activity which could result in increased mineralization of passive om content over years 2015 2021 om was reduced by 20 in 2021 compared to 2015 this could represent the effect of tillage on om over time since the field had been in annual forage production in the prior 6 years this might have resulted from a shift in soil texture with reduced clay content at 0 10 cm soil depth in dwr and do treatments clay has been found to affect the stability of soil om in previous studies enhanced soil om was observed in soils with higher clay content lal 2009 similarly in a soil column study rezanezhad et al 2014 reported a significant change in biological and geochemical functioning of soil with water table fluctuations they observed that water table fluctuations caused transient redox conditions which resulted in higher microbial oxidation of soil om in addition changes in soil temperature and moisture regimes lead to depletion of the om pool due to accelerated mineralization lal 2009 which could explain the observation in this study seasonal variations in soil moisture and temperature over years could have contributed to variation in om content among different treatments which has been observed in other research nearby belknap et al 2022 soil total organic carbon was reduced 19 in dwr compared to do and nd treatments table 6 water holding capacity was higher in non drained soils with fine pores than in soils with macro pores nimmo 2004 in contrast the transport of water containing nutrients and aeration is poorer in non drained soils the activity of soil microorganisms is highly dependent on soil moisture nutrients temperature and soil aeration van gestel et al 1993 increased transport of soil water in dwr after rainfall with narrower 9 1 m subsurface drainage spacing compared to do 18 3 m which could have improved overall soil aeration fig 3 in contrast nd and do may have remained saturated for longer periods of time as a consequence enhanced soil aeration and increased water and nutrient availability with the dwr treatment may induce the biodegradation of soil oc resulting in leaching or gaseous losses of soil c jeanneau et al 2019 among the various ways in which soil om is lost soil moisture affects leaching and transportation of dissolved organic and inorganic c and co2 fluxes the dwr treatment was in controlled drainage mode during the non growing season which increased soil water availability in the soil profile fig 3 high soil volumetric water content with dwr might have stimulated soil c cycling during warm periods soil organic carbon is correlated with several soil processes such as denitrification respiration and phosphorus sorption ahn and jones 2013 also water saturated soils increase the availability of dissolved oc in soil macropores due to the release of om adsorbed to iron oxide knorr 2013 loeb et al 2008 lambert et al 2013 in iowa continuous corn production along with n application has been found to increase the om decay rate with its shortened turnover time which resulted in no change in soil oc with different n fertilizer rates russell et al 2009 in this study increased corn yield and residue production kaur et al 2021 with dwr did not increase soil om but it did increase soil acidification and improve soil moisture conditions which increased soil om and oc mineralization kaur et al 2021 there was no treatment p 0 0987 effect on soil bulk density among drainage management systems 1 02 g cm 3 1 1 g cm 3 a significant depth p 0 0001 effect showed increase in bd with soil depth at 0 10 cm 0 92 g cm 3 11 20 cm 1 1 g cm 3 21 40 cm

455 to 1641 kpa a significant treatment x year p 0 0158 and depth x year p 0 0425 interaction showed variation in treatments over years which was probably due to soil moisture fluctuations tables 8 9 in 2017 penetration resistance was reduced by 46 kpa in the do treatment compared to 2016 table 8 higher precipitation in 2017 might have improved soil moisture resulting in reduced penetration resistance fig 3 in addition treatment x depth p 0 2369 and treatment x depth x year p 0 9737 interactions were not significant penetration resistance is strongly influenced by soil texture moisture content bulk density and soil om thus penetration resistance increases with an increase in bd and clay content and decreases with increased om and moisture content canarache 1990 quraishi and mouazen 2010 unger and jones 1998 kuang et al 2012 therefore increased clay content lower soil moisture and reduced soil om helps explain the increase in soil penetration resistance in the dwr treatment thus increased penetration resistance and change in texture with drainage and subirrigation dwr treatment further support the change in soil penetration resistance with dwr compared to do and nd treatments these results were in agreement with other research studies showing a change in mean weight diameter and a shift in pore size distribution with drainage and subirrigation baker 2002 van hoorn 1958 baker et al 2004 4 conclusion the investigation of soil properties along with volumetric soil water content was used to highlight the key role of water table dynamics between different drainage treatments in a continuous corn production system six years after drainage installation soil properties changed significantly with dwr compared to do and nd drainage and subirrigation of soils caused a shift in soil texture with an increase in clay content and reduced silt content in addition improved soil moisture and aeration with dwr triggered om decomposition resulting in om and oc losses therefore this further increased cation concentrations and cec in dwr at deeper soil depths continuous water table fluctuations with dwr affected soil structure through a disruption of aggregates which caused increased penetration resistance compared to do and nd treatments in addition surface water runoff and subsurface water was recycled for irrigation in dwr which might have aggravated these effects due to increased content of bicarbonates in the water detected in 2017 and 2018 similarly a long term study in northeast missouri showed a change in soil texture with higher clay and reduced silt after 17 years of dwr recycled surface and subsurface runoff compared to do and nd kaur et al 2023 however authors reported increased salt and dissolved nutrients in the water reservoir during the initial years of the study in addition the implementation of other irrigation methods such as drip or sprinkler systems might have an interactive effect on soil properties these results have implications for producers balancing corn production goals with environmental outcome thus more long term studies are needed to quantify if these changes are associated with drainage

9068,almond plantations are expanding worldwide specifically in spain the new orchards are often designed under more intensive systems in comparison to the traditional rainfed orchards frequently found in the mediterranean sea basin in these new areas water is the main limiting factor and therefore the present research is aimed at quantitatively analyzing previous findings obtained in irrigation field trials carried out in spain with mature almond trees the goal was to derive applied water production functions and compare sustained and regulated deficit irrigation strategies to provide robust information on the marginal water productivity and the preferred irrigation option to be applied under water scarcity conditions this quantitative analysis reported a yield increase as water application increased with the highest potential yield of about 2500 kg ha achieved with around 1000 mm of irrigation water applied under severe water restrictions similar responses were observed regardless of the deficit irrigation technique employed in contrast under moderate water stress it seems more advantageous to apply a regulated deficit irrigation strategy rather than a sustained deficit strategy the reported results are useful for deriving more sustainable irrigation protocols and highlight the need to optimize other inputs in addition to water to take full advantage of the irrigation intensification to be carried out in the new almond plantations keywords deficit irrigation marginal productivity production function prunus dulcis water stress data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global awareness of the health benefits of nuts has resulted in a rapid expansion of the nuts industry which is expected to continue in the case of the almond crop the global harvested area has increased from 1776 546 ha in 2015 to 2162 263 ha in 2020 an increase of 22 in five years faostat 2021 most of the new almond orchards planted in the main producing countries are intensive irrigated plantations which would explain the 54 increase in almond production worldwide observed over the same period from 2696 057 t of shelled almonds in 2015 to 4140 043 t in 2020 faostat 2021 the united states of america spain and australia are the world s leading almond producers with a share of 57 10 and 5 of world production in 2020 respectively faostat 2021 the almond sector in spain is undergoing a substantial transformation with an increase in the cultivated area from 580 467 ha in 2015 esyrce 2015 to 721 796 ha in 2020 esyrce 2020 most of the new almond plantations are being developed in traditional irrigated areas displacing other irrigated crops i e stone fruits which have a lower profitability as a consequence spain s irrigated almond area has almost tripled in five years from 52 990 ha in 2015 to 139 399 ha in 2020 esyrce 2020 2015 despite this increase in irrigated areas low yielding rainfed almond orchards still represent 80 of the cultivated area which explains the low average yields in spain 0 58 t ha of shelled almonds as compared to those of the usa 4 68 t ha of shelled almonds faostat 2021 where most of the almond plantations are intensively irrigated goldhamer and fereres 2017 one of the main threats of the new drip irrigated almond plantations in spain is the reduced water allocation provided by the regulatory authorities for this crop species for instance the hydrographical confederation of the guadalquivir river basin establishes an endowment of 250 mm for almond tree plantations in its hydrological regulatory plans chg 2015 this water amount is notably lower than the irrigation requirements to meet the maximum crop evapotranspiration etc of this species under mediterranean climate conditions which can exceed 1300 mm in california goldhamer and fereres 2017 and 800 mm in southern spain l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 these water allocations can be further reduced in drought periods which are expected to be more frequent due to climate change in arid and semi arid regions under these scenarios of severe water shortages experimental works such as that by moldero et al 2022 demonstrate the need to continuously develop optimal irrigation management strategies to cope with both the chronic water shortages of most almond producing areas of spain and the extreme events caused by cycling droughts in this regard moldero et al 2022 found that almond trees grown in southern spain that were submitted to severe water deprivation during a single season experienced very high tree mortality 92 when submitted to rainfed conditions after previous seasons of full irrigation application in contrast those receiving only 25 etc had a 33 yield reduction as compared to fully irrigated trees and recovered yield levels in the following years in the last two decades a great research effort has been carried out in spain to determine the physiological and agronomic responses of almond trees to irrigation strategies supplying water depths lower than those required to meet the maximum etc namely deficit irrigation di strategies fereres and soriano 2007 within the term di a distinction can be made between sustained deficit irrigation strategies sdi aimed at applying a certain level of water deficit throughout the growing season and regulated deficit irrigation strategies rdi aimed at applying water deficit only in certain phenological periods that are less sensitive to water stress egea et al 2013 rdi strategies in almond trees have mainly consisted in applying a more or less severe water deficit during the grain filling stage coinciding with the months of highest water demand egea et al 2010 garc√≠a tejero et al 2019 girona et al 2005 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 ma√±as et al 2014 however this has not always been the case as moderate water deficits have also been applied in the rapid fruit growth and or postharvest stages in some field experiments moldero et al 2021 puerto et al 2013 romero et al 2004 the great range of rdi treatments tested together with the high number of cultivars evaluated the differing soil i e deep vs shallow soils and weather conditions i e semi arid mediterranean continental mediterranean complicate drawing solid and clear messages to convey to irrigation managers and farmers on the most suitable irrigation strategy for a given water allocation in drought prone areas such as spain in addition to rdi sdi irrigation strategies egea et al 2010 garc√≠a tejero et al 2020 girona et al 2005 guti√©rrez gordillo et al 2020 lipan et al 2020 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 ma√±as et al 2014 moldero et al 2021 with different degrees of water deficit ranging from 75 etc garc√≠a tejero et al 2020 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 to 25 etc ma√±as et al 2014 have also been evaluated in the different almond field trials conducted in spain in an experiment carried out in california with almond trees goldhamer et al 2006 found that rdi trees had greater yields than sdi trees when similar amounts of water were applied however no clear differential patterns among rdi and sdi strategies were observed in the almond experiments conducted in spain egea et al 2013 girona et al 2005 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 ma√±as et al 2014 moldero et al 2021 in this sense a meta analysis of all the data collected in the experiments conducted so far in spain on the response of almond trees to deficit irrigation would help to unravel some questions on the management of deficit irrigation in almond orchards under the soil and climatic conditions found in spain for this reason this work tries to answer the following questions 1 for a given water allocation below the total crop requirements what would be the most appropriate irrigation strategy for almond trees grown in spain 2 for a given water allocation what yield loss can be expected versus that of a well watered orchard 3 under the edaphoclimatic conditions of spain is the productive response of almond trees to deficit irrigation conditioned by the timing at which the water stress is applied or does it depend mainly on the percentage of etc supplied annually 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of the database data were collected from studies performed in spain in which almond trees were subjected to different irrigation regimes to obtain these data research groups from all over spain were contacted and asked to provide the data from their published works articles were restricted to those in which a full irrigation control was compared to either a regulated or sustained deficit treatment ideally the three irrigation modalities namely full regulated and sustained were investigated within the same study whenever possible a rain fed treatment was also considered the criteria for incorporating a work into the final analysis were the following 1 the experimental characteristics should indicate both in season or annual rainfall and the amount of irrigation applied to each treatment 2 the articles had to report yields for each treatment and 3 the almond trees should be at least five years old in the end the database contained 15 articles for a total of 173 observations mainly located in southern and eastern spain table 1 data from the selected articles included some years in which the trees were four years old thus not meeting one of the criteria for selection therefore data were filtered to select only those which referred to adult trees at least five years after their plantation moreover a treatment with over irrigated trees was removed from the analysis except for the calculation of the production function and marginal water productivity where these data were included see below in the end the database for adult almond trees consisted of 144 observations a database was created by listing the irrigation regimes in each study yield data were arranged as paired observations in which deficit irrigation treatments were compared to a full irrigation control the treatments classified as moderate water stress were those that received annual irrigation volumes above 55 of those received by the control treatments whereas those that received annual irrigation depths below 55 of maximum crop water requirements were considered severe water stressed treatments the stress coefficient threshold value of 55 was chosen based on the production function obtained by moldero et al 2021 who observed in their trials carried out in southern spain that reduced yield losses 15 were expected for 45 irrigation shortages and that kernel yield was impaired more significantly with water shortages higher than 45 of maximum crop water requirements other data referred to the experimental conditions including location irrigation system design cultivar rootstock spacings tree density and age and external factors such as rainfall received per year and growing season and clipped grass reference evapotranspiration eto were included in the database relevant moderators are shown in table 2 all studies used conventional management practices so this was not included in the list of moderators the meta analysis cannot be performed on continuous variables hence the moderators were sub divided into categories mitchell mccallister et al 2020 new drip irrigated almond plantations in spain including recently developed varieties high density planting systems and regions where almond is newly introduced would have different water needs but the research on these new plantations is scarce and consequently we did not consider them for the quantitative analysis carried out focusing on the more traditional almond orchards 2 2 relative yield and water production to reduce the variability in the results from the studies considered which involved different almond cultivars irrigation amounts soil types and rainfall regimes yields were relativized to the yield observed in the full irrigation control corresponding to each study with this data from all the studies could be easily compared moreover applied water production functions for each irrigation strategy either fi rdi or sdi and for all of them combined were calculated by plotting the mean yield response to the water applied and fitting a second order polynomial expression goldhamer and fereres 2017 the marginal water productivity was computed as the derivative of the water productivity function and plotted against the applied water goldhamer and fereres 2017 2 3 data analysis an exploratory analysis including descriptive statistics boxplots and scatterplots for relating different variables and external factors was first conducted generalized linear models between yield both total and relative and water received both rainfall and irrigation were performed and regression coefficients were computed shapiro wilks and bartlett tests were used for assessing the normality of yield data among water deficit treatments to carry out an anova for evaluating the effect of watering types and regimes on almond yield means were separated using tukey s test a meta analysis was performed to aggregate the results from the individual studies and thus obtain greater statistical power meta analysis is a research process used to systematically synthesize and merge the findings of single independent studies using statistical methods to calculate an overall or absolute effect egger and smith 1997 shorten and shorten 2013 this technique uses well recognised systematic methods to account for differences in sample size variability heterogeneity in study approach and findings treatment effects and test how sensitive their results are egger and smith 1997 borenstein et al 2009 this technique has provided further insights into the impacts of agricultural practices on crop yield and water use efficiency fan et al 2018 mitchell mccallister et al 2020 the meta analysis was conducted using the meta and metasens packages balduzzi et al 2019 schwarzer 2007 schwarzer et al 2015 under the r statistical environment r core team 2021 a random effects model was considered to assess yield under deficit irrigation as we assumed that the true effect varied across studies borenstein et al 2009 moreover a fixed effects model was also considered cochran s q statistic was used to assess heterogeneity testing the null hypothesis that all the studies share a common effect size this statistic follows a chi square distribution with the number of studies minus one degree of freedom the percentage of variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance was assessed through the i 2 statistic which is computed as 1 i2 q df q 100 where q is the cochran s heterogeneity statistic and df means degrees of freedom values of i 2 range from 0 to 100 where values of 25 50 and 75 represent low medium and high heterogeneity borenstein et al 2009 higgins et al 2003 graphical and statistical methods were used for determining publication bias which is the most significant source of type i errors in a meta analysis harrison 2011 funnel plots were used to present the effect size plotted against the standard error placing the effect sizes of small studies at the bottom of the funnel and larger studies concentrated at the top funnel plots are symmetrical in the absence of bias sterne et al 2006 3 results 3 1 description of the dataset table 3 summarises the number of data mean maximum and minimum values for each variable as well as the number of missing data yield and irrigation applied data were present in the 144 observations table 3 whereas the rest of the variables showed missing data yield in these studies showed a wide spectrum of values ranging from 352 to 3329 kg ha table 3 while irrigation applied varied from 7 to 985 mm table 3 a categorical variable representing the ratio between the irrigation applied to a given deficit treatment over the irrigation applied to the control treatment allowed for classifying the deficit irrigation treatments into moderate ratio between 0 55 and 0 99 and severe ratio 0 55 fig 1 shows the boxplots of yields and relative yields for the different watering regimes considered the combinations of stress level and irrigation strategy both yield and relative yield data met the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions according to shapiro wilks and bartlett s tests p values 0 05 so an anova was performed to assess the significance of the effects of both irrigation strategy and water stress level fig 1 yields from severe deficit treatments were significantly lower than those from the control and moderate deficit treatments independently of the irrigation strategy fig 1a however a moderate sdi treatment significantly reduced the relative yield with respect to the control treatment but the rdi strategy did not fig 1b a positive and significant correlation between the water received rainfall irrigation by the almond trees and their yield was observed fig 2a this relationship can be expressed as yield 0 0009 rainfall irrigation 2 3 3433 rainfall irrigation 489 55 and its coefficient of determination r2 was 0 5761 p value 0 01 according to this equation an amount around 1100 mm of water per year would be needed to obtain 2000 kg ha of almonds in terms of irrigation supply the dataset suggests that the maximum yield would be obtained with 800 mm of irrigation water per year fig s1 moreover when the yield and the water received were relativized to the corresponding full irrigation control fig 2b the dataset suggests that no yield reduction could be expected if the water received is more than 85 that of the control the variation in yield among studies was not only dependent on the water received but also on the almond cultivar fig 3 in this dataset guara and lauranne showed the highest yields whereas ferragn√®s showed the lowest yields however a high variability was observed likely caused by the different conditions agrometeorological soil and fertigation practices among studies fig 3 to better understand this situation generalized linear models were built separately for each cultivar to describe the relationship between water received rainfall irrigation and yield table 4 except for the cultivars marcona for which there were no rainfall data available and lauranne the slopes of the fitted models were significantly different from zero table 4 the intercept was not significant for ferragn√®s and vairo in addition the regression coefficients were lower than 0 6 except for vairo and cartagenera table 4 therefore a heterogeneity in the yield response to water received was observed among cultivars although this effect was negligible for lauranne this can be due to the magnitude of the yields observed in the dataset very high in lauranne when compared to the rest of the cultivars when plotted as a function of the irrigation strategy the highest yields corresponded to the control treatments and in some cases to the moderate deficit treatments both rdi and sdi whereas the lowest yields always corresponded to the treatments that imposed a severe water deficit fig 4 3 2 water production function and water productivity the yield response to applied irrigation ai for the treatments included within this dataset is shown in fig 5 yields increased from about 500 kg ha with ai of 50 mm to nearly 2700 kg ha with the 1050 mm of applied irrigation and then it seemed to stabilize kernel yield did not decline within the limits of applied irrigation considered in the current study fig 5 to quantify water productivity levels as a function of applied irrigation a second order polynomial expression was fitted to the mean yield versus ai fig 5 and its derivative the marginal water productivity was computed and plotted against ai fig 6 water productivity reached a maximum value of 0 34 kg m3 when no irrigation was applied and decreased to zero at 1260 mm becoming negative as ai increased fig 6 the yield response to ai and the marginal water productivities for regulated and sustained deficit irrigation strategies are shown in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2 respectively 3 3 meta analysis the effect of water deficit combining rdi with sdi treatments for all deficit levels on yield kg ha was assessed by means of a forest plot combining the 15 studies included in the database fig 7 this graph indicates that deficit treatments yielded 84 87 of what their respective well irrigated controls yielded the confidence interval is quite narrow varying between 0 85 and 0 89 in the case of a fixed effects model and between 0 79 and 0 89 in the case of a random effects model fig 7 finally the heterogeneity indicators showed a large variability between studies i 2 77 cochran s q indicator took a value of 61 54 p value 0 0001 indicating that the effect size differed among studies the funnel plot revealed the presence of a certain publication bias fig s3 however a regression test of funnel plot asymmetry provided an intercept of 0 1164 with a p value of 0 2519 suggesting that the estimated effects were robust fig 7 clearly shows that the control treatment favoured almond yield over deficit irrigation regardless of soil depth however the rate at which this yield increase occurred was different in deep random effects model 0 84 than in shallow soils random effects model 0 76 this suggests that deficit irrigation in shallow soils decreases yield to a greater extent than in the case of deeper soils the exact soil depth in each study incorporated within this meta analysis is unknown although the low number of studies carried out on shallow soils does not allow for drawing sound conclusions when rdi was compared against sdi regardless of the severity of the water stress applied the number of studies was reduced and conclusions were not clear fig 8 in fact if a fixed effects model is considered sdi led to a 3 higher yield compared to rdi however using a random effects model the result was the opposite fig 8 the variability between the studies was very high i 2 73 cochran s q indicator obtained a value of 26 07 p value 0 0005 indicating that the effect size differed among studies the funnel plot did not reveal the presence of publication bias fig s4 in addition almond yield benefited slightly under rdi in both deep and shallow soils the rate at which this increase in yield occurred was similar in deep random effects model 0 97 and in shallow soils random effects model 0 94 considering only a moderate water deficit the differences between applying this deficit in a sustained manner throughout the season or in certain phases of the crop cycle were practically nil fig s5 this may be because the analysis only considered the stress for the whole season which could be masking some other effects however when considering severe water stress the meta analysis seemed to indicate that it is more advisable to apply rdi as yield would be less affected fig s6 however it should be noted that the latter two analyses include fewer studies 4 discussion the quantitative analysis performed to evaluate the agronomic response of adult almond plantations grown in spain to different levels of water stress revealed a wide range of almond yields 352 3329 kg ha for a wide range of irrigation volumes applied 7 985 mm table 3 this variability was partly because the relationship between applied water and yield was not straightforward it was affected by the soil type the soil water content at the beginning of the season and the prevailing evaporative demand which can vary significantly among regions evapotranspiration was the pertinent indicator for this analysis but unfortunately it was seldom measured so the applied water was used here as a proxy for the actual water used by the almond trees the comparison of these results with those obtained in field experiments conducted in california the main almond producing area in the world showed that the maximum yields obtained in the field trials carried out in spain coincided with the minimum average yields obtained by goldhamer and fereres 2017 in a 5 year trial carried out in an adult almond orchard subjected to 10 irrigation levels in this sense it is important to highlight that the maximum irrigation volumes applied in the experiments carried out in spain were close to the minimum volumes used in the study performed by goldhamer and fereres 2017 where up to 1350 mm of irrigation depths were applied and maximum 5 year mean yields close to 4000 kg ha of almonds were obtained the incorporation of an irrigation treatment with over irrigation in the production function obtained in this study fig 5 did not lead to any increase in kernel yield suggesting that the volumes of water applied in control well irrigated treatments were suitable for reaching potential yields for the plant material crop management and agroclimatic conditions prevailing in spain the high almond yields achieved in california 4000 kg ha resulted from decades of crop intensification goldhamer and fereres 2017 with a similar situation in australia the second greatest almond producer worldwide whose almond growing sector employs the cultivars and cultural practices used in california thorp et al 2021 conversely in spain these levels of crop intensification with irrigation inputs that can exceed 1300 mm per year goldhamer and fereres 2017 are not expected due to the reduced availability of irrigation water in most of the inland areas into which almond plantations are expanding in this sense irrigation water allocations commonly range between 250 mm and 600 mm per year moldero et al 2021 well below the water requirements needed for intensive adult almond plantations under the premises of irrigating almond orchards with deficit allocations the results obtained in the current study confirmed the good productive performance of almond trees under conditions of moderate water deficit as very low yield penalties 7 9 were observed when compared with the control treatments fig 1 an important aspect of deficit irrigation management in almond orchards that continues to generate uncertainty is the convenience of using regulated rdi versus sustained sdi deficit irrigation strategies the results obtained in this work suggest although not definitely a certain advantage of using rdi strategies over sdi in almond trees in absolute terms the mean kernel yield between rdi and sdi treatments did not differ significantly regardless of the level of water deficit applied fig 1 however when relative yields were analyzed sdi differed from the control for both levels of water deficit moderate and severe in contrast the rdi treatment only differed from the control when the water deficit was severe fig 1 despite being significant the reduction in yield for a moderate water deficit applied through sdi was only 9 with respect to the control therefore the analysis performed could not robustly confirm that this irrigation strategy causes an appreciable decrease in almond yield the meta analysis fig 8 suggested a certain production advantage for rdi over sdi when simultaneously considering both moderate and severe water deficit therefore the current study cannot provide a definite answer for the first question raised about which irrigation strategy is more appropriate for a given water allocation below the total almond water requirements as the current study only suggests slight yield improvements for rdi rdi strategies in almond trees have mostly consisted of applying a certain level of water deficit during the kernel filling stage considered the most drought resistant phenological stage in almond trees girona et al 2005 however some studies observed yield reductions when water deficit was applied during this stage egea et al 2013 goldhamer et al 2006 goldhamer and viveros 2000 hutmacher et al 1994 while in other studies yield was unaffected by water deficits applied during kernel filling egea et al 2010 2009 goldhamer and fereres 2004 puerto et al 2013 these controversial results seem to be related to the level of water stress reached by trees during this period as stem water potential values lower than 2 mpa during kernel filling have been suggested to cause yield losses garc√≠a tejero et al 2018 due to variations in kernel weight girona et al 2005 despite this evidence the analysis conducted in this work indicates that applying water shortages only during the grain filling stage rather than spreading it proportionally throughout the crop cycle is not clearly justified this leads to the second question about what yield loss can be expected for a given water allocation when compared to a well watered orchard the results obtained in the current study are not conclusive on whether the cultivars evaluated differed in their productive response to deficit irrigation although some differences were observed in the relationships between water input and yield of each cultivar the variability in the ranges of water applied among the different experiments made it difficult to obtain sound conclusions regarding the tolerance of the cultivars to water stress on the other hand although it has sometimes been considered that shallow soils are better for the application of rdi strategies in woody crops due to the adequate timing of water stress application that is needed in an rdi strategy girona et al 2003 in almond trees it seems that the crop response to rdi strategies is poorer in shallow soils compared to deeper soils however the low number of studies developed on shallow soils does not allow for obtaining sound conclusions fig 7 nevertheless the current study indicated that for a moderate water deficit 7 9 yield reductions can be expected with respect to a well watered orchard while for a severe water deficit yield decrease could be up to 33 the applied irrigation yield response function obtained in this analysis comprising multiple cultivars irrigation treatments and experimental conditions fig 5 was similar to that obtained by moldero et al 2021 in a 6 year trial carried out in southern spain on almond trees cv guara by comparing both production functions it can be deduced that spanish cultivars have a similar productive response to irrigation under the agroclimatic and management conditions of the spanish almond orchards with maximum kernel yields obtained with irrigation water allocations of about 1000 mm per growth cycle however when these production functions were compared with that obtained in california goldhamer and fereres 2017 it was observed that californian almond plantations continued to increase kernel yields above 1000 mm of irrigation water applied reaching maximum yields close to 4000 kg ha with irrigation inputs of about 1250 mm per growth cycle the marginal productivity of irrigation water decreased continuously with any irrigation water input both in the relationship obtained by moldero et al 2021 and in the one obtained in this analysis fig 6 this pattern has also been observed in previous studies conducted with other cultivars e g cv marta egea et al 2010 while the almonds cv guara needed irrigation inputs close to 1000 mm for marginal water productivity to be zero in the meta analysis carried out in this study irrigation inputs close to 1200 mm were needed for marginal irrigation productivity to be zero in any case the comparison with the irrigation water productivities obtained in california shows the low productivity of irrigation inputs in spain above 800 mm year lower than 0 1 kg m3 while maximum marginal productivities of irrigation water of around 0 3 kg m3 were observed for irrigation inputs of 1100 mm year in california goldhamer and fereres 2017 from these data it can be concluded that higher irrigation water productivities than those observed in the spanish trials are possible for high irrigation water allocations therefore it seems that almond productive response depends mainly on the percentage of etc supplied annually answering the third question raised in the introduction of the current study however as irrigation water allocations above 700 800 mm are not expected in spain and over the mediterranean sea basin the scientific and technological challenge for almond cultivation is to increase the marginal productivity for moderate irrigation allocations to the levels observed in californian almond orchards for notably higher irrigation water allocations this could be achieved not only by means of improved irrigation technologies and scheduling but also by optimizing the overall agronomic management with particular attention to fertilization regimes and pruning operations the challenge of increasing marginal productivity should also consider the sustainability component for minimizing contamination risks ensuring soil conservation and considering the common trend of increasing organic farming cultivation 5 final considerations and recommendations despite the large variability observed in the pooled data set because of the wide range of studied conditions such as soil types cultivars climatic conditions or tree sizes among others the quantitative analysis conducted allowed us to derive some general trends in spain under semi arid mediterranean conditions almond yield increases with irrigation water application with an expected yield of about 2500 kg ha for around 1000 mm of irrigation water applied the yield reduction observed when water allocation decreased in comparison to fully irrigated trees was mostly due to the severity of the water stress suffered by trees and to a lesser extent due to the irrigation strategy implemented the application of a regulated deficit irrigation strategy rather than a sustained deficit one only showed some advantage when water stress was

9068,almond plantations are expanding worldwide specifically in spain the new orchards are often designed under more intensive systems in comparison to the traditional rainfed orchards frequently found in the mediterranean sea basin in these new areas water is the main limiting factor and therefore the present research is aimed at quantitatively analyzing previous findings obtained in irrigation field trials carried out in spain with mature almond trees the goal was to derive applied water production functions and compare sustained and regulated deficit irrigation strategies to provide robust information on the marginal water productivity and the preferred irrigation option to be applied under water scarcity conditions this quantitative analysis reported a yield increase as water application increased with the highest potential yield of about 2500 kg ha achieved with around 1000 mm of irrigation water applied under severe water restrictions similar responses were observed regardless of the deficit irrigation technique employed in contrast under moderate water stress it seems more advantageous to apply a regulated deficit irrigation strategy rather than a sustained deficit strategy the reported results are useful for deriving more sustainable irrigation protocols and highlight the need to optimize other inputs in addition to water to take full advantage of the irrigation intensification to be carried out in the new almond plantations keywords deficit irrigation marginal productivity production function prunus dulcis water stress data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global awareness of the health benefits of nuts has resulted in a rapid expansion of the nuts industry which is expected to continue in the case of the almond crop the global harvested area has increased from 1776 546 ha in 2015 to 2162 263 ha in 2020 an increase of 22 in five years faostat 2021 most of the new almond orchards planted in the main producing countries are intensive irrigated plantations which would explain the 54 increase in almond production worldwide observed over the same period from 2696 057 t of shelled almonds in 2015 to 4140 043 t in 2020 faostat 2021 the united states of america spain and australia are the world s leading almond producers with a share of 57 10 and 5 of world production in 2020 respectively faostat 2021 the almond sector in spain is undergoing a substantial transformation with an increase in the cultivated area from 580 467 ha in 2015 esyrce 2015 to 721 796 ha in 2020 esyrce 2020 most of the new almond plantations are being developed in traditional irrigated areas displacing other irrigated crops i e stone fruits which have a lower profitability as a consequence spain s irrigated almond area has almost tripled in five years from 52 990 ha in 2015 to 139 399 ha in 2020 esyrce 2020 2015 despite this increase in irrigated areas low yielding rainfed almond orchards still represent 80 of the cultivated area which explains the low average yields in spain 0 58 t ha of shelled almonds as compared to those of the usa 4 68 t ha of shelled almonds faostat 2021 where most of the almond plantations are intensively irrigated goldhamer and fereres 2017 one of the main threats of the new drip irrigated almond plantations in spain is the reduced water allocation provided by the regulatory authorities for this crop species for instance the hydrographical confederation of the guadalquivir river basin establishes an endowment of 250 mm for almond tree plantations in its hydrological regulatory plans chg 2015 this water amount is notably lower than the irrigation requirements to meet the maximum crop evapotranspiration etc of this species under mediterranean climate conditions which can exceed 1300 mm in california goldhamer and fereres 2017 and 800 mm in southern spain l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 these water allocations can be further reduced in drought periods which are expected to be more frequent due to climate change in arid and semi arid regions under these scenarios of severe water shortages experimental works such as that by moldero et al 2022 demonstrate the need to continuously develop optimal irrigation management strategies to cope with both the chronic water shortages of most almond producing areas of spain and the extreme events caused by cycling droughts in this regard moldero et al 2022 found that almond trees grown in southern spain that were submitted to severe water deprivation during a single season experienced very high tree mortality 92 when submitted to rainfed conditions after previous seasons of full irrigation application in contrast those receiving only 25 etc had a 33 yield reduction as compared to fully irrigated trees and recovered yield levels in the following years in the last two decades a great research effort has been carried out in spain to determine the physiological and agronomic responses of almond trees to irrigation strategies supplying water depths lower than those required to meet the maximum etc namely deficit irrigation di strategies fereres and soriano 2007 within the term di a distinction can be made between sustained deficit irrigation strategies sdi aimed at applying a certain level of water deficit throughout the growing season and regulated deficit irrigation strategies rdi aimed at applying water deficit only in certain phenological periods that are less sensitive to water stress egea et al 2013 rdi strategies in almond trees have mainly consisted in applying a more or less severe water deficit during the grain filling stage coinciding with the months of highest water demand egea et al 2010 garc√≠a tejero et al 2019 girona et al 2005 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 ma√±as et al 2014 however this has not always been the case as moderate water deficits have also been applied in the rapid fruit growth and or postharvest stages in some field experiments moldero et al 2021 puerto et al 2013 romero et al 2004 the great range of rdi treatments tested together with the high number of cultivars evaluated the differing soil i e deep vs shallow soils and weather conditions i e semi arid mediterranean continental mediterranean complicate drawing solid and clear messages to convey to irrigation managers and farmers on the most suitable irrigation strategy for a given water allocation in drought prone areas such as spain in addition to rdi sdi irrigation strategies egea et al 2010 garc√≠a tejero et al 2020 girona et al 2005 guti√©rrez gordillo et al 2020 lipan et al 2020 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 ma√±as et al 2014 moldero et al 2021 with different degrees of water deficit ranging from 75 etc garc√≠a tejero et al 2020 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 to 25 etc ma√±as et al 2014 have also been evaluated in the different almond field trials conducted in spain in an experiment carried out in california with almond trees goldhamer et al 2006 found that rdi trees had greater yields than sdi trees when similar amounts of water were applied however no clear differential patterns among rdi and sdi strategies were observed in the almond experiments conducted in spain egea et al 2013 girona et al 2005 l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2018 ma√±as et al 2014 moldero et al 2021 in this sense a meta analysis of all the data collected in the experiments conducted so far in spain on the response of almond trees to deficit irrigation would help to unravel some questions on the management of deficit irrigation in almond orchards under the soil and climatic conditions found in spain for this reason this work tries to answer the following questions 1 for a given water allocation below the total crop requirements what would be the most appropriate irrigation strategy for almond trees grown in spain 2 for a given water allocation what yield loss can be expected versus that of a well watered orchard 3 under the edaphoclimatic conditions of spain is the productive response of almond trees to deficit irrigation conditioned by the timing at which the water stress is applied or does it depend mainly on the percentage of etc supplied annually 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of the database data were collected from studies performed in spain in which almond trees were subjected to different irrigation regimes to obtain these data research groups from all over spain were contacted and asked to provide the data from their published works articles were restricted to those in which a full irrigation control was compared to either a regulated or sustained deficit treatment ideally the three irrigation modalities namely full regulated and sustained were investigated within the same study whenever possible a rain fed treatment was also considered the criteria for incorporating a work into the final analysis were the following 1 the experimental characteristics should indicate both in season or annual rainfall and the amount of irrigation applied to each treatment 2 the articles had to report yields for each treatment and 3 the almond trees should be at least five years old in the end the database contained 15 articles for a total of 173 observations mainly located in southern and eastern spain table 1 data from the selected articles included some years in which the trees were four years old thus not meeting one of the criteria for selection therefore data were filtered to select only those which referred to adult trees at least five years after their plantation moreover a treatment with over irrigated trees was removed from the analysis except for the calculation of the production function and marginal water productivity where these data were included see below in the end the database for adult almond trees consisted of 144 observations a database was created by listing the irrigation regimes in each study yield data were arranged as paired observations in which deficit irrigation treatments were compared to a full irrigation control the treatments classified as moderate water stress were those that received annual irrigation volumes above 55 of those received by the control treatments whereas those that received annual irrigation depths below 55 of maximum crop water requirements were considered severe water stressed treatments the stress coefficient threshold value of 55 was chosen based on the production function obtained by moldero et al 2021 who observed in their trials carried out in southern spain that reduced yield losses 15 were expected for 45 irrigation shortages and that kernel yield was impaired more significantly with water shortages higher than 45 of maximum crop water requirements other data referred to the experimental conditions including location irrigation system design cultivar rootstock spacings tree density and age and external factors such as rainfall received per year and growing season and clipped grass reference evapotranspiration eto were included in the database relevant moderators are shown in table 2 all studies used conventional management practices so this was not included in the list of moderators the meta analysis cannot be performed on continuous variables hence the moderators were sub divided into categories mitchell mccallister et al 2020 new drip irrigated almond plantations in spain including recently developed varieties high density planting systems and regions where almond is newly introduced would have different water needs but the research on these new plantations is scarce and consequently we did not consider them for the quantitative analysis carried out focusing on the more traditional almond orchards 2 2 relative yield and water production to reduce the variability in the results from the studies considered which involved different almond cultivars irrigation amounts soil types and rainfall regimes yields were relativized to the yield observed in the full irrigation control corresponding to each study with this data from all the studies could be easily compared moreover applied water production functions for each irrigation strategy either fi rdi or sdi and for all of them combined were calculated by plotting the mean yield response to the water applied and fitting a second order polynomial expression goldhamer and fereres 2017 the marginal water productivity was computed as the derivative of the water productivity function and plotted against the applied water goldhamer and fereres 2017 2 3 data analysis an exploratory analysis including descriptive statistics boxplots and scatterplots for relating different variables and external factors was first conducted generalized linear models between yield both total and relative and water received both rainfall and irrigation were performed and regression coefficients were computed shapiro wilks and bartlett tests were used for assessing the normality of yield data among water deficit treatments to carry out an anova for evaluating the effect of watering types and regimes on almond yield means were separated using tukey s test a meta analysis was performed to aggregate the results from the individual studies and thus obtain greater statistical power meta analysis is a research process used to systematically synthesize and merge the findings of single independent studies using statistical methods to calculate an overall or absolute effect egger and smith 1997 shorten and shorten 2013 this technique uses well recognised systematic methods to account for differences in sample size variability heterogeneity in study approach and findings treatment effects and test how sensitive their results are egger and smith 1997 borenstein et al 2009 this technique has provided further insights into the impacts of agricultural practices on crop yield and water use efficiency fan et al 2018 mitchell mccallister et al 2020 the meta analysis was conducted using the meta and metasens packages balduzzi et al 2019 schwarzer 2007 schwarzer et al 2015 under the r statistical environment r core team 2021 a random effects model was considered to assess yield under deficit irrigation as we assumed that the true effect varied across studies borenstein et al 2009 moreover a fixed effects model was also considered cochran s q statistic was used to assess heterogeneity testing the null hypothesis that all the studies share a common effect size this statistic follows a chi square distribution with the number of studies minus one degree of freedom the percentage of variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance was assessed through the i 2 statistic which is computed as 1 i2 q df q 100 where q is the cochran s heterogeneity statistic and df means degrees of freedom values of i 2 range from 0 to 100 where values of 25 50 and 75 represent low medium and high heterogeneity borenstein et al 2009 higgins et al 2003 graphical and statistical methods were used for determining publication bias which is the most significant source of type i errors in a meta analysis harrison 2011 funnel plots were used to present the effect size plotted against the standard error placing the effect sizes of small studies at the bottom of the funnel and larger studies concentrated at the top funnel plots are symmetrical in the absence of bias sterne et al 2006 3 results 3 1 description of the dataset table 3 summarises the number of data mean maximum and minimum values for each variable as well as the number of missing data yield and irrigation applied data were present in the 144 observations table 3 whereas the rest of the variables showed missing data yield in these studies showed a wide spectrum of values ranging from 352 to 3329 kg ha table 3 while irrigation applied varied from 7 to 985 mm table 3 a categorical variable representing the ratio between the irrigation applied to a given deficit treatment over the irrigation applied to the control treatment allowed for classifying the deficit irrigation treatments into moderate ratio between 0 55 and 0 99 and severe ratio 0 55 fig 1 shows the boxplots of yields and relative yields for the different watering regimes considered the combinations of stress level and irrigation strategy both yield and relative yield data met the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions according to shapiro wilks and bartlett s tests p values 0 05 so an anova was performed to assess the significance of the effects of both irrigation strategy and water stress level fig 1 yields from severe deficit treatments were significantly lower than those from the control and moderate deficit treatments independently of the irrigation strategy fig 1a however a moderate sdi treatment significantly reduced the relative yield with respect to the control treatment but the rdi strategy did not fig 1b a positive and significant correlation between the water received rainfall irrigation by the almond trees and their yield was observed fig 2a this relationship can be expressed as yield 0 0009 rainfall irrigation 2 3 3433 rainfall irrigation 489 55 and its coefficient of determination r2 was 0 5761 p value 0 01 according to this equation an amount around 1100 mm of water per year would be needed to obtain 2000 kg ha of almonds in terms of irrigation supply the dataset suggests that the maximum yield would be obtained with 800 mm of irrigation water per year fig s1 moreover when the yield and the water received were relativized to the corresponding full irrigation control fig 2b the dataset suggests that no yield reduction could be expected if the water received is more than 85 that of the control the variation in yield among studies was not only dependent on the water received but also on the almond cultivar fig 3 in this dataset guara and lauranne showed the highest yields whereas ferragn√®s showed the lowest yields however a high variability was observed likely caused by the different conditions agrometeorological soil and fertigation practices among studies fig 3 to better understand this situation generalized linear models were built separately for each cultivar to describe the relationship between water received rainfall irrigation and yield table 4 except for the cultivars marcona for which there were no rainfall data available and lauranne the slopes of the fitted models were significantly different from zero table 4 the intercept was not significant for ferragn√®s and vairo in addition the regression coefficients were lower than 0 6 except for vairo and cartagenera table 4 therefore a heterogeneity in the yield response to water received was observed among cultivars although this effect was negligible for lauranne this can be due to the magnitude of the yields observed in the dataset very high in lauranne when compared to the rest of the cultivars when plotted as a function of the irrigation strategy the highest yields corresponded to the control treatments and in some cases to the moderate deficit treatments both rdi and sdi whereas the lowest yields always corresponded to the treatments that imposed a severe water deficit fig 4 3 2 water production function and water productivity the yield response to applied irrigation ai for the treatments included within this dataset is shown in fig 5 yields increased from about 500 kg ha with ai of 50 mm to nearly 2700 kg ha with the 1050 mm of applied irrigation and then it seemed to stabilize kernel yield did not decline within the limits of applied irrigation considered in the current study fig 5 to quantify water productivity levels as a function of applied irrigation a second order polynomial expression was fitted to the mean yield versus ai fig 5 and its derivative the marginal water productivity was computed and plotted against ai fig 6 water productivity reached a maximum value of 0 34 kg m3 when no irrigation was applied and decreased to zero at 1260 mm becoming negative as ai increased fig 6 the yield response to ai and the marginal water productivities for regulated and sustained deficit irrigation strategies are shown in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2 respectively 3 3 meta analysis the effect of water deficit combining rdi with sdi treatments for all deficit levels on yield kg ha was assessed by means of a forest plot combining the 15 studies included in the database fig 7 this graph indicates that deficit treatments yielded 84 87 of what their respective well irrigated controls yielded the confidence interval is quite narrow varying between 0 85 and 0 89 in the case of a fixed effects model and between 0 79 and 0 89 in the case of a random effects model fig 7 finally the heterogeneity indicators showed a large variability between studies i 2 77 cochran s q indicator took a value of 61 54 p value 0 0001 indicating that the effect size differed among studies the funnel plot revealed the presence of a certain publication bias fig s3 however a regression test of funnel plot asymmetry provided an intercept of 0 1164 with a p value of 0 2519 suggesting that the estimated effects were robust fig 7 clearly shows that the control treatment favoured almond yield over deficit irrigation regardless of soil depth however the rate at which this yield increase occurred was different in deep random effects model 0 84 than in shallow soils random effects model 0 76 this suggests that deficit irrigation in shallow soils decreases yield to a greater extent than in the case of deeper soils the exact soil depth in each study incorporated within this meta analysis is unknown although the low number of studies carried out on shallow soils does not allow for drawing sound conclusions when rdi was compared against sdi regardless of the severity of the water stress applied the number of studies was reduced and conclusions were not clear fig 8 in fact if a fixed effects model is considered sdi led to a 3 higher yield compared to rdi however using a random effects model the result was the opposite fig 8 the variability between the studies was very high i 2 73 cochran s q indicator obtained a value of 26 07 p value 0 0005 indicating that the effect size differed among studies the funnel plot did not reveal the presence of publication bias fig s4 in addition almond yield benefited slightly under rdi in both deep and shallow soils the rate at which this increase in yield occurred was similar in deep random effects model 0 97 and in shallow soils random effects model 0 94 considering only a moderate water deficit the differences between applying this deficit in a sustained manner throughout the season or in certain phases of the crop cycle were practically nil fig s5 this may be because the analysis only considered the stress for the whole season which could be masking some other effects however when considering severe water stress the meta analysis seemed to indicate that it is more advisable to apply rdi as yield would be less affected fig s6 however it should be noted that the latter two analyses include fewer studies 4 discussion the quantitative analysis performed to evaluate the agronomic response of adult almond plantations grown in spain to different levels of water stress revealed a wide range of almond yields 352 3329 kg ha for a wide range of irrigation volumes applied 7 985 mm table 3 this variability was partly because the relationship between applied water and yield was not straightforward it was affected by the soil type the soil water content at the beginning of the season and the prevailing evaporative demand which can vary significantly among regions evapotranspiration was the pertinent indicator for this analysis but unfortunately it was seldom measured so the applied water was used here as a proxy for the actual water used by the almond trees the comparison of these results with those obtained in field experiments conducted in california the main almond producing area in the world showed that the maximum yields obtained in the field trials carried out in spain coincided with the minimum average yields obtained by goldhamer and fereres 2017 in a 5 year trial carried out in an adult almond orchard subjected to 10 irrigation levels in this sense it is important to highlight that the maximum irrigation volumes applied in the experiments carried out in spain were close to the minimum volumes used in the study performed by goldhamer and fereres 2017 where up to 1350 mm of irrigation depths were applied and maximum 5 year mean yields close to 4000 kg ha of almonds were obtained the incorporation of an irrigation treatment with over irrigation in the production function obtained in this study fig 5 did not lead to any increase in kernel yield suggesting that the volumes of water applied in control well irrigated treatments were suitable for reaching potential yields for the plant material crop management and agroclimatic conditions prevailing in spain the high almond yields achieved in california 4000 kg ha resulted from decades of crop intensification goldhamer and fereres 2017 with a similar situation in australia the second greatest almond producer worldwide whose almond growing sector employs the cultivars and cultural practices used in california thorp et al 2021 conversely in spain these levels of crop intensification with irrigation inputs that can exceed 1300 mm per year goldhamer and fereres 2017 are not expected due to the reduced availability of irrigation water in most of the inland areas into which almond plantations are expanding in this sense irrigation water allocations commonly range between 250 mm and 600 mm per year moldero et al 2021 well below the water requirements needed for intensive adult almond plantations under the premises of irrigating almond orchards with deficit allocations the results obtained in the current study confirmed the good productive performance of almond trees under conditions of moderate water deficit as very low yield penalties 7 9 were observed when compared with the control treatments fig 1 an important aspect of deficit irrigation management in almond orchards that continues to generate uncertainty is the convenience of using regulated rdi versus sustained sdi deficit irrigation strategies the results obtained in this work suggest although not definitely a certain advantage of using rdi strategies over sdi in almond trees in absolute terms the mean kernel yield between rdi and sdi treatments did not differ significantly regardless of the level of water deficit applied fig 1 however when relative yields were analyzed sdi differed from the control for both levels of water deficit moderate and severe in contrast the rdi treatment only differed from the control when the water deficit was severe fig 1 despite being significant the reduction in yield for a moderate water deficit applied through sdi was only 9 with respect to the control therefore the analysis performed could not robustly confirm that this irrigation strategy causes an appreciable decrease in almond yield the meta analysis fig 8 suggested a certain production advantage for rdi over sdi when simultaneously considering both moderate and severe water deficit therefore the current study cannot provide a definite answer for the first question raised about which irrigation strategy is more appropriate for a given water allocation below the total almond water requirements as the current study only suggests slight yield improvements for rdi rdi strategies in almond trees have mostly consisted of applying a certain level of water deficit during the kernel filling stage considered the most drought resistant phenological stage in almond trees girona et al 2005 however some studies observed yield reductions when water deficit was applied during this stage egea et al 2013 goldhamer et al 2006 goldhamer and viveros 2000 hutmacher et al 1994 while in other studies yield was unaffected by water deficits applied during kernel filling egea et al 2010 2009 goldhamer and fereres 2004 puerto et al 2013 these controversial results seem to be related to the level of water stress reached by trees during this period as stem water potential values lower than 2 mpa during kernel filling have been suggested to cause yield losses garc√≠a tejero et al 2018 due to variations in kernel weight girona et al 2005 despite this evidence the analysis conducted in this work indicates that applying water shortages only during the grain filling stage rather than spreading it proportionally throughout the crop cycle is not clearly justified this leads to the second question about what yield loss can be expected for a given water allocation when compared to a well watered orchard the results obtained in the current study are not conclusive on whether the cultivars evaluated differed in their productive response to deficit irrigation although some differences were observed in the relationships between water input and yield of each cultivar the variability in the ranges of water applied among the different experiments made it difficult to obtain sound conclusions regarding the tolerance of the cultivars to water stress on the other hand although it has sometimes been considered that shallow soils are better for the application of rdi strategies in woody crops due to the adequate timing of water stress application that is needed in an rdi strategy girona et al 2003 in almond trees it seems that the crop response to rdi strategies is poorer in shallow soils compared to deeper soils however the low number of studies developed on shallow soils does not allow for obtaining sound conclusions fig 7 nevertheless the current study indicated that for a moderate water deficit 7 9 yield reductions can be expected with respect to a well watered orchard while for a severe water deficit yield decrease could be up to 33 the applied irrigation yield response function obtained in this analysis comprising multiple cultivars irrigation treatments and experimental conditions fig 5 was similar to that obtained by moldero et al 2021 in a 6 year trial carried out in southern spain on almond trees cv guara by comparing both production functions it can be deduced that spanish cultivars have a similar productive response to irrigation under the agroclimatic and management conditions of the spanish almond orchards with maximum kernel yields obtained with irrigation water allocations of about 1000 mm per growth cycle however when these production functions were compared with that obtained in california goldhamer and fereres 2017 it was observed that californian almond plantations continued to increase kernel yields above 1000 mm of irrigation water applied reaching maximum yields close to 4000 kg ha with irrigation inputs of about 1250 mm per growth cycle the marginal productivity of irrigation water decreased continuously with any irrigation water input both in the relationship obtained by moldero et al 2021 and in the one obtained in this analysis fig 6 this pattern has also been observed in previous studies conducted with other cultivars e g cv marta egea et al 2010 while the almonds cv guara needed irrigation inputs close to 1000 mm for marginal water productivity to be zero in the meta analysis carried out in this study irrigation inputs close to 1200 mm were needed for marginal irrigation productivity to be zero in any case the comparison with the irrigation water productivities obtained in california shows the low productivity of irrigation inputs in spain above 800 mm year lower than 0 1 kg m3 while maximum marginal productivities of irrigation water of around 0 3 kg m3 were observed for irrigation inputs of 1100 mm year in california goldhamer and fereres 2017 from these data it can be concluded that higher irrigation water productivities than those observed in the spanish trials are possible for high irrigation water allocations therefore it seems that almond productive response depends mainly on the percentage of etc supplied annually answering the third question raised in the introduction of the current study however as irrigation water allocations above 700 800 mm are not expected in spain and over the mediterranean sea basin the scientific and technological challenge for almond cultivation is to increase the marginal productivity for moderate irrigation allocations to the levels observed in californian almond orchards for notably higher irrigation water allocations this could be achieved not only by means of improved irrigation technologies and scheduling but also by optimizing the overall agronomic management with particular attention to fertilization regimes and pruning operations the challenge of increasing marginal productivity should also consider the sustainability component for minimizing contamination risks ensuring soil conservation and considering the common trend of increasing organic farming cultivation 5 final considerations and recommendations despite the large variability observed in the pooled data set because of the wide range of studied conditions such as soil types cultivars climatic conditions or tree sizes among others the quantitative analysis conducted allowed us to derive some general trends in spain under semi arid mediterranean conditions almond yield increases with irrigation water application with an expected yield of about 2500 kg ha for around 1000 mm of irrigation water applied the yield reduction observed when water allocation decreased in comparison to fully irrigated trees was mostly due to the severity of the water stress suffered by trees and to a lesser extent due to the irrigation strategy implemented the application of a regulated deficit irrigation strategy rather than a sustained deficit one only showed some advantage when water stress was

south korea a combination of sixteen general circulation models gcms with two greenhouse gas emission scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways ssps were used in order to evaluate the uncertainty of the impacts the results indicated that shortened and unseasonable growing seasons are expected based on simulated leaf area index and biomass accounting for a reduction in rice yields of about 10 13 and 10 27 under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively this shorter growing season in addition to projected higher precipitation and less efficient application of nitrogen causes an increase of 7 2 19 8 and 12 0 35 3 in nitrogen loss under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively the findings demonstrated that the projected shortened and unseasonable crop growing season caused by climate change is a threat to global food security and the ecosystem due to the excessive pollutants loads into the environment keywords apex model climate change food security nutrient transport paddy rice production ssps scenarios data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction growing season length gsl and growing season timing gst are crucial to crop yields and global food security gst is defined as a particular point or period when the growing season happens and gsl mainly refers to the length of the growing season climate change and the projected 4 degree increase in global average temperature by the end of the 21st century ipcc 2013 have posed a threat to gsl gst hydroclimatic processes and crop phenologies lenton et al 2019 wang et al 2012 although climate change is a global phenomenon its impacts on gsl gst and ecohydroclimatological cycles may vary by geographical location thus to adopt the most suitable mitigation strategies for food security under a changing climate it is critical to study the impacts of climate change on gsl gst crop yields and food security globally rice is the second most crucial cereal feeding more than 50 of the population pathak et al 2018 a decline in rice production is a significant threat to global food security in south korea it consists of 90 of the total cereal production and has achieved self sufficiency of 103 it contributes about 13 1 to agricultural gross domestic product gdp marfa 2017 nasrullah et al 2021 thus it is crucial to plan for more resilient strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change for future sustainable rice production and food security literature is recently assigned to investigate the impacts of climate change on the length of the growing season climate change has lengthened the growing seasons in regions such as high latitudes 60 90 most of the high latitudes are experiencing extended gsls than two and half decades ago with an expansion up to almost three weeks in some places bouchard and qi 2017 reasons for such a trend toward longer growing seasons include changes in the timing or amount of precipitation or the drying out of soil due to higher temperatures wolfe et al 2005 zeng et al 2011 ziska et al 2011 zhu et al 2012 also indicated an extension of the growing season over mid latitudes in north america although climate change impacts lengthen the growing season in most of the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere the reverse is happening in most of central asia based on vegetation native grasses and trees rather than agricultural crops data from the past two decades from remote sensing climate change is rapidly shortening central asia s growing season growth is starting later and ending earlier even though central asia is warming faster than the global average wu et al 2021 more studies are required to shed light on the impacts of climate change on the length of growing seasons regardless of the altitude the average length of the growing season in the contiguous us has increased by more than two weeks since the beginning of the 20th century and precisely a significant steady and rapid increase has occurred in the west over the last 30 years kunkel et al 2004 cold climate regions not suitable for growing wheat and maize benefit from longer growing seasons possibly double cropping and having multiple harvests mueller et al 2015 kukal and irmak 2018 developed the relationships between county level crop yields vs agroclimatic changes they found that the study crops i e maize soybean sorghum spring wheat winter wheat and cotton responded positively to a lengthened growing season although a lengthened growing season is beneficiary for agriculture in various ways for e g more available land for planting and double cropping in many regions high temperature in some regions can be a limiting factor for plant productivity mueller et al 2015 variations in gsl and gst potentially impact the release of pollutants to water bodies paddy rice production practices significantly contribute to the pollution of water bodies in south korea since paddy rice is the primary crop and it covers 58 of the agricultural land in the country kosis 2020 about 50 of the annual rainfall in korea occurs in june and july during the monsoon season which coincides with the rice production season and makes paddy fields a potential non point source of pollutants into nearby streams and the environment due to the high amounts of rainfall and excessive applications of fertilizers in this specific period salim et al 2019 on the other hand cui et al 2020 suggested that a rice paddy field could act as a potential filter for nutrients and other chemicals with appropriate management practices instead of as a source of pollutants to shed light on the impacts of climate change on gsl and gst and hence on the contribution of paddy rice fields on nutrient transport simulation of ecohydroclimatological processes is beneficial since yields increase or decrease due to longer growing seasons is still unclear porter et al 2014 this research aims to study 1 the impacts of climate change on actual gsl and gst 2 the relationship between actual gsl and crop yields and 3 to discover the variation of nutrient transport from paddy fields to the surrounded water bodies the growing season term was revisited using simulated vegetation growth as an indicator of growing season instead of temperature variations in the literature thus the term of actual growing season which refers to the period that plant is growing is introduced in this study to achieve the objectives paddy rice was selected as the target crop the apex paddy model choi et al 2017a 2017b was used to simulate the vegetation growth and other echohydrological processes such as runoff generation and nutrient transport under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 climate scenarios in the near future nf 2011 2040 mid future mf 2041 2070 and far future ff 2071 2100 compared to historical hist 1981 2010 data 2 materials and methods in the literature the growing season is defined based on the suitability of temperature that allows plant growth for example gsl is the number of days between the first span of at least six days with a daily mean temperature warmer than 5 and the first span of 6 days with a daily mean temperature below 5 frich et al 2002 by this definition gsl increases in a warming climate as temperature increases the actual growing season can be identified using actual or simulated vegetation growth thus an indicator of plant growth can be used to determine the actual growing season this study used biomass and leaf area index lai to determine crop growth seasons the growing season starts with an increase in lai from zero continues with vegetation growth and eventually finishes as the lai decreases to zero the growing season can also be defined by an increase in biomass from zero for crops to the points where biomass reaches the highest point and the biomass curve becomes constant to assess the impacts of climate change on gsl critical ecohydroclimatological variables to plant growth were selected climatic variables including daily minimum and maximum temperature precipitation and solar radiation were obtained from sixteen global climate models under two scenarios using the apex paddy model these datasets were further used to project the main hydrological processes in paddy rice fields such as evaporation transpiration evapotranspiration and runoff then this model was used to simulate lai biomass and crop yields and then to project actual gsl since the changes in gsl influence the amount of nitrogen absorption by plants nitrogen n discharge from rice paddy fields into water bodies was simulated and projected to assess the impacts of climate change on each ecohydroclimatological variable the multi model ensemble mme of each dataset in nf 2011 2040 mf 2041 2070 and ff 2071 2100 was estimated and compared to the mme of each dataset in hist period 1981 2010 2 1 study area the gimje plain fig 1 is the largest in south korea and paddy rice fields cover 39 6 of this plain kosis 2020 the national institute of agricultural sciences nas has mounted a testbed within the gimje plain 35 44 56 13 n 126 51 50 21 e since 2012 for measuring and monitoring long term water movement methane and carbon dioxide fluxes in the paddy daily weather data were obtained from an automated synoptic observing system asos for 1981 2020 at the jeonju meteorological station 35 49 17 40 n 127 09 18 00 e mean annual precipitation and temperature are 1024 mm and 12 8 respectively approximately 45 of the annual rainfall occurs between july and august during the summer monsoon seasons the topsoil is silty clay loam the soil drainage is slightly poor and the paddy rice fields are irrigated inland typically rice season starts in late spring when rice seedlings are transplanted and continues until rice is harvested in fall paddy management often involves massive applications of fertilizers under intensive flood irrigation poor irrigation management or a significant storm event during or after puddling or transplanting threatens the water quality thus it is critical to study the runoff and fertilizer based pollutants transported from paddy rice fields into water bodies in the gimje plain 2 2 climate scenarios and downscaling two shared socioeconomic pathways ssp scenarios 1 ssp2 4 5 middle of the road development and 2 ssp5 8 5 fossil fueled development were used to forecast runoff n discharge and rice productivity from rice paddy fields using the apex paddy model the ssp2 4 5 scenarios reflect moderate challenges to mitigation and adoption while ssp5 8 5 reflects more extreme challenges to mitigation and adoption to climate change o neill et al 2016 the general source of data for a climate change impact evaluation is the general circulation models gcms however gcms have the challenge of running on a coarse horizontal scale 100 300 km resulting in uncertainties to address this uncertainty from a gcm multiple gcms are employed for downscaling as recommended by daron et al 2018 the release of coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 by the world climate research program wcrp which provided gcms for rcp scenarios simulations improved future scenario assessment comparing to the cmip3 gcms onyutha et al 2016 shiru et al 2020 the recently released cmip6 is a set of gcms whose future climate scenario projections are based on the ssps instead of the rcp used in the cmip5 gcms o neill et al 2016 song et al 2021 the projections from cmip5 rcps scenarios are based on climate force dimensions of greenhouse gases ghgs emission and radiative force at the same time the projections in cmip6 ssps scenarios are also based on socio economic drivers such as population and economic growth riahi et al 2017 thus highly dependent on socio economic development and human activities therefore it provides a broad range of scenarios that integrates key aspects of societal changes over the 21st century that influence mitigation and adaptation to climate change o neill et al 2017 arnell et al 2019 ssps provide five broad socio economic developments narratives ssp1 sustainable development ssp2 middle of the road ssp3 regional rivalry ssp4 inequality and ssp5 fossil fueled development riahi et al 2017 to reduce the impacts of the uncertainty of gcms it is recommended to use a multi model ensemble mme of various gcms chung et al 2015 noor et al 2019 thus climate change scenarios obtained from 16 gcms from cmip6 under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 were used to evaluate runoff n discharge gsl and rice yields under changing climate table 1 these gcms have different spatial resolutions and inherent biases that must be corrected therefore daily weather data for historical 1981 2010 and future 2015 2100 periods were downscaled for the jeonju weather station a non parametric quantile mapping technique of the simple quantile mapping sqm approach was used for bias correction cho et al 2018 the non parametric downscaling approach reduces the probability of possible overestimation in parametric downscaling methods cho et al 2018 the downscaling technique was applied for each climatic variable at a monthly timestep to adjust the monthly average and daily cumulative distributions the climate scenario data series were divided into three subsets nf 2011 2040 mf 2041 2070 and ff 2071 2100 the hist 1981 2010 was used for control purposes for each period the rate of change was calculated using eq 1 for comparison with historical data the data were subjected to an analysis of variance at a 5 significant level p 0 05 duncan s multiple range test was used where significant differences were observed in the annual values duncan 1956 1 change rate y p y h 100 y h where y p and y h are the average values over the projected periods and the average value over the historical period respectively 2 3 apex paddy model apex paddy model choi et al 2017a was employed to evaluate the impacts of climate change on gsl runoff agricultural non point source pollution mineral n discharge and rice yield the penman monteith method which requires air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed was used to estimate future potential evapotranspiration pet for calculating water balance in the paddy field apex paddy switches between the soil conservation service curve number scs cn hawkins et al 2009 method and a weir discharge equation paddy discharge is controlled by flood irrigation and weir discharge operation during the growing season when the paddy has standing water for weed control and rice growth when management does not require water ponding in the paddy in midseason drainage or off seasons the paddy weir system is set back to the default upland sub area and the scs cn method applies to runoff calculation choi et al 2017a apex paddy has a set of subroutines for simulating daily water balance ponding discharge control evapotranspiration and paddy management using eq 2 to 5 choi et al 2017a if the water level is below the irrigation trigger depth it the model responds by irrigating to reach the target depth td however if the water level is higher than outlet weir height h then overflow o occurs 2 pd

apex paddy include soil landuse digital elevation model dem and climate data paddy fields are located in lowlands and thus have a high portion of clay therefore the hydrologic soil group c was used the daily time interval was selected to simulate and track the biomass and vegetation growth daily weather data for the jeonju meteorological station located at 35 49 17 40 n and 127 09 18 00 e was obtained from automated synoptic observing system asos the weather data include the minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity from 1981 to 2010 the calibrated apex paddy model choi et al 2017a was extended to estimate the effects of climate change using the bias corrected ssp scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 rice cultivation in the study area implements the typical rice cultivation schedule in south korea rice seeds are nursed for about 25 30 days and then transplanted to the paddy field with 1 5 2 leaves these nursed seedlings are then transplanted from mid may to june land preparational operations include weeding fertilizer application irrigation and puddling irrigation is managed at 60 mm ponding depth to ensure sufficient water and weed control during the growing season for the best rice productivity the first application of fertilizer 55 45 40 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 herbicide and pesticide is from may to june the second fertilizer 22 0 0 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 application is planned for june to july the last fertilizer 33 0 17 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 is applied from july to august to help fill the grain midseason drainage is carried out for two weeks in july to suppress invalid tillering and support root establishment after midseason drainage irrigation is done to a depth of 80 mm and a complete drain is further conducted at the end of september for harvesting in october the final management practice harvest is set for august to october in the simulation process 2 3 2 evaluation criteria evaluation criteria of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 recommended by moriasi et al 2015 were used for the calibration and validation of the model if r2 0 60 nse 0 50 and pbias 15 for a factor then the model performance is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2015 r2 nse and pbias are estimated by eqs 6 7 and 8 respectively 6 r 2 p p o o p p 2 o o 2 2 7 nse 1 o p 2 o o 2 8 pbias o p o 100 where p and o are the predicted and observed values respectively p and o are the means of p s and o s respectievley the apex paddy model choi et al 2017a was calibrated for periods of 2003 2004 in icheon and 2014 in gimje for runoff in daily time step nitrogen was calibrated only in icheon fig 1 from 2003 2004 due to a lack of testbed and observed nitrogen data in gimje grain yield data from 1996 to 2014 in both icheon and gimje was used for calibration the performance metrics indicated that the model can be used for predicting runoff r2 0 88 nse 0 87 pbias 14 57 nitrogen r2 0 66 nse 0 63 pbias 2 1 and crop yield choi et al 2017a thus this calibrated model was used to estimate the effects of climate change using the bias corrected ssp scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 3 results after adjusting parameter values in apex paddy through the calibration process table 2 the model s performance in simulating runoff and n discharge was within very good to satisfactory categories based on the calibration and validation results table 3 3 1 evaluation of bias corrected climate scenarios the comparison of raw and bias corrected datasets with the median of the observed precipitation solar radiation average daily minimum temperature and average daily maximum temperature from sixteen cmip6 gcms fig 2 indicated that the raw gcms data significantly deviated from the median of the observed data after the bias correction the down scaled gcms successfully captured the variance and trends found in the experimental data fig 2 3 2 future climate increases in solar radiation and annual average daily minimum and maximum temperatures were found in ssp scenarios fig 3 the magnitudes of the increase in all climatic variables except for solar radiation were higher in ssp5 8 5 than in ssp2 4 5 solar radiation in both climate scenarios had similar percentages of increase the increase in the annual average daily minimum temperature was more significant than the maximum temperature in both scenarios the values of increase in the annual average daily minimum temperature along the future periods were 17 2 nf 32 2 mf and 43 7 ff and 7 9 nf 14 8 mf and 20 1 ff for average daily maximum temperature under ssp2 4 5 under ssp5 8 5 the increases in the average daily temperature along the future periods were 18 4 nf 43 7 mf and 73 6 ff for the average daily minimum temperature and 8 5 nf 20 1 mf and 32 3 ff for the average daily maximum temperature table 4 fig 4 also shows the temperature variations through julian days over both scenarios historical and future periods the length of growing seasons based on temperature is also depicted in this figure according to frich et al 2002 5 is a critical temperature for gsl the comparison of mme of the future periods and the historical mean showed that the temperature in the future periods starts to get higher than 5 earlier and starts to get lower than 5 later thus an extended gsl is expected in the future to determine the actual gsl it is required to analyse the data from biomass and lai fig 5 a significant increase in precipitation was projected for all the future periods and this increase was higher under the ssp5 8 5 than in the ssp2 4 5 scenario compared to the observed and historical data precipitation increased by 5 6 11 9 and 16 3 for nf mf and ff under ssp2 4 5 respectively under the worse scenario of ssp5 8 5 precipitation increased by 7 0 14 4 and 24 8 for nf mf and ff respectively table 4 the coefficient of variations cvs in table 4 shows that the uncertainties in these gcm s weather variables increased in all future periods in both ssp scenarios according to ssp2 4 5 the cv values of minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation for hist increased from 0 04 0 09 and 0 23 0 06 0 12 and 0 27 for ff respectively according to ssp5 8 5 the cv values of minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation increased to 0 08 0 16 and 0 28 for ff respectively in general the ssp5 8 5 scenario had higher uncertainties than the ssp2 4 5 scenario since the ssp5 8 5 is based on more extreme scenarios table 4 and fig 3 3 3 the length of the growing season the results indicate that the impact of climate change on actual gsl is significant according to the outputs of apex paddy the predicted temperature increase figs 3 and 4 causes a faster accumulation of heat units in future periods and therefore a more rapid growth and biomass accumulation of paddy rice as the potential heat units phu will be met earlier during the growing season the biomass accumulation would cease earlier fig 6 leading to a shorter actual gsl according to ssp5 8 5 scenarios the biomass reached its highest value earlier than hist by 17 30 and 38 days in nf mf and ff respectively the earlier biomass accumulation and shorter actual gsl were also observed in the ssp2 4 5 scenarios table 4 with less severe impacts induced by climate change fig 7 shows the variation of lai the sharper bell shape of the lai curve for mme of future data compared to the broader bell shape curve of the historical period shows a shorter actual gsl in the future fig 7 although the simulated results of lai and biomass indicated that the actual gsl would be shortened in the future gsl based on temperature would be extended fig 4 this contradiction highlights the importance of using lai and biomass rather than temperature variations to estimate the actual gsl in addition to gsl is also influenced by climate change particularly by an increase in temperature and timing fig 4 shows that the temperature in the future periods starts to increase earlier a backward shift in the mme of future data compared to the historical period for lai and biomass in figs 6 and 7 indicates an earlier growing season in the future according to ssp5 8 5 scenarios biomass curve slope and lai became zero earlier than hist by 17 30 and 38 days in nf mf and ff respectively the impact of climate change on gsl was also significant based on ssp2 4 5 scenarios the time that biomass curve slope and lai became above zero was earlier than hist by 13 22 and 31 days in nf mf and ff respectively table 4 the maximum value of lai the number of days with the maximum lai and the maximum value of biomass are other critical indicators of growing seasons that affect crop growth and crop yields the maximum value of lai was increased by 0 08 0 16 and 0 22 in nf mf and ff for ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively table 5 however the maximum value of biomass was decreased by 1 2 1 7 and 3 4 t ha in nf mf and ff respectively table 4 the number of days with the maximum lai also shrank by 5 8 and 12 days in nf mf and ff for ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively and 4 6 and 8 days in nf mf and ff for ssp2 4 5 scenarios respectively table 4 thus it is expected to observe a shorter period to reach the maximum lai higher lai and lower biomass in the future 3 4 future runoff and nitrogen discharge from paddy field runoff and n discharge increased in the future periods for both ssps scenarios compared with the historical period a significant increase in precipitation led to a substantial increase in runoff and n discharge in both scenarios with higher runoff and n discharge in ssp5 8 5 table 6 the cv values in table 6 show that the uncertainties in the projected runoff increased in the nf and ff periods for both scenarios the cv values of runoff for hist increased from 0 31 to 0 35 and 0 36 for ff in ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively in contrast the cv values of the projected n discharge in table 6 show that the uncertainties decreased in all the future periods in both ssp scenarios the decreases in the projected runoff in the mf period and the projected n discharge for all the future periods can be related to the model uncertainty runoff increased by 7 0 14 6 and 20 3 for nf mf and ff under the ssp2 4 5 scenario respectively under the ssp5 8 5 scenario runoff for nf mf and ff further increased to 8 4 17 4 and 31 5 respectively table 6 nitrogen discharge followed a similar trend as runoff n discharge increased by 7 2 13 2 and 19 8 for nf mf and ff under the ssp2 4 5 scenario respectively n discharge increased to 12 0 18 6 and 35 3 for nf mf and ff under ssp5 8 5 respectively table 6 the earlier and faster accumulation of biomass and the projected shorter actual gsl cause less nitrogen uptake by the rice thus more nitrogen loads discharge from paddy fields into the water bodies 3 5 future paddy rice yield variability in climate variables especially in temperature and precipitation due to climate change affects evapotranspiration and thus the growth and yield of rice results show that evaporation of ponding water in paddy fields and evapotranspiration will significantly increase in the future periods with a higher percentage increase for ssp5 8 5 thus more water is required for irrigation as a result of the increase in evaporation of ponding water in paddy fields less ponded water will remain and hence less water will be available for paddy rice in the future on the other hand transpiration volumes are expected to decrease significantly in all future periods table 7 due to shortened actual gsl and elevated co2 concentration future rice yields will substantially reduce under both ssp scenarios the uncertainty of projected grain yield will be higher under ssp5 8 5 than ssp2 4 5 table 7 and fig 8 in this scenario the uncertainty for hist is increased from 0 12 to 0 14 in the ff period however the cv values in table 7 show that the uncertainty of projected yield based on the ssp2 4 5 scenario has decreased from hist to the future periods 0 11 rice yield is estimated to reduce by 9 7 11 3 and 12 9 in the nf mf and ff periods under ssp2 4 5 respectively under the ssp5 8 5 scenario rice yield is more susceptible to the changing climate with yield reductions of 9 7 14 5 and 27 4 during the nf mf and ff periods respectively the acceleration of ghgs emissions in the ff period is expected to worsen the growing environment with more than a 20 additional reduction in yield under ssp5 8 5 than the ssp2 4 5 scenario table 7 4 discussion 4 1 climate change gsl runoff and n discharge into the environment the results exhibited unfavorable effects of climate change on actual gsl crop yields runoff volume and n discharge from paddy fields the apex paddy simulation results indicate that the increased variability and magnitude of precipitation intensities will cause a higher quantity of runoff and n discharge in rice paddies under the ssp2 4 5 scenario which emulates moderate emissions the average 13 2 increase in n discharge in the future is primarily attributable to an 11 9 increase in precipitation and a 14 6 increase in runoff tables 4 and 6 in comparison the estimated increase of 35 3 in n discharge in the ssp5 8 5 scenario exhibits compounding effects of uncontrolled ghgs emissions and its environmental stress in rice cultivation the significant correlations among precipitation runoff and nitrogen discharge in rice paddies are well supported by other studies in south korea e g kamruzzaman et al 2020a kim et al 2020 according to the results a shorter period to reach the maximum lai higher lai and lower biomass is expected in the future this can be a reason for lower crop yields the projected increase in temperature and consequently the transpiration rate causes a reduction of vegetative tissue s water content thus depression in the rate of growth and biomass production the projected higher temperature that affects evapotranspiration would lead to less transpiration volumes in all future periods table 7 shortened actual gsl and elevated co2 concentration in that case the photosynthesis period is shortened reducing total biomass crop yield and transpiration weraduwage et al 2015 suggested a non linear relationship between leaf area and plant biomass that is variable depending on carbon partitioning the study revealed that while photosynthesis may drive plant growth significant changes in growth can occur as a result of small changes in the partitioning of assimilated carbon to growth especially to leaf area growth and thickening a linear relationship between leaf mass and plant mass could be seen during the vegetative phase of plant growth when up to 88 of plant mass was composed of leaf mass at this stage leaf mass could provide a reasonably accurate estimation of plant mass however as the plants attained reproductive maturity more carbon was allocated to inflorescence growth disrupting this linear relationship such that leaf mass tended to vastly underestimate plant mass weraduwage et al 2015 the apex paddy model uses an exponential equation for the calculation of biomass based on lai and solar radiation choi 2019 the projected increase in lai maximum and decrease in biomass maximum tables 4 and 5 can be related to the non linear relationship between lai and biomass after vegetative growth and other factors like water stress in other words lower crop yields can be reflected in lower biomass while lai is projected to increase in the future under moderate effort to deal with climate change under ssp2 4 5 an average daily temperature increases of about 3 is expected for all future periods in the 21st century table 4 this is in line with the study by li et al 2011 in china a region with the same monsoon climate as the study area in this study the same 3 increase in average daily temperature was projected as a result a significant increase in inorganic n phosphorus and sediment discharge into water bodies estuary was observed a substantial fraction of fertilizers applied to the paddy was susceptible to discharge into the environment rather than being used for rice growth chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 due to earlier and shorter growing seasons with the projected increase in temperature rice maturation in the paddy will hasten resulting in less nutrient use for biomass accumulation thus causing poor nutrient use efficiency dong et al 2011 yang et al 2019 and higher amounts of residual n in the paddy field at the end of the season choi et al 2020 these residual nutrients move along with runoff into the environment since most soil nutrients especially inorganic nitrogen nitrate are highly soluble in water and have weak adsorption to the soil wu et al 2018 thus reducing n discharge from the paddy rice field into the environment can be reduced by more efficiently applying nitrogen fertilizers under the best management practices about 58 of agricultural land in south korea is under paddy rice production kosis 2020 therefore it is necessary to plan strategies to manage runoff and more efficient application of nitrogen fertilizers for sustainable and environmental friendly rice production with the predicted increase in runoff and nitrogen discharge under a changing climate the results on climate change impacts are well aligned with other studies that used the cmip5 gcms of rcps indicating similar increasing trends in precipitation and average daily minimum and maximum temperatures in the future and by the end of the 21st century kamruzzaman et al 2020b evaluated water balance in paddy rice production in south korea using rcp gcms in cmip5 and the apex paddy model across all future periods under rcp4 5 a projection of 8 5 14 5 7 1 17 0 and 11 2 15 3 increase in precipitation average daily minimum and maximum temperatures were observed respectively under rcp8 5 a further increase of 6 4 23 0 10 1 44 7 and 12 0 26 7 was observed for precipitation and average daily minimum and maximum temperatures respectively in this study across all the future periods a projected increase of 5 6 16 3 17 2 43 7 and 7 9 20 1 in precipitation average daily minimum and maximum temperatures under ssp2 4 5 were observed respectively under ssp5 8 5 an increase of 7 0 24 8 18 4 73 6 and 8 5 32 3 were observed for precipitation and average daily minimum and maximum temperatures respectively thus the ssp gcms in cmip6 used in this study presented a worse climate change projection than rcp gcms in cmip5 for climate prediction in the same location this agrees with the observation by song et al 2021 who observed that cmip6 ssp gcms improved reproducibility of historical periods and did better future climate forecasting than the rcp gcms in cmip5 thus it is suggested that climate forecast with cmip6 increases the confidence of prediction than using gcms of cmip5 the ssp scenario projection uses both radiation enforcement and socio economic activities which either reduce or increase ghgs emissions into the atmosphere over time on the other hand the rcp projections are only based on radiative enforcement and co2 concentration in the atmosphere over time van vuuren et al 2014 4 2 rice productivity and implications on food security the inverse relationship between rice transpiration and co2 concentration in the future table 7 indicates that as the co2 in the atmosphere increases due to human activities crops keep stomatal openings narrower and lose less moisture to the atmosphere however the high temperature results in shortened growth and development period at the expense of rice grain filling and yield kumar et al 2019 chaturvedi et al 2017 the projected sharper increase in minimum night temperatures than maximum day temperature table 4 and the predicted reduction in rice yields demonstrated potential threats to food security due to the high sensitivity of rice to the increased night temperature lyman et al 2013 rice requires daily minimum and maximum temperatures of 22 and 28 for optimum growth and development an increase of 1 in average temperature corresponds to a 10 15 loss in rice yield zhao et al 2017 fahad et al 2019 respectively increasing night temperatures results in increased night respiration and high loss in carbon especially during the post flowing stage causing faster growth with less time for biomass accumulation and thus a reduction in rice yield bahuguna et al 2017 under moderate human activities and emissions ssp2 4 5 it is expected to observe an increase in night temperature by 17 2 32 2 and 43 7 corresponding to 9 7 11 3 and 12 9 grain yield loss for nf mf and ff respectively under worse socio economic activities with no concern for the environment ssp5 8 5 night temperatures will increase by 18 4 43 7 and 73 6 with a correspondent grain loss of 9 7 14 5 and 27 4 for nf mf and ff respectively tables 4 and 6 thus this decline in rice production is a significant threat to global food security and it is critical to mitigate and adapt to climate change and its consequences 5 conclusions the ecohydroclimatological assessment of climate change impacts on the length of growing seasons of paddy rice in south korea projected shortened actual growing seasons due to an increase in the prospective average daily temperature although an extended gsl was predicted based on the traditional gsl definition which is based on temperature the simulated lai and biomass by the apex paddy model predicted shortened growing seasons in the future since the results of this study projected an earlier increase in temperature an unseasonable or earlier growing season is expected in the future the findings also demonstrated an increase in runoff due to predicted increased precipitation in the study area an increase in n discharge into the environment from paddy fields was also projected since the change in the phenology of paddy rice affected the length of the growing season and rice yields the rapid accumulation of potential heat units causes biomass accumulation to cease earlier thus the accumulated nitrogen outflow increased due to less absorption of nitrogen although the biomass accumulation rate is increased the final biomass and thus rice yields are reduced hence this significant reduction in rice grain yields is expected in the future due to the projected increase in average daily temperature in the 21st century to secure food production a series of strategies can be taken for example a reduction in ghgs emissions can alleviate the negative impacts of climate change and lead to more sustainable rice production improved best management practices bmps in agriculture such as shifting cropping period and more efficient application of nitrogen fertilizers in paddy fields through right timing and quantity application will reduce the n loads in water bodies adjusting the height of the rice paddy field weir can also lead to less runoff discharge from the rice paddy fields into the environment and more efficient rainwater use moreover timing and amount of water for irrigation in addition to an alternative wetting and drying lead to more efficient water use in the paddy fields breeding for rice varieties tolerant to high temperatures and water stress can enable sustainable rice production under elevated temperatures and limited water conditions this study has given foresight into the future of rice production and environmental implications in gimje plain in south korea since this study is limited to only one crop rice in one specific region under specific conditions timing of planting and amounts of fertilizers future studies are suggested this study can be extrapolated to other regions with similar agroecological characteristics or on a bigger scale particularly at different altitudes potential future research can be focused on adjustments in the current timing of planting and the amount of nitrogen fertilizers to adapt to the changing climate future studies can also assess the impacts of climate change on other crops and water quality parameters the findings of this study including increasing temperature unseasonable and shortened actual growing seasons and more nitrogen discharge in water bodies call for strategies and adjustments in human activities toward reducing ghgs emissions to maintain food security for an increasing global population in the future declaration of competing

9069,climate change has altered ecohydroclimatological variables and the phenology of crops and thus has threatened the ecosystem and food security this study aims to quantify the impacts of climate change on the length and timing of growing seasons crop yields and nitrogen transport from paddy fields a calibrated apex paddy model was used to simulate the paddy rice fields in gimje district of south korea a combination of sixteen general circulation models gcms with two greenhouse gas emission scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways ssps were used in order to evaluate the uncertainty of the impacts the results indicated that shortened and unseasonable growing seasons are expected based on simulated leaf area index and biomass accounting for a reduction in rice yields of about 10 13 and 10 27 under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively this shorter growing season in addition to projected higher precipitation and less efficient application of nitrogen causes an increase of 7 2 19 8 and 12 0 35 3 in nitrogen loss under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively the findings demonstrated that the projected shortened and unseasonable crop growing season caused by climate change is a threat to global food security and the ecosystem due to the excessive pollutants loads into the environment keywords apex model climate change food security nutrient transport paddy rice production ssps scenarios data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction growing season length gsl and growing season timing gst are crucial to crop yields and global food security gst is defined as a particular point or period when the growing season happens and gsl mainly refers to the length of the growing season climate change and the projected 4 degree increase in global average temperature by the end of the 21st century ipcc 2013 have posed a threat to gsl gst hydroclimatic processes and crop phenologies lenton et al 2019 wang et al 2012 although climate change is a global phenomenon its impacts on gsl gst and ecohydroclimatological cycles may vary by geographical location thus to adopt the most suitable mitigation strategies for food security under a changing climate it is critical to study the impacts of climate change on gsl gst crop yields and food security globally rice is the second most crucial cereal feeding more than 50 of the population pathak et al 2018 a decline in rice production is a significant threat to global food security in south korea it consists of 90 of the total cereal production and has achieved self sufficiency of 103 it contributes about 13 1 to agricultural gross domestic product gdp marfa 2017 nasrullah et al 2021 thus it is crucial to plan for more resilient strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change for future sustainable rice production and food security literature is recently assigned to investigate the impacts of climate change on the length of the growing season climate change has lengthened the growing seasons in regions such as high latitudes 60 90 most of the high latitudes are experiencing extended gsls than two and half decades ago with an expansion up to almost three weeks in some places bouchard and qi 2017 reasons for such a trend toward longer growing seasons include changes in the timing or amount of precipitation or the drying out of soil due to higher temperatures wolfe et al 2005 zeng et al 2011 ziska et al 2011 zhu et al 2012 also indicated an extension of the growing season over mid latitudes in north america although climate change impacts lengthen the growing season in most of the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere the reverse is happening in most of central asia based on vegetation native grasses and trees rather than agricultural crops data from the past two decades from remote sensing climate change is rapidly shortening central asia s growing season growth is starting later and ending earlier even though central asia is warming faster than the global average wu et al 2021 more studies are required to shed light on the impacts of climate change on the length of growing seasons regardless of the altitude the average length of the growing season in the contiguous us has increased by more than two weeks since the beginning of the 20th century and precisely a significant steady and rapid increase has occurred in the west over the last 30 years kunkel et al 2004 cold climate regions not suitable for growing wheat and maize benefit from longer growing seasons possibly double cropping and having multiple harvests mueller et al 2015 kukal and irmak 2018 developed the relationships between county level crop yields vs agroclimatic changes they found that the study crops i e maize soybean sorghum spring wheat winter wheat and cotton responded positively to a lengthened growing season although a lengthened growing season is beneficiary for agriculture in various ways for e g more available land for planting and double cropping in many regions high temperature in some regions can be a limiting factor for plant productivity mueller et al 2015 variations in gsl and gst potentially impact the release of pollutants to water bodies paddy rice production practices significantly contribute to the pollution of water bodies in south korea since paddy rice is the primary crop and it covers 58 of the agricultural land in the country kosis 2020 about 50 of the annual rainfall in korea occurs in june and july during the monsoon season which coincides with the rice production season and makes paddy fields a potential non point source of pollutants into nearby streams and the environment due to the high amounts of rainfall and excessive applications of fertilizers in this specific period salim et al 2019 on the other hand cui et al 2020 suggested that a rice paddy field could act as a potential filter for nutrients and other chemicals with appropriate management practices instead of as a source of pollutants to shed light on the impacts of climate change on gsl and gst and hence on the contribution of paddy rice fields on nutrient transport simulation of ecohydroclimatological processes is beneficial since yields increase or decrease due to longer growing seasons is still unclear porter et al 2014 this research aims to study 1 the impacts of climate change on actual gsl and gst 2 the relationship between actual gsl and crop yields and 3 to discover the variation of nutrient transport from paddy fields to the surrounded water bodies the growing season term was revisited using simulated vegetation growth as an indicator of growing season instead of temperature variations in the literature thus the term of actual growing season which refers to the period that plant is growing is introduced in this study to achieve the objectives paddy rice was selected as the target crop the apex paddy model choi et al 2017a 2017b was used to simulate the vegetation growth and other echohydrological processes such as runoff generation and nutrient transport under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 climate scenarios in the near future nf 2011 2040 mid future mf 2041 2070 and far future ff 2071 2100 compared to historical hist 1981 2010 data 2 materials and methods in the literature the growing season is defined based on the suitability of temperature that allows plant growth for example gsl is the number of days between the first span of at least six days with a daily mean temperature warmer than 5 and the first span of 6 days with a daily mean temperature below 5 frich et al 2002 by this definition gsl increases in a warming climate as temperature increases the actual growing season can be identified using actual or simulated vegetation growth thus an indicator of plant growth can be used to determine the actual growing season this study used biomass and leaf area index lai to determine crop growth seasons the growing season starts with an increase in lai from zero continues with vegetation growth and eventually finishes as the lai decreases to zero the growing season can also be defined by an increase in biomass from zero for crops to the points where biomass reaches the highest point and the biomass curve becomes constant to assess the impacts of climate change on gsl critical ecohydroclimatological variables to plant growth were selected climatic variables including daily minimum and maximum temperature precipitation and solar radiation were obtained from sixteen global climate models under two scenarios using the apex paddy model these datasets were further used to project the main hydrological processes in paddy rice fields such as evaporation transpiration evapotranspiration and runoff then this model was used to simulate lai biomass and crop yields and then to project actual gsl since the changes in gsl influence the amount of nitrogen absorption by plants nitrogen n discharge from rice paddy fields into water bodies was simulated and projected to assess the impacts of climate change on each ecohydroclimatological variable the multi model ensemble mme of each dataset in nf 2011 2040 mf 2041 2070 and ff 2071 2100 was estimated and compared to the mme of each dataset in hist period 1981 2010 2 1 study area the gimje plain fig 1 is the largest in south korea and paddy rice fields cover 39 6 of this plain kosis 2020 the national institute of agricultural sciences nas has mounted a testbed within the gimje plain 35 44 56 13 n 126 51 50 21 e since 2012 for measuring and monitoring long term water movement methane and carbon dioxide fluxes in the paddy daily weather data were obtained from an automated synoptic observing system asos for 1981 2020 at the jeonju meteorological station 35 49 17 40 n 127 09 18 00 e mean annual precipitation and temperature are 1024 mm and 12 8 respectively approximately 45 of the annual rainfall occurs between july and august during the summer monsoon seasons the topsoil is silty clay loam the soil drainage is slightly poor and the paddy rice fields are irrigated inland typically rice season starts in late spring when rice seedlings are transplanted and continues until rice is harvested in fall paddy management often involves massive applications of fertilizers under intensive flood irrigation poor irrigation management or a significant storm event during or after puddling or transplanting threatens the water quality thus it is critical to study the runoff and fertilizer based pollutants transported from paddy rice fields into water bodies in the gimje plain 2 2 climate scenarios and downscaling two shared socioeconomic pathways ssp scenarios 1 ssp2 4 5 middle of the road development and 2 ssp5 8 5 fossil fueled development were used to forecast runoff n discharge and rice productivity from rice paddy fields using the apex paddy model the ssp2 4 5 scenarios reflect moderate challenges to mitigation and adoption while ssp5 8 5 reflects more extreme challenges to mitigation and adoption to climate change o neill et al 2016 the general source of data for a climate change impact evaluation is the general circulation models gcms however gcms have the challenge of running on a coarse horizontal scale 100 300 km resulting in uncertainties to address this uncertainty from a gcm multiple gcms are employed for downscaling as recommended by daron et al 2018 the release of coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 by the world climate research program wcrp which provided gcms for rcp scenarios simulations improved future scenario assessment comparing to the cmip3 gcms onyutha et al 2016 shiru et al 2020 the recently released cmip6 is a set of gcms whose future climate scenario projections are based on the ssps instead of the rcp used in the cmip5 gcms o neill et al 2016 song et al 2021 the projections from cmip5 rcps scenarios are based on climate force dimensions of greenhouse gases ghgs emission and radiative force at the same time the projections in cmip6 ssps scenarios are also based on socio economic drivers such as population and economic growth riahi et al 2017 thus highly dependent on socio economic development and human activities therefore it provides a broad range of scenarios that integrates key aspects of societal changes over the 21st century that influence mitigation and adaptation to climate change o neill et al 2017 arnell et al 2019 ssps provide five broad socio economic developments narratives ssp1 sustainable development ssp2 middle of the road ssp3 regional rivalry ssp4 inequality and ssp5 fossil fueled development riahi et al 2017 to reduce the impacts of the uncertainty of gcms it is recommended to use a multi model ensemble mme of various gcms chung et al 2015 noor et al 2019 thus climate change scenarios obtained from 16 gcms from cmip6 under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 were used to evaluate runoff n discharge gsl and rice yields under changing climate table 1 these gcms have different spatial resolutions and inherent biases that must be corrected therefore daily weather data for historical 1981 2010 and future 2015 2100 periods were downscaled for the jeonju weather station a non parametric quantile mapping technique of the simple quantile mapping sqm approach was used for bias correction cho et al 2018 the non parametric downscaling approach reduces the probability of possible overestimation in parametric downscaling methods cho et al 2018 the downscaling technique was applied for each climatic variable at a monthly timestep to adjust the monthly average and daily cumulative distributions the climate scenario data series were divided into three subsets nf 2011 2040 mf 2041 2070 and ff 2071 2100 the hist 1981 2010 was used for control purposes for each period the rate of change was calculated using eq 1 for comparison with historical data the data were subjected to an analysis of variance at a 5 significant level p 0 05 duncan s multiple range test was used where significant differences were observed in the annual values duncan 1956 1 change rate y p y h 100 y h where y p and y h are the average values over the projected periods and the average value over the historical period respectively 2 3 apex paddy model apex paddy model choi et al 2017a was employed to evaluate the impacts of climate change on gsl runoff agricultural non point source pollution mineral n discharge and rice yield the penman monteith method which requires air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed was used to estimate future potential evapotranspiration pet for calculating water balance in the paddy field apex paddy switches between the soil conservation service curve number scs cn hawkins et al 2009 method and a weir discharge equation paddy discharge is controlled by flood irrigation and weir discharge operation during the growing season when the paddy has standing water for weed control and rice growth when management does not require water ponding in the paddy in midseason drainage or off seasons the paddy weir system is set back to the default upland sub area and the scs cn method applies to runoff calculation choi et al 2017a apex paddy has a set of subroutines for simulating daily water balance ponding discharge control evapotranspiration and paddy management using eq 2 to 5 choi et al 2017a if the water level is below the irrigation trigger depth it the model responds by irrigating to reach the target depth td however if the water level is higher than outlet weir height h then overflow o occurs 2 pd

apex paddy include soil landuse digital elevation model dem and climate data paddy fields are located in lowlands and thus have a high portion of clay therefore the hydrologic soil group c was used the daily time interval was selected to simulate and track the biomass and vegetation growth daily weather data for the jeonju meteorological station located at 35 49 17 40 n and 127 09 18 00 e was obtained from automated synoptic observing system asos the weather data include the minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity from 1981 to 2010 the calibrated apex paddy model choi et al 2017a was extended to estimate the effects of climate change using the bias corrected ssp scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 rice cultivation in the study area implements the typical rice cultivation schedule in south korea rice seeds are nursed for about 25 30 days and then transplanted to the paddy field with 1 5 2 leaves these nursed seedlings are then transplanted from mid may to june land preparational operations include weeding fertilizer application irrigation and puddling irrigation is managed at 60 mm ponding depth to ensure sufficient water and weed control during the growing season for the best rice productivity the first application of fertilizer 55 45 40 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 herbicide and pesticide is from may to june the second fertilizer 22 0 0 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 application is planned for june to july the last fertilizer 33 0 17 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 is applied from july to august to help fill the grain midseason drainage is carried out for two weeks in july to suppress invalid tillering and support root establishment after midseason drainage irrigation is done to a depth of 80 mm and a complete drain is further conducted at the end of september for harvesting in october the final management practice harvest is set for august to october in the simulation process 2 3 2 evaluation criteria evaluation criteria of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 recommended by moriasi et al 2015 were used for the calibration and validation of the model if r2 0 60 nse 0 50 and pbias 15 for a factor then the model performance is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2015 r2 nse and pbias are estimated by eqs 6 7 and 8 respectively 6 r 2 p p o o p p 2 o o 2 2 7 nse 1 o p 2 o

periods of 2003 2004 in icheon and 2014 in gimje for runoff in daily time step nitrogen was calibrated only in icheon fig 1 from 2003 2004 due to a lack of testbed and observed nitrogen data in gimje grain yield data from 1996 to 2014 in both icheon and gimje was used for calibration the performance metrics indicated that the model can be used for predicting runoff r2 0 88 nse 0 87 pbias 14 57 nitrogen r2 0 66 nse 0 63 pbias 2 1 and crop yield choi et al 2017a thus this calibrated model was used to estimate the effects of climate change using the bias corrected ssp scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 3 results after adjusting parameter values in apex paddy through the calibration process table 2 the model s performance in simulating runoff and n discharge was within very good to satisfactory categories based on the calibration and validation results table 3 3 1 evaluation of bias corrected climate scenarios the comparison of raw and bias corrected datasets with the median of the observed precipitation solar radiation average daily minimum temperature and average daily maximum temperature from sixteen cmip6 gcms fig 2 indicated that the raw gcms data significantly deviated from the median of the observed data after the bias correction the down scaled gcms successfully captured the variance and trends found in the experimental data fig 2 3 2 future climate increases in solar radiation and annual average daily minimum and maximum temperatures were found in ssp scenarios fig 3 the magnitudes of the increase in all climatic variables except for solar radiation were higher in ssp5 8 5 than in ssp2 4 5 solar radiation in both climate scenarios had similar percentages of increase the increase in the annual average daily minimum temperature was more significant than the maximum temperature in both scenarios the values of increase in the annual average daily minimum temperature along the future periods were 17 2 nf 32 2 mf and 43 7 ff and 7 9 nf 14 8 mf and 20 1 ff for average daily maximum temperature under ssp2 4 5 under ssp5 8 5 the increases in the average daily temperature along the future periods were 18 4 nf 43 7 mf and 73 6 ff for the average daily minimum temperature and 8 5 nf 20 1 mf and 32 3 ff for the average daily maximum temperature table 4 fig 4 also shows the temperature variations through julian days over both scenarios historical and future periods the length of growing seasons based on temperature is also depicted in this figure according to frich et al 2002 5 is a critical temperature for gsl the comparison of mme of the future periods and the historical mean showed that the temperature in the future periods starts to get higher than 5 earlier and starts to get lower than 5 later thus an extended gsl is expected in the future to determine the actual gsl it is required to analyse the data from biomass and lai fig 5 a significant increase in precipitation was projected for all the future periods and this increase was higher under the ssp5 8 5 than in the ssp2 4 5 scenario compared to the observed and historical data precipitation increased by 5 6 11 9 and 16 3 for nf mf and ff under ssp2 4 5 respectively under the worse scenario of ssp5 8 5 precipitation increased by 7 0 14 4 and 24 8 for nf mf and ff respectively table 4 the coefficient of variations cvs in table 4 shows that the uncertainties in these gcm s weather variables increased in all future periods in both ssp scenarios according to ssp2 4 5 the cv values of minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation for hist increased from 0 04 0 09 and 0 23 0 06 0 12 and 0 27 for ff respectively according to ssp5 8 5 the cv values of minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation increased to 0 08 0 16 and 0 28 for ff respectively in general the ssp5 8 5 scenario had higher uncertainties than the ssp2 4 5 scenario since the ssp5 8 5 is based on more extreme scenarios table 4 and fig 3 3 3 the length of the growing season the results indicate that the impact of climate change on actual gsl is significant according to the outputs of apex paddy the predicted temperature increase figs 3 and 4 causes a faster accumulation of heat units in future periods and therefore a more rapid growth and biomass accumulation of paddy rice as the potential heat units phu will be met earlier during the growing season the biomass accumulation would cease earlier fig 6 leading to a shorter actual gsl according to ssp5 8 5 scenarios the biomass reached its highest value earlier than hist by 17 30 and 38 days in nf mf and ff respectively the earlier biomass accumulation and shorter actual gsl were also observed in the ssp2 4 5 scenarios table 4 with less severe impacts induced by climate change fig 7 shows the variation of lai the sharper bell shape of the lai curve for mme of future data compared to the broader bell shape curve of the historical period shows a shorter actual gsl in the future fig 7 although the simulated results of lai and biomass indicated that the actual gsl would be shortened in the future gsl based on temperature would be extended fig 4 this contradiction highlights the importance of using lai and biomass rather than temperature variations to estimate the actual gsl in addition to gsl is also influenced by climate change particularly by an increase in temperature and timing fig 4 shows that the temperature in the future periods starts to increase earlier a backward shift in the mme of future data compared to the historical period for lai and biomass in figs 6 and 7 indicates an earlier growing season in the future according to ssp5 8 5 scenarios biomass curve slope and lai became zero earlier than hist by 17 30 and 38 days in nf mf and ff respectively the impact of climate change on gsl was also significant based on ssp2 4 5 scenarios the time that biomass curve slope and lai became above zero was earlier than hist by 13 22 and 31 days in nf mf and ff respectively table 4 the maximum value of lai the number of days with the maximum lai and the maximum value of biomass are other critical indicators of growing seasons that affect crop growth and crop yields the maximum value of lai was increased by 0 08 0 16 and 0 22 in nf mf and ff for ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively table 5 however the maximum value of biomass was decreased by 1 2 1 7 and 3 4 t ha in nf mf and ff respectively table 4 the number of days with the maximum lai also shrank by 5 8 and 12 days in nf mf and ff for ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively and 4 6 and 8 days in nf mf and ff for ssp2 4 5 scenarios respectively table 4 thus it is expected to observe a shorter period to reach the maximum lai higher lai and lower biomass in the future 3 4 future runoff and nitrogen discharge from paddy field runoff and n discharge increased in the future periods for both ssps scenarios compared with the historical period a significant increase in precipitation led to a substantial increase in runoff and n discharge in both scenarios with higher runoff and n discharge in ssp5 8 5 table 6 the cv values in table 6 show that the uncertainties in the projected runoff increased in the nf and ff periods for both scenarios the cv values of runoff for hist increased from 0 31 to 0 35 and 0 36 for ff in ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively in contrast the cv values of the projected n discharge in table 6 show that the uncertainties decreased in all the future periods in both ssp scenarios the decreases in the projected runoff in the mf period and the projected n discharge for all the future periods can be related to the model uncertainty runoff increased by 7 0 14 6 and 20 3 for nf mf and ff under the ssp2 4 5 scenario respectively under the ssp5 8 5 scenario runoff for nf mf and ff further increased to 8 4 17 4 and 31 5 respectively table 6 nitrogen discharge followed a similar trend as runoff n discharge increased by 7 2 13 2 and 19 8 for nf mf and ff under the ssp2 4 5 scenario respectively n discharge increased to 12 0 18 6 and 35 3 for nf mf and ff under ssp5 8 5 respectively table 6 the earlier and faster accumulation of biomass and the projected shorter actual gsl cause less nitrogen uptake by the rice thus more nitrogen loads discharge from paddy fields into the water bodies 3 5 future paddy rice yield variability in climate variables especially in temperature and precipitation due to climate change affects evapotranspiration and thus the growth and yield of rice results show that evaporation of ponding water in paddy fields and evapotranspiration will significantly increase in the future periods with a higher percentage increase for ssp5 8 5 thus more water is required for irrigation as a result of the increase in evaporation of ponding water in paddy fields less ponded water will remain and hence less water will be available for paddy rice in the future on the other hand transpiration volumes are expected to decrease significantly in all future periods table 7 due to shortened actual gsl and elevated co2 concentration future rice yields will substantially reduce under both ssp scenarios the uncertainty of projected grain yield will be higher under ssp5 8 5 than ssp2 4 5 table 7 and fig 8 in this scenario the uncertainty for hist is increased from 0 12 to 0 14 in the ff period however the cv values in table 7 show that the uncertainty of projected yield based on the ssp2 4 5 scenario has decreased from hist to the future periods 0 11 rice yield is estimated to reduce by 9 7 11 3 and 12 9 in the nf mf and ff periods under ssp2 4 5 respectively under the ssp5 8 5 scenario rice yield is more susceptible to the changing climate with yield reductions of 9 7 14 5 and 27 4 during the nf mf and ff periods respectively the acceleration of ghgs emissions in the ff period is expected to worsen the growing environment with more than a 20 additional reduction in yield under ssp5 8 5 than the ssp2 4 5 scenario table 7 4 discussion 4 1 climate change gsl runoff and n discharge into the environment the results exhibited unfavorable effects of climate change on actual gsl crop yields runoff volume and n discharge from paddy fields the apex paddy simulation results indicate that the increased variability and magnitude of precipitation intensities will cause a higher quantity of runoff and n discharge in rice paddies under the ssp2 4 5 scenario which emulates moderate emissions the average 13 2 increase in n discharge in the future is primarily attributable to an 11 9 increase in precipitation and a 14 6 increase in runoff tables 4 and 6 in comparison the estimated increase of 35 3 in n discharge in the ssp5 8 5 scenario exhibits compounding effects of uncontrolled ghgs emissions and its environmental stress in rice cultivation the significant correlations among precipitation runoff and nitrogen discharge in rice paddies are well supported by other studies in south korea e g kamruzzaman et al 2020a kim et al 2020 according to the results a shorter period to reach the maximum lai higher lai and lower biomass is expected in the future this can be a reason for lower crop yields the projected increase in temperature and consequently the transpiration rate causes a reduction of vegetative tissue s water content thus depression in the rate of growth and biomass production the projected higher temperature that affects evapotranspiration would lead to less transpiration volumes in all future periods table 7 shortened actual gsl and elevated co2 concentration in that case the photosynthesis period is shortened reducing total biomass crop yield and transpiration weraduwage et al 2015 suggested a non linear relationship between leaf area and plant biomass that is variable depending on carbon partitioning the study revealed that while photosynthesis may drive plant growth significant changes in growth can occur as a result of small changes in the partitioning of assimilated carbon to growth especially to leaf area growth and thickening a linear relationship between leaf mass and plant mass could be seen during the vegetative phase of plant growth when up to 88 of plant mass was composed of leaf mass at this stage leaf mass could provide a reasonably accurate estimation of plant mass however as the plants attained reproductive maturity more carbon was allocated to inflorescence growth disrupting this linear relationship such that leaf mass tended to vastly underestimate plant mass weraduwage et al 2015 the apex paddy model uses an exponential equation for the calculation of biomass based on lai and solar radiation choi 2019 the projected increase in lai maximum and decrease in biomass maximum tables 4 and 5 can be related to the non linear relationship between lai and biomass after vegetative growth and other factors like water stress in other words lower crop yields can be reflected in lower biomass while lai is projected to increase in the future under moderate effort to deal with climate change under ssp2 4 5 an average daily temperature increases of about 3 is expected for all future periods in the 21st century table 4 this is in line with the study by li et al 2011 in china a region with the same monsoon climate as the study area in this study the same 3 increase in average daily temperature was projected as a result a significant increase in inorganic n phosphorus and sediment discharge into water bodies estuary was observed a substantial fraction of fertilizers applied to the paddy was susceptible to discharge into the environment rather than being used for rice growth chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 due to earlier and shorter growing seasons with the projected increase in temperature rice maturation in the paddy will hasten resulting in less nutrient use for biomass accumulation thus causing poor nutrient use efficiency dong et al 2011 yang et al 2019 and higher amounts of residual n in the paddy field at the end of the season choi et al 2020 these residual nutrients move along with runoff into the environment since most soil nutrients especially inorganic nitrogen nitrate are highly soluble in water and have weak adsorption to the soil wu et al 2018 thus reducing n discharge from the paddy rice field into the environment can be reduced by more efficiently applying nitrogen fertilizers under the best management practices about 58 of agricultural land in south korea is under paddy rice production kosis 2020 therefore it is necessary to plan strategies to manage runoff and more efficient application of nitrogen fertilizers for sustainable and environmental friendly rice production with the predicted increase in runoff and nitrogen discharge under a changing climate the results on climate change impacts are well aligned with other studies that used the cmip5 gcms of rcps indicating similar increasing trends in precipitation and average daily minimum and maximum temperatures in the future and by the end of the 21st century kamruzzaman et al 2020b evaluated water balance in paddy rice production in south korea using rcp gcms in cmip5 and the apex paddy model across all future periods under rcp4 5 a projection of 8 5 14 5 7 1 17 0 and 11 2 15 3 increase in precipitation average daily minimum and maximum temperatures were observed respectively under rcp8 5 a further increase of 6 4 23 0 10 1 44 7 and 12 0 26 7 was observed for precipitation and average daily minimum and maximum temperatures respectively in this study across all the future periods a projected increase of 5 6 16 3 17 2 43 7 and 7 9 20 1 in precipitation average daily minimum and maximum temperatures under ssp2 4 5 were observed respectively under ssp5 8 5 an increase of 7 0 24 8 18 4 73 6 and 8 5 32 3 were observed for precipitation and average daily minimum and maximum temperatures respectively thus the ssp gcms in cmip6 used in this study presented a worse climate change projection than rcp gcms in cmip5 for climate prediction in the same location this agrees with the observation by song et al 2021 who observed that cmip6 ssp gcms improved reproducibility of historical periods and did better future climate forecasting than the rcp gcms in cmip5 thus it is suggested that climate forecast with cmip6 increases the confidence of prediction than using gcms of cmip5 the ssp scenario projection uses both radiation enforcement and socio economic activities which either reduce or increase ghgs emissions into the atmosphere over time on the other hand the rcp projections are only based on radiative enforcement and co2 concentration in the atmosphere over time van vuuren et al 2014 4 2 rice productivity and implications on food security the inverse relationship between rice transpiration and co2 concentration in the future table 7 indicates that as the co2 in the atmosphere increases due to human activities crops keep stomatal openings narrower and lose less moisture to the atmosphere however the high temperature results in shortened growth and development period at the expense of rice grain filling and yield kumar et al 2019 chaturvedi et al 2017 the projected sharper increase in minimum night temperatures than maximum day temperature table 4 and the predicted reduction in rice yields demonstrated potential threats to food security due to the high sensitivity of rice to the increased night temperature lyman et al 2013 rice requires daily minimum and maximum temperatures of 22 and 28 for optimum growth and development an increase of 1 in average temperature corresponds to a 10 15 loss in rice yield zhao et al 2017 fahad et al 2019 respectively increasing night temperatures results in increased night respiration and high loss in carbon especially during the post flowing stage causing faster growth with less time for biomass accumulation and thus a reduction in rice yield bahuguna et al 2017 under moderate human activities and emissions ssp2 4 5 it is expected to observe an increase in night temperature by 17 2 32 2 and 43 7 corresponding to 9 7 11 3 and 12 9 grain yield loss for nf mf and ff respectively under worse socio economic activities with no concern for the environment ssp5 8 5 night temperatures will increase by 18 4 43 7 and 73 6 with a correspondent grain loss of 9 7 14 5 and 27 4 for nf mf and ff respectively tables 4 and 6 thus this decline in rice production is a significant threat to global food security and it is critical to mitigate and adapt to climate change and its consequences 5 conclusions the ecohydroclimatological assessment of climate change impacts on the length of growing seasons of paddy rice in south korea projected shortened actual growing seasons due to an increase in the prospective average daily temperature although an extended gsl was predicted based on the traditional gsl definition which is based on temperature the simulated lai and biomass by the apex paddy model predicted shortened growing seasons in the future since the results of this study projected an earlier increase in temperature an unseasonable or earlier growing season is expected in the future the findings also demonstrated an increase in runoff due to predicted increased precipitation in the study area an increase in n discharge into the environment from paddy fields was also projected since the change in the phenology of paddy rice affected the length of the growing season and rice yields the rapid accumulation of potential heat units causes biomass accumulation to cease earlier thus the accumulated nitrogen outflow increased due to less absorption of nitrogen although the biomass accumulation rate is increased the final biomass and thus rice yields are reduced hence this significant reduction in rice grain yields is expected in the future due to the projected increase in average daily temperature in the 21st century to secure food production a series of strategies can be taken for example a reduction in ghgs emissions can alleviate the negative impacts of climate change and lead to more sustainable rice production improved best management practices bmps in agriculture such as shifting cropping period and more efficient application of nitrogen fertilizers in paddy fields through right timing and quantity application will reduce the n loads in water bodies adjusting the height of the rice paddy field weir can also lead to less runoff discharge from the rice paddy fields into the environment and more efficient rainwater use moreover timing and amount of water for irrigation in addition to an alternative wetting and drying lead to more efficient water use in the paddy fields breeding for rice varieties tolerant to high temperatures and water stress can enable sustainable rice production under elevated temperatures and limited water conditions this study has given foresight into the future of rice production and environmental implications in gimje plain in south korea since this study is limited to only one crop rice in one specific region under specific conditions timing of planting and amounts of fertilizers future studies are suggested this study can be extrapolated to other regions with similar agroecological characteristics or on a bigger scale particularly at different altitudes potential future research can be focused on adjustments in the current timing of planting and the amount of nitrogen fertilizers to adapt to the changing climate future studies can also assess the impacts of climate change on other crops and water quality parameters the findings of this study including increasing temperature unseasonable and shortened actual growing seasons and more nitrogen discharge in water bodies call for strategies and adjustments in human activities toward reducing ghgs emissions to maintain food security for an increasing global population in the future declaration of competing
