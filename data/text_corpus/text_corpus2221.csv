11105,the brazilian savanna biome is the main agricultural region of brazil and is facing a growing water shortage and conflicts that tend to expand to new areas and intensify in those already stressed which is hindering the economic development of the region small reservoirs play an important role in supporting the local economy in the savanna areas of brazil hundreds of small reservoirs have been built in the last twenty years in the region they were constructed by individual farmers or projects funded by different agencies without any coordination and knowledge that the reservoirs are part of a complex hydrologic system the lack of reservoir basic information and appropriate methods to quantify water supply demand and losses are hindering efficient water management in this context evaporation is a non beneficial loss to the water system and should be better quantified the present study aimed to improve methods for estimating small reservoir evaporation in the brazilian savanna region the study area was the buriti vermelho watershed where the evaporation were measured in class a pans installed inside and outside of a small reservoir pan coefficients were calculated on a monthly seasonal and annual basis in addition equations for estimating evaporation based on climatic variables were developed the pan coefficients values varied throughout the year from 0 72 to 0

performed for large reservoirs coelho et al 2017 vieira et al 2016 however the evaporation of small reservoirs in the region has to our knowledge never been quantified many methods have been proposed

the operationalization process could be simplified if evaporation data collected in pans existing in the national standard climate stations were used or by installing an evaporation pan outside the reservoir however the evaporation measured in this situation is higher than the evaporation observed in a pan buried or immersed in water fu et al 2004 thus a pan coefficient should be used to adjust

and stewart 1963 thornthwaite 1948 despite the lack of consensus of which method presents the best performance a significant limitation for application of most of these methods is that they require several meteorological variables to be measured or estimated at the reservoir information rarely available for small reservoirs in the region thus it is important to develop equations for estimating reservoir evaporation that take into account the region specificities and data availability the present work was developed with the objective to improve methods for estimating evaporation in small reservoirs in the brazilian cerrado region considering that accurate quantification of evaporation is essential for improvement in the planning operation and maintenance of small reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the 10 km2 buriti vermelho basin drainage area is located in the central portion of brazil its main stream is affluent of the estreito river which is a tributary of the preto river about 80 of the agricultural production from the federal district comes from the preto river basin the small reservoir evaluated in this study fig 1 had 0 25 ha of surface area and storage capacity of 3178 7 m3 2 2 data the daily data of average maximum and minimum temperature average relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were obtained from a meteorological station installed near to the studied reservoir for the period of two years 2010 to 2011 the evaporation data for the same period were obtained from two class a pans installed inside pan inside and outside pan outside the reservoir and measured synchronously the main criterion for the pan installations was to choose a location representative of the reservoir conditions the pan placed inside was installed near the center of the reservoir surface area it was held by a structure fixed in the bottom of the dam after installation the pan was about 5 cm above the reservoir surface water it is worth noting that the waves in the reservoir were very small with no risk of entering the pan the outside pan was installed in a place close to the shore of the reservoir free of obstacles the water level measurements in the class a pans were carried out by a water level sensor coupled to a datalogger whenever the accumulated evaporation surpassed 25 mm the pan was manually refilled with the reservoir water same temperature and albedo up to the reference level which was 5 cm below the maximum height of the pan wall problematic data due to rain or datalogger reading errors were eliminated from the series 2 3 pan coefficients masoner and stannard 2010 have shown that floating pans adequately represent reservoir evaporation partially submerged pans have already been used in the design of many studies to represent the evaporation of small lakes reservoirs and wetlands masoner et al 2008 mendoza sanchez et al 2013 watras et al 2016 one of the main advantages of this technique is that evaporation measures are independent to reservoirs inflow or outflow gallego elvira et al 2012 to estimate reservoir evaporation based on pan outside measurements pan coefficients were developed assuming that pan inside satisfactorily represented the average of the reservoir evaporation eq 1 1 e l e i n k p e e x where el average reservoir evaporation mm d 1 ein pan inside evaporation mm d 1 eex pan outside evaporation mm d 1 and kp pan coefficient dimensionless the pan coefficients for the desired periods were obtained using linear regression with intercept at the origin where the dependent variable is the reservoir evaporation and the independent variable is external pan evaporation 2 4 equations for evaporation estimation based on climatic variables equations correlating the pan inside evaporation with climatic variables were developed using multiple linear regressions eq 2 2 e l Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 Œ≤ n x n where Œ≤0 linear regression intercept Œ≤1 Œ≤n angular coefficients linked to climatic variables and x1 xn predictors daily climatic variables average ta maximum tx and minimum tn temperature relative humidity rh wind speed ws and solar radiation sr were tested as reservoir evaporation predicators in the case of temperature only the one variable with the highest correlation to evaporation was kept for final simulations a total number of 15 equations to estimate evaporation based on the climatic variables were developed 2 5 performance analysis of pan coefficients and climatic equations in order to evaluate the performance of the pan coefficients and the climatic equations coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse richter et al 2011 willmott and matsuura 2005 were used the mean error indicates when a model is under or overestimating the observations while the mean absolute error indicates the magnitude of the error the root of the mean square error unlike the absolute mean error adds a larger weight to the errors of greater magnitude the nash sutcliffe index ranges between and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect model and values equal to or less than 0 indicate that the model is as good as the mean of the predictions schaefli and gupta 2007 according to richter et al 2011 an nse index above 0 50 indicates good performance of the model while nse values above 0 are still considered acceptable 2 6 validations of pan coefficients and climatic equations for the validation of the equations the bootstrap method was used to obtain new groups of data by resampling with replacement of the initial dataset this method assumes that the training data are representative of the population and through several resamples multiple samplings of the population are simulated kim et al 2015 from the new datasets resampled new equations were developed and the respective coefficients and indexes of performance were obtained the determination of the coefficients and final performance indexes is based on the stabilization of their mean values that is when the number of resamplings reaches a sufficiently large number that the standard deviation of the observed estimator approaches the standard deviation of the population estimator deng et al 2013 parke et al 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 data fig 2 shows the monthly average climatic variables observed in a meteorological station installed close to the reservoir studied for the period from 2010 to 2011 with an annual average of 21 6 c mean temperature was quite stable monthly averages range from 19 1 c in june to a maximum of 22 9 c in october average minimum and maximum temperatures varied from 12 4 to 31 2 c respectively relative humidity with higher variation throughout the year ranges from up to 85 in the rainy season to a minimum of 40 in the dry season solar radiation recorded the highest values in the months of february august and september however the average values of both seasons were close to the annual average of 219 w m 2 d 1 with an annual average of 1 8 m s 1 and increasing continuously throughout the dry season the monthly average wind speed presented its lowest values in the month of february 1 3 m s 1 and the highest in september 2 3 m s 1 the initial database consisted of 357 pairs of values of inside pan and outside pan evaporation after data cleaning and quality control 313 evaporation data 220 for the dry season and 93 for the rainy season were used in the simulation the difference between evaporation of pan inside and pan outside varies from 0 36 mm 9 in june dry season to 1 61 mm 37 in february rainy season fig 3 a the highest evaporation value occurred in september when rh was low and ta ws and sr were high fig 2 the evaporation of pan outside was an average 0 77 mm higher than the evaporation measured in the pan inside with kp equal to 0 85 fig 3b 3 2 pan coefficients the monthly seasonal dry and wet season and annual pan coefficients and the statistical indices are presented in table 1 monthly pan coefficients varied from 0 72 to 0 92 table 1 lower values of kp were observed from october to march mcjannet et al 2017 in an arid region of australia evaluated the evaporation of ponds using an evaporation pan installed inside and outside the pond and observed monthly coefficients ranging from 0 62 to 0 80 lapworth 1965 evaluated the evaporation of a reservoir in england and observed a high monthly variation of the pan coefficient between 0 47 and 1 18 oliveira 2009 evaluated in a region of tropical climate the evaporation of a small artificial lake presenting dimensions similar to the one used in this study and found monthly coefficients ranging from 0 77 to 0 87 oliveira et al 2005 found coefficients ranging from 0 76 to 0 93 for the brazilian semiarid yu et al 2017 obtained monthly pan coefficients ranging from 0 73 to 0 94 for lakes in arid climate the variations observed in the value of the monthly kp highlight the importance to consider its temporal variation in the calculation of the reservoir evaporation looking at the seasonal scale the highest value of kp 0 88 was obtained in the dry season when average temperature and relative humidity were low fig 2 in the rainy season temperature and relative humidity recorded high values while either solar radiation or wind speed were high fig 2 which resulted in a low kp 0 78 the annual kp obtained in this study was equal to 0 85 pereira et al 2009 found annual coefficient of 0 57 for large lakes in the cerrado region while using kohler et al 1955 methodology as reference evaporation it can be seen from table 1 that although some months like june and august showed nse values close to zero the maximum mae was equal to 0 53 mm d 1 not much higher than the lowest mae which occurred in february 0 32 mm d 1 and november 0 35 mm d 1 high nse values above 0 80 were also observed in february and november r2 from monthly kp varied from 0 25 to 0 94 oliveira 2009 found in his work rmse varying from 0 29 to 0 49 mm d 1 however in his work a 20 m¬≤ pan was assumed as the lake evaporation which has more stable and controlled conditions than a real lake yu et al 2017 studied the monthly lake evaporation and found rmse equal to 9 43 mm month 1 which when calculated in the daily scale is somewhat lower than the values presented in this study a thousand resamples of pan inside and pan outside evaporation obtained by the bootstrap method were used to validate the pan coefficients fig 4 presents a boxplot of the monthly evaporation calculated using the pan coefficients obtained for each resampling it can be observed that the average monthly evaporation calculated based on the resamples pan coefficient values are very close to the average measured evaporation with maximum mean error of 0 07 mm d 1 for may and june and of 0 08 mm d 1 for december it is common for water resource managers as they usually do not have information of the pan coefficient variation over time to use a seasonal or annual pan coefficient to estimate evaporation throughout the year concei√ß√£o 2002 kiziloglu et al 2009 mcjannet et al 2017 oliveira et al 2005 oliveira 2009 pereira et al 2009 sabziparvar et al 2010 this practice can lead to errors in the evaporation quantification and as so it is of interest to evaluate the magnitude of these errors fig 5 when using the monthly kp the average monthly evaporation is very close to the measured evaporation fig 5 with the mean error varying from 0 07 to 0 02 mm d 1 table 1 on the other hand when seasonal and annual kp is used the error increases the use of seasonal kp implies an overestimation of evaporation ranging from 0 14 to 0 31 mm d 1 in the months of january february may november and december whilst for the months of march april june july and october occurred an underestimation varying from 0 11 to 0 40 mm d 1 when using the annual pan coefficient the magnitude of the mean error increases for all months with the exception of april and may when annual kp was closer to the monthly kp than the seasonal kp the overestimation of water evaporation from the reservoir indicates that there is lower water availability in the basin leading managers to reduce the amount of water allocated among users resulting in reduction of income and welfare for rural communities on the other hand the underestimation of evaporation indicates that there is higher water availability and consequently a greater amount of water available to be allocated which can create or increase the water conflicts in the basin the average mae observed in the months increased from 0 45 to 0 47 mm d 1 when the seasonal kp was used instead of monthly kp the error increased however when the annual kp is used presenting an average mae of 0 58 mm d 1 the use of the annual pan coefficient has made some models in some months unacceptable nse 0 as was the case of january nse 1 46 june nse 0 09 august 0 02 and december nse 0 40 this indicates the importance of obtaining and using pan coefficients that adequately represent the temporal variability of evaporation 3 3 equations for estimating reservoir evaporation base on climatic variables in order to determine which predictors would be used to develop the equations the dispersions and correlations among climatic variables were analyzed due to low correlation r 0 01 with the evaporation measured in the pan inside daily minimum temperature was not used in the multiple linear regression models the variables ta and tx showed high collinearity r 0 90 tx presented the highest correlation r 0 46 with pan inside evaporation and as so was used to build the models the mean nse and multiple linear regressions coefficients were obtained from 1000 bootstrap resamplings table 2 the climatic equations ce are presented in the table according to their performance from the best to the worst the climatic equations numbers 1 and 2 table 2 presented the best performance and had the same nse 0 69 and mae 0 44 mm d 1 and rmse of 0 58 and 0 59 mm d 1 respectively fig 6 shows the correlation between evaporation estimated using ce1 fig 6a and ce2 fig 6b and measured evaporation pan inside ce1 and ce2 fitted the observed data quite well with r2 0 70 and 0 69 respectively which give great confidence in their application the observed dispersion of the points in relation to the adjusted line is mainly due to advection effects since the reservoir is not large enough to eliminate the oasis effect another factor that may have influenced this dispersion is the sensitivity of the water level sensor used which limited the accuracy of the readings to 0 32 mm or 1 80th of an inch besides ce1 and ce2 the equations that use rh and sr tx rh and sr tx ws and sr and tx rh and ws as predictors variables also showed good fit these equations presented nse of 0 58 0 58 0 56 and 0 56 rmse values equal to 0 68 0 68 0 70 and 0 70 mm d 1 and mae values of 0 53 0 53 0 55 and 0 55 mm d 1 respectively the mean bias error for all equations was very close to zero in the cerrado region it is difficult to find meteorological stations measuring all those variables and as so it is convenient to evaluate simpler equations amongst the equations that uses less predictors those based only on mean relative humidity or total daily solar radiation were the ones that presented better fittings to the evaporation which justifies the good results obtained by the equations that uses these two variables as input however the use of equations based on only in one input variable indicates an mae ranging from 0 64 to 0 81 mm d 1 vining 2003 estimated average monthly evaporation using only temperature for two reservoirs in north dakota obtaining rmse of 10 and 20 mm month 1 and coefficients of determination of 0 64 and 0 77 these results are more accurate than those found by the ce14 rmse 0 94 mm d 1 which could be explained by the fact that vining s study was carried out on monthly basis and the error and uncertainty have the tendency to be lower for larger period of time kisi et al 2016 estimated for mediterranean regions in turkey the daily evaporation from climatic variables using more sophisticated methods such as artificial neural networks and found mae ranging from 1 28 to 1 30 mm d 1 and rmse between 2 00 and 2 03 mm d 1 anda et al 2018 using several climatic variables and methods such as elasticnet boosting and randomforest to estimate evaporation of shallow lakes in hungary obtained mae ranging from 0 42 to 0 49 mm d 1 and rmse ranging from 0 57 to 0 65 mm d 1 dogan et al 2010 also using artificial intelligence algorithms estimated lake evaporation from climatic variables and obtained a rmse of 0 43 mm d 1 the use of simple methodologies such as the multiple linear regressions presented in this study had similar statistical indices to those obtained by the application of more elaborated methods which gives confidence in the application of such equations 3 4 comparison of evaporation estimated by pan coefficient and climatic methods given the fact that water managers usually make decisions on a monthly base it is of interest to evaluate the models based on this time scale such a comparison is shown in fig 7 where the monthly evaporation calculated by both pan and the two best climatic methods ce1 and ce2 were compared with the evaporation observed in the pan inside the pan method was more accurate monthly wise though it presented higher dispersion in the months of march to june and august to october the climate based equations underestimated evaporation in the months of february march and april and overestimated it in the months of may june november and december fig 7 the under or overestimation of the values in some months is due to the fact that the relationship between the climatic variables and the evaporation phenomenon are nonlinear the pan method presented mae rmse and nse of 0 45 mm d 1 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 69 respectively these results are similar to those obtained for ce1 and ce2 since the accuracy of the monthly mean estimate was better for the pan method the similarity of the performance indicates that the climatic method had a greater dispersion in the daily values 4 conclusion in regions like the brazilian savanna where small reservoirs area crucial for the economic and social development it is essential for water management to be able to better quantify the reservoir evaporation which represents a non beneficial water loss from the basin it is common practice in small reservoirs water resource management to estimate evaporation using nearby measurements of pan evaporation however there is no information regarding pan coefficients for the majority of the small reservoirs in the region monthly seasonal and annual pan coefficients were developed with r2 varying from 0 25 to 0 94 respectively monthly coefficients ranged from 0 72 during the rainy season to 0 92 for the dry season the most common source of data for evaporation estimates is land based meteorological data however not all station measures the same group of climatic variables which justifies the development of different equations fifteen new equations based on climatic data were developed with r2 varying from 0 11 to 0 70 the equations that used relative humidity and solar radiation as input variables performed better historically water management operational decisions are made on a monthly basis in this time scale the pan method was more accurate even though the use of climatic equation is growing the methods here presented can be easily applied to estimate evaporation in small reservoirs in the brazilian savanna combining them with hydrological models will contribute to improve the water resources management specifically in the small reservoirs where evaporation is

et al 2011 willmott and matsuura 2005 were used the mean error indicates when a model is under or overestimating the observations while the mean absolute error indicates the magnitude of the error the root of the mean square error unlike the absolute mean error adds a larger weight to the errors of greater magnitude the nash sutcliffe index ranges between and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect model and values equal to or less than 0 indicate that the model is as good as the mean of the predictions schaefli and gupta 2007 according to richter et al 2011 an nse index above 0 50 indicates good performance of the model while nse values above 0 are still considered acceptable 2 6 validations of pan coefficients and climatic equations for the validation of the equations the bootstrap method was used to obtain new groups of data by resampling with replacement of the initial dataset this method assumes that the training data are representative of the population and through several resamples multiple samplings of the population are simulated kim et al 2015 from the new datasets resampled new equations were developed and the respective coefficients and indexes of performance were obtained the determination of the coefficients and final performance indexes is based on the stabilization of their mean values that is when the number of resamplings reaches a sufficiently large number that the standard deviation of the observed estimator approaches the standard deviation of the population estimator deng et al 2013 parke et al 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 data fig 2 shows the monthly average climatic variables observed in a meteorological station installed close to the reservoir studied for the period from 2010 to 2011 with an annual average of 21 6 c mean temperature was quite stable monthly averages range from 19 1 c in june to a maximum of 22 9 c in october average minimum and maximum temperatures varied from 12 4 to 31 2 c respectively relative humidity with higher variation throughout the year ranges from up to 85 in the rainy season to a minimum of 40 in the dry season solar radiation recorded the highest values in the months of february august and september however the average values of both seasons were close to the annual average of 219 w m 2 d 1 with an annual average of 1 8 m s 1 and increasing continuously throughout the dry season the monthly average wind speed presented its lowest values in the month of february 1 3 m s 1 and the highest in september 2 3 m s 1 the initial database consisted of 357 pairs of values of inside pan and outside pan evaporation after data cleaning and quality control 313 evaporation data 220 for the dry season and 93 for the rainy season were used in the simulation the difference between evaporation of pan inside and pan outside varies from 0 36 mm 9 in june dry season to 1 61 mm 37 in february rainy season fig 3 a the highest evaporation value occurred in september when rh was low and ta ws and sr were high fig 2 the evaporation of pan outside was an average 0 77 mm higher than the evaporation measured in the pan inside with kp equal to 0 85 fig 3b 3 2 pan coefficients the monthly seasonal dry and wet season and annual pan coefficients and the statistical indices are presented in table 1 monthly pan coefficients varied from 0 72 to 0 92 table 1 lower values of kp were observed from october to march mcjannet et al 2017 in an arid region of australia evaluated the evaporation of ponds using an evaporation pan installed inside and outside the pond and observed monthly coefficients ranging from 0 62 to 0 80 lapworth 1965 evaluated the evaporation of a reservoir in england and observed a high monthly variation of the pan coefficient between 0 47 and 1 18 oliveira 2009 evaluated in a region of tropical climate the evaporation of a small artificial lake presenting dimensions similar to the one used in this study and found monthly coefficients ranging from 0 77 to 0 87 oliveira et al 2005 found coefficients ranging from 0 76 to 0 93 for the brazilian semiarid yu et al 2017 obtained monthly pan coefficients ranging from 0 73 to 0 94 for lakes in arid climate the variations observed in the value of the monthly kp highlight the importance to consider its temporal variation in the calculation of the reservoir evaporation looking at the seasonal scale the highest value of kp 0 88 was obtained in the dry season when average temperature and relative humidity were low fig 2 in the rainy season temperature and relative humidity recorded high values while either solar radiation or wind speed were high fig 2 which resulted in a low kp 0 78 the annual kp obtained in this study was equal to 0 85 pereira et al 2009 found annual coefficient of 0 57 for large lakes in the cerrado region while using kohler et al 1955 methodology as reference evaporation it can be seen from table 1 that although some months like june and august showed nse values close to zero the maximum mae was equal to 0 53 mm d 1 not much higher than the lowest mae which occurred in february 0 32 mm d 1 and november 0 35 mm d 1 high nse values above 0 80 were also observed in february and november r2 from monthly kp varied from 0 25 to 0 94 oliveira 2009 found in his work rmse varying from 0 29 to 0 49 mm d 1 however in his work a 20 m¬≤ pan was assumed as the lake evaporation which has more stable and controlled conditions than a real lake yu et al 2017 studied the monthly lake evaporation and found rmse equal to 9 43 mm month 1 which when calculated in the daily scale is somewhat lower than the values presented in this study a thousand resamples of pan inside and pan outside evaporation obtained by the bootstrap method were used to validate the pan coefficients fig 4 presents a boxplot of the monthly evaporation calculated using the pan coefficients obtained for each resampling it can be observed that the average monthly evaporation calculated based on the resamples pan coefficient values are very close to the average measured evaporation with maximum mean error of 0 07 mm d 1 for may and june and of 0 08 mm d 1 for december it is common for water resource managers as they usually do not have information of the pan coefficient variation over time to use a seasonal or annual pan coefficient to estimate evaporation throughout the year concei√ß√£o 2002 kiziloglu et al 2009 mcjannet et al 2017 oliveira et al 2005 oliveira 2009 pereira et al 2009 sabziparvar et al 2010 this practice can lead to errors in the evaporation quantification and as so it is of interest to evaluate the magnitude of these errors fig 5 when using the monthly kp the average monthly evaporation is very close to the measured evaporation fig 5 with the mean error varying from 0 07 to 0 02 mm d 1 table 1 on the other hand when seasonal and annual kp is used the error increases the use of seasonal kp implies an overestimation of evaporation ranging from 0 14 to 0 31 mm d 1 in the months of january february may november and december whilst for the months of march april june july and october occurred an underestimation varying from 0 11 to 0 40 mm d 1 when using the annual pan coefficient the magnitude of the mean error increases for all months with the exception of april and may when annual kp was closer to the monthly kp than the seasonal kp the overestimation of water evaporation from the reservoir indicates that there is lower water availability in the basin leading managers to reduce the amount of water allocated among users resulting in reduction of income and welfare for rural communities on the other hand the underestimation of evaporation indicates that there is higher water availability and consequently a greater amount of water available to be allocated which can create or increase the water conflicts in the basin the average mae observed in the months increased from 0 45 to 0 47 mm d 1 when the seasonal kp was used instead of monthly kp the error increased however when the annual kp is used presenting an average mae of 0 58 mm d 1 the use of the annual pan coefficient has made some models in some months unacceptable nse 0 as was the case of january nse 1 46 june nse 0 09 august 0 02 and december nse 0 40 this indicates the importance of obtaining and using pan coefficients that adequately represent the temporal variability of evaporation 3 3 equations for estimating reservoir evaporation base on climatic variables in order to determine which predictors would be used to develop the equations the dispersions and correlations among climatic variables were analyzed due to low correlation r 0 01 with the evaporation measured in the pan inside daily minimum temperature was not used in the multiple linear regression models the variables ta and tx showed high collinearity r 0 90 tx presented the highest correlation r 0 46 with pan inside evaporation and as so was used to build the models the mean nse and multiple linear regressions coefficients were obtained from 1000 bootstrap resamplings table 2 the climatic equations ce are presented in the table according to their performance from the best to the worst the climatic equations numbers 1 and 2 table 2 presented the best performance and had the same nse 0 69 and mae 0 44 mm d 1 and rmse of 0 58 and 0 59 mm d 1 respectively fig 6 shows the correlation between evaporation estimated using ce1 fig 6a and ce2 fig 6b and measured evaporation pan inside ce1 and ce2 fitted the observed data quite well with r2 0 70 and 0 69 respectively which give great confidence in their application the observed dispersion of the points in relation to the adjusted line is mainly due to advection effects since the reservoir is not large enough to eliminate the oasis effect another factor that may have influenced this dispersion is the sensitivity of the water level sensor used which limited the accuracy of the readings to 0 32 mm or 1 80th of an inch besides ce1 and ce2 the equations that use rh and sr tx rh and sr tx ws and sr and tx rh and ws as predictors variables also showed good fit these equations presented nse of 0 58 0 58 0 56 and 0 56 rmse values equal to 0 68 0 68 0 70 and 0 70 mm d 1 and mae values of 0 53 0 53 0 55 and 0 55 mm d 1 respectively the mean bias error for all equations was very close to zero in the cerrado region it is difficult to find meteorological stations measuring all those variables and as so it is convenient to evaluate simpler equations amongst the equations that uses less predictors those based only on mean relative humidity or total daily solar radiation were the ones that presented better fittings to the evaporation which justifies the good results obtained by the equations that uses these two variables as input however the use of equations based on only in one input variable indicates an mae ranging from 0 64 to 0 81 mm d 1 vining 2003 estimated average monthly evaporation using only temperature for two reservoirs in north dakota obtaining rmse of 10 and 20 mm month 1 and coefficients of determination of 0 64 and 0 77 these results are more accurate than those found by the ce14 rmse 0 94 mm d 1 which could be explained by the fact that vining s study was carried out on monthly basis and the error and uncertainty have the tendency to be lower for larger period of time kisi et al 2016 estimated for mediterranean regions in turkey the daily evaporation from climatic variables using more sophisticated methods such as artificial neural networks and found mae ranging from 1 28 to 1 30 mm d 1 and rmse between 2 00 and 2 03 mm d 1 anda et al 2018 using several climatic variables and methods such as elasticnet boosting and randomforest to estimate evaporation of shallow lakes in hungary obtained mae ranging from 0 42 to 0 49 mm d 1 and rmse ranging from 0 57 to 0 65 mm d 1 dogan et al 2010 also using artificial intelligence algorithms estimated lake evaporation from climatic variables and obtained a rmse of 0 43 mm d 1 the use of simple methodologies such as the multiple linear regressions presented in this study had similar statistical indices to those obtained by the application of more elaborated methods which gives confidence in the application of such equations 3 4 comparison of evaporation estimated by pan coefficient and climatic methods given the fact that water managers usually make decisions on a monthly base it is of interest to evaluate the models based on this time scale such a comparison is shown in fig 7 where the monthly evaporation calculated by both pan and the two best climatic methods ce1 and ce2 were compared with the evaporation observed in the pan inside the pan method was more accurate monthly wise though it presented higher dispersion in the months of march to june and august to october the climate based equations underestimated evaporation in the months of february march and april and overestimated it in the months of may june november and december fig 7 the under or overestimation of the values in some months is due to the fact that the relationship between the climatic variables and the evaporation phenomenon are nonlinear the pan method presented mae rmse and nse of 0 45 mm d 1 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 69 respectively these results are similar to those obtained for ce1 and ce2 since the accuracy of the monthly mean estimate was better for the pan method the similarity of the performance indicates that the climatic method had a greater dispersion in the daily values 4 conclusion in regions like the brazilian savanna where small reservoirs area crucial for the economic and social development it is essential for water management to be able to better quantify the reservoir evaporation which represents a non beneficial water loss from the basin it is common practice in small reservoirs water resource management to estimate evaporation using nearby measurements of pan evaporation however there is no information regarding pan coefficients for the majority of the small reservoirs in the region monthly seasonal and annual pan coefficients were developed with r2 varying from 0 25 to 0 94 respectively monthly coefficients ranged from 0 72 during the rainy season to 0 92 for the dry season the most common source of data for evaporation estimates is land based meteorological data however not all station measures the same group of climatic variables which justifies the development of different equations fifteen new equations based on climatic data were developed with r2 varying from 0 11 to 0 70 the equations that used relative humidity and solar radiation as input variables performed better historically water management operational decisions are made on a monthly basis in this time scale the pan method was more accurate even though the use of climatic equation is growing the methods here presented can be easily applied to estimate evaporation in small reservoirs in the brazilian savanna combining them with hydrological models will contribute to improve the water resources management specifically in the small reservoirs where evaporation is

systems colloquially tile drainage systems are essential for humid agricultural systems with poorly drained soils such as in the midwest united states in these areas precipitation often exceeds evapotranspiration king et al 2014 saturating the soil especially in areas with a slowly permeable fragipan and perched water tables mcdaniel et al 2008 without artificial drainage these fields would be too wet for farm machinery and excess soil moisture conditions could drastically reduce yields fausey et al 1987 smith et al 2015 it is not a coincidence that the most extensive tile drainage networks in the united states coincide with the most productive agricultural regions smith and pappas 2007 the leaching of n particularly as no3 n from agricultural systems is accelerated by subsurface drainage skaggs and van schilfgaarde 1999 while the primary transport mechanism for p is generally via surface runoff with p bound to eroding sediments eastman et al 2010 however soils with sandy subsoils high organic matter content and or preferential flow paths can lead to significant p leaching through subsurface drainage sims et al 1998 small p loads lost from fields are often deemed inconsequential agronomically but they can have drastic impacts on water quality since low levels of p are required to sustain fresh water ecosystems correll 1998 these small loads can push p concentrations to a level that accelerates eutrophication in water bodies in terms of n lowering water tables with subsurface drainage ultimately increases n mineralization rates and drainage volume resulting in elevated n loads skaggs et al 2005 therefore identifying management factors that minimize n and p concentrations in drain discharge is required to reduce water quality impacts the measured annual nutrient loads from agricultural environments manage database administered by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service is a compilation of field scale surface and subsurface n and p loads from agricultural landscapes across the united states and canada christianson and harmel 2015a harmel et al 2006 2008 2016 2017 previous studies using data compiled in manage explored relationships between agricultural management and subsurface drainage volume and n and p loads however high variability in these previous findings resulted in a need to better quantify the effect of controllable and uncontrollable factors on subsurface drainage n and p concentrations alone the objective of this study was to analyze the newly compiled agricultural drainage n and p concentrations in the manage database to better define the variability of n and p concentrations over time and space as well as identify the likelihood of water quality concerns 2 methods and materials between may and december 2016 a literature review was performed on more than 400 agricultural drainage publications of which 79 were deemed acceptable subsurface and surface drainage studies nutrient concentrations both annual flow weighted and annual arithmetic means cropping system crop yield nutrient application precipitation and drainage data were recorded although not all site years contained information for these data fields literature was sourced from online literature search engines web of science and google scholar in addition to revisiting studies previously reviewed during creation of the manage drain load database the studies were sorted to meet criteria developed for the previously described manage database harmel et al 2016 in short

new manage drain concentration database were international studies and lack of reported nutrient concentrations the manage drain concentration database was produced in the same format as the drain

subsurface drainage site years i e surface ditch drainage data were excluded with the exception of the soil textural triangle and site years analyses medians of reported mean annual nutrient concentrations were used for spatial analysis maps due to extreme outliers skewing the state means of annual mean concentrations probability of exceedance for the nutrient concentrations was calculated with the weibull formula which creates unbiased exceedance probabilities for all distributions maidment 1993 this was conducted by ranking concentrations in descending order with rank one as the highest concentration in the database for a given nutrient these rankings were divided by the total number of concentrations plus one this probability was then plotted against the corresponding

concentrations or all forms of each nutrient annual flow weighted mean concentrations made up 71 and annual arithmetic means totaled 27 of the database fig 2 twenty eight site years 2 did not fall into either category because only annual minimum and or maximum nutrient values were recorded a relatively greater percentage of the arithmetic mean site years were from canadian studies 57 of arithmetic site years vs 27 of overall database or reported drp concentrations 51 of arithmetic site years vs 27 of overall compared to the entire database the shift towards reporting flow weighted means rather than arithmetic means e g fig 2 seemed to reflect a change in water sampling technology over time potentially away from grab sampling and towards methods allowing for more accurate flow and nutrient measurements the mean field plot size across all site years was 2 86 0 41 ha median 0 17 ha range 0 17 113 4 ha n 1254 mean land slope was 2 2 0 1 median 2 range 0 13 n 777 mean annual

2 3 2 spatial analysis of nutrient concentrations medians of annual flow weighted mean no3 n concentrations in subsurface drainage by state province ranged from 6 70 to 16 20 mg l fig 1a the highest median annual no3 n concentrations were from illinois 16 20 mg l n 105 minnesota 12 46 mg l n 34 new brunswick 12 00 mg l n 10 iowa 11 80 mg l n 460 and indiana 11 65 mg l n 138 these values all exceeded the united states environmental protection agency s 10 mg l no3 n maximum contaminant level mcl for drinking water usepa 2009 illinois minnesota iowa and indiana site years primarily reported corn and or soybean cropping systems 91 of their combined site years these landscapes share characteristics that generally correlate with high nitrate concentrations they tend to be high in soil organic matter are poorly drained requiring subsurface drainage are dominated by corn and soybean cropping systems and have humid high rainfall conditions randall and goss 2001 ohio 6 7 mg l n 15 and new york 6 75 mg l n 42 exhibited the lowest state wide median no3 n concentrations across flow weighted site years in the database eighteen of the 42 new york site years had an orchard grass crop with mean and median annual flow weighted no3 n concentrations of 2 61 and 2 1 mg l no3 n respectively this notably reduced the median no3 n concentration for new york as the remainder of site years from this state were corn n 24 with a median concentration of 12 20 mg l no3 n medians by state province of annual flow weighted mean drp concentrations in subsurface drainage ranged from 0 012 to 0 253 mg l fig 1b the highest state based median drp concentrations were from minnesota 0 253 mg l n 3 ontario 0 200 mg l n 55 missouri 0 150 mg l n 4 and illinois 0 075 mg l n 30 while the lowest were from new york 0 012 mg l n 14 and iowa 0 018 mg l n 92 however the median concentrations from minnesota and missouri were likely not representative due to extremely small sample sizes n 3 and 4 respectively several statewide median drp concentrations exceeded the 0 0375 mg l threshold for tp recommended to limit algal growth in lakes and reservoirs in the northern great plains and corn belt regions usepa 2000 this is notable as these concentrations in the database were drp not tp 3 3 probability of exceedance more than half 56 of the nitrate site years reported annual concentrations above 10 mg l across a simple count of both flow weighted and arithmetic annual means for flow weighted means alone the 25th and 75th percentiles and median concentrations were 9 00 17 90 and 12 60 mg l respectively there was 69 probability that a given flow weighted no3 n site year would exceed the mcl of 10 mg l usepa 2009 fig 4 a this probability of mcl exceedance was slightly higher than the approximately 55 and 50 exceedance probabilities reported by logan et al 1994 in soybean and corn years respectively for ohio these relatively high probabilities across the database which was compiled from studies presumably testing recommended management practices or more likely comparing poor management vs recommended management atones to the difficulty in minimizing no3 n concentrations in subsurface drainage and the need for further research on additional strategies including edge of field conservation drainage practices there was a comparatively lower 27 probability a given site year would contain drp concentrations exceeding 0 0375 mg drp l fig 4b the recommended concentration of tp to not exceed for algal growth in lakes and reservoirs within the corn belt and northern great plains usepa 2000 this was also reflected in the percentile distribution with the 25th percentile and median drp values of 0 016 and 0 021 mg l respectively both lower than this suggested threshold 75th percentile 0 064 mg drp l however different states have different recommendations in illinois the recommendation is 0 050 mg tp l for lakes and reservoirs larger than 8 1 ha corresponding with a 25 probability of exceedance in minnesota it is 0 030 mg tp l for shallow lakes and reservoirs a 28 probability and in wisconsin it is 0 030 mg tp l for drainage and stratified lakes usepa 2014 because the fraction of drp in drainage water is highly variable the probability of exceedance estimated here is likely underestimated for example king et al 2015 reported more than 90 of their measured tile drainage drp and tp concentrations exceeded the selected recommended level of 0 03 mg l to avoid eutrophication another interpretation of this data based on extrapolating from their figure using data thief and using the slightly higher criterion of 0 0375 mg l yielded probabilities of exceedance between 80 and 90 for both drp and tp this probability of exceedance for tp concentrations corresponded reasonably well with findings here of a probability of 86 for tp fig 4c based on the probability of exceedance for this dataset no3 n and drp concentrations across the database followed a normal weibull distribution r2 0 97 and 0 51 for no3 n and drp respectively while tp concentrations deviated likely due to a smaller sample size and possibly due to greater variability with arithmetic versus flow weighted means r2 0 11 4 conclusion the new manage drain concentration database can be used to better inform the scientific community state and federal agencies and conservation and agricultural organizations about nutrient and drainage related water quality impairments across north america the 25th 50th median and 75th percentile flow weighted nitrate 9 00

the database the compiled annual no3 n concentrations had a relatively high probability 69 of exceeding the recommended drinking water standard some of the higher no3 n values in this range may have

sandy subsoils high organic matter content and or preferential flow paths can lead to significant p leaching through subsurface drainage sims et al 1998 small p loads lost from fields are often deemed inconsequential agronomically but they can have drastic impacts on water quality since low levels of p are required to sustain fresh water ecosystems correll 1998 these small loads can push p concentrations to a level that accelerates eutrophication in water bodies in terms of n lowering water tables with subsurface drainage ultimately increases n mineralization rates and drainage volume resulting in elevated n loads skaggs et al 2005 therefore identifying management factors that minimize n and p concentrations in drain discharge is required to reduce water quality impacts the measured annual nutrient loads from agricultural environments manage database administered by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service is a compilation of field scale surface and subsurface n and p loads from agricultural landscapes across the united states and canada christianson and harmel 2015a harmel et al 2006 2008 2016 2017 previous studies using data compiled in manage explored relationships between agricultural management and subsurface drainage volume and n and p loads however high variability in these previous findings resulted in a need to better quantify the effect of controllable and uncontrollable factors on subsurface drainage n and p concentrations alone the objective of this study was to analyze the newly compiled agricultural drainage n and p concentrations in the manage database to better define the variability of n and p concentrations over time and space as well as identify the likelihood of water quality concerns 2 methods and materials between may and december 2016 a literature review was performed on more than 400 agricultural drainage publications of which 79 were deemed acceptable subsurface and surface drainage studies nutrient concentrations both annual flow weighted and annual arithmetic means cropping system crop yield nutrient application precipitation and drainage data were recorded although not all site years contained information for these data fields literature was sourced from online literature search engines web of science and google scholar in addition to revisiting studies previously reviewed during creation of the manage drain load database the studies were sorted to meet criteria developed for the previously described manage database harmel et al 2016 in short acceptable literature must 1 have been peer reviewed 2 be from studies performed in the united states or canada 3 contain at least one full year of data multiple years were divided into separate site years 4 have a drainage area 0 009 ha 5 represent free drainage treatments only and 6 not be a rainfall simulation or lysimeter study the two most frequent reasons for exclusion of a study from the new manage drain concentration database were international studies and lack of reported nutrient concentrations the manage drain concentration database was produced in the same format as the drain load database but for concentrations in place of loads and new data fields were added to record drainage flow rate and percent sand silt clay of a given site nitrogen concentration classifications included dissolved nitrogen for any data not reported as a specific type of dissolved nitrogen no3 n including no2 no3 n ammonium n nh4 n particulate n and total n tn phosphorus concentration classifications were dissolved p a catch all for those not reporting a specific form of dissolved p and inorganic organic p dissolved organic p dop dissolved reactive p drp po4 p soluble p orthophosphate and molybdate reactive p particulate p pp and total p tp data thief software was used to obtain values for data reported in figures only all remaining data extraction steps and database development followed that of the previously described manage drain load database christianson and harmel 2015a b once the drain concentration database was constructed data analysis was restricted to subsurface drainage site years i e surface ditch drainage data were excluded with the exception of the soil textural triangle and site years analyses medians of reported mean annual nutrient concentrations were used for spatial analysis maps due to extreme outliers skewing the state means of annual mean concentrations probability of exceedance for the nutrient concentrations was calculated with the weibull formula which creates unbiased exceedance probabilities for all distributions maidment 1993 this was conducted by ranking concentrations in descending order with rank one as the highest concentration in the database for a given nutrient these rankings were divided by the total number of concentrations plus one this probability was then plotted against the corresponding concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 the manage drain concentration database the new manage drain concentration database contains 1564 nutrient concentration site years from 79 studies conducted in thirteen u s states and four canadian provinces fig 1 note tp tn annual arithmetic mean no3 n and particulate p site years were not reflected in the figure this included 426 120 and 373 dissolved reactive particulate and total p concentration site years respectively and 1107 and 137 no3 n and nh4 n concentration site years respectively dissolved organic p dop dissolved p particulate n dissolved n and total n comprised 57 64 3 14 and 91 site years respectively the manage drain concentration database site years spanned 1961 to 2013 but not all site years had both n and p concentrations or all forms of each nutrient annual flow weighted mean concentrations made up 71 and annual arithmetic means totaled 27 of the database fig 2 twenty eight site years 2 did not fall into either category because only annual minimum and or maximum nutrient values were recorded a relatively greater percentage of the arithmetic mean site years were from canadian studies 57 of arithmetic site years vs 27 of overall database or reported drp concentrations 51 of arithmetic site years vs 27 of overall compared to the entire database the shift towards reporting flow weighted means rather than arithmetic means e g fig 2 seemed to reflect a change in water sampling technology over time potentially away from grab sampling and towards methods allowing for more accurate flow and nutrient measurements the mean field plot size across all site years was 2 86 0 41 ha median 0 17 ha range 0 17 113 4 ha n 1254 mean land slope was 2 2 0 1 median 2 range 0 13 n 777 mean annual

and clay were reported were predominantly loam silt loam and clay loam soils which corresponded with the majority of site years being from the north american corn belt region fig 3 crop type was reported in 1329 85 site years the most prevalent crop was corn zea mays l also including white seed and silage corn 56 followed by soybean glycine max 19 alfalfa medicago sativa 6 corn soybean grown in the same year and same plot 5 and grass i e prairie pasture grass mixture permanent grass cover and crp 4 twenty three other crops made up the remaining 11 of site years with no one crop exceeding 2 3 2 spatial analysis of nutrient concentrations medians of annual flow weighted mean no3 n concentrations in subsurface drainage by state province ranged from 6 70 to 16 20 mg l fig 1a the highest median annual no3 n concentrations were from illinois 16 20 mg l n 105 minnesota 12 46 mg l n 34 new brunswick 12 00 mg l n 10 iowa 11 80 mg l n 460 and indiana 11 65 mg l n 138 these values all exceeded the united states environmental protection agency s 10 mg l no3 n maximum contaminant level mcl for drinking water usepa 2009 illinois minnesota iowa and indiana site years primarily reported corn and or soybean cropping systems 91 of their combined site years these landscapes share characteristics that generally correlate with high nitrate concentrations they tend to be high in soil organic matter are poorly drained requiring subsurface drainage are dominated by corn and soybean cropping systems and have humid high rainfall conditions randall and goss 2001 ohio 6 7 mg l n 15 and new york 6 75 mg l n 42 exhibited the lowest state wide median no3 n concentrations across flow weighted site years in the database eighteen of the 42 new york site years had an orchard grass crop with mean and median annual flow weighted no3 n concentrations of 2 61 and 2 1 mg l no3 n respectively this notably reduced the median no3 n concentration for new york as the remainder of site years from this state were corn n 24 with a median concentration of 12 20 mg l no3 n medians by state province of annual flow weighted mean drp concentrations in subsurface drainage ranged from 0 012 to 0 253 mg l fig 1b the highest state based median drp concentrations were from minnesota 0 253 mg l n 3 ontario 0 200 mg l n 55 missouri 0 150 mg l n 4 and illinois 0 075 mg l n 30 while the lowest were from new york 0 012 mg l n 14 and iowa 0 018 mg l n 92 however the median concentrations from minnesota and missouri were likely not representative due to extremely small sample sizes n 3 and 4 respectively several statewide median drp concentrations exceeded the 0 0375 mg l threshold for tp recommended to limit algal growth in lakes and reservoirs in the northern great plains and corn belt regions usepa 2000 this is notable as these concentrations in the database were drp not tp 3 3 probability of exceedance more than half 56 of the nitrate site years reported annual concentrations above 10 mg l across a simple count of both flow weighted and arithmetic annual means for flow weighted means alone the 25th and 75th percentiles and median concentrations were 9 00 17 90 and 12 60 mg l respectively there was 69 probability that a given flow weighted no3 n site year would exceed the mcl of 10 mg l usepa 2009 fig 4 a this probability of mcl exceedance was slightly higher than the approximately 55 and 50 exceedance probabilities reported by logan et al 1994 in soybean and corn years respectively for ohio these relatively high probabilities across the database which was compiled from studies presumably testing recommended management practices or more likely comparing poor management vs recommended management atones to the difficulty in minimizing no3 n concentrations in subsurface drainage and the need for further research on additional strategies including edge of field conservation drainage practices there was a comparatively lower 27 probability a given site year would contain drp concentrations exceeding 0 0375 mg drp l fig 4b the recommended concentration of tp to not exceed for algal growth in lakes and reservoirs within the corn belt and northern great plains usepa 2000 this was also reflected in the percentile distribution with the 25th percentile and median drp values of 0 016 and 0 021 mg l respectively both lower than this suggested threshold 75th percentile 0 064 mg drp l however different states have different recommendations in illinois the recommendation is 0 050 mg tp l for lakes and reservoirs larger than 8 1 ha corresponding with a 25 probability of exceedance in minnesota it is 0 030 mg tp l for shallow lakes and reservoirs a 28 probability and in wisconsin it is 0 030 mg tp l for drainage and stratified lakes usepa 2014 because the fraction of drp in drainage water is highly variable the probability of exceedance estimated here is likely underestimated for example king et al 2015 reported more than 90 of their measured tile drainage drp and tp concentrations exceeded the selected recommended level of 0 03 mg l to avoid eutrophication another interpretation of this data based on extrapolating from their figure using data thief and using the slightly higher criterion of 0 0375 mg l yielded probabilities of exceedance between 80 and 90 for both drp and tp this probability of exceedance for tp concentrations corresponded reasonably well with findings here of a probability of 86 for tp fig 4c based on the probability of exceedance for this dataset no3 n and drp concentrations across the database followed a normal weibull distribution r2 0 97 and 0 51 for no3 n and drp respectively while tp concentrations deviated likely due to a smaller sample size and possibly due to greater variability with arithmetic versus flow weighted means r2 0 11 4 conclusion the new manage drain concentration database can be used to better inform the scientific community state and federal agencies and conservation and agricultural organizations about nutrient and drainage related water quality impairments across north america the 25th 50th median and 75th percentile flow weighted nitrate 9 00 12 60 and 17 90 mg n l respectively and dissolved p 0 016 0 021 0 064 drp l respectively concentration site years across the database ranged above recommended water quality thresholds e g mcl across the database the compiled annual no3 n concentrations had a relatively high probability 69 of exceeding the recommended drinking water standard some of the higher no3 n values in this range may have been due to differences in cropping system e g 91 of illinois minnesota iowa and indiana site years were corn and or soybean looking forward the manage drain concentration data is a publicly available

11107,controlled drainage cd is a measure designed to lower n leaching from agricultural fields however raising the drainage depth in fields creating partially waterlogged conditions can have negative impacts on the yield and development of winter cereals a combination of physical and chemical analyses was performed in an outdoor lysimetric setup under north european climatic and soil conditions to characterize the effect of cd on winter wheat yields of the cultivars belgard bg benchmark bm and substance sub cd treatments consisted of drainage depths of 10 20 and 25 cm below the soil surface from january to april 2016 the control was a freely draining treatment with drains at 150 cm depth both chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm and net photosynthetic rate pn indicated that cd tended to not affect growth and dry matter dm yield at maturity which were only influenced by cultivar fv fm tended to be lowest at 10 cm drainage depth indicating increasing plant stress with shallower drainage depths the bg cultivar generally had the lowest pn rate of the three cultivars likely reflected in a 27 lower grain yield than the bm cultivar the straw n concentration was 21 higher in the bg compared to bm but neither cd nor cultivar affected the grain n concentration n uptake was controlled by the biomass production of the cultivars cd affected the concentration of multiple nutrients such as fe cu and p though no coherent pattern in nutrient changes was found overall cultivar was the main factor controlling the concentrations and uptake of the nutrients hence the only negative effect of cd on winter wheat yields was in relation to uptake of some nutrient which is a rather unexplored topic finally the consistently low fv fm at the 10 cm drainage depth indicates that shallower drainage or prolonging the cd period could cause significant waterlogging stress abbreviations cd controlled drainage wl waterlogging n nitrogen pn net photosynthesis ca calcium cu copper k

bank group 2017 consequently the country has long been dealing with high rates of nitrogen n loss and thus large nitrate losses due to large precipitation surpluses primarily during autumn and winter dalgaard et al 2014 denmark has managed to lower the annual farm n surplus by 70 kg n ha 1 yr 1 dalgaard et al 2014 but this remains inadequate if denmark is to fulfil the obligations of the eu water framework directive hansen et al 2017 which asks for good ecological status of all water bodies european union 2000 good ecological status requires that waterbodies only show slight changes from how they are expected to be under undisturbed conditions in relation to both the ecology chemistry morphology and quantity of water in the rivers european union 2000 consequently new possible management tools for decreasing n leaching are being explored controlled drainage cd is one of the tested measures for reducing n leaching from agricultural fields carstensen et al 2016 by raising the water level in the soil profile controlled drainage has the potential to increase denitrification in the anaerobic zone borin et al 2001 and increase percolation through deeper sediments cd has been applied in many countries such as the united states sweden and italy and has resulted in less n entering streams and rivers ayars et al 2006 bonaiti and borin 2010 wesstr√∂m et al 2001 field studies have shown that cd can increase yields of various crops including wheat by up to 18 bonaiti and borin 2010 wesstr√∂m and messing 2007 woli et al 2010 yield increases in cd fields have been attributed to the higher available soil water contents by subirrigation ayars et al 2006 and the retention of n in fields making n accessible to the plants wesstr√∂m and messing 2007 most studies on the effects of cd have focused on how cd can lower n leaching while little attention has been paid to the effects that cd might have on plant development and plant nutrient relations however these are important for ensuring a stable grain production which is why effects on yield and plant nutrient uptake under cd need to be investigated further if cd is to be applied in denmark as an effective tool for lowering n leaching it would have to be enforced during the autumn and winter season to lower the nitrate concentration in soil water and minimize the percolation through drains jabloun et al 2015 until now cd experiments with drainage depths of 40 cm have had no repercussion on crop growth and development under danish conditions carstensen et al 2016 this indicates that it might be possible to have even shallower drainage depths which may allow for higher denitrification rates if water reaches the plough layer where most of the organic matter needed for the process is found however this is only acceptable if still low or no influence on crop growth can be demonstrated higher groundwater levels in the soil during autumn can cause waterlogging wl conditions affecting the growth of winter crops waterlogging of fields has previously been of concern in the uk when growing winter wheat belford et al 1985 cannell et al 1980 which has resulted in wheat cultivars with a high tolerance to wl being chosen dickin et al 2009 similar tendencies have been seen in mexico boru et al 2001 wl has been estimated to lower crop yields by 7 51 in the united states and united kingdom cannell et al 1980 dickin and wright 2008 musgrave 1994 so the risk of negative wl effects in cd fields needs to be examined before implementing cd as a n remediation measure in drained fields with winter cereal production it is know that crops grown under partially waterlogged soil conditions drainge depths of 10 cm can respond similar to completely waterlogged crops malik et al 2001 thus to obtain the highest possible impact of cd on n retention and denitrification without impacting the crop development it is important to identify at which drainage depth cd crops start to mimic the respons of wl crops under danish weather conditions the low yield of wl plants has been shown to relate to lower net photosynthetic rates pn wu et al 2015 and impaired n uptake shao et al 2013 both pn and n uptake in plants affect the chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm as fv fm has been shown to increase with n application jin et al 2015 and decrease under wl conditions similar to pn betancourt osorio et al 2016 consequently fv fm has been suggested as a screening parameter when determining plant environmental stress baker and rosenqvist 2004 and in particularly for wl sensitivity since this parameter is practical and easy to measure smethurst et al 2005 additionally studies have found that the availability of several micronutrients changes in flooded soils indicating that wl can cause changes in the nutrient uptake of plants ding and musgrave 1995 setter et al 2009 while the duration of a flooding event is important for the effect of wl on plant growth and yield marti et al 2015 and nutrient uptake herzog et al 2016 we speculate that for cd it is more likely that the height of the water table determines the outcome since cd only partially waterlogs the soil additionally we find that determination of the tolerance to a high water level for typical danish winter wheat cultivars is necessary to ensure a minimal effect on yields the objective of this study was to determine how cd during autumn and winter affects winter wheat growth yields and nutrient uptake n p and a range of nutrients under north european weather conditions our hypothesis was that i cd causes waterlogging like conditions when applied during the winter resulting in decreases in nutrient uptake pn n concentration of the vegetation and the grain causing smaller yields ii the severity of damages caused by cd will increase with the height of the water table and iii cd will have different effects on different wheat cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was carried out during the growing season 2015 2016 at research centre foulum 56 29 18 6 n9 34 58 9 e using large outdoor lysimeters the lysimeters were constructed in 1992 and consist of concrete containers 1 1 m depth 1 5 m coated with epoxy the soil is a sandy loam table 1 temperature and monthly precipitation during the experimental period are presented in table 2 an automatic mobile roof connected to a rain sensor was active from 28 january to 6 april when activated by rain the roof covered the lysimeters resulting in null or insignificant amounts of precipitation ensuring that the drainage depth of the water level of the lysimeter did not rise over the winter the adjusted precipitation in table 2 indicates the amount of precipitation which the lysimeters received during the treatments months january to april while the automatic roof was activated 2 2 experimental setup sowing took place on 28 september 2015 where 36 lysimeters were sown with winter wheat triticum aestivum l of the cultivars belgrade benchmark and substance in random order fig 1 a total of 12 lysimeters was sown with each of the three cultivars after sowing a piezometer 16 mm diameter 1 m depth was installed in each lysimeter for measuring the height of the water table the lysimeters were saturated with water on 26 january to drainage depths of 10 20 and 25 cm below the soil surface the amount of water added to the lysimeters to obtain the drainage depths of 10 20 and 25 cm was no measured instead the water levels was determined every second or third day using a water level mirror elwa teknik i s herning denmark with an accuracy of 2 cm nine of the lysimeters were left to drain freely with a drainage depth of 150 cm these nine lysimeters functioned as the control each cd treatment thus consisted of nine lysimeters and contained three replicates of each winter wheat variety the cd was started in january because the water levels in danish cd fields tend to be highest during january and february carstensen et al 2016 if the water level deviated more than 2 cm from the intended height water was added or drained from the lysimeters until the intended height 2 cm was reached again on 1 february all lysimeters were fertilised with npk fertiliser equal to 50 kg n ha 1 npk 21 3 10 free drainage of the lysimeters started on 6 april at which point the lysimeters were fertilised with additional 50 kg n ha 1 npk 21 3 10 the automatic roof controlling the precipitation during the experiment with cd was deactivated on 28 april when all lysimeters were drained off hence once the cd period ceased all lysimeters were rainfed and has a drainage depth of all lysimeters was 150 cm until harvest at maturity on 2 may the lysimeters were fertilised again with 140 kg n ha 1 npk 21 3 10 all lysimeters were sprayed against powdery mildew on 11 may with flexity basf a s ludwigshafen germany 2 3 crop measurements 2 3 1 net photosynthesis net photosynthesis pn measurements were started on 4 april two days before free drainage was instigated in all of the lysimeters and the last measurement was taken on 12 may measurements were taken between 08 00 15 00 in all lysimeters once every week on days when there were clear skies and little wind all measurements were made on the latest fully developed leaf ligule present of a representative plant in each lysimeter the measurements were made using the open flow gas exchange system ciras 2 pp systems amesbury ma usa the settings in the cuvette were made to reflect the outdoor environment the co2 concentration was set at 400 Œºmol mol 1 and the mean leaf temperature was kept at the same temperature as the outside environment the water vapour deficit in the cuvette was set to mimic that of the ambient air par was set to 1200 Œºmol m 2 s 1 and the airflow through the cuvette was set at 255 ml min 1 2 3 2 chlorophyll fluorescence chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm measurements started on 6 april just before drainage was started up later the same day measurements were taken once every week on days when there were clear skies and no rain measurements were taken using the mini pam fluorimeter walz germany before measuring the leaves were dark adapted with dark leaf clips for 30 min the minimum fluorescence f0 was measured at low photosynthetic photon flux density when the photosystem ii psii reaction centres were in the open state maximum fluorescence fm was measured by applying a 0 8 s light pulse at approximately 4000 Œºmol m 2 s 1 forcing the reaction centres to close the maximum quantum yield of psii fv fm was calculated from f0 and fm which can be expressed as fv fm fm f0 fm measurements were made on a representative plant from the centre of each of the lysimeters on all measuring dates 2 4 harvest 2 4 1 dry matter yield harvest of the lysimeters took place on 12 august when 0 5 m2 was harvested from the middle of each lysimeter by cutting the plants with a pair of scissors at ground level the harvested material from each plot was divided into straw grain and the total fresh weight of the two fractions recorded subsamples consisting of approximately one third of each of the harvested straw and grain samples were taken out and dried at 60 c until a stable weight was obtained for dry matter dm determination the total dm yield was determined by adding the dm of the straw with the grain dm an overview of the timing of the experimental activities is presented in table 3 2 4 2 analyses harvest index hi was determined by h a r v e s t i n d e x h i g r a i n d m y i e l d t o t a l d m y i e l d n concentration in the dry matter fractions was determined by the dumas method the nitrogen harvest index nhi was determined by n h i g r a i n n i t r o g e n a m o u n t t o t a l d m n i t r o g e n a m o u n t ca cu fe k mg mn and p were determined by coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp measurements all icp measurements were made on the icap 6600 series icp spectrometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa 2 5 statistics using the r studio software version 3 2 3 the harvest data were subjected to a two way analysis of variance anova or a two way kruskal wallis test to detect significant differences between cd treatments and cultivars both the two way anova and kruskal wallis test used cd treatment and cultivar as factors determining the harvest data the pn data were subjected to a three and two way anova analysis while fv fm data were subjected to a three way kruskal wallis test for the three way analysis cd treatment cultivar and date were used as the determining factors for both the pn and fv fm measurements the kruskal wallis three and two way analyses were applied to data that did not follow a normal distribution or when there was uneven variance among the normally distributed samples due to outliers between residuals when the anova or kruskal wallis tests indicated significant treatment effects mean comparisons were conducted significant differences were given at p 0 05 normally distributed data were subjected to a tukey test for determination of the significant difference between cd treatments and cultivars the significant level used for the anova tukey test was p 0 05 indicating a confidence interval of 95 for the non parametric kruskal wallis test significant differences were determined by applying a multiple comparisons test with correction for multiple testing by the single step method where a confidence interval of 95 was used 3 results 3 1 photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements on 10 april the pn was significantly affected by the cd treatment where both t20 and t25 had a significantly larger pn compared to the free drainage treatment on the same day t20 was also significantly different from t10 p 0 01 in addition to the cd treatments cultivar also impacted pn on 10 april p 0 05 however it was not possible to separate the cultivars using the tukey test on 10 april still on 10 april the bg cultivar had the lowest average pn of 21 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1 while bm and sub had average pn values of 23 6 and 24 4 Œºmol m 2 s 1 moreover bg tended to have the lowest average pn across all measuring dates with an average pn of 22 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1 while for bm and sub the average pn was respectively 23 6 and 23 8 Œºmol m 2 s 1 additionally the measuring date also affected the pn measurements p 0 001 with 12 may producing the highest average pn fig 2 e and being the only date which was significantly different from the other dates t10 tended to have the lowest fv fm values on five out of the seven days fig 3 b c e f and g and on the two remaining days t10 had the second lowest average fv fm fig 3a and d the free drainage treatment had the highest average fv fm on four out of the seven days fig 3b e and the second highest average fv fm on the remaining three days fig 3a f and g however the difference in fv fm caused by cd was not significant at any point hence neither cd nor cultivar nor date had any significant effects on fv fm as pn only was significantly impacted by cd and cultivar on 10 april and fv fm never was significantly impacted by cd nor cultivar these results suggest that the photosynthetic capacity of the wheat plants was unaffected by the cd treatments 3 2 yield and nitrogen uptake grain and straw yields at harvest were unaffected by the previous cd treatments while the cultivar had a significant effect on both table 4 averaged over cd treatments the grain and straw yields of bg of respectively 6 5 and 6 6 t ha 1 were significantly lower than for bm and sub cultivars table 4 the highest average grain and straw yields were obtained with bm of respectively 9 0 and 7 9 t ha 1 similar to grain and straw yields hi was only affected by cultivar hi was largest for the bm cultivar which was significantly different from both bg and sub sub and bg were not significantly different from each other tables 4 and 5 cd did not affect the grain or straw n concentration tables 4 and 5 however cultivar did affect the n concentration in the straw table 4 where bg had a significantly higher n concentration compared to both bm and sub cd did not affect the n uptake in grain and straw table 5 but cultivar did with bm having a significantly larger n uptake compared to bg while sub was not significantly different from neither bg nor bm table 4 cd did not affect nhi but an effect of cultivar was found table 5 as bg had the lowest n translocation of the three cultivars though it was not significantly different from sub table 4 bm had a significantly higher nhi than both bg and sub thus indicating that the n efficiency of bm was higher compared to the other two cultivars 3 3 nutrient uptake cd affected the concentration of nutrients in the crop figs 4 and 5 the concentrations of fe k and mn in the grain were affected by the cd treatments through interaction with cultivar fig 4c d f but we were unable to statistically separate the cd treatments for the interaction affecting the fe concentration for mn the concentration was significantly lower in bm t20 compared to the concentration in bg t20 and sub with free drainage but at the other cd levels there were no differences for the concentration of k the two way anova did indicate that the cd treatment affected the concentrations in the grains but using pairwise comparison we were unable to tell the treatments apart besides the nutrient concentrations in the grain were mainly affected by the cultivar fig 4 as only the cu concentration was not influenced by the cultivar in any way the straw concentration of both fe and k was only determined by cd fig 5c d while cd also affected the concentration of cu mg mn and p through interactions with the cultivar fig 5b e f g the concentration of fe in the straw was significantly lower in t10 and t20 than in the free drainage treatment while t25 had significantly larger concentrations of fe in the straw compared to t10 fig 5c the free drainage treatment had a significantly lower straw k concentration compared to the t10 t20 and t25 treatments fig 5d between which the concentrations did not differ significantly cultivar also affected the concentrations of nutrients in the straw but only through interactions fig 5 unfortunately we were unable to tell the cd treatments apart for the ca mg and p concentrations in straw for the mn concentration in the straw bm t20 had a significantly lower concentration compared to bg t20 and sub with free drainage but for all other cd levels no significant differences occurred cd did have some significant effects on the uptake of nutrients though cultivar was the most important factor fig 6 bm tended to have the highest nutrient uptake whilst bg tended to have the lowest nutrient uptakes fig 6 generally there appeared to be a positive correlation among total dry biomass and nutrient uptake especially so for fe k mg and p fig 6c d e g 4 discussion previous studies have shown that wheat grown in partially waterlogged soils drainage depth 10 cm can experience decreased pn values for instance malik et al 2001 found that five days of complete or partial wl decreased pn in the third leaf to 0 however in the present study cd tended to not affect pn except on 10 april where free drainage and t10 had significantly lower pn values than t25 the different effect of pn in malik et al 2001 to the present experiment could be related to the difference in temperature our experiment took place during winter where the average daily temperatures ranged between 0 1 to 5 9 c while the average day night temperature in malik et al 2001 was 20 15 c studies have shown that the effects of wl increase with temperature herzog et al 2016 musgrave 1994 as higher temperatures decrease the solubility of o2 and increase the biological demand for oxygen schlesinger 1996 hence partial waterlogging with a drainage depth of 10 cm might not have any significant effect on its own but in combination with high temperatures it can have significant effects on wheat growth the temperatures registered at foulum from january to april 2016 during the experiment fell within the danish climate norms for the twelve year period 2006 2017 for this period the lowest average temperature of 3 4 c was recorded during january and the highest average temperature of 9 9 c in april dmi 2017a 2018 corresponding to the lowest and highest average temperatures for our experiment table 2 this indicates that our registered temperatures fall within the norm for winter temperatures in denmark and thus the risk of high temperatures during the treatment period is only an issue if cd is applied in early autumn when average temperatures can be as high as 16 2 c in september dmi 2017b although t10 did not have the lowest pn it tended to have the lowest average fv fm on five out of seven days while fv fm tended to be highest in the free drainage treatment fig 3 smethurst et al 2005 found that fv fm is a sensitive measure of waterlogging stress and our results could therefore indicate a tendency for plants in t10 to be more stressed than those of the free drainage treatment although there was no significant difference cd during the early growth stages did not have any effect on the grain or the straw yield in our experiment table 5 this is in line with other cd experiments in denmark where raising the water level to 70 cm above the natural drainage depth of 110 cm had no impact on the yield of winter wheat carstensen et al 2016 however other experiments in denmark have shown that grain yield increased by 0 25 t ha 1 when lowering the drainage depth from 80 to 115 cm hansen and karl 1969 contradicting our findings however in hansen and karl 1969 the drainage depth was lowered throughout the year and partially waterlogged soil may be more critical during the later phenological stages where redistribution of n and carbohydrates for grain formation occurs jiang et al 2008 kaur et al 2017 while there was no significant effect of cd on grain or straw yields the cultivar had a significant effect on both table 5 this is consistent with dickin et al 2009 who found different cultivar behaviors depends on the climate conditions the grain and straw yields obtained with the bg cultivar were significantly lower than those of both bm and sub table 4 this might be related to the lower pn observed for bg fig 3a d although not significantly different still low yields have been linked to decreased pn values in plants stressed by wl de san celedonio et al 2016 jiang et al 2008 additionally musgrave 1994 showed that assimilation rate and grain yield of eight different winter wheat cultivars exposed to wl were positively correlated over three years but with different degrees of correlation depending on cultivar and with no interactions between treatment and cultivar hence choice of cultivar can result in significant differences in yield due to the difference in pn neither cd nor cultivar had any effect on grain n concentration but cultivar did affect the concentration of n in the straw tables 4 and 5 this indicated a difference in the relocation of n in the plant as bg had a significantly higher n concentration in the straw than the other cultivars but a similar n concentration in the grains resulting in the lowest nhi which was significantly different from that of bm table 4 in other experiments lower n concentrations in leaves have been observed in both partially and completely waterlogged wheat plants herzog et al 2016 malik et al 2001 but since we did not collect plant samples during the cd treatment we were not able to determine whether such a drop occurred however it is clear that cd had no long term effect on the n concentration or uptake in any of the cultivars table 4 besides malik et al 2001 showed that wheat experiencing partial or complete wl during the early phenological stages is capable of recovering where a compensatory n uptake meant that cd had no effect on the final n concentration and uptake at harvest the higher grain n uptake in bm compared to bg table 4 was probably caused by the significant difference in biomass accumulation for the grain since there was no significant difference between grain n concentrations table 5 hence the higher biomass accumulation likely caused by a higher pn affected not only the straw and grain yield but also the translocation of n to the grains also the macro and micronutrients were mainly affected by the cultivar as was the case for almost all parameters however several nutrients such as fe cu and p were also affected by cd or interaction between cd and cultivar fig 4 and 5 the highest concentration of the macro and micro nutrients was always found in either the free drainage treatment or t10 as e g fe where the highest concentration was found in the free drainage treatment however fe has previously been reported to increase in wl plants khabaz saberi et al 2007 stieger and feller 1994 because of the higher solubility of its reduced form additionally khabaz saberi et al 2007 found an increase in fe only in plants grown on acid soils while it remained the same or could even be decreased in wl plants grown in neutral soil conditions this is likely caused by the decrease of fe 2 in soils when ph increases even when the redox potential is below 0 2 v and anoxic conditions are present schlesinger 1996 also setter et al 2009 concluded that local soil conditions determine the fate of micronutrients in soil and crops exposed to wl thus the same might be the case for cd where the soil is partially waterlogged indicating the need to measure the local soil ph which determines whether redox sensitive nutrients can be expected to increase in plants grown under partially waterlogged conditions cd affected the concentration of the nutrients more than it did the uptake figs 4 6 hence the total uptake of nutrients was more likely to be determined by the biomass of the plants than the differences in the concentrations as we also found for the n uptake in the straw the impact of the relationship between biomass and concentration on the uptake was partially visible when looking at bg and bm where bg generally had the highest nutrient concentrations but the lowest uptakes figs 4 6 which were caused by a significantly lower biomass accumulation table 4 while the opposite was true for bm 5 perspective while our results are promising for the application of cd in denmark we have identified some areas that would need to be investigated further before cd can be applied we therefore suggest that further research concentrates on whether drainage dephts shallower than 10 cm will induce significant plant stress as t10 tended to have the lowest fv fm values additionally our research raises the question of whether longer periods with cd could cause significant plant stress as the application of cd is supposed to start in early autumn and last until the early spring to mitigate n loss under danish conditions carstensen et al 2016 prolonging the cd period might inflict more permanent damage on plant growth we also find that there is a need to test whether higher temperatures during the early autumn compared to our experiment might cause pn to decrease when combined with the high water levels as in malik et al 2001 as this could reduce crop growth finally we believe that it will be necessary to examine how long shallow drainage depth can be maintained without affecting the accessibility to the fields as heavy machinery on wet soils might cause soil compaction munkholm 2011 for plant growth we find that it is worth considering whether annual repetition of the experiment could impact the yield outputs since specific climate conditions favour the growth of cultivars differently li et al 2016 thus annual repetitions of the experiment might change the perception of which cultivars would be the most effective under cd conditions in denmark additionally due to limited research related to the effect of cd on plant growth we have not been able to find any literature exploring how cd affects nutrient solubility or uptake in plants there is obviously a need for further investigations into the relation between cd and plant nutrient uptake as tolerant cultivars have been found to experience a smaller increase in mn and fe under wl conditions khabaz saberi et al 2012 thus the three cultivars bg bm and sub might have been wl tolerant cultivars as cd had only limited effect on all of the measured parameters 6 conclusion controlled drainage did not introduce wl stress when applied during winter in denmark since shallow drainage depths did not lower n concentration or n uptake in the plants nor did it tend to decrease pn or cause lower yields although we did not observe any significant effect of cd on yields t10 tended to have the lowest fv fm indicating that shallow drainage depths did cause more stress than deeper drainage though the difference in stress levels was not significant however to confirm that cd do not influence plant growth repetition of studies on the impact of cd on plant growth is essential the cultivars bg bm and sub were significantly different from each other and we ruled out that the difference was due to wl sensitivity but more likely was caused by genetic differences which was expressed due to the weather conditions acknowledgments this research was supported by grants from the sino danish center sdc in denmark and china as a part of a phd project and the danish gudp sponsored project 3405 11 0385 kontrolleret dr√¶ning som virkemiddel til reduction af kv√¶lstofudledningen

11107,controlled drainage cd is a measure designed to lower n leaching from agricultural fields however raising the drainage depth in fields creating partially waterlogged conditions can have negative impacts on the yield and development of winter cereals a combination of physical and chemical analyses was performed in an outdoor lysimetric setup under north european climatic and soil conditions to characterize the effect of cd on winter wheat yields of the cultivars belgard bg benchmark bm and substance sub cd treatments consisted of drainage depths of 10 20 and 25 cm below the soil surface from january to april 2016 the control was a freely draining treatment with drains at 150 cm depth both chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm and net photosynthetic rate pn indicated that cd tended to not affect growth and dry matter dm yield at maturity which were only influenced by cultivar fv fm tended to be lowest at 10 cm drainage depth indicating increasing plant stress with shallower drainage depths the bg cultivar generally had the lowest pn rate of the three cultivars likely reflected in a 27 lower grain yield than the bm cultivar the straw n concentration was 21 higher in the bg compared to bm but neither cd nor cultivar affected the grain n concentration n uptake was controlled by the biomass production of the cultivars cd affected the concentration of multiple nutrients such as fe cu and p though no coherent pattern in nutrient changes was found overall cultivar was the main factor controlling the concentrations and uptake of the nutrients hence the only negative effect of cd on winter wheat yields was in relation to uptake of some nutrient which is a rather unexplored topic finally the consistently low fv fm at the 10 cm drainage depth indicates that

bank group 2017 consequently the country has long been dealing with high rates of nitrogen n loss and thus large nitrate losses due to large precipitation surpluses primarily during autumn and winter dalgaard et al 2014 denmark has managed to lower the annual farm n surplus by 70 kg n ha 1 yr 1 dalgaard et al 2014 but this remains inadequate if denmark is to fulfil the obligations of the eu water framework directive hansen et al 2017 which asks for good ecological status of all water bodies european union 2000 good ecological status requires that waterbodies only show slight changes from how they are expected to be under undisturbed conditions in relation to both the ecology chemistry morphology and quantity of water in the rivers european union 2000 consequently new possible management tools for decreasing n leaching are being explored controlled drainage cd is one of the tested measures for reducing n leaching from agricultural fields carstensen et al 2016 by raising the water level in the soil profile controlled drainage has the potential to increase denitrification in the anaerobic zone borin et al 2001 and increase percolation through deeper sediments cd has been applied in many countries such as the united states sweden and italy and has resulted in less n entering streams and rivers ayars et al 2006 bonaiti and borin 2010 wesstr√∂m et al 2001 field studies have shown that cd can increase yields of various crops including wheat by up to 18 bonaiti and borin 2010 wesstr√∂m and messing 2007 woli et al 2010 yield increases in cd fields have been attributed to the higher available soil water contents by subirrigation ayars et al 2006 and the retention of n in fields making n accessible to the plants wesstr√∂m and messing 2007 most studies on the effects of cd have focused on how cd can lower n leaching while little attention has been paid to the effects that cd might have on plant development and plant nutrient relations however these are important for ensuring a stable grain production which is why effects on yield and plant nutrient uptake under cd need to be investigated further if cd is to be applied in denmark as an effective tool for lowering n leaching it would have to be enforced during the autumn and winter season to lower the nitrate concentration in soil water and minimize the percolation through drains jabloun et al 2015 until now cd experiments with drainage depths of 40 cm have had no repercussion on crop growth and development under danish conditions carstensen et al 2016 this indicates that it might be possible to have even shallower drainage depths which may allow for higher denitrification rates if water reaches the plough layer where most of the organic matter needed for the process is found however this is only acceptable if still low or no influence on crop growth can be demonstrated higher groundwater levels in the soil during autumn can cause waterlogging wl conditions affecting the growth of winter crops waterlogging of fields has previously been of concern in the uk when growing winter wheat belford et al 1985 cannell et al 1980 which has resulted in wheat cultivars with a high tolerance to wl being chosen dickin et al 2009 similar tendencies have been seen in mexico boru et al 2001 wl has been estimated to lower crop yields by 7 51 in the united states and united kingdom cannell et al 1980 dickin and wright 2008 musgrave 1994 so the risk of negative wl effects in cd fields needs to be examined before implementing cd as a n remediation measure in drained fields with winter cereal production it is know that crops grown under partially waterlogged soil conditions drainge depths of 10 cm can respond similar to completely waterlogged crops malik et al 2001 thus to obtain the highest possible impact of cd on n retention and denitrification without impacting the crop development it is important to identify at which drainage depth cd crops start to mimic the respons of wl crops under danish weather conditions the low yield of wl plants has been shown to relate to lower net photosynthetic rates pn wu et al 2015 and impaired n uptake shao et al 2013 both pn and n uptake in plants affect the chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm as fv fm has been shown to increase with n application jin et al 2015 and decrease under wl conditions similar to pn betancourt osorio et al 2016 consequently fv fm has been suggested as a screening parameter when determining plant environmental stress baker and rosenqvist 2004 and in particularly for wl sensitivity since this parameter is practical and easy to measure smethurst et al 2005 additionally studies have found that the availability of several micronutrients changes in flooded soils indicating that wl can cause changes in the nutrient uptake of plants ding and musgrave 1995 setter et al 2009 while the duration of a flooding event is important for the effect of wl on plant growth and yield marti et al 2015 and nutrient uptake herzog et al 2016 we speculate that for cd it is more likely that the height of the water table determines the outcome since cd only partially waterlogs the soil additionally we find that determination of the tolerance to a high water level for typical danish winter wheat cultivars is necessary to ensure a minimal effect on yields the objective of this study was to determine how cd during autumn and winter affects winter wheat growth yields and nutrient uptake n p and a range of nutrients under north european weather conditions our hypothesis was that i cd causes waterlogging like conditions when applied during the winter resulting in decreases in nutrient uptake pn n concentration of the vegetation and the grain causing smaller yields ii the severity of damages caused by cd will increase with the height of the water table and iii cd will have different effects on different wheat cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was carried out during the growing season 2015 2016 at research centre foulum 56 29 18 6 n9 34 58 9 e using large outdoor lysimeters the lysimeters were constructed in 1992 and consist of concrete containers 1 1 m depth 1 5 m coated with epoxy the soil is a sandy loam table 1 temperature and monthly precipitation during the experimental period are presented in table 2 an automatic mobile roof connected to a rain sensor was active from 28 january to 6 april when activated by rain the roof covered the lysimeters resulting in null or insignificant amounts of precipitation ensuring that the drainage depth of the water level of the lysimeter did not rise over the winter the adjusted precipitation in table 2 indicates the amount of precipitation which the lysimeters received during the treatments months january to april while the automatic roof was activated 2 2 experimental setup sowing took place on 28 september 2015 where 36 lysimeters were sown with winter wheat triticum aestivum l of the cultivars belgrade benchmark and substance in random order fig 1 a total of 12 lysimeters was sown with each of the three cultivars after sowing a piezometer 16 mm diameter 1 m depth was installed in each lysimeter for measuring the height of the water table the lysimeters were saturated with water on 26 january to drainage depths of 10 20 and 25 cm below the soil surface the amount of water added to the lysimeters to obtain the drainage depths of 10 20 and 25 cm was no measured instead the water levels was determined every second or third day using a water level mirror elwa teknik i s herning denmark with an accuracy of 2 cm nine of the lysimeters were left to drain freely with a drainage depth of 150 cm these nine lysimeters functioned as the control each cd treatment thus consisted of nine lysimeters and contained three replicates of each winter wheat variety the cd was started in january because the water levels in danish cd fields tend to be highest during january and february carstensen et al 2016 if the water level deviated more than 2 cm from the intended height water was added or drained from the lysimeters until the intended height 2 cm was reached again on 1 february all lysimeters were fertilised with npk fertiliser equal to 50 kg n ha 1 npk 21 3 10 free drainage of the lysimeters started on 6 april at which point the lysimeters were fertilised with additional 50 kg n ha 1 npk 21 3 10 the automatic roof controlling the precipitation during the experiment with cd was deactivated on 28 april when all lysimeters were drained off hence once the cd period ceased all lysimeters were rainfed and has a drainage depth of all lysimeters was 150 cm until harvest at maturity on 2 may the lysimeters were fertilised again with 140 kg n ha 1 npk 21 3 10 all lysimeters were sprayed against powdery mildew on 11 may with flexity basf a s ludwigshafen germany 2 3 crop measurements 2 3 1 net photosynthesis net photosynthesis pn measurements were started on 4 april two days before free drainage was instigated in all of the lysimeters and the last measurement was taken on 12 may measurements were taken between 08 00 15 00 in all lysimeters once every week on days when there were clear skies and little wind all measurements were made on the latest fully developed leaf ligule present of a representative plant in each lysimeter the measurements were made using the open flow gas exchange system ciras 2 pp systems amesbury ma usa the settings in the cuvette were made to reflect the outdoor environment the co2 concentration was set at 400 Œºmol mol 1 and the mean leaf temperature was kept at the same temperature as the outside environment the water vapour deficit in the cuvette was set to mimic that of the ambient air par was set to 1200 Œºmol m 2 s 1 and the airflow through the cuvette was set at 255 ml min 1 2 3 2 chlorophyll fluorescence chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm measurements started on 6 april just before drainage was started up later the same day measurements were taken once every week on days when there were clear skies and no rain measurements were taken using the mini pam fluorimeter walz germany before measuring the leaves were dark adapted with dark leaf clips for 30 min the minimum fluorescence f0 was measured at low photosynthetic photon flux density when the photosystem ii psii reaction centres were in the open state maximum fluorescence fm was measured by applying a 0 8 s light pulse at approximately 4000 Œºmol m 2 s 1 forcing the reaction centres to close the maximum quantum yield of psii fv fm was calculated from f0 and fm which can be expressed as fv fm fm f0 fm measurements were made on a representative plant from the centre of each of the lysimeters on all measuring dates 2 4 harvest 2 4 1 dry matter yield harvest of the lysimeters took place on 12 august when 0 5 m2 was harvested from the middle of each lysimeter by cutting the plants with a pair of scissors at ground level the harvested material from each plot was divided into straw grain and the total fresh weight of the two fractions recorded subsamples consisting of approximately one third of each of the harvested straw and grain samples were taken out and dried at 60 c until a stable weight was obtained for dry matter dm determination the total dm yield was determined by adding the dm of the straw with the grain dm an overview of the timing of the experimental activities is presented in table 3 2 4 2 analyses harvest index hi was determined by h a r v e s t i n d e x h i g r a i n d m y i e l d t o t a l d m y i e l d n concentration in the dry matter fractions was determined by the dumas method the nitrogen harvest index nhi was determined by n h i g r a i n n i t r o g e n a m o u n t t o t a l d m n i t r o g e n a m o u n t ca cu fe k mg mn and p were determined by coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp measurements all icp measurements were made on the icap 6600 series icp spectrometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa 2 5 statistics using the r studio software version 3 2 3 the harvest data were subjected to a two way analysis of variance anova or a two way kruskal wallis test to detect significant differences between cd treatments and cultivars both the two way anova and kruskal wallis test used cd treatment and cultivar as factors determining the harvest data the pn data were subjected to a three and two way anova analysis while fv fm data were subjected to a three way kruskal wallis test for the three way analysis cd treatment cultivar and date were used as the determining factors for both the pn and fv fm measurements the kruskal wallis three and two way analyses were applied to data that did not follow a normal distribution or when there was uneven variance among the normally distributed samples due to outliers between residuals when the anova or kruskal wallis tests indicated significant treatment effects mean comparisons were conducted significant differences were given at p 0 05 normally distributed data were subjected to a tukey test for determination of the significant difference between cd treatments and cultivars the significant level used for the anova tukey test was p 0 05 indicating a confidence interval of 95 for the non parametric kruskal wallis test significant differences were determined by applying a multiple comparisons test with correction for multiple testing by the single step method where a confidence interval of 95 was used 3 results 3 1 photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements on 10 april the pn was significantly affected by the cd treatment where both t20 and t25 had a significantly larger pn compared to the free drainage treatment on the same day t20 was also significantly different from t10 p 0 01 in addition to the cd treatments cultivar also impacted pn on 10 april p 0 05 however it was not possible to separate the cultivars using the tukey test on 10 april still on 10 april the bg cultivar had the lowest average pn of 21 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1 while bm and sub had average pn values of 23 6 and 24 4 Œºmol m 2 s 1 moreover bg tended to have the lowest average pn across all measuring dates with an average pn of 22 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1 while for bm and sub the average pn was respectively 23 6 and 23 8 Œºmol m 2 s 1 additionally the measuring date also affected the pn measurements p 0 001 with 12 may producing the highest average pn fig 2 e and being the only date which was significantly different from the other dates t10 tended to have the lowest fv fm values on five out of the seven days fig 3 b c e f and g and on the two remaining days t10 had the second lowest average fv fm fig 3a and d the free drainage treatment had the highest average fv fm on four out of the seven days fig 3b e and the second highest average fv fm on the remaining three days fig 3a f and g however the difference in fv fm caused by cd was not significant at any point hence neither cd nor cultivar nor date had any significant effects on fv fm as pn only was significantly impacted by cd and cultivar on 10 april and fv fm never was significantly impacted by cd nor cultivar these results suggest that the photosynthetic capacity of the wheat plants was unaffected by the cd treatments 3 2 yield and nitrogen uptake grain and straw yields at harvest were unaffected by the previous cd treatments while the cultivar had a significant effect on both table 4 averaged over cd treatments the grain and straw yields of bg of respectively 6 5 and 6 6 t ha 1 were significantly lower than for bm and sub cultivars table 4 the highest average grain and straw yields were obtained with bm of respectively 9 0 and 7 9 t ha 1 similar to grain and straw yields hi was only affected by cultivar hi was largest for the bm cultivar which was significantly different from both bg and sub sub and bg were not significantly different from each other tables 4 and 5 cd did not affect the grain or straw n concentration tables 4 and 5 however cultivar did affect the n concentration in the straw table 4 where bg had a significantly higher n concentration compared to both bm and sub cd did not affect the n uptake in grain and straw table 5 but cultivar did with bm having a significantly larger n uptake compared to bg while sub was not significantly different from neither bg nor bm table 4 cd did not affect nhi but an effect of cultivar was found table 5 as bg had the lowest n translocation of the three cultivars though it was not significantly different from sub table 4 bm had a significantly higher nhi than both bg and sub thus indicating that the n efficiency of bm was higher compared to the other two cultivars 3 3 nutrient uptake cd affected the concentration of nutrients in the crop figs 4 and 5 the concentrations of fe k and mn in the grain were affected by the cd treatments through interaction with cultivar fig 4c d f but we were unable to statistically separate the cd treatments for the interaction affecting the fe concentration for mn the concentration was significantly lower in bm t20 compared to the concentration in bg t20 and sub with free drainage but at the other cd levels there were no differences for the concentration of k the two way anova did indicate that the cd treatment affected the concentrations in the grains but using pairwise comparison we were unable to tell the treatments apart besides the nutrient concentrations in the grain were mainly affected by the cultivar fig 4 as only the cu concentration was not influenced by the cultivar in any way the straw concentration of both fe and k was only determined by cd fig 5c d while cd also affected the concentration of cu mg mn and p through interactions with the cultivar fig 5b e f g the concentration of fe in the straw was significantly lower in t10 and t20 than in the free drainage treatment while t25 had significantly larger concentrations of fe in the straw compared to t10 fig 5c the free drainage treatment had a significantly lower straw k concentration compared to the t10 t20 and t25 treatments fig 5d between which the concentrations did not differ significantly cultivar also affected the concentrations of nutrients in the straw but only through interactions fig 5 unfortunately we were unable to tell the cd treatments apart for the ca mg and p concentrations in straw for the mn concentration in the straw bm t20 had a significantly lower concentration compared to bg t20 and sub with free drainage but for all other cd levels no significant differences occurred cd did have some significant effects on the uptake of nutrients though cultivar was the most important factor fig 6 bm tended to have the highest nutrient uptake whilst bg tended to have the lowest nutrient uptakes fig 6 generally there appeared to be a positive correlation among total dry biomass and nutrient uptake especially so for fe k mg and p fig 6c d e g 4 discussion previous studies have shown that wheat grown in partially waterlogged soils drainage depth 10 cm can experience decreased pn values for instance malik et al 2001 found that five days of complete or partial wl decreased pn in the third leaf to 0 however in the present study cd tended to not affect pn except on 10 april where free drainage and t10 had significantly lower pn values than t25 the different effect of pn in malik et al 2001 to the present experiment could be related to the difference in temperature our experiment took place during winter where the average daily temperatures ranged between 0 1 to 5 9 c while the average day night temperature in malik et al 2001 was 20 15 c studies have shown that the effects of wl increase with temperature herzog et al 2016 musgrave 1994 as higher temperatures decrease the solubility of o2 and increase the biological demand for oxygen schlesinger 1996 hence partial waterlogging with a drainage depth of 10 cm might not have any significant effect on its own but in combination with high temperatures it can have significant effects on wheat growth the temperatures registered at foulum from january to april 2016 during the experiment fell within the danish climate norms for the twelve year period 2006 2017 for this period the lowest average temperature of 3 4 c was recorded during january and the highest average temperature of 9 9 c in april dmi 2017a 2018 corresponding to the lowest and highest average temperatures for our experiment table 2 this indicates that our registered temperatures fall within the norm for winter temperatures in denmark and thus the risk of high temperatures during the treatment period is only an issue if cd is applied in early autumn when average temperatures can be as high as 16 2 c in september dmi 2017b although t10 did not have the lowest pn it tended to have the lowest average fv fm on five out of seven days while fv fm tended to be highest in the free drainage treatment fig 3 smethurst et al 2005 found that fv fm is a sensitive measure of waterlogging stress and our results could therefore indicate a tendency for plants in t10 to be more stressed than those of the free drainage treatment although there was no significant difference cd during the early growth stages did not have any effect on the grain or the straw yield in our experiment table 5 this is in line with other cd experiments in denmark where raising the water level to 70 cm above the natural drainage depth of 110 cm had no impact on the yield of winter wheat carstensen et al 2016 however other experiments in denmark have shown that grain yield increased by 0 25 t ha 1 when lowering the drainage depth from 80 to 115 cm hansen and karl 1969 contradicting our findings however in hansen and karl 1969 the drainage depth was lowered throughout the year and partially waterlogged soil may be more critical during the later phenological stages where redistribution of n and carbohydrates for grain formation occurs jiang et al 2008 kaur et al 2017 while there was no significant effect of cd on grain or straw yields the cultivar had a significant effect on both table 5 this is consistent with dickin et al 2009 who found different cultivar behaviors depends on the climate conditions the grain and straw yields obtained with the bg cultivar were significantly lower than those of both bm and sub table 4 this might be related to the lower pn observed for bg fig 3a d although not significantly different still low yields have been linked to decreased pn values in plants stressed by wl de san celedonio et al 2016 jiang et al 2008 additionally musgrave 1994 showed that assimilation rate and grain yield of eight different winter wheat cultivars exposed to wl were positively correlated over three years but with different degrees of correlation depending on cultivar and with no interactions between treatment and cultivar hence choice of cultivar can result in significant differences in yield due to the difference in pn neither cd nor cultivar had any effect on grain n concentration but cultivar did affect the concentration of n in the straw tables 4 and 5 this indicated a difference in the relocation of n in the plant as bg had a significantly higher n concentration in the straw than the other cultivars but a similar n concentration in the grains resulting in the lowest nhi which was significantly different from that of bm table 4 in other experiments lower n concentrations in leaves have been observed in both partially and completely waterlogged wheat plants herzog et al 2016 malik et al 2001 but since we did not collect plant samples during the cd treatment we were not able to determine whether such a drop occurred however it is clear that cd had no long term effect on the n concentration or uptake in any of the cultivars table 4 besides malik et al 2001 showed that wheat experiencing partial or complete wl during the early phenological stages is capable of recovering where a compensatory n uptake meant that cd had no effect on the final n concentration and uptake at harvest the higher grain n uptake in bm compared to bg table 4 was probably caused by the significant difference in biomass accumulation for the grain since there was no significant difference between grain n concentrations table 5 hence the higher biomass accumulation likely caused by a higher pn affected not only the straw and grain yield but also the translocation of n to the grains also the macro and micronutrients were mainly affected by the cultivar as was the case for almost all parameters however several nutrients such as fe cu and p were also affected by cd or interaction between cd and cultivar fig 4 and 5 the highest concentration of the macro and micro nutrients was always found in either the free drainage treatment or t10 as e g fe where the highest concentration was found in the free drainage treatment however fe has previously been reported to increase in wl plants khabaz saberi et al 2007 stieger and feller 1994 because of the higher solubility of its reduced form additionally khabaz saberi et al 2007 found an increase in fe only in plants grown on acid soils while it remained the same or could even be decreased in wl plants grown in neutral soil conditions this is likely caused by the decrease of fe 2 in soils when ph increases even when the redox potential is below 0 2 v and anoxic conditions are present schlesinger 1996 also setter et al 2009 concluded that local soil conditions determine the fate of micronutrients in soil and crops exposed to wl thus the same might be the case for cd where the soil is partially waterlogged indicating the need to measure the local soil ph which determines whether redox sensitive nutrients can be expected to increase in plants grown under partially waterlogged conditions cd affected the concentration of the nutrients more than it did the uptake figs 4 6 hence the total uptake of nutrients was more likely to be determined by the biomass of the plants than the differences in the concentrations as we also found for the n uptake in the straw the impact of the relationship between biomass and concentration on the uptake was partially visible when looking at bg and bm where bg generally had the highest nutrient concentrations but the lowest uptakes figs 4 6 which were caused by a significantly lower biomass accumulation table 4 while the opposite was true for bm 5 perspective while our results are promising for the application of cd in denmark we have identified some areas that would need to be investigated further before cd can be applied we therefore suggest that further research concentrates on whether drainage dephts shallower than 10 cm will induce significant plant stress as t10 tended to have the lowest fv fm values additionally our research raises the question of whether longer periods with cd could cause significant plant stress as the application of cd is supposed to start in early autumn and last until the early spring to mitigate n loss under danish conditions carstensen et al 2016 prolonging the cd period might inflict more permanent damage on plant growth we also find that there is a need to test whether higher temperatures during the early autumn compared to our experiment might cause pn to decrease when combined with the high water levels as in malik et al 2001 as this could reduce crop growth finally we believe that it will be necessary to examine how long shallow drainage depth can be maintained without affecting the accessibility to the fields as heavy machinery on wet soils might cause soil compaction munkholm 2011 for plant growth we find that it is worth considering whether annual repetition of the experiment could impact the yield outputs since specific climate conditions favour the growth of cultivars differently li et al 2016 thus annual repetitions of the experiment might change the perception of which cultivars would be the most effective under cd conditions in denmark additionally due to limited research related to the effect of cd on plant growth we have not been able to find any literature exploring how cd affects nutrient solubility or uptake in plants there is obviously a need for further investigations into the relation between cd and plant nutrient uptake as tolerant cultivars have been found to experience a smaller increase in mn and fe under wl conditions khabaz saberi et al 2012 thus the three cultivars bg bm and sub might have been wl tolerant cultivars as cd had only limited effect on all of the measured parameters 6 conclusion controlled drainage did not introduce wl stress when applied during winter in denmark since shallow drainage depths did not lower n concentration or n uptake in the plants nor did it tend to decrease pn or cause lower yields although we did not observe any significant effect of cd on yields t10 tended to have the lowest fv fm indicating that shallow drainage depths did cause more stress than deeper drainage though the difference in stress levels was not significant however to confirm that cd do not influence plant growth repetition of studies on the impact of cd on plant growth is essential the cultivars bg bm and sub were significantly different from each other and we ruled out that the difference was due to wl sensitivity but more likely was caused by genetic differences which was expressed due to the weather conditions acknowledgments this research was supported by grants from the sino danish center sdc in denmark and china as a part of a phd project and the danish gudp sponsored project 3405 11 0385 kontrolleret dr√¶ning som virkemiddel til reduction af kv√¶lstofudledningen

11108,biodegradable film is considered as a promising alternative to polyethylene film in rainfed farming of arid and semi arid regions since the widespread use of polyethylene film has led to many negative effects such as environmental pollution and land degeneration in order to identify an optimal biodegradable film for summer maize field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of biodegradable films with different degradation rates on soil water storage sws soil temperature soil organic carbon soc the growth stages grain yield water use efficiency wue and economic return over three growing seasons from 2014 to 2016 three biodegradable films one with a fast degradation rate b1 one with a moderate degradation rate b2 and one with a slow degradation rate b3 were compared with a polyethylene film p and a flat planting system without film mulching was used as the control ck the degradation progress of the three types of biodegradable film b1 b2 and b3 was on time or delayed by about 10 days during normal years 2014 and 2015 seasons and advanced by 10 20 days during the extreme year 2016 season plants affected by both lodging and high temperature soil temperature and sws increased significantly under b1 3 6 c higher at 5 cm and 2 4 c higher at 25 cm and b2 3 7 c higher at 5 cm and 2 3 c higher at 25 cm compared with ck before the biodegradable film degraded however there was no difference in soil temperature and sws after the biodegradable films b1 and b2 had degraded the b3 and p treatments led to similar soil temperatures and sws values throughout the maize seasons after 3 years of experiments the soc levels ranked from high to low were 2 85 5 30 11 72 and 15 07 higher in ck than that in b1 b2 b3 and p respectively the season length was the longest

in b1 b3 p and ck respectively the results suggested that biodegradable film with a moderate degradation rate could improve the soil environment promote maize growth increase net revenue and reduce loss of soc relative to b1 b3 no significant difference with b1 in soc level and p therefore b2 was the best biodegradable film for summer maize production in regions with sub humid drought prone climates keywords biodegradable film soil temperature soil water storage yield water use efficiency 1 introduction mulching with polyethylene film has many benefits such as reducing water evaporation modifying soil temperature inhibiting weeds elmore 1990 yin et al 2018 reducing time to harvest controlling nutrient leaching nawaz et al 2017 and improving crop productivity cuello et al 2015 saglam et al 2017 polyethylene film in combination with ridge furrow planting is also used to harvest and conserve rainwater zhou et al 2012 mulching with polyethylene film has become an important agricultural practice in china since its introduction in 1978 especially in regions where the irrigation is limited and the temperature is low zhou et al 2009 filipovic et al 2016 it is well known that the typical application time for polyethylene film mulches in each growing season during agricultural production is only for a few months however the setting and disposal processes for polyethylene films are expensive and time consuming adhikari et al 2016 as a result most of the polyethylene film remaining on the fields are burned by farmers without proper controls moreno and moreno 2008 inappropriate disposal and the increase in polyethylene film use over the years has generated large amounts of mulch residue and has caused serious soil and environmental issues called white pollution briassoulis 2006 scarascia mugnozza et al 2006 ren et al 2017 the large amount of residual films on farmland can lead to soil structure deterioration and reduce soil porosity and permeability dong et al 2013 nawaz et al 2017 it can also influence root development and inhibit the absorption of water and nutrients which decreases agricultural productivity and leads to unsustainable agro ecosystems yan et al 2006 furthermore the modified microclimate under polyethylene film mulches increases the biological degradation of soil organic carbon soc which has recently been identified as triggering the rapid depletion of soil nutrients and carbon stocks steinmetz et al 2016 at present the most effective solution for mitigating or eliminating these problems could be to replace traditional polyethylene with biodegradable film moreno and moreno 2008 biodegradable film is basically composed of polysaccharides with low permeabilities and harmless decomposition products mainly water and carbon dioxide scarascia mugnozza et al 2006 vox and schettini 2007 this means they can be incorporated directly into the soil after harvest and are biodegraded by soil microorganisms scarascia mugnozza et al 2004 additionally biodegradable film can be made to degrade at a known rate kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 to date studies on the mulching effects of biodegradable film have investigated a variety of crops in multiple locations bilck et al 2010 braunack et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 the application of biodegradable film has had functional such as improving farmland microclimate and agronomic such as promoting crop growth positive effects in northern china biodegradable film made by shaanxi huayu gaoke biotechnology co ltd mulching has significantly increased soil temperature and moisture accelerated the growth process and has increased maize yields compared to bare soil furthermore the differences between polyethylene film and biodegradable film are non significant zhang et al 2010 shen et al 2011 in central spain biodegradable films green and 0 025 mm thick brown and 0 018 mm thick black and 0 020 mm thick and black and 0 016 mm thick undergo early decomposition but in general they remain functional during use and do not affect tomato yield and fruit quality moreno and moreno 2008 in brazil biodegradable film made of poly butylene adipate co terephthalate provides efficient mulching for strawberry production because it produces fruit that have a similar weight and quality to polyethylene film bilck et al 2010 in central china using biodegradable film ecovio f mulch badische anilin und soda fabrik basf germany instead of polyethylene film allows fertilizers to be applied as a split application in rice production which increases rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency and significantly reduces environmental pollution zhang et al 2017a however there are also some negative effects caused by biodegradable film mulching the performance of biodegradable film mulching is poor compared to polyethylene film in increasing soil temperature conserving moisture and improving yield wang et al 2011 kader et al 2017 therefore the application effect of biodegradable film mulching needs to be further improved he et al 2011 li et al 2011 the degradation behavior of biodegradable film varies greatly and this variation is caused by different environmental conditions crop varieties field management systems and the materials used costa et al 2014 li et al 2014 this means that the economic benefits are not clear in all cases yin et al 2017 previous studies mainly focused on comparing the effects of biodegradable film mulching and polyethylene film mulching on soil moisture soil temperature crop growth and productivity and the degradation performance of biodegradable film with different composition materials martin closas et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 siegenthaler et al 2011 however few studies sun et al 2019 have investigated the degradation rate a vital property of biodegradable film using a biodegradable film with a reasonable degradation rate may expect to optimize the soil hydrothermal environment for crop growth and help maximize the mulching effect however it is not clear whether the biodegradable film mulching effects are due to differences in the degradation rate or whether biodegradable film with a suitable degradation rate can match or even exceed the mulching effect of polyethylene film the objectives of this study were to 1 study possible differences between biodegradable mulching films with different degradation rates and polythene mulching film on the soil environment and maize growth and 2 identify an appropriate degradation rate for biodegradable film in summer maize production that maximizes the mulching effect and maintains soc 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a 3 year field experiment was performed from june 2014 to october 2016 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas of the ministry of education northwest a f university yangling 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 m a s l shaanxi china the region is characterized by having a typical sub humid drought prone climate with a mean annual precipitation of 632 mm nearly 60 occurs in july to september average annual temperature of 13 c and annual frost free period of 210 d the soil at the experimental field is a medium loam with an average bulk density of 1 40 g cm3 water content at field capacity of 24 and permanent wilting point of 8 5 in the upper 0 200 cm soil profile before sowing the summer maize in 2014 soil samples 0 30 cm soil layer were randomly collected to analyze nutrient properties table 1 an automatic weather station installed at the experimental site provided the meteorological data including air temperature and rainfall throughout maize seasons 2 2 experimental design luodan 9 a major summer maize cultivar in the region was used for the three maize growing seasons five treatments same treatment in the same position in each experimental year with three replicates were arranged in a completely randomized design a ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system was adopted except for the ck treatment the ridges were covered with the different films using new films in each season and the furrows were planted with maize fig 1 the widths of the ridges and furrows were both 60 cm and the ridge heights were 25 cm the maize was sown on the internal sides of the furrows near the ridges with 30 cm between each plant in the row the mulching films over the ridges were a biodegradable film with a fast degradation rate b1 made of corn starch polycaprolactone masterbatch in a 30 62 8 ratio a biodegradable film with a moderate degradation rate b2 made of corn starch polycaprolactone masterbatch in a 30 65 5 ratio a biodegradable film with a slow degradation rate b3 made of corn starch polycaprolactone masterbatch in a 30 67 3 ratio and a polyethylene film p non degrading a conventional flat planting system without film mulching was used as the control ck both of the 3 biodegradable films manufactured by shandong tianzhuang environmental protection technology co ltd and the polyethylene film made by yangling ruifeng environmental protection technology co ltd were transparent 100 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick the plot 6 4 m was separated by a 1 m wide gap and the polyethylene film using new films in each season was inserted 1 m deep into soil in the middle of the gap to prevent the lateral diffusion of water no artificial removing the film was applied to the three biodegradable film mulching treatments throughout the maize growing seasons 2 3 field management in accordance with local practice 120 kg n ha of urea 40 applied as a basic fertilizer and 60 top dressed at the jointing stage 120 kg p2o5 ha of superphosphate and 60 kg k2o ha of potassium sulfate were evenly spread on the soil surface and ploughed into the soil the ridges and furrows in the four mulching treatments were then formed and the films were laid tightly against ridge surfaces with soil covering the two edges one day before sowing each plot was irrigated between maize rows with 35 mm water at the jointing stage in both 2014 27 july and 2015 30 july and at the tasseling stage in 2016 18 august due to the limited precipitation and high air temperature irrigation water was applied using plastic pipes and measured with a flow meter installed in the pipelines the middle jointing stage in the 2016 season was affected by storms and strong winds which led to the maize plants lodging 45 between the ground and plant twice within 3 days therefore various practices such as earthing and straightening were adopted to make the plants stand upright plots were regularly hand weeded until canopy closure prevented weed growth diseases and insects were controlled to avoid yield loss during the three seasons maize was sown in the middle june and harvested in the early october of the same year 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 biodegradability the degradation of the exposed mulching films in the field was evaluated every 10 days after sowing das throughout the maize growing seasons using a qualitative scale hu et al 2015 the grades ranged from 0 to 5 0 represents the film practically intact 1 represents the film beginning to crack 2 represents 25 of the film showing tiny cracks 3 represents film with cracks that were 2 0 2 5 cm length 4 represents film with uniform mesh cracks and no large intact areas of film and 5 represents the film breaking down into fragments that were smaller than 4 4 cm2 2 4 2 soil water storage sws soil water content to a depth of 200 cm was determined before sowing and after harvesting for calculating changes of sws in soil profiles throughout the growing season the water content to a depth of 100 cm 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm layers was measured at 20 day intervals after sowing to observe the dynamics of sws during the growing season the soil was sampled at 10 cm intervals by manual coring at base of mulch and the gravimetric water content of the soil samples was calculated on the basis of oven dried weights ren et al 2017 the sws mm was calculated by 1 s w s i 1 n h i œÅ i b i 10 where hi cm is soil depth œÅi g cm3 is the soil bulk density in each layer bi is soil water content by weight n is the number of soil layers 2 4 3 soil temperature soil temperature at depths of 5 cm and 25 cm was periodically taken using thermometers at 10 day intervals recorded every two hours from 08 00 to 18 00 after sowing maize the measured place was in the middle of a ridge in the middle of a row for ck for each plot and was always at the same point 2 4 4 soil organic carbon soc the soil between 0 and 30 cm depth was sampled at 10 cm intervals the samples treated separately were taken from both the ridges and furrows for ck the soil sample was collected on two adjacent flats in each plot after harvest in 2016 the soc was measured using the tiurin method by oxidizing in potassium dichromate siwek et al 2015 2 4 5 growth stages the date on which 70 of the plants in each plot showed the main characteristics of a particular growth stage was used to demarcate their entry into that growth stage 2 4 6 yield evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue an area of 1 m2 1 m 1 m in the center of each plot was harvested manually and threshed by a hand driven thresher to determine grain yield at water content of 14 and yield components including spike length ear diameter grains per ear and 100 kernel weight et mm was calculated using the soil water balance equation 2 e t p i c w 0 w 1 r d where p mm is precipitation i mm is the amount of irrigation c mm is the groundwater supply w 0 and w 1 are swss before sowing and after harvesting both at 0 200 cm respectively r mm is surface runoff and d mm is the downward drainage out of root zone the groundwater table at the experimental site is located 5 m below the ground surface and the field was flat and no heavy rain fell during maize growing seasons so c r and d were assumed to be negligible therefore the reduced equation is as follows 3 e t p i w 0 w 1 wue kg ha mm was defined as 4 w u e y e t where y kg ha is the yield of summer maize 2 4 7 economic analysis an economic analysis of maize production was performed after harvest total revenue tr yuan ha was calculated as sime et al 2015 5 t r y p where p yuan kg is the price of summer maize the maize price was 2 16 2 04 and 2 41 yuan kg for the 2014 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively net return nr yuan ha was calculated as lu and liao 2017 6 n r t r t c where tc yuan ha includes input cost and labor cost 2 5 statistical analysis all data are reported in terms of mean value of the three replicates the sas statistics analysis system package version 9 3 sas institute 2011 was used to conduct analyses of variance anova and least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 was used to compare mean differences between treatments figures were made using origin 9 0 and autocad 2007 3 results 3 1 climatic conditions the daily rainfall distributions and the average air temperatures during the three maize growing seasons are shown in fig 2 total rainfall over the whole growing period was 355 3 mm for 2014 283 9 mm for 2015 and 299 0 mm for 2016 however the rainfall distribution was more suitable for maize growth in 2015 and 2016 both evenly distributed during maize growing season than it was in 2014 mainly distributed in the later stages of maize growth daily average air temperatures from maximum to minimum was 14 3 32 3 c in 2014 10 3 31 3 c in 2015 and 16 5 31 0 c in 2016 followed the same trend in the three experimental seasons which was to first increase and then decrease over time throughout the maize season the average air temperature in 2016 was 1 84 c and 2 31 c higher than in 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 2 biodegradability the degradation performances of the three biodegradable films were similar in all three seasons table 2 the b1 film showed the first signs of degradation at 20 30 das and experienced further deterioration achieved a grade 5 degradation rating at 90 100 das each year over the 3 years the degradation of b2 started at 50 60 das and reached the grade 4 degradation stage after 120 days the b3 film started to degrade at 100 das in 2014 90 das in 2015 and 70 das in 2016 but remained relatively intact until the maize harvest additionally the polyethylene film had cracks during the later growth stages these were mainly caused by mechanical pulling and human activities during the production process which are considered to be normal wear and tear 3 3 soil environment 3 3 1 sws the sws levels in the 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm soil layers fluctuated over the three maize seasons table 3 the differences in sws among treatments were much larger in the 0 30 cm soil layer than in the 30 100 cm layer and were increased at first but then decreased over time at 20 das the sws levels in the b1 b2 b3 and p treatments were significantly higher than in ck with an average increase of 7 8 mm and 15 5 mm in the 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm soil layers respectively over the 3 years however there were no significant differences between the b1 b2 and b3 treatments and p the b1 film only started to break up by 40 das its sws levels were still higher than ck but the differences were not significant except for the 0 30 cm soil layer in 2014 at 60 das the sws levels in b2 were slightly lower than in b3 and p but were significantly higher than in b1 and ck the differences in sws between b3 and p were not significant throughout the growing seasons the average sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer for the three seasons in b1 b2 and b3 increased by 7 5 mm 12 8 mm and 19 4 mm respectively when compared to ck and decreased by 14 6 mm 9 2 mm and 2 7 mm respectively when compared to p 3 3 2 soil temperature the daily mean soil temperature at depths of 5 and 25 cm varied significantly during the three growing seasons table 4 overall the daily average soil temperature dynamics among treatments showed a decreasing trend and the differences became smaller as the maize season progressed especially during the later growth stages at the depth of 5 cm the daily average soil temperature among treatments ranged from 21 8 c to 37 9 c in 2014 from 18 1 c to 36 5 c in 2015 and from 19 2 c to 38 2 c in 2016 with the highest and lowest values occurring in p no significant difference with b3 and ck respectively during the observation periods in 2014 and 2015 seasons the daily average soil temperatures in b1 b2 and b3 were significantly higher than in ck but were not significantly different from p before 30 das the temperature improving effects of b1 and b2 began to decrease at 40 das and 60 das respectively as the canopy coverage increased and the biodegradable film deteriorated in 2016 season the daily average soil temperatures in b1 and b2 began to significantly lower than in p at 30 das and 50 das respectively since the degradation progress of the biodegradable film was advanced in this season over the three maize seasons the daily mean soil temperatures in b1 and b2 were on average 3 6 c and 3 7 c higher than in ck respectively before the biodegradable film begins to degrade and 2 0 c and 1 3 c lower than in p respectively after the biodegradable film begins to degrade the ranking for average daily soil temperature at 25 cm depth under each treatment followed the same trend as found for the 5 cm depth however the variation 18 0 31 7 c in 2014 16 3 32 4 c in 2015 17 2 33 8 c in 2016 of soil temperature among treatments at 25 cm was lower than 5 cm depth the daily mean soil temperatures in b1 and b2 were on average 2 4 c and 2 3 c higher than in ck respectively before the biodegradable film begins to degrade and 1 5 c and 1 0 c lower than in p respectively after the biodegradable film begins to degrade during the three maize seasons 3 3 3 soc by october 2016 after the maize harvest representing after 3 years of experiments the soc content in the top 30 cm soil layer significantly decreased in b2 b3 and p relative to that in june 2014 the beginning of the experiment 11 18 g kg the soc level was 2 85 5 30 11 72 and 15 07 higher for ck than in b1 b2 b3 and p respectively fig 3 3 4 maize growth 3 4 1 growth stages the biodegradable film b1 gradually degraded after the jointing stage had been reached reducing the mulching effect the b1 plants reached the tasseling and filling stages at almost the same time as the ck plants table 5 the time needed to reach the tasseling stage in b2 was 5 5 and 4 days longer than for p in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the growth stage progress under the b3 treatment was similar to p and showed a certain degree of premature aging under the combined effect of high air temperature and mulching time taken for the maize to mature was the longest in b2 over all three seasons which was 3 5 8 9 8 9 and 3 4 days longer than that of b1 b3 p and ck respectively 3 4 2 yield the effects of the different biodegradable film mulches on the yield components of spike length ear diameter grains per ear 100 kernel weight and grain yield were consistent across the three growing seasons table 6 the yield components were significantly higher in b1 b2 and b3 than in ck with an average increase of 8 58 7 04 11 71 and 8 18 in spike length ear diameter grains per spike and 100 kernel weight respectively and did not differ significantly between b3 and p for all three seasons the b2 treatment consistently produced the highest grain yield over the three years the grain yield in b2 compared to p and ck increased by 1037 kg ha and 2526 kg ha for 2014 1162 kg ha and 2495 kg ha for 2015 822 kg ha and 2203 kg ha for 2016 respectively in addition the yield components and grain yields for the five treatments b1 b2 b3 p and ck were higher in 2014 and 2015 than in 2016 possibly due to the two lodging events in 2016 3 4 3 et and wue the et and wue were significantly affected when the different biodegradable films were used to mulch the plants fig 4 the et was the lowest in b3 and p and highest in ck over the three growing seasons the b2 treatment had a markedly higher et than p in 2015 but did not differ significantly from p in 2014 and 2016 compared to ck et in b1 b2 and b3 was reduced by 6 9 mm 27 0 mm and 40 2 mm respectively in 2014 by 16 3 mm 29 8 mm and 42 4 mm respectively in 2015 and by 15 1 mm 32 7 mm and 50 3 mm respectively in 2016 the wue among treatments varied from 21 96 kg ha mm in ck to 31 87 kg ha mm in b2 for 2014 from 24 52 kg ha mm in ck to 35 27 kg ha mm in b2 for 2015 and from 20 71 kg ha mm in ck to 30 72 kg ha mm in b2 for 2016 but it did not differ significantly between b3 and p the 3 year average wue in b2 increased by 6 54 kg ha mm 2 02 kg ha mm 2 08 kg ha mm and 10 22 kg ha mm compared to b1 b3 p and ck respectively the wues for all the treatments were higher in 2014 and 2015 than in 2016 which was similar to the grain yields 3 5 economic analysis the economic parameters of summer maize under the five treatments were evaluated in the three growing seasons table 7 in general input cost decreased with ck compared with other mulching treatments as follow ck p b1 b2 and b3 the input cost under b1 b2 b3 p and ck accounted for 29 7 25 6 28 2 25 3 and 26 3 of the total revenue respectively however labor cost increased with p as follow p b1 b2 and b3 ck the labor cost under b1 b2 b3 p and ck accounted for 13 5 11 6 12 8 14 4 and 15 0 of the total revenue respectively the net revenue among treatments ranged from 9524 to 13 608 yuan ha in 2014 from 9796 to 13 513 yuan ha in 2015 and from 9281 to 13 218 yuan ha in 2016 with the highest value obtained in b2 and the lowest value recorded in ck during the three seasons 4 discussions 4 1 degradation of the biodegradable films there are various methods to determine the degradation rate of a biodegradable film including visual inspection mechanical testing differential scanning calorimetry qualitative surface analysis and material weight loss in this study visual inspection using a qualitative scale ranging from 0 to 5 was used to describe the degradation process affected by different climatic conditions the three kinds of biodegradable film were degraded either in advance or on time or postponed in the three seasons however p and b3 were stable until the end of the maize season although there were some small cracks these results were similar to the findings by moreno and moreno 2008 in a summer maize experiment wu et al 2002 found that the degradation progress of biodegradable films with a degradation rate of 45 days and 60 days was delayed by 5 10 days and the biodegradable film with a degradation rate of 90 days did not degrade throughout the growing season moreover the degree of degradation differs depending on the laying position for the same biodegradable film in a cotton experiment he et al 2011 stated that three biodegradable films starch based with different composition materials deteriorated faster in hebei province than in xinjiang autonomous region these studies further confirm the complexity and variability of the biodegradable film degradation process at the same time this suggests that the control of biodegradable film degradation needs to be further improved especially for specific climatic conditions and crop species in the present study during normal years 2014 and 2015 seasons the biodegradable films degraded on time or were delayed by about 10 days however during the extreme year 2016 season plants affected by both lodging and high temperature film degradation was advanced by 10 20 days 4 2 soil environment film mulching improves farmland ecological microclimates and the plant growth environment by coordinating soil water fertilizer gas and heat sreedevi et al 2017 li et al 2018 many studies have indicated that both biodegradable film mulching and polyethylene film mulching can greatly increase sws especially during the early crop stages and in the top soil layer braunack et al 2015 yin et al 2016a in this experiment sws did not differ significantly among b1 b2 b3 and p before the biodegradable film degraded at 20 das after degradation less water directed to plant line meant that the less swss of b1 and b2 compared to p the differences in sws among treatments were increased at first and then decreased over time a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the water conservation effect of film mulching is better before degradation and gradually decreases until disappear after degradation in addition the sws capacities in b3 and p both did not degrade to the same extent as the other films were not significantly different over the three growing seasons although the film slit was prior in b3 than in p this agrees with observations previously reported by braunack et al 2015 there are two possible reasons for this firstly in the middle and later maize growth stages the full crop canopy reduces the water loss by soil evaporation secondly the increased precipitation in the later period could have weakened the moisture conservation effect of film mulching and alleviated the contradiction between soil moisture supply and demand in contrast wang et al 2003 reported the opposite finding their results suggested that the water conserving effect of biodegradable film 20 of starch and 80 of polyethylene was better during the middle maize growth stage but there were no obvious improvements in the early and later stages this may be due to the fluctuation in precipitation and its distribution over the crop growing season adequate precipitation and distribution during crop growth periods may mask any mulching benefits furthermore the differences in degradation rates and the film composition materials may lead to different moisture conservation effects soil water balance is vital for the sustainability of agroecosystems many studies have shown that an increased grain yield under film mulching is associated with soil water depletion in the deeper 100 cm soil layers liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 which suggests film mulching cultivation might not be sustainable in the long term however liu et al 2014 indicated that soil water balance was maintained in the 0 200 cm soil layer when the annual precipitation was 273 mm under ridge furrow and polyethylene film mulching in our study after three years the swss in the 0 200 cm soil layer of all treatments increased when compared to its values before maize sowing in june 2014 data not shown more rainfall directed into plant line for b3 and p thus they had much higher sws than did b1 b2 and ck at harvest in october 2016 the differences among studies in soil moisture conditions with film mulching may be related to the rainfall amount during crop growing seasons and the placement of film mulching over ridges low temperature is another major factor limiting agricultural productivity a suitable soil temperature accelerates plant growth maintains root activity and increases crop yield sarkar et al 2007 yin et al 2015a the summer maize growing season coincides with the period in a year when the temperature is relatively high during the early growth stages the air temperature is lower than the suitable growth temperature of summer maize therefore the higher topsoil temperature under film mulching improves seedling emergence and establishment however the air temperature is higher than the suitable growth temperature of summer maize during the middle and later stages therefore the higher temperature under film mulching during the middle and later growth stages can be a disadvantage since the air temperature is also high in this study ck showed decreased soil temperature compared to b1 b2 and b3 before they degradation this is due to the good transparency and poor permeability of the film yin et al 2015b film mulching can effectively store solar radiation prevent the soil heat from being lost in the form of long wave radiation and reduce the loss of evaporation heat by soil moisture b1 b2 b3 and p generally increased the soil temperature during the early growth stages but the soil temperatures of b1 and b2 behaved in a similar way to bare soil after the films had degraded the thermal effect of b3 and p extended to the end of maize seasons similar results were observed by gu et al 2017 for winter oilseed rape in china and by moreno and moreno 2008 for tomato in spain the growth process results table 5 showed that b2 could bring forward the tasseling stage furthermore the filling stage and maturity stage duration were longer than in b3 and p prolonging the growth cycle especially the reproductive growth cycle promotes the assimilation conversion from vegetative organs to reproductive organs which contributes to increase yield and water and fertilizer use efficiency li et al 1999 yin et al 2015a considering the maize yield wue and net revenue we found that the soil temperature in b2 was ideal for maize growth these results imply the importance of reducing the soil temperature during later crop stages under biodegradable film mulching soc a major indicator of agricultural ecosystem sustainability is the result of the long term net balance between the loss and accumulation of organic carbon in the soil zhang et al 2017b and can be greatly influenced by polyethylene film mulching davidson and janssens 2006 li et al 2007 in this study ck flat sample and p ridge furrow sample had the highest and lowest soc respectively after applying the treatments for 3 years these findings were consistent with zhang et al 2015 who found that the increased soil temperature and a decreased c n ratio under polyethylene film mulching induced significant soc losses and were supported by tian et al 2013 who reported that a mulched soil used to grow rice and wheat contained 40 50 more dissolved organic carbon than uncovered soil after a study that lasted for 10 years these results indicated that polyethylene film mulching may not be a long term solution for improving agricultural productivity while maintaining soil quality in contrast yin et al 2016b reported that double mulching with polyethylene film and crop straw helps to maintain or increase soc wang et al 2016 in a six year study of continuous growth of maize under polyethylene film mulch confirmed that the total soc stocks in the upper 0 15 m of soil were similar in the mulched and non mulched soils applying a process based biogeochemical model zhang et al 2017a found that if 5 of crop residues are returned to the soil polyethylene film mulching has no significant impact on the overall average content of soc across the loess plateau of china compared to the fields without mulching these studies proved that the soc mineralization stimulated by the increased soil temperature and moisture in the mulched treatments could be balanced by an increase in belowground carbon input to the soil relative to the non mulched treatments in addition b2 was better than b3 and p in keeping soc level this shows that the mulching film will increase the decomposition of soc at the later stage of crop growth therefore from a sustainable development point of view long term or whole season film mulching should not be advocated cai et al 2006 4 3 grain yield and wue crop yield and wue do not differ significantly between biodegradable film mulching and polyethylene film mulching which has been shown using various crops including maize shen et al 2011 wheat yin et al 2016a tomato moreno and moreno 2008 and winter rapeseed subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 this study confirmed the previous reports the b3 and p treatments produced non significant increases in grain yield and wue across all three seasons it is worth noting that the grain yield and wue in b2 were significantly higher than in b1 b3 and p this means that biodegradable films with the fast or slow degradation rates do not maximize the contribution to yield formation but a biodegradable film with an appropriate degradation rate such as b2 in this study can match or even exceed the yield increasing effect of polyethylene film li et al 2004 and zhao et al 2012 also demonstrated that polyethylene film mulching over the whole crop season appeared to be detrimental in the semiarid loess plateau of china and that film mulching for 60 days and 65 days increased the yield and wue for spring wheat and potato respectively additionally rainfall and its distribution during the maize growing season influence the effects of different biodegradable film mulching on yield and wue total rainfall was higher in 2014 compared to 2015 but rainfall distribution was more suitable for maize growth during 2015 than in 2014 fig 2 therefore the five treatments produced higher grain yields and wues in 2015 than in 2014 rainfall and its distribution during 2015 and 2016 were similar 2016 has great fall late compared to 2015 the grain yields of the five treatments were higher in 2015 than in 2016 because the maize plants lodged twice in 2016 and the ets were slightly higher in 2015 than that in 2016 however the extents of reduction in yields were large than the ets in 2016 relative to 2015 therefore the wues of the five treatments are lowest in 2016 4 4 economic response ridge furrow rainwater harvesting cultivation with film mulching can appreciably increase crop yield and produce greater economic benefit which has been proved by many studies li et al 2001 yin et al 2018 in this study input cost was higher with biodegradable film b1 b2 and b3 than with polyethylene film p since the price of the biodegradable film is higher than that of the polyethylene film labor costs between biodegradable film and polyethylene film however were just the opposite of input cost this is mainly due to the increasing labor demand for disposing residual film when using polyethylene film overall b2 treatment obtained the highest net revenue similar results were found by guo et al 2015 in tobacco cultivation and by wu et al 2017 in cotton cultivation this further confirms the feasibility of using a biodegradable film instead of a polyethylene film for agricultural production from the perspective of economic response 4 5 optimum degradation rate for biodegradable film the higher topsoil temperature and soil moisture in fields that have been completely covered with film mulches are related to higher soil respiration and soc mineralization which damages to the agro ecosystem wu et al 2002 li et al 2004 furthermore when the ground is film mulched for the whole growing period the high soil temperature and poor rhizosphere aeration during the later crop stages can accelerate the root system aging and root activity decreasing which limits water and nutrient transport and reduces crop yield and quality jiang et al 2013 film mulching the field for the entire maize growth period is not conducive to the precipitation infiltration during the later crop stages using biodegradable film with a reasonable degradation rate can effectively reduce the negative effects of polyethylene film mulching on the field environment and increase crop yield and wue siwek et al 2015 touchaleaume et al 2016 in this study b2 had a moderate degradation rate of about 60 days which meant that this treatment produced the highest maize yields yield components wue values and net revenue compared to b1 b3 and p over the three seasons it is known that summer maize is in the transitional period from vegetative growth to reproductive growth at about 60 das at this point the full establishment of plant canopy covers soil surface which causes a gradually weakened mulching effects of increasing temperature and conserving moisture at the same time timely degradation of biodegradable film improves precipitation permeability during the later growth stages therefore the degradation rate for biodegradable film should coincide with the time when the plant canopy reaches its maximum leaf area index the results from this study suggest that a biodegradable film with moderate degradation rate of about 60 days can reach the yield increasing and income increasing effects of polyethylene film and avoid the loss of soc for summer maize in sub humid drought prone climates and other regions with similar ecologies 5 conclusions the three types of biodegradable films b1 b2 and b3 degraded basically in accord with their degradation rates the soil temperature and sws in b1 and b2 were not significantly different from p before the biodegradable film degraded after the biodegradable film degraded soil temperature and sws significantly decreased in b1 and b2 compared to p however the differences in soil temperature and sws between b3 and p were not significantly different over the three maize seasons b2 reduced vegetative growth and prolonged reproductive growth which contributed to higher grain yield wue and net revenue compared to that in b1 b3 and p for all three seasons and avoided the over decomposition of soc that occurred in the p treatment the mulching effect and biodegradability results suggested that a moderate degradation rate of about 60 days was the most suitable degradation rate for biodegradable film when summer maize is grown in sub humid drought prone areas acknowledgments this study was financed by the state commission of agriculture of china 201503105 and 201503125 and the chinese national high

11108,biodegradable film is considered as a promising alternative to polyethylene film in rainfed farming of arid and semi arid regions since the widespread use of polyethylene film has led to many negative effects such as environmental pollution and land degeneration in order to identify an optimal biodegradable film for summer maize field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of biodegradable films with different degradation rates on soil water storage sws soil temperature soil organic carbon soc the growth stages grain yield water use efficiency wue and economic return over three growing seasons from 2014 to 2016 three biodegradable films one with a fast degradation rate b1 one with a moderate degradation rate b2 and one with a slow degradation rate b3 were compared with a polyethylene film p and a flat planting system without film mulching was used as the control ck the degradation progress of the three types of biodegradable film b1 b2 and b3 was on time or delayed by about 10 days during normal years 2014 and 2015 seasons and advanced by 10 20 days during the extreme year 2016 season plants affected by both lodging and high temperature soil temperature and sws increased significantly under b1 3 6 c higher at 5 cm and 2 4 c higher at 25 cm and b2 3 7 c higher at 5 cm and 2 3 c higher at 25 cm compared with ck before the biodegradable film degraded however there was no difference in soil temperature and sws after the biodegradable films b1 and b2 had degraded the b3 and p treatments led to similar soil temperatures and sws values throughout the maize seasons after 3 years of experiments the soc levels ranked from high to low were 2 85 5 30 11 72 and 15 07 higher in ck than that in b1 b2 b3 and p respectively the season length was the longest in b2 117 117 and 112 d for all three seasons average grain yield wue and net revenue in b2 were 18 40 25 10 and 32 97 11 90 6 62 and 20 46 11 43 6 82 and 15 71 and 32 50 45 64 and 41 05 higher than in b1 b3 p and ck respectively the results suggested that biodegradable film with a moderate degradation rate could improve the soil environment promote maize growth increase net revenue and reduce loss of soc relative to b1 b3 no significant difference with b1 in soc level and p therefore b2 was the best biodegradable film for summer maize production in regions with sub humid drought prone climates keywords biodegradable film soil temperature soil water storage yield water use efficiency 1 introduction mulching with polyethylene film has many benefits such as reducing water evaporation modifying soil temperature inhibiting weeds elmore 1990 yin et al 2018 reducing time to harvest controlling nutrient leaching nawaz et al 2017 and improving crop productivity cuello et al 2015 saglam et al 2017 polyethylene film in combination with ridge furrow planting is also used to harvest and conserve rainwater zhou et al 2012 mulching with polyethylene film has become an important agricultural practice in china since its introduction in 1978 especially in regions where the irrigation is limited and the temperature is low zhou et al 2009 filipovic et al 2016 it is well known that the typical application time for polyethylene film mulches in each growing season during agricultural production is only for a few months however the setting and disposal processes for polyethylene films are expensive and time consuming adhikari et al 2016 as a result most of the polyethylene film remaining on the fields are burned by farmers without proper controls moreno and moreno 2008 inappropriate disposal and the increase in polyethylene film use over the years has generated large amounts of mulch residue and has caused serious soil and environmental issues called white pollution briassoulis 2006 scarascia mugnozza et al 2006 ren et al 2017 the large amount of residual films on farmland can lead to soil structure deterioration and reduce soil porosity and permeability dong et al 2013 nawaz et al 2017 it can also influence root development and inhibit the absorption of water and nutrients which decreases agricultural productivity and leads to unsustainable agro ecosystems yan et al 2006 furthermore the modified microclimate under polyethylene film mulches increases the biological degradation of soil organic carbon soc which has recently been identified as triggering the rapid depletion of soil nutrients and carbon stocks steinmetz et al 2016 at present the most effective solution for mitigating or eliminating these problems could be to replace traditional polyethylene with biodegradable film moreno and moreno 2008 biodegradable film is basically composed of polysaccharides with low permeabilities and harmless decomposition products mainly water and carbon dioxide scarascia mugnozza et al 2006 vox and schettini 2007 this means they can be incorporated directly into the soil after harvest and are biodegraded by soil microorganisms scarascia mugnozza et al 2004 additionally biodegradable film can be made to degrade at a known rate kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 to date studies on the mulching effects of biodegradable film have investigated a variety of crops in multiple locations bilck et al 2010 braunack et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 the application of biodegradable film has had functional such as improving farmland microclimate and agronomic such as promoting crop growth positive effects in northern china biodegradable film made by shaanxi huayu gaoke biotechnology co ltd mulching has significantly increased soil temperature and moisture accelerated the growth process and has increased maize yields compared to bare soil furthermore the differences between polyethylene film and biodegradable film are non significant zhang et al 2010 shen et al 2011 in central spain biodegradable films green and 0 025 mm thick brown and 0 018 mm thick black and 0 020 mm thick and black and 0 016 mm thick undergo early decomposition but in general they remain functional during use and do not affect tomato yield and fruit quality moreno and moreno 2008 in brazil biodegradable film made of poly butylene adipate co terephthalate provides efficient mulching for strawberry production because it produces fruit that have a similar weight and quality to polyethylene film bilck et al 2010 in central china using biodegradable film ecovio f mulch badische anilin und soda fabrik basf germany instead of polyethylene film allows fertilizers to be applied as a split application in rice production which increases rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency and significantly reduces environmental pollution zhang et al 2017a however there are also some negative effects caused by biodegradable film mulching the performance of biodegradable film mulching is poor compared to polyethylene film in increasing soil temperature conserving moisture and improving yield wang et al 2011 kader et al 2017 therefore the application effect of biodegradable film mulching needs to be further improved he et al 2011 li et al 2011 the degradation behavior of biodegradable film varies greatly and this variation is caused by different environmental conditions crop varieties field management systems and the materials used costa et al 2014 li et al 2014 this means that the economic benefits are not clear in all cases yin et al 2017 previous studies mainly focused on comparing the effects of biodegradable film mulching and polyethylene film mulching on soil moisture soil temperature crop growth and productivity and the degradation performance of biodegradable film with different composition materials martin closas et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 siegenthaler et al 2011 however few studies sun et al 2019 have investigated the degradation rate a vital property of biodegradable film using a biodegradable film with a reasonable degradation rate may expect to optimize the soil hydrothermal environment for crop growth and help maximize the mulching effect however it is not clear whether the biodegradable film mulching effects are due to differences in the degradation rate or whether biodegradable film with a suitable degradation rate can match or even exceed the mulching effect of polyethylene film the objectives of this study were to 1 study possible differences between biodegradable mulching films with different degradation rates and polythene mulching film on the soil environment and maize growth and 2 identify an appropriate degradation rate for biodegradable film in summer maize production that maximizes the mulching effect and maintains soc 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a 3 year field experiment was performed from june 2014 to october 2016 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas of the ministry of education northwest a f university yangling 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 m a s l shaanxi china the region is characterized by having a typical sub humid drought prone climate with a mean annual precipitation of 632 mm nearly 60 occurs in july to september average annual temperature of 13 c and annual frost free period of 210 d the soil at the experimental field is a medium loam with an average bulk density of 1 40 g cm3 water content at field capacity of 24 and permanent wilting point of 8 5 in the upper 0 200 cm soil profile before sowing the summer maize in 2014 soil samples 0 30 cm soil layer were randomly collected to analyze nutrient properties table 1 an automatic weather station installed at the experimental site provided the meteorological data including air temperature and rainfall throughout maize seasons 2 2 experimental design luodan 9 a major summer maize cultivar in the region was used for the three maize growing seasons five treatments same treatment in the same position in each experimental year with three replicates were arranged in a completely randomized design a ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system was adopted except for the ck treatment the ridges were covered with the different films using new films in each season and the furrows were planted with maize fig 1 the widths of the ridges and furrows were both 60 cm and the ridge heights were 25 cm the maize was sown on the internal sides of the furrows near the ridges with 30 cm between each plant in the row the mulching films over the ridges were a biodegradable film with a fast degradation rate b1 made of corn starch polycaprolactone masterbatch in a 30 62 8 ratio a biodegradable film with a moderate degradation rate b2 made of corn starch polycaprolactone masterbatch in a 30 65 5 ratio a biodegradable film with a slow degradation rate b3 made of corn starch polycaprolactone masterbatch in a 30 67 3 ratio and a polyethylene film p non degrading a conventional flat planting system without film mulching was used as the control ck both of the 3 biodegradable films manufactured by shandong tianzhuang environmental protection technology co ltd and the polyethylene film made by yangling ruifeng environmental protection technology co ltd were transparent 100 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick the plot 6 4 m was separated by a 1 m wide gap and the polyethylene film using new films in each season was inserted 1 m deep into soil in the middle of the gap to prevent the lateral diffusion of water no artificial removing the film was applied to the three biodegradable film mulching treatments throughout the maize growing seasons 2 3 field management in accordance with local practice 120 kg n ha of urea 40 applied as a basic fertilizer and 60 top dressed at the jointing stage 120 kg p2o5 ha of superphosphate and 60 kg k2o ha of potassium sulfate were evenly spread on the soil surface and ploughed into the soil the ridges and furrows in the four mulching treatments were then formed and the films were laid tightly against ridge surfaces with soil covering the two edges one day before sowing each plot was irrigated between maize rows with 35 mm water at the jointing stage in both 2014 27 july and 2015 30 july and at the tasseling stage in 2016 18 august due to the limited precipitation and high air temperature irrigation water was applied using plastic pipes and measured with a flow meter installed in the pipelines the middle jointing stage in the 2016 season was affected by storms and strong winds which led to the maize plants lodging 45 between the ground and plant twice within 3 days therefore various practices such as earthing and straightening were adopted to make the plants stand upright plots were regularly hand weeded until canopy closure prevented weed growth diseases and insects were controlled to avoid yield loss during the three seasons maize was sown in the middle june and harvested in the early october of the same year 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 biodegradability the degradation of the exposed mulching films in the field was evaluated every 10 days after sowing das throughout the maize growing seasons using a qualitative scale hu et al 2015 the grades ranged from 0 to 5 0 represents the film practically intact 1 represents the film beginning to crack 2 represents 25 of the film showing tiny cracks 3 represents film with cracks that were 2 0 2 5 cm length 4 represents film with uniform mesh cracks and no large intact areas of film and 5 represents the film breaking down into fragments that were smaller than 4 4 cm2 2 4 2 soil water storage sws soil water content to a depth of 200 cm was determined before sowing and after harvesting for calculating changes of sws in soil profiles throughout the growing season the water content to a depth of 100 cm 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm layers was measured at 20 day intervals after sowing to observe the dynamics of sws during the growing season the soil was sampled at 10 cm intervals by manual coring at base of mulch and the gravimetric water content of the soil samples was calculated on the basis of oven dried weights ren et al 2017 the sws mm was calculated by 1 s w s i 1 n h i œÅ i b i 10 where hi cm is soil depth œÅi g cm3 is the soil bulk density in each layer bi is soil water content by weight n is the number of soil layers 2 4 3 soil temperature soil temperature at depths of 5 cm and 25 cm was periodically taken using thermometers at 10 day intervals recorded every two hours from 08 00 to 18 00 after sowing maize the measured place was in the middle of a ridge in the middle of a row for ck for each plot and was always at the same point 2 4 4 soil organic carbon soc the soil between 0 and 30 cm depth was sampled at 10 cm intervals the samples treated separately were taken from both the ridges and furrows for ck the soil sample was collected on two adjacent flats in each plot after harvest in 2016 the soc was measured using the tiurin method by oxidizing in potassium dichromate siwek et al 2015 2 4 5 growth stages the date on which 70 of the plants in each plot showed the main characteristics of a particular growth stage was used to demarcate their entry into that growth stage 2 4 6 yield evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue an area of 1 m2 1 m 1 m in the center of each plot was harvested manually and threshed by a hand driven thresher to determine grain yield at water content of 14 and yield components including spike length ear diameter grains per ear and 100 kernel weight et mm was calculated using the soil water balance equation 2 e t p i c w 0 w 1 r d where p mm is precipitation i mm is the amount of irrigation c mm is the groundwater supply w 0 and w 1 are swss before sowing and after harvesting both at 0 200 cm respectively r mm is surface runoff and d mm is the downward drainage out of root zone the groundwater table at the experimental site is located 5 m below the ground surface and the field was flat and no heavy rain fell during maize growing seasons so c r and d were assumed to be negligible therefore the reduced equation is as follows 3 e t p i w 0 w 1 wue kg ha mm was defined as 4 w u e y e t where y kg ha is the yield of summer maize 2 4 7 economic analysis an economic analysis of maize production was performed after harvest total revenue tr yuan ha was calculated as sime et al 2015 5 t r y p where p yuan kg is the price of summer maize the maize price was 2 16 2 04 and 2 41 yuan kg for the 2014 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively net return nr yuan ha was calculated as lu and liao 2017 6 n r t r t c where tc yuan ha includes input cost and labor cost 2 5 statistical analysis all data are reported in terms of mean value of the three replicates the sas statistics analysis system package version 9 3 sas institute 2011 was used to conduct analyses of variance anova and least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 was used to compare mean differences between treatments figures were made using origin 9 0 and autocad 2007 3 results 3 1 climatic conditions the daily rainfall distributions and the average air temperatures during the three maize growing seasons are shown in fig 2 total rainfall over the whole growing period was 355 3 mm for 2014 283 9 mm for 2015 and 299 0 mm for 2016 however the rainfall distribution was more suitable for maize growth in 2015 and 2016 both evenly distributed during maize growing season than it was in 2014 mainly distributed in the later stages of maize growth daily average air temperatures from maximum to minimum was 14 3 32 3 c in 2014 10 3 31 3 c in 2015 and 16 5 31 0 c in 2016 followed the same trend in the three experimental seasons which was to first increase and then decrease over time throughout the maize season the average air temperature in 2016 was 1 84 c and 2 31 c higher than in 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 2 biodegradability the degradation performances of the three biodegradable films were similar in all three seasons table 2 the b1 film showed the first signs of degradation at 20 30 das and experienced further deterioration achieved a grade 5 degradation rating at 90 100 das each year over the 3 years the degradation of b2 started at 50 60 das and reached the grade 4 degradation stage after 120 days the b3 film started to degrade at 100 das in 2014 90 das in 2015 and 70 das in 2016 but remained relatively intact until the maize harvest additionally the polyethylene film had cracks during the later growth stages these were mainly caused by mechanical pulling and human activities during the production process which are considered to be normal wear and tear 3 3 soil environment 3 3 1 sws the sws levels in the 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm soil layers fluctuated over the three maize seasons table 3 the differences in sws among treatments were much larger in the 0 30 cm soil layer than in the 30 100 cm layer and were increased at first but then decreased over time at 20 das the sws levels in the b1 b2 b3 and p treatments were significantly higher than in ck with an average increase of 7 8 mm and 15 5 mm in the 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm soil layers respectively over the 3 years however there were no significant differences between the b1 b2 and b3 treatments and p the b1 film only started to break up by 40 das its sws levels were still higher than ck but the differences were not significant except for the 0 30 cm soil layer in 2014 at 60 das the sws levels in b2 were slightly lower than in b3 and p but were significantly higher than in b1 and ck the differences in sws between b3 and p were not significant throughout the growing seasons the average sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer for the three seasons in b1 b2 and b3 increased by 7 5 mm 12 8 mm and 19 4 mm respectively when compared to ck and decreased by 14 6 mm 9 2 mm and 2 7 mm respectively when compared to p 3 3 2 soil temperature the daily mean soil temperature at depths of 5 and 25 cm varied significantly during the three growing seasons table 4 overall the daily average soil temperature dynamics among treatments showed a decreasing trend and the differences became smaller as the maize season progressed especially during the later growth stages at the depth of 5 cm the daily average soil temperature among treatments ranged from 21 8 c to 37 9 c in 2014 from 18 1 c to 36 5 c in 2015 and from 19 2 c to 38 2 c in 2016 with the highest and lowest values occurring in p no significant difference with b3 and ck respectively during the observation periods in 2014 and 2015 seasons the daily average soil temperatures in b1 b2 and b3 were significantly higher than in ck but were not significantly different from p before 30 das the temperature improving effects of b1 and b2 began to decrease at 40 das and 60 das respectively as the canopy coverage increased and the biodegradable film deteriorated in 2016 season the daily average soil temperatures in b1 and b2 began to significantly lower than in p at 30 das and 50 das respectively since the degradation progress of the biodegradable film was advanced in this season over the three maize seasons the daily mean soil temperatures in b1 and b2 were on average 3 6 c and 3 7 c higher than in ck respectively before the biodegradable film begins to degrade and 2 0 c and 1 3 c lower than in p respectively after the biodegradable film begins to degrade the ranking for average daily soil temperature at 25 cm depth under each treatment followed the same trend as found for the 5 cm depth however the variation 18 0 31 7 c in 2014 16 3 32 4 c in 2015 17 2 33 8 c in 2016 of soil temperature among treatments at 25 cm was lower than 5 cm depth the daily mean soil temperatures in b1 and b2 were on average 2 4 c and 2 3 c higher than in ck respectively before the biodegradable film begins to degrade and 1 5 c and 1 0 c lower than in p respectively after the biodegradable film begins to degrade during the three maize seasons 3 3 3 soc by october 2016 after the maize harvest representing after 3 years of experiments the soc content in the top 30 cm soil layer significantly decreased in b2 b3 and p relative to that in june 2014 the beginning of the experiment 11 18 g kg the soc level was 2 85 5 30 11 72 and 15 07 higher for ck than in b1 b2 b3 and p respectively fig 3 3 4 maize growth 3 4 1 growth stages the biodegradable film b1 gradually degraded after the jointing stage had been reached reducing the mulching effect the b1 plants reached the tasseling and filling stages at almost the same time as the ck plants table 5 the time needed to reach the tasseling stage in b2 was 5 5 and 4 days longer than for p in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the growth stage progress under the b3 treatment was similar to p and showed a certain degree of premature aging under the combined effect of high air temperature and mulching time taken for the maize to mature was the longest in b2 over all three seasons which was 3 5 8 9 8 9 and 3 4 days longer than that of b1 b3 p and ck respectively 3 4 2 yield the effects of the different biodegradable film mulches on the yield components of spike length ear diameter grains per ear 100 kernel weight and grain yield were consistent across the three growing seasons table 6 the yield components were significantly higher in b1 b2 and b3 than in ck with an average increase of 8 58 7 04 11 71 and 8 18 in spike length ear diameter grains per spike and 100 kernel weight respectively and did not differ significantly between b3 and p for all three seasons the b2 treatment consistently produced the highest grain yield over the three years the grain yield in b2 compared to p and ck increased by 1037 kg ha and 2526 kg ha for 2014 1162 kg ha and 2495 kg ha for 2015 822 kg ha and 2203 kg ha for 2016 respectively in addition the yield components and grain yields for the five treatments b1 b2 b3 p and ck were higher in 2014 and 2015 than in 2016 possibly due to the two lodging events in 2016 3 4 3 et and wue the et and wue were significantly affected when the different biodegradable films were used to mulch the plants fig 4 the et was the lowest in b3 and p and highest in ck over the three growing seasons the b2 treatment had a markedly higher et than p in 2015 but did not differ significantly from p in 2014 and 2016 compared to ck et in b1 b2 and b3 was reduced by 6 9 mm 27 0 mm and 40 2 mm respectively in 2014 by 16 3 mm 29 8 mm and 42 4 mm respectively in 2015 and by 15 1 mm 32 7 mm and 50 3 mm respectively in 2016 the wue among treatments varied from 21 96 kg ha mm in ck to 31 87 kg ha mm in b2 for 2014 from 24 52 kg ha mm in ck to 35 27 kg ha mm in b2 for 2015 and from 20 71 kg ha mm in ck to 30 72 kg ha mm in b2 for 2016 but it did not differ significantly between b3 and p the 3 year average wue in b2 increased by 6 54 kg ha mm 2 02 kg ha mm 2 08 kg ha mm and 10 22 kg ha mm compared to b1 b3 p and ck respectively the wues for all the treatments were higher in 2014 and 2015 than in 2016 which was similar to the grain yields 3 5 economic analysis the economic parameters of summer maize under the five treatments were evaluated in the three growing seasons table 7 in general input cost decreased with ck compared with other mulching treatments as follow ck p b1 b2 and b3 the input cost under b1 b2 b3 p and ck accounted for 29 7 25 6 28 2 25 3 and 26 3 of the total revenue respectively however labor cost increased with p as follow p b1 b2 and b3 ck the labor cost under b1 b2 b3 p and ck accounted for 13 5 11 6 12 8 14 4 and 15 0 of the total revenue respectively the net revenue among treatments ranged from 9524 to 13 608 yuan ha in 2014 from 9796 to 13 513 yuan ha in 2015 and from 9281 to 13 218 yuan ha in 2016 with the highest value obtained in b2 and the lowest value recorded in ck during the three seasons 4 discussions 4 1 degradation of the biodegradable films there are various methods to determine the degradation rate of a biodegradable film including visual inspection mechanical testing differential scanning calorimetry qualitative surface analysis and material weight loss in this study visual inspection using a qualitative scale ranging from 0 to 5 was used to describe the degradation process affected by different climatic conditions the three kinds of biodegradable film were degraded either in advance or on time or postponed in the three seasons however p and b3 were stable until the end of the maize season although there were some small cracks these results were similar to the findings by moreno and moreno 2008 in a summer maize experiment wu et al 2002 found that the degradation progress of biodegradable films with a degradation rate of 45 days and 60 days was delayed by 5 10 days and the biodegradable film with a degradation rate of 90 days did not degrade throughout the growing season moreover the degree of degradation differs depending on the laying position for the same biodegradable film in a cotton experiment he et al 2011 stated that three biodegradable films starch based with different composition materials deteriorated faster in hebei province than in xinjiang autonomous region these studies further confirm the complexity and variability of the biodegradable film degradation process at the same time this suggests that the control of biodegradable film degradation needs to be further improved especially for specific climatic conditions and crop species in the present study during normal years 2014 and 2015 seasons the biodegradable films degraded on time or were delayed by about 10 days however during the extreme year 2016 season plants affected by both lodging and high temperature film degradation was advanced by 10 20 days 4 2 soil environment film mulching improves farmland ecological microclimates and the plant growth environment by coordinating soil water fertilizer gas and heat sreedevi et al 2017 li et al 2018 many studies have indicated that both biodegradable film mulching and polyethylene film mulching can greatly increase sws especially during the early crop stages and in the top soil layer braunack et al 2015 yin et al 2016a in this experiment sws did not differ significantly among b1 b2 b3 and p before the biodegradable film degraded at 20 das after degradation less water directed to plant line meant that the less swss of b1 and b2 compared to p the differences in sws among treatments were increased at first and then decreased over time a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the water conservation effect of film mulching is better before degradation and gradually decreases until disappear after degradation in addition the sws capacities in b3 and p both did not degrade to the same extent as the other films were not significantly different over the three growing seasons although the film slit was prior in b3 than in p this agrees with observations previously reported by braunack et al 2015 there are two possible reasons for this firstly in the middle and later maize growth stages the full crop canopy reduces the water loss by soil evaporation secondly the increased precipitation in the later period could have weakened the moisture conservation effect of film mulching and alleviated the contradiction between soil moisture supply and demand in contrast wang et al 2003 reported the opposite finding their results suggested that the water conserving effect of biodegradable film 20 of starch and 80 of polyethylene was better during the middle maize growth stage but there were no obvious improvements in the early and later stages this may be due to the fluctuation in precipitation and its distribution over the crop growing season adequate precipitation and distribution during crop growth periods may mask any mulching benefits furthermore the differences in degradation rates and the film composition materials may lead to different moisture conservation effects soil water balance is vital for the sustainability of agroecosystems many studies have shown that an increased grain yield under film mulching is associated with soil water depletion in the deeper 100 cm soil layers liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 which suggests film mulching cultivation might not be sustainable in the long term however liu et al 2014 indicated that soil water balance was maintained in the 0 200 cm soil layer when the annual precipitation was 273 mm under ridge furrow and polyethylene film mulching in our study after three years the swss in the 0 200 cm soil layer of all treatments increased when compared to its values before maize sowing in june 2014 data not shown more rainfall directed into plant line for b3 and p thus they had much higher sws than did b1 b2 and ck at harvest in october 2016 the differences among studies in soil moisture conditions with film mulching may be related to the rainfall amount during crop growing seasons and the placement of film mulching over ridges low temperature is another major factor limiting agricultural productivity a suitable soil temperature accelerates plant growth maintains root activity and increases crop yield sarkar et al 2007 yin et al 2015a the summer maize growing season coincides with the period in a year when the temperature is relatively high during the early growth stages the air temperature is lower than the suitable growth temperature of summer maize therefore the higher topsoil temperature under film mulching improves seedling emergence and establishment however the air temperature is higher than the suitable growth temperature of summer maize during the middle and later stages therefore the higher temperature under film mulching during the middle and later growth stages can be a disadvantage since the air temperature is also high in this study ck showed decreased soil temperature compared to b1 b2 and b3 before they degradation this is due to the good transparency and poor permeability of the film yin et al 2015b film mulching can effectively store solar radiation prevent the soil heat from being lost in the form of long wave radiation and reduce the loss of evaporation heat by soil moisture b1 b2 b3 and p generally increased the soil temperature during the early growth stages but the soil temperatures of b1 and b2 behaved in a similar way to bare soil after the films had degraded the thermal effect of b3 and p extended to the end of maize seasons similar results were observed by gu et al 2017 for winter oilseed rape in china and by moreno and moreno 2008 for tomato in spain the growth process results table 5 showed that b2 could bring forward the tasseling stage furthermore the filling stage and maturity stage duration were longer than in b3 and p prolonging the growth cycle especially the reproductive growth cycle promotes the assimilation conversion from vegetative organs to reproductive organs which contributes to increase yield and water and fertilizer use efficiency li et al 1999 yin et al 2015a considering the maize yield wue and net revenue we found that the soil temperature in b2 was ideal for maize growth these results imply the importance of reducing the soil temperature during later crop stages under biodegradable film mulching soc a major indicator of agricultural ecosystem sustainability is the result of the long term net balance between the loss and accumulation of organic carbon in the soil zhang et al 2017b and can be greatly influenced by polyethylene film mulching davidson and janssens 2006 li et al 2007 in this study ck flat sample and p ridge furrow sample had the highest and lowest soc respectively after applying the treatments for 3 years these findings were consistent with zhang et al 2015 who found that the increased soil temperature and a decreased c n ratio under polyethylene film mulching induced significant soc losses and were supported by tian et al 2013 who reported that a mulched soil used to grow rice and wheat contained 40 50 more dissolved organic carbon than uncovered soil after a study that lasted for 10 years these results indicated that polyethylene film mulching may not be a long term solution for improving agricultural productivity while maintaining soil quality in contrast yin et al 2016b reported that double mulching with polyethylene film and crop straw helps to maintain or increase soc wang et al 2016 in a six year study of continuous growth of maize under polyethylene film mulch confirmed that the total soc stocks in the upper 0 15 m of soil were similar in the mulched and non mulched soils applying a process based biogeochemical model zhang et al 2017a found that if 5 of crop residues are returned to the soil polyethylene film mulching has no significant impact on the overall average content of soc across the loess plateau of china compared to the fields without mulching these studies proved that the soc mineralization stimulated by the increased soil temperature and moisture in the mulched treatments could be balanced by an increase in belowground carbon input to the soil relative to the non mulched treatments in addition b2 was better than b3 and p in keeping soc level this shows that the mulching film will increase the decomposition of soc at the later stage of crop growth therefore from a sustainable development point of view long term or whole season film mulching should not be advocated cai et al 2006 4 3 grain yield and wue crop yield and wue do not differ significantly between biodegradable film mulching and polyethylene film mulching which has been shown using various crops including maize shen et al 2011 wheat yin et al 2016a tomato moreno and moreno 2008 and winter rapeseed subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 this study confirmed the previous reports the b3 and p treatments produced non significant increases in grain yield and wue across all three seasons it is worth noting that the grain yield and wue in b2 were significantly higher than in b1 b3 and p this means that biodegradable films with the fast or slow degradation rates do not maximize the contribution to yield formation but a biodegradable film with an appropriate degradation rate such as b2 in this study can match or even exceed the yield increasing effect of polyethylene film li et al 2004 and zhao et al 2012 also demonstrated that polyethylene film mulching over the whole crop season appeared to be detrimental in the semiarid loess plateau of china and that film mulching for 60 days and 65 days increased the yield and wue for spring wheat and potato respectively additionally rainfall and its distribution during the maize growing season influence the effects of different biodegradable film mulching on yield and wue total rainfall was higher in 2014 compared to 2015 but rainfall distribution was more suitable for maize growth during 2015 than in 2014 fig 2 therefore the five treatments produced higher grain yields and wues in 2015 than in 2014 rainfall and its distribution during 2015 and 2016 were similar 2016 has great fall late compared to 2015 the grain yields of the five treatments were higher in 2015 than in 2016 because the maize plants lodged twice in 2016 and the ets were slightly higher in 2015 than that in 2016 however the extents of reduction in yields were large than the ets in 2016 relative to 2015 therefore the wues of the five treatments are lowest in 2016 4 4 economic response ridge furrow rainwater harvesting cultivation with film mulching can appreciably increase crop yield and produce greater economic benefit which has been proved by many studies li et al 2001 yin et al 2018 in this study input cost was higher with biodegradable film b1 b2 and b3 than with polyethylene film p since the price of the biodegradable film is higher than that of the polyethylene film labor costs between biodegradable film and polyethylene film however were just the opposite of input cost this is mainly due to the increasing labor demand for disposing residual film when using polyethylene film overall b2 treatment obtained the highest net revenue similar results were found by guo et al 2015 in tobacco cultivation and by wu et al 2017 in cotton cultivation this further confirms the feasibility of using a biodegradable film instead of a polyethylene film for agricultural production from the perspective of economic response 4 5 optimum degradation rate for biodegradable film the higher topsoil temperature and soil moisture in fields that have been completely covered with film mulches are related to higher soil respiration and soc mineralization which damages to the agro ecosystem wu et al 2002 li et al 2004 furthermore when the ground is film mulched for the whole growing period the high soil temperature and poor rhizosphere aeration during the later crop stages can accelerate the root system aging and root activity decreasing which limits water and nutrient transport and reduces crop yield and quality jiang et al 2013 film mulching the field for the entire maize growth period is not conducive to the precipitation infiltration during the later crop stages using biodegradable film with a reasonable degradation rate can effectively reduce the negative effects of polyethylene film mulching on the field environment and increase crop yield and wue siwek et al 2015 touchaleaume et al 2016 in this study b2 had a moderate degradation rate of about 60 days which meant that this treatment produced the highest maize yields yield components wue values and net revenue compared to b1 b3 and p over the three seasons it is known that summer maize is in the transitional period from vegetative growth to reproductive growth at about 60 das at this point the full establishment of plant canopy covers soil surface which causes a gradually weakened mulching effects of increasing temperature and conserving moisture at the same time timely degradation of biodegradable film improves precipitation permeability during the later growth stages therefore the degradation rate for biodegradable film should coincide with the time when the plant canopy reaches its maximum leaf area index the results from this study suggest that a biodegradable film with moderate degradation rate of about 60 days can reach the yield increasing and income increasing effects of polyethylene film and avoid the loss of soc for summer maize in sub humid drought prone climates and other regions with similar ecologies 5 conclusions the three types of biodegradable films b1 b2 and b3 degraded basically in accord with their degradation rates the soil temperature and sws in b1 and b2 were not significantly different from p before the biodegradable film degraded after the biodegradable film degraded soil temperature and sws significantly decreased in b1 and b2 compared to p however the differences in soil temperature and sws between b3 and p were not significantly different over the three maize seasons b2 reduced vegetative growth and prolonged reproductive growth which contributed to higher grain yield wue and net revenue compared to that in b1 b3 and p for all three seasons and avoided the over decomposition of soc that occurred in the p treatment the mulching effect and biodegradability results suggested that a moderate degradation rate of about 60 days was the most suitable degradation rate for biodegradable film when summer maize is grown in sub humid drought prone areas acknowledgments this study was financed by the state commission of agriculture of china 201503105 and 201503125 and the chinese national high

11109,climate projection at local scale is one of the crucial challenges that affects the development of water management related mitigation plans moreover the currently available climate models do not directly simulate some of the hydro climatic parameters e g effective rainfall reference evapotranspiration irrigation requirements which are of interest in irrigation sector modeling crop water demands under changing climate involves several step by step approaches that are tedious and time consuming for many water users this study developed a water management tool hereafter called climate smart decision support system csdss for modeling water demand of rice irrigation schemes under climate change impacts the csdss is a user friendly interactive program consisting of three main modules integrated in matlab and a graphical user interface development environment guide the model runs with ten global climate models gcms and three emission scenarios rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 it can generate several hydro climatic parameters based on a daily water balance model with input data from gcms projections crop soil and field conditions the model allows water managers to make fast decision for paddy water management the generated outputs can be obtained through individual gcms as well as through multi models ensemble projection and can be converted into excel format for further analysis the model was applied to evaluate the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demand and other key hydro climatic parameters in tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme in malaysia for the period 2010 2099 with reference to the baseline period of 1976 2005 the results show that irrigation water demand will increase during the off season january june but decrease during the main season july december due to significant contribution from effective rainfall in the latter season the csdss tool can be used for managing water resources under changing climate and would therefore be helpful in promoting appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies that can lead to more sustainable water use at farm level some future improvements of the tool due to methodological limitations of the study will however improve its performance keywords rice cultivation irrigation water demand climate change global climate models climate smart dss 1 introduction inter governmental panel on climate change international panel for climate change ipcc 2007 identified three main signals of climate change gradual increase in global average temperatures rise in mean sea levels and changes in rainfall patterns across the globe it is thought that climate change will take the world into a new phase of water stress and uncertainty in the future many studies reveal that climate change will lead to a sharp increase in water demand by altering the hydrological cycle and affecting agricultural water supplies jang et al 2007 kirby et al 2015 mojid et al 2015 kirby et al 2016 wang et al 2014 increase in temperature and change in rainfall patterns will lead to higher crop evapotranspiration water demand and water shortage in stream flows water availability the impacts of climate change influence irrigation requirements schlenker et al 2007 and are particularly sensitive to changes in precipitation and temperature frederick and major 1997 previous studies showed that even small changes in rainfall intensity can result in significant impacts on stream flow risbey and entekhabi 1996 acharjee et al 2017 investigated the impacts of climate change on future water requirements for long term water resources management and agricultural planning they emphasized on close monitoring and periodic evaluations to understand future directions of change in rainfall amounts and distribution ye et al 2015 explored the temporal and spatial influence of climate change on suitable rice cropping areas rice cropping systems and crop water requirements during the growing season for historical 1951 2010 and future 2011 2100 time periods in china their study aimed to provide a scientific guideline for planning future cropping systems and optimizing water management in addition to the water requirements climate change affects several other aspects of rice cultivation systems such as cultivated land and length of crop growing season yoo et al 2012 2013 rice is the most common staple food for majority of the world s population with more than 142 million hectares area under cultivation ninety percent of this area is in the monsoon regions of asia de wrachien 2003 fao 2013 of which 75 is under irrigation and the remaining is rainfed global rice consumption is projected to increase by 35 in 2020 relative to the 1995 baseline lee et al 2005 it is envisaged that climate change will put a severe strain on future water resources for food especially rice production under irrigation therefore the contradictory occurrences of increasing food demand and decreasing water availability warrant development of smart water management tools that would be consistent with future water resources planning and management under climate forcing in general assessments of climate change require future climate scenarios which can be derived either from the past climatic data with statistical approaches synthetic climate scenarios or outputs of global circulation models gcms assessment studies using gcm outputs are widely becoming a basis of understanding the implications of climate change impacts in the context of future irrigation water demands both at global and scheme levels the gcms are incredible tools to study the impact of climate change and have been used globally in a number of recent studies wilby and harris 2006 obtained most credible results by using gcm approach compared to other approaches however direct use of gcms is restricted due to coarse spatial resolution of their outputs so it is necessary to downscale the gcm outputs atmospheric predictor variables to local scale surface variables wilby et al 2002 several statistical downscaling approaches and models such as delta change factor methodology wxgen model sharpley 1990 cligen model nicks et al 1995 sdsm wilby et al 2002 lars wg semenov et al 2002 climgen mckague et al 2003 and earwig kilsby et al 2007 have been developed in recent years a number of global studies e g doll 2002 fischer et al 2007 elgaali et al 2007 yano et al 2007 diaz et al 2007 de silva et al 2007 knox et al 2010 shahid 2011 wang et al 2014 were also done to assess the impact of climate change on regional and local scale irrigation water demand based on perturbed climate change scenarios generated with gcm outputs or by using models despite a good number of available tools the downscaling procedure is still tedious complex and computationally problematic for many stakeholders like farmers and water managers who may be laymen in this field moreover the gcms do not simulate the hydro climatic parameters of interest in irrigation practice such as crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand further steps are required to obtain these parameters on a daily scale as required in practical irrigation the main problem faced by irrigation managers in many large scale rice schemes is estimating water demand under climate scenarios and supplying water at the head of distributaries of the canal network in advance so an easy to use decision support system for rice irrigation management information system that can integrate climate change impact assessment procedures e g gcms rcps scenarios downscaling process climate projections and baseline period and interface for linking with water demand models can remove the difficulty such a tool can remove the task of downscaling it simply requires the users to generate climate scenarios and import them into a water demand module for simulating water demand based on selected gcm scenario combination the objectives of this study was i to develop a matlab based decision support system called climate smart decision support system for rice irrigation management information system csdss rimis that can integrate climate change impact assessment procedures 10 gcms three rcp scenarios of 4 5 6 0 8 5 downscaling process climate projections from 2010 to 2099 and climate baseline period of 1976 to 2005 and interface for linking with evapotranspiration models and ii to apply and test the csdss rimis tool in modeling irrigation water demand for a large scale rice irrigation scheme under climate change impacts in malaysia 2 methodological approach modeling crop water demands under climate change scenario involves several tedious and time consuming step by step approaches first the observed and gcm projected daily hydro meteorological data are needed for estimating reference evapotranspiration then irrigation requirements of paddy fields and effective rainfall need to be estimated with a water balance model some other related data such as crop coefficient seepage percolation rate water application and conveyance losses and irrigation command area are also necessary the flowchart of the methodology adopted in this study is depicted in fig 1 2 1 study area the command area of the integrated agricultural development area iada was considered for developing csdss rimis for modeling crop water demand under climate change condition the project initially started as tanjung karang rice irrigation project in 1936 and transformed to the iada in 1978 is located in the district of kuala selangor and sabak bernam at 3 40 n latitude and 100 59 e longitude fig 2 it covers an area of 19 030 ha which is used for irrigated rice farming twice in a year dry off season january june called first season and wet main season july december called second season the project area has an average rainfall of 1500 mm mostly concentrated over october to january with the highest rainfall in october and lowest in june the average monthly air temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed is 28 c 77 15 2 20 4 mj m 2day 1 and 2 25 m s 1 respectively based on data of department of irrigation and drainage did and malaysian meteorological department mmd the average monthly meteorological data of the study area from 1990 to 2010 is presented in table 1 about one half 51 of the irrigation water requirement is supplied in the scheme by rainfall received as effective rainfall within the rice fields and the rest comes from the bernam river basin for better management of irrigation water supply the project area has been divided into four irrigation service areas isas isa i isa ii isa iii and isa iv and irrigation is staggered by one month interval during planting water is diverted at the bernam headworks at maximum design discharge 30 6 m3 s 1 and conveyed through a 14 5 km feeder canal into the tengi river the water is then channeled by gravity flow to the intake point of the main canal and delivered to paddy fields through off take structures consisting of constant head orifice structures 2 2 data and their sources the observed climate data in the project area is of poor quality due to missing values for a series of years so a gridded daily hydro meteorological dataset developed by wong et al 2011 covering the whole peninsular malaysia was used in this study except the rainfall the dataset included daily maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed and mean relative humidity the data were gridded from the daily observed data at a spatial resolution of 5 km based on angular distance weighting adw procedure which performed well in areas with sparse data as in malaysia the gridded data were developed using observed data obtained from different sources including datalogger and telemetry network database of did and mmd global summary of the day gsod archive global energy and water balance experiment gewex research program and asian monsoon experiment game archive detailed overview of data processing quality control and methodology used in data development was elaborated by wong et al 2009 and wong et al 2011 three existing stations were considered to represent the historical spatial climate 1976 2005 of the scheme area a threshold value of 1 0 mm was applied to remove small rainfall events following deni et al 2010 and zin et al 2010 the programming was developed following the irrigation scheme s current cropping calendar and irrigation distribution for the two seasons off season and main season as given in table 2 2 3 hydro meteorological downscaling module 2 3 1 climate data extraction and processing rainfall and evapotranspiration are the major hydro meteorological variables that influence crop water requirement knox et al 2010 diaz et al 2007 evapotranspiration is dominantly influenced by air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation these hydro meteorological data sets were obtained from ten gcms from coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmipp5 under three emission scenarios of rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 some impact assessment studies on water demand used the special report on emission scenarios sres rehana and mujumdar 2012 chung and nkomozepi 2012 shahid 2011 however we used the latest scenarios called representative concentration pathways rcps which are a new set of greenhouse gas scenarios represented by rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 table 3 lists the gcm models used in the development of climate smart decision support system csdss gcms grid points were selected on the basis of stations locations within the scheme area in terms of their longitude and latitude each gcm had four grid points and a representative grid point was chosen based on the average value where the values were computed on all grid points and averaged to a single weighted value the data was prepared in three future periods of 30 year time segments centered on 2020s 2010 2039 2050s 2040 2069 and 2080s 2070 2099 2 3 2 hydro meteorological downscaling because of coarse resolution of gcms projections their outputs cannot be utilized directly in water demand modeling so the gcms output was downscaled to bridge the gap the downscaling task is however complex and time consuming for assessing the risk of climate change impacts and selecting adaptation strategies in this study a hydro meteorological graphical user interface was developed that integrates the common procedures of assessing climate change impacts integrated with gcms and scenarios selection and downscaling procedures of climate variables and their future projections the interface also links the water demand model in the computational steps the interface is based on methodology of delta change factor as a statistical downscaling algorithm to create high resolution future variables at the station scale delta change is the most commonly adopted statistical downscaling technique used as an ordinary bias correction method to reduce bias between the observed station data and gcms outputs chen et al 2011 ouyang et al 2015 the algorithm modifies the observed daily time series of the climate variables by adding and or multiplying monthly mean changes of gcm outputs using adjusting formulas the adjusting formulas for modified daily rainfall are expressed by eqs 1 and 2 and the modified daily series of temperature and other parameters are expressed by eqs 3 and 4 due to lack of good quality data in the study area before stating of the project in 1976 a baseline period of 1976 2005 was adopted in this study 1 r

the step by step procedures followed in simulating the climate sequences in the hydro meteorological interface are illustrated in fig 3 the change factors for the gcm grid box encompassing the command area are calculated for each month in the future years relative to the baseline the interface can be applied to other geographical areas by simply incorporating the observed data of those stations and their corresponding baseline and future gcms outputs in the working folder additionally the change factors can always be updated quickly if new gcms and emission scenarios become available in the future the change factor technique has been widely applied in crop water demand calculation and hydrological studies around the world chung and nkomozepi 2012 knox et al 2010 diaz nieto and wilby 2005

expressed by 5 e t o t s 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 where etot s is standardized reference crop evapotranspiration for short grass mm day 1 in period t at downscaling

vapour pressure deficit kpa Œ¥ is slope of vapour pressure curve k pa c 1 and Œ≥ is psychrometric constant k pa c 1 the downscaled hydro meteorological variables such as air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were used as input to the eto model eq 5 for evaluating the anticipated changes it is noted that solar radiation could not be downscaled directly owing to the non existence of solar radiation data from gcms archives a simple temperature based equation by hargreaves and samani 1982 was used to estimate the solar radiation r s as 6 r s k r s t m a x t m i n 1 2 r a where krs is an adjustment factor that is equal to 0 16 for interior locations and 0 19 for coastal locations tmax and tmin are the mean monthly maximum and minimum air temperatures c respectively and ra is extraterrestrial radiation w m 2 which was computed following allen et al 1998 a stand alone graphical user interface was designed with several scripted codes and functions for the eto module using matlab programming following a step by step process as illustrated in fig 4 2 5 crop water demand simulation 2 5 1 water balance model for rice fields for evaluating the impact of climate change on

effective rainfall e r j eq 7 on period j at downscaling station s was estimated by using the drainage model of the international rice research institute irri 1977 as 8 e r j s r f j s f o r d r j 0 9

etc j p s is crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 kcj p s is crop coefficient dimensionless and etoj p s is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 of rice crop p for period j at downscaling station s the crop coefficient values experimentally determined by chan and cheong 2001 in several rice fields of the tanjung karang irrigation scheme are depicted in fig 6 reference evapotranspiration values were computed by using fao penman monteith method eq 5 from the reference evapotranspiration module based on gcms data and imported to the water demand simulation module 2 5 4 pre saturation water

an important initial stage prior to planting of rice crop water for pre saturation was supplied at a rate of 18 5 mm day 1 ha 1 for a period of 14 days to the irrigation blocks of irrigation service

of irrigation water demand under climate change scenarios is illustrated in the working flow diagram of fig 5 2 6 design and development of dss user interface the csdss rimis tool consists of three basic modules i hydro meteorological simulation ii reference evapotranspiration simulation and iii water demand simulation all modules are contained within a single working folder in designing the interface a criterion for modular development was adopted so that analyses can be done separately where necessary the interface is structured in matlab with its graphical user interface development environment guide which is a useful platform to design user interface the key advantage for using matlab is its computational capability the interface is based on a mouse driven approach with pop up windows pull down menus and button controls in designing the interface several scripted functions based on ten gcms were developed each running under three rcp scenarios rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 the design of the interface includes creating gcms calendars to account for gcms with all 365 days in a year for computing change factors the modules are inter connected through the graphical user interface which provides users with ability to access data and outputs from the system the gcms data are contained in matlab database allowing for quick update of data as new climate scenarios and gcms become available on activation of the csdss rimis model the main dialog window appears in matlab environment after activating dialog windows of the three modules a simulation dialog window allows for generating daily sequences of hydro meteorological variables to run a simulation for rainfall the user has to select the station variable of interest gcm rcp scenario combination and simulation period by using the drop down buttons the future hydro climatic parameters of a station are produced by perturbing the station the parameters are derived by using change factors from the mean projected changes which are simulated from gcms for the same variables simulation outputs can be obtained from each of the ten gcms or through multi models projections based on selected rcp emission scenario the outputs can be generated as daily time series and long term monthly time scale and can be viewed as tables and graphs the outputs are then imported to water demand module for simulation of irrigation water demands for running the reference evapotranspiration simulation the basic information like station gcm scenario and irrigation date are selected by using drop down buttons in reference et simulation dialog window the hydro meteorological variables generated from the gcms outputs and their change factors are the main inputs in computing the reference evapotranspiration eto the time series of eto is generated for the selected irrigation period by pressing simulation of eto time series button the simulated eto outputs include daily eto series mean monthly eto multi scenario comparisons and multi future comparisons the eto outputs can be imported to the water demand module for computing recommended irrigation water demands for the target irrigation areas the water demand simulation module simulates irrigation demands by taking inputs from all irrigation service areas as the season advances the user has to provide station gcm scenario and irrigation date in the simulation dialog window the user also needs to adjust crop input data like length of growth stage crop factors irrigation efficiency and seepage and pre saturation rates daily eto and rainfall data are imported from the previous modules effective rainfall is computed within the module other input data are provided by the model as default values that can be changed manually if needed with required input data simulation of irrigation water demand is done by clicking the simulate future scheme water demand button the outputs can be viewed as tables and graphs the module allows for saving the inputs and outputs into matlab database or in excel format the developed csdss tool was applied to tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme to assess climate change impacts on key hydro climatic parameters and irrigation water demands several outputs were generated from the model using both single gcm model s and multi model projections however due to space constraint only few selected outputs are discusssed in this paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 csdss rimis model simulation outputs 3 1 1 hydro meteorological variables fig 6 represents long term monthly rainfall simulated by gcm models for 2050s period under rcp4 5 scenario most gcms predicted higher annual rainfall compared to the baseline values with the exception of cnrm csiro and hadgem2 es models which predicted 3 0 4 5 and 2 9 less rainfall compared to the baseline period these differences in simulated monthly rainfall emphasize the uncertainties within the climate models in simulating rainfall table 4 provides summary of analyses of changes in future rainfall on monthly time scale for multi scenario case for the periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 fig 7 illustrates the projected mean monthly rainfall using multi models and rcp scenarios for three future periods of 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 relative to the baseline period of 1976 2005 rcp4 5 scenario shows increasing trends in monthly rainfall also for future periods except in june and december when the rainfall decreased by 3 7 8 and 2 9 1 6 in 2020s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 the monthly rainfall distribution shows increasing trend in the near future 2020s and a decreasing trend in january february march and december however rcp6 0 scenario shows a decreasing trend in all the months of the year and all future periods with the greatest decrease in january 35 6 february 26 4 and march 32 6 climate projection in the study area thus reveals a decrease in rainfall in dry season january june but increase in wet season july december other rainfall related outputs such as effective rainfall wet and dry spell lengths and weekly rainfall can also be generated from the interface these analyses can be used periodically to compare the model outputs with station rainfall data for identifying climate change signals its magnitude and direction of change such information can assist water managers and farmers in developing relevant adaptation and mitigation plans for irrigation water management it is apparent from these outputs that under rcps 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 scenarios annual rainfall is projected to increase by 5 6 3 3 and 8 7 during 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively however rcp6 0 scenario shows a decrease in annual rainfall by 10 6 6 8 and 10 5 during 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively 3 1 2 reference evapotranspiration fig 8 illustrates an example of mean monthly reference evapotranspiration eto for january december of 2017 that was projected by using a single climate model ccsm4 under rcp4 5 scenario the overall projected annual eto is 1410 2 mm which is consistent with the expected observed eto values from the scheme area all gcms predict increase in future eto under rcp4 5 scenario with respect to the baseline period the largest annual mean change in eto 2 9 was obtained with csiro model and the lowest 0 4 was with hadgem2 cc model the largest mean monthly eto was obtained for the dry season march august with the highest value obtained for july and the lowest for november with all models 3 1 3 water demand projection irrigation requirements vary with the emission scenarios rcps 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 and that high irrigation requirement is obtained for march april where all irrigation service areas are fully planted the model outputs also reveal that the main wet season july december has no irrigation requirements due to heavy rainfall during that period 3 2 modeling hydro climatic parameters under climate change impacts 3 2 1 effective rainfall changes in effective rainfall differ considerably with the gcms and rcp scenarios with no general trend table 5 and fig 9 the effective rainfall is projected to increase during off season from the baseline value of 386 mm by 3 4 0 8 and 7 6 for 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp4 5 the percentage values in parenthesis are for rcp8 5 there is also a noticeable decrease of the effective rainfall 7 6 in the late century under rcp8 5 a similar nature of variation is observed in the main season with the exception of rcp6 0 scenario significant decrease in rainfall is observed with the csiro and hadgem2 es models while mpi esm lr and canesm2 models predicted marked increase in future effective rainfall the change in rainfall is generally not defined by the characteristics of a given model but it depends largely on the gcm s physical parameterizations chung and nkomozepi 2012 the prediction of effective rainfall is therefore a major source of uncertainty in impact assessments despite their variations most gcms predicted an increase in effective rainfall for all future scenarios under investigation this information will help understanding water management in rice irrigation in the future 3 2 2 reference evapotranspiration the annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures continuously increase in the 2020s 2050s and 2080s over the baseline period for the three rcp scenarios table 6 there is a general consensus in all gcm models with respect to temperature increase in the future under all three emission scenarios this implies that the scheme area under study is expected to be warmer in the future especially during the off dry season months this predicted future change is consistent with the ipcc findings for south east asia region stocker 2014 solomon et al 2007 table 6 also presents annual changes in reference evapotranspiration eto for the three future periods under the three rcp scenarios under the three rcps eto increases in the scheme area by 1 6 3 7 0 8 4 7 and 1 6 9 1 during 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 periods respectively with respect to the baseline period of 1976 2005 the highest eto is 1549 8 mm under rcp 8 5 during 2080s and the lowest eto is 1431 6 mm under rcp6 0 during 2020s similar to temperature change there is also consensus in the gcm projected annual changes in eto under all scenarios throughout the future periods with all models projecting future increase in eto as provided in table 7 significant increase in monthly eto is prominent during the dry season months march july fig 10 the highest increase is 14 2 under rcp 8 5 most severe scenario during the 2080s and the lowest increase is 0 2 under rcp 6 0 in the near future 2020s the analysis unequivocally reveals that the projected increase in temperature has a direct impact on eto and consequently will have the effect on crop water demand the projected increase in the annual eto fig 11 under the three rcp scenarios for the three future periods clearly demonstrates that irrigation requirements are expected to increase in the future therefore climate smart appropriate adaptation strategies will be crucial towards meeting crop water demand under future climatic conditions based on the projection future monthly changes in temperature for the three future periods under the three rcp scenarios with respect to baseline period are expected to increase in rcp8 5 scenario significant monthly increase in temperature is predicted with maximum increase between 3 5 c and 3 7 c more warming is estimated during the off season in the irrigation scheme compared to the main season the anticipated irrigation demands of the rice crop are examined for the future emission scenarios by accounting for the changes in rainfall and reference evapotranspiration fig 12 based on the gcm outputs demonstrates that more water will be needed in the future except in october and november the predicted trends of warming due to increase in temperature are expected to cause increase in reference evapotranspiration in the future periods 3 2 3 crop evapotranspiration paddy crop evapotranspiration etc was computed by using penman monteith model eq 5 based on the time varying crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration eto the seasonal crop evapotranspiration increases in the future periods over the baseline period following different trends for the three rcp scenarios and future periods table 8 on average etc for the off dry season varies from 1008 to 1021 mm 1 1 2 5 under rcp 4 5 1003 to 1029 mm 0 7 3 3 under rcp 6 0 and 1009 to 1058 mm 1 2 6 1 under rcp 8 5 scenarios similarly the variation is from 948 to 958 mm 0 6 1 7 under rcp 4 5 945 to 961 mm 0 2 2 0 under rcp 6 0 and 947 to 981 mm 0 5 4 1 under rcp 8 5 during the main season the highest etc for the worst case scenario rcp 8 5 is estimated to be 8 5 mm day 1 march april and 2 6 mm day 1 june july during the off season the lowest etc is 7 3 mm day 1 september october and 2 3 mm day 1 december january during the main season as expected etc is found higher in the dry season than in the wet season due to future increase in temperature and subsequent increase in eto in the dry season 3 2 4 irrigation water requirements irrigation requirements are higher in the off season compared to the main season for the off season the mean irrigation water requirement is projected to increase up to 0 1 613 mm under rcp 4 5 13 7 694 mm under rcp 6 0 and 10 5 675 mm under rcp 8 5 for 2080s period with respect to baseline period table 9 during the main season irrigation water requirements are projected to decrease in all three future periods and rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the projected decrease in irrigation water requirement for 2020s 2050s and 2080s is 5 4 382 mm 3 8 388 mm and 2 9 392 mm respectively under rcp 4 5 and 6 8 376 mm l 3 2 390 mm and 1 7 410 mm increase during 2080s respectively under rcp 8 5 the main reason for the decrease in irrigation water requirement is attributed to significant contribution from effective rainfall however the high medium rcp6 0 scenario exhibits the highest increase in irrigation water requirement in all future periods and seasons this would be possibly due to unavailability of data for this scenario at the archives of some gcms canesm2 cnrm cm5 hadgem2 cc and mpi esm lr the rcp 6 0 scenario should therefore be used with great caution in future application of the csdss rimis tool february to may of the off season will require more irrigation water in the 2080s under rcp 8 5 scenario with a maximum requirement of 29 4 in march fig 13 the average irrigation requirement would be the highest 5 2 mm day 1 during march april and lowest 1 9 mm day 1 during may june the first future period 2020s does not show much increase in irrigation water demand under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in the same manner the main season will be dominated by high rainfall events which will lead to less irrigation requirements especially in november and december it is revealed that effective rainfall in the study area starts exceeding the irrigation requirements in october and continues up to december january in the future irrigation water requirements in the scheme will vary significantly over the months during the off season and the increase in effective rainfall during the main season will compensate the high water demand of the off season consequently no irrigation will be required for some months e g november and december this result is partially supported by the findings of tukimat et al 2017 who also revealed that climate change will not affect water abundance in the south east asian countries since water demand will reduce due to increase in rainfall however the major challenge will be to manage the monthly variability of irrigation water demand in the command area failure to which would lead the irrigation system to much more uncertainty since the project is a run of the river irrigation scheme with no storage reservoir 4 conclusions a user friendly climate smart decision support system for rice irrigation management information system csdss rimis was developed and tested successfully for simulating climate scenarios to enhance planning and management of irrigation water under future climate forcing for a large scale irrigation scheme tanjung karang rice irrigation project in malaysia the outputs generated by the csdss rimis tool can be obtained through individual gcms and or multi models ensemble projection the outputs of the model reveal that the future challenge for efficacious irrigation in the tanjung karang project will be to properly manage monthly variability in water demand that could lead to uncertainty in water supply since the project is a run of the river irrigation scheme with no storage reservoir the predicted change in irrigation water demand at the scheme is a function of changing patterns of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration the csdss rimis tool can be utilized as a guide for managing water resources under climate change scenario it will promote appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies like construction of storage reservoir for rainwater harvesting that can lead to sustainable water use at farm level under climate forcing the advantage of the tool is the quick simulation of a very comprehensive information that allows water managers to make fast decision for paddy field water management the easy to use tool can also make climate change discussions more practical to water users who may not be familiar with such forums although the tool has been customized for local application in a tropical rice cultivation area it can be extended to other locations by taking into account historical station data gcms and data of the locations in spite of these advantages there are some limitations of the csdss rimis tool in this study a popular downscaling approach using change factors was used that has limitations compared to other approaches further studies may adopt more sophisticated approaches which will allow more detailed analysis of climate change impacts upgrading the gcms with missing outputs under rcp 6 0 scenario and addition of the lowest scenario rcp 2 5 which was not included in the current study are needed future studies should include estimation of demand based flows in the tertiary networks including recommended irrigation supply actual irrigation supply volume of water etc these parameters have not been included in the current study but would be important

11109,climate projection at local scale is one of the crucial challenges that affects the development of water management related mitigation plans moreover the currently available climate models do not directly simulate some of the hydro climatic parameters e g effective rainfall reference evapotranspiration irrigation requirements which are of interest in irrigation sector modeling crop water demands under changing climate involves several step by step approaches that are tedious and time consuming for many water users this study developed a water management tool hereafter called climate smart decision support system csdss for modeling water demand of rice irrigation schemes under climate change impacts the csdss is a user friendly interactive program consisting of three main modules integrated in matlab and a graphical user interface development environment guide the model runs with ten global climate models gcms and three emission scenarios rcp 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 it can generate several hydro climatic parameters based on a daily water balance model with input data from gcms projections crop soil and field conditions the model allows water managers to make fast decision for paddy water management the generated outputs can be obtained through individual gcms as well as through multi models ensemble projection and can be converted into excel format for further analysis the model was applied to evaluate the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demand and other key hydro climatic parameters in tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme in malaysia for the period 2010 2099 with reference to the baseline period of 1976 2005 the results show that irrigation water demand will increase during the off season january june but decrease during the main season july december due to significant contribution from effective rainfall in the latter season the csdss tool can be used for managing water resources under changing climate and would therefore be helpful in promoting appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies that can lead to more sustainable water use at farm level some future improvements of the tool due to methodological limitations of the study will however improve its performance keywords rice cultivation irrigation water demand climate change global climate models climate smart dss 1 introduction inter governmental panel on climate change international panel for climate change ipcc 2007 identified three main signals of climate change gradual increase in global average temperatures rise in mean sea levels and changes in rainfall patterns across the globe it is thought that climate change will take the world into a new phase of water stress and uncertainty in the future many studies reveal that climate change will lead to a sharp increase in water demand by altering the hydrological cycle and affecting agricultural water supplies jang et al 2007 kirby et al 2015 mojid et al 2015 kirby et al 2016 wang et al 2014 increase in temperature and change in rainfall patterns will lead to higher crop evapotranspiration water demand and water shortage in stream flows water availability the impacts of climate change influence

rainfall intensity can result in significant impacts on stream flow risbey and entekhabi 1996 acharjee et al 2017 investigated the impacts of climate change on future water requirements for long term water resources management and agricultural planning they emphasized on close monitoring and periodic evaluations to understand future directions of change in rainfall amounts and distribution ye et al 2015 explored the temporal and spatial influence of climate change on suitable rice cropping areas rice cropping systems and crop water requirements during the growing season for historical 1951 2010 and future 2011 2100 time periods in china their study aimed to provide a scientific guideline for planning future cropping systems and optimizing water management in addition to the water requirements climate change affects several other aspects of rice cultivation systems such as cultivated land and length of crop growing season yoo et al 2012 2013 rice is the most common staple food for majority of the world s population with more than 142 million hectares area under cultivation ninety percent of this area is in the monsoon regions of asia de wrachien 2003 fao 2013 of which 75 is under irrigation and the remaining is rainfed global rice consumption is projected to increase by 35 in 2020 relative to the 1995 baseline lee et al 2005 it is envisaged that climate change will put a severe strain on future water resources for food especially rice production under irrigation therefore the contradictory occurrences of increasing food demand and decreasing water availability warrant development of smart water management tools that would be consistent with future water resources planning and management under climate forcing in general assessments of climate change require future climate scenarios which can be derived either from the past climatic data with statistical approaches synthetic climate scenarios or outputs of global circulation models gcms assessment studies using gcm outputs are widely becoming a basis of understanding the implications of climate change impacts in the context of future irrigation water demands both at global and scheme levels the gcms are incredible tools to study the impact of climate change and have been used globally in a number of recent studies wilby and harris 2006 obtained most credible results by using gcm approach compared to other approaches however direct use of gcms is restricted due to coarse spatial resolution of their outputs so it is necessary to downscale the gcm outputs atmospheric predictor variables to local scale surface variables wilby et al 2002 several statistical downscaling approaches and models such as delta change factor methodology wxgen model sharpley 1990 cligen model nicks et al 1995 sdsm wilby et al 2002 lars wg semenov et al 2002 climgen mckague et al 2003 and earwig kilsby et al 2007 have been developed in recent years a number of global studies e g doll 2002 fischer et al 2007 elgaali et al 2007 yano et al 2007 diaz et al 2007 de silva et al 2007 knox et al 2010 shahid 2011 wang et al 2014 were also done to assess the impact of climate change on regional and local scale irrigation water demand based on perturbed climate change scenarios generated with gcm outputs or by using models despite a good number of available tools the downscaling procedure is still tedious complex and computationally problematic for many stakeholders like farmers and water managers who may be laymen in this field moreover the gcms do not simulate the hydro climatic parameters of interest in irrigation practice such as crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand further steps are required to obtain these parameters on a daily scale as required in practical irrigation the main problem faced by irrigation managers in many large scale rice schemes is estimating water demand under climate scenarios and supplying water at the head of distributaries of the canal network in advance so an easy to use decision support system for rice irrigation management information system that can integrate climate change impact assessment procedures e g gcms rcps scenarios downscaling process climate projections and baseline period and interface for linking with water demand models can remove the difficulty such a tool can remove the task of downscaling it simply requires the users to generate climate scenarios and import them into a water demand module for simulating water demand based on selected gcm scenario combination the objectives of this study was i to develop a matlab based decision support system called climate smart decision support system for rice irrigation management information system csdss rimis that can integrate climate change impact assessment procedures 10 gcms three rcp scenarios of 4 5 6 0 8 5 downscaling process climate projections from 2010 to 2099 and climate baseline period of 1976 to 2005 and interface for linking with evapotranspiration models and ii to apply and test the csdss rimis tool in modeling irrigation water demand for a large scale rice irrigation scheme under climate change impacts in malaysia 2 methodological approach modeling crop water demands under climate change scenario involves several tedious and time consuming step by step approaches first the observed and gcm projected daily hydro meteorological data are needed for estimating reference evapotranspiration then irrigation requirements of paddy fields and effective rainfall need to be estimated with a water balance model some other related data such as crop coefficient seepage percolation rate water application and conveyance losses and irrigation command area are also necessary the flowchart of the methodology adopted in this study is depicted in fig 1 2 1 study area the command area of the integrated agricultural development area iada was considered for developing csdss rimis for modeling crop water demand under climate change condition the project initially started as tanjung karang rice irrigation project in 1936 and transformed to the iada in 1978 is located in the district of kuala selangor and sabak bernam at 3 40 n latitude and 100 59 e longitude fig 2 it covers an area of 19 030 ha which is used for irrigated rice farming twice in a year dry off season january june called first season and wet main season july december called second season the project area has an average rainfall of 1500 mm mostly concentrated over october to january with the highest rainfall in october and lowest in june the average monthly air temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed is 28 c 77 15 2 20 4 mj m 2day 1 and 2 25 m s 1 respectively based on data of department of irrigation and drainage did and malaysian meteorological department mmd the average monthly meteorological data of the study area from 1990 to 2010 is presented in table 1 about one half 51 of the irrigation water requirement is supplied in the scheme by rainfall received as effective rainfall within the rice fields and the rest comes from the bernam river basin for better management of irrigation water supply the project area has been divided into four irrigation service areas isas isa i isa ii isa iii and isa iv and irrigation is staggered by one month interval during planting water is diverted at the bernam headworks at maximum design discharge 30 6 m3 s 1 and conveyed through a 14 5 km feeder canal into the tengi river the water is then channeled by gravity flow to the intake point of the main canal and delivered to paddy fields through off take structures consisting of constant head orifice structures 2 2 data and their sources the observed climate data in the project area is of poor quality due to missing values for a series of years so a gridded daily hydro meteorological dataset developed by wong et al 2011 covering the whole peninsular malaysia was used in this study except the rainfall the dataset included daily maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed and mean relative humidity the data were gridded from the daily observed data at a spatial resolution of 5 km based on angular distance weighting adw procedure which performed well in areas with sparse data as in malaysia the gridded data were developed using observed data obtained from different sources including datalogger

detailed overview of data processing quality control and methodology used in data development was elaborated by wong et al 2009 and wong et al 2011 three existing stations were considered to represent the historical spatial climate 1976 2005 of the scheme area a threshold value of 1 0 mm was applied to remove small rainfall events following deni et al 2010 and zin et al 2010 the programming was developed following the irrigation scheme s current cropping calendar and irrigation distribution for the two seasons off season and main season as given in table 2 2 3 hydro meteorological downscaling module 2 3 1 climate data extraction and processing rainfall and evapotranspiration are the major hydro meteorological variables that influence crop water requirement knox et al 2010 diaz et al 2007 evapotranspiration is dominantly influenced by air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation these hydro meteorological data sets were obtained from ten gcms from coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmipp5 under three emission scenarios of rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 some impact assessment studies on water demand used the special report on emission scenarios sres rehana and mujumdar 2012 chung and nkomozepi 2012 shahid 2011 however we used the latest scenarios called representative concentration pathways rcps which are a new set of greenhouse gas scenarios represented by rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 table 3 lists the gcm models used in the development of climate smart decision support system csdss gcms grid points were selected on the basis of stations locations within the scheme area in terms of their longitude and latitude each gcm had four grid points and a representative grid point was chosen based on the average value where the values were computed on all grid points and averaged to a single weighted value the data was prepared in three future periods of 30 year time segments centered on 2020s 2010 2039 2050s 2040 2069 and 2080s 2070 2099 2 3 2 hydro meteorological downscaling because of coarse resolution of gcms projections their outputs cannot be utilized directly in water demand modeling so the gcms output was downscaled to bridge the gap the downscaling task is however complex and time consuming for assessing the risk of climate change impacts and selecting adaptation strategies in this study a hydro meteorological graphical user interface was developed that integrates the common procedures of assessing climate change impacts integrated with gcms and scenarios selection and downscaling procedures of climate variables and their future projections the interface also links the water demand model in the computational steps the interface is based on methodology of delta change factor as a statistical downscaling algorithm to create high resolution future variables at the station scale delta change is the most commonly adopted statistical downscaling technique used as an ordinary bias correction method to reduce bias between the observed station data and gcms outputs chen et al 2011 ouyang et al 2015 the algorithm modifies the observed daily time series of the climate variables by adding and or multiplying monthly mean changes of gcm outputs using adjusting formulas the adjusting formulas for modified daily rainfall are expressed by eqs 1 and 2 and the modified daily series of temperature and other parameters are expressed by eqs 3 and 4 due to lack of good quality data in the study area before stating of the project in 1976 a baseline period of 1976 2005 was adopted in this study 1 r

daily variable using the delta method observed daily denotes daily observations future denotes the average monthly gcm output for the future period and control denotes the average monthly gcm output for the control or baseline period the module was developed using matlab graphical user interface containing several scripted functions including data extraction processing and downscaling functions the step by step procedures followed in simulating the climate sequences in the hydro meteorological interface are illustrated in fig 3 the change factors for the gcm grid box encompassing the command area are calculated for each month in the future years relative to the baseline the interface can be applied to other geographical areas by simply incorporating the observed data of those stations and their corresponding baseline and future gcms outputs in the working folder additionally the change factors can always be updated quickly if new gcms and emission scenarios become available in the future the change factor technique has been widely applied in crop water demand calculation and hydrological studies around the world chung and nkomozepi 2012 knox et al 2010 diaz nieto and wilby 2005 2 4 reference evapotranspiration simulation module modeling irrigation water demand for assessing impacts of climate change requires estimating reference evapotranspiration eto for baseline period and future projections the fao penman monteith model is widely adopted for estimating eto to provide relatively consistent values with actual crop water use data worldwide allen et al 1998 the model is expressed by 5 e t o t s 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 where etot s is standardized reference crop evapotranspiration for short grass mm day 1 in period t at downscaling

vapour pressure deficit kpa Œ¥ is slope of vapour pressure curve k pa c 1 and Œ≥ is psychrometric constant k pa c 1 the downscaled hydro meteorological variables such as air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were used as input to the eto model eq 5 for evaluating the anticipated changes it is noted that solar radiation could not be downscaled directly owing to the non existence of solar radiation data from gcms archives a simple temperature based equation by hargreaves and samani 1982 was used to estimate the solar radiation r s as 6 r s k r s t m a x t m i n 1 2 r a where krs is an adjustment factor that is equal to 0 16 for interior locations and 0 19 for coastal locations tmax and tmin are the mean monthly maximum and minimum air temperatures c respectively and ra is extraterrestrial radiation w m 2 which was computed following allen et al 1998 a stand alone graphical user interface was designed with several scripted codes and functions for the eto module using matlab programming following a step by step process as illustrated in fig 4 2 5 crop water demand simulation 2 5 1 water balance model for rice fields for evaluating the impact of climate change on

effective rainfall e r j eq 7 on period j at downscaling station s was estimated by using the drainage model of the international rice research institute irri 1977 as 8 e r j s r f j s f o r d r j 0 9

evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated based on relationship between reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient eq 10 as 10 e t c j p s e t o j p s k c j p s where etc j p s is crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 kcj p s is crop coefficient dimensionless and etoj p s is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 of rice crop p for period j at downscaling station s the crop coefficient values experimentally determined by chan and cheong 2001 in several rice fields of the tanjung karang irrigation scheme are depicted in fig 6 reference evapotranspiration values were computed by using fao penman monteith method eq 5 from the reference evapotranspiration module based on gcms data and imported to the water demand simulation module 2 5 4 pre saturation water requirements and seepage rate mr84 is a widely adopted rice variety in malaysia with growth duration of 120 125 days wet direct seeding method is practiced in the irrigation scheme pre saturation is an important initial stage prior to planting of rice crop water for pre saturation was supplied at a rate of 18 5 mm day 1 ha 1 for a period of 14 days to the irrigation blocks of irrigation service area isa i table 2 followed by land preparation and drainage of excess water if there was any similar supply rate was followed to irrigation blocks of the other irrigation service areas isas ii iii and iv each staggered by one month form the other the seepage and percolation rate were estimated as 1 3 mm day 1 following field test of did and feasibility study of jica 1998 water requirements for

irrigation water requirement irrigation water requirement is the main consideration for planning designing and day to day operation of an irrigation scheme the irrigation water requirement irj for k

of irrigation water demand under climate change scenarios is illustrated in the working flow diagram of fig 5 2 6 design and development of dss user interface the csdss rimis tool consists of three basic modules i hydro meteorological simulation ii reference evapotranspiration simulation and iii water demand simulation all modules are contained within a single working folder in designing the interface a criterion for modular development was adopted so that analyses can be done separately where necessary the interface is structured in matlab with its graphical user interface development environment guide which is a useful platform to design user interface the key advantage for using matlab is its computational capability the interface is based on a mouse driven approach with pop up windows pull down menus and button controls in designing the interface several scripted functions based on ten gcms were developed each running under three rcp scenarios rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 the design of the interface includes creating gcms calendars to account for gcms with all 365 days in a year for computing change factors the modules are inter connected through the graphical user interface which provides users with ability to access data and outputs from the system the gcms data are contained in matlab database allowing for quick update of data as new climate scenarios and gcms become available on activation of the csdss rimis model the main dialog window appears in matlab environment after activating dialog windows of the three modules a simulation dialog window allows for generating daily sequences of hydro meteorological variables to run a simulation for rainfall the user has to select the station variable of interest gcm rcp scenario combination and simulation period by using the drop down buttons the future hydro climatic parameters of a station are produced by perturbing the station the parameters are derived by using change factors from the mean projected changes which are simulated from gcms for the same variables simulation outputs can be obtained from each of the ten gcms or through multi models projections based on selected rcp emission scenario the outputs can be generated as daily time series and long term monthly time scale and can be viewed as tables and graphs the outputs are then imported to water demand module for simulation of irrigation water demands for running the reference evapotranspiration simulation the basic information like station gcm scenario and irrigation date are selected by using drop down buttons in reference et simulation dialog window the hydro meteorological variables generated from the gcms outputs and their change factors are the main inputs in computing the reference evapotranspiration eto the time series of eto is generated for the selected irrigation period by pressing simulation of eto time series button the simulated eto outputs include daily eto series mean monthly eto multi scenario comparisons and multi future comparisons the eto outputs can be imported to the water demand module for computing recommended irrigation water demands for the target irrigation areas the water demand simulation module simulates irrigation demands by taking inputs from all irrigation service areas as the season advances the user has to provide station gcm scenario and irrigation date in the simulation dialog window the user also needs to adjust crop input data like length of growth stage crop factors irrigation efficiency and seepage and pre saturation rates daily eto and rainfall data are imported from the previous modules effective rainfall is computed within the module other input data are provided by the model as default values that can be changed manually if needed with required input data simulation of irrigation water demand is done by clicking the simulate future scheme water demand button the outputs can be viewed as tables and graphs the module allows for saving the inputs and outputs into matlab database or in excel format the developed csdss tool was applied to tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme to assess climate change impacts on key hydro climatic parameters and irrigation water demands several outputs were generated from the model using both single gcm model s and multi model projections however due to space constraint only few selected outputs are discusssed in this paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 csdss rimis model simulation outputs 3 1 1 hydro meteorological variables fig 6 represents long term monthly rainfall simulated by gcm models for 2050s period under rcp4 5 scenario most gcms predicted higher annual rainfall compared to the baseline values with the exception of cnrm csiro and hadgem2 es models which predicted 3 0 4 5 and 2 9 less rainfall compared to the baseline period these differences in simulated monthly rainfall emphasize the uncertainties within the climate models in simulating rainfall table 4 provides summary of analyses of changes in future rainfall on monthly time scale for multi scenario case for the periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 fig 7 illustrates the projected mean monthly rainfall using multi models and rcp scenarios for three future periods of 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 relative to the baseline period of 1976 2005 rcp4 5 scenario shows increasing trends in monthly rainfall also for future periods except in june and december when the rainfall decreased by 3 7 8 and 2 9 1 6 in 2020s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 the monthly rainfall distribution shows increasing trend in the near future 2020s and a decreasing trend in january february march and december however rcp6 0 scenario shows a decreasing trend in all the months of the year and all future periods with the greatest decrease in january 35 6 february 26 4 and march 32 6 climate projection in the study area thus reveals a decrease in rainfall in dry season january june but increase in wet season july december other rainfall related outputs such as effective rainfall wet and dry spell lengths and weekly rainfall can also be generated from the interface these analyses can be used periodically to compare the model outputs with station rainfall data for identifying climate change signals its magnitude and direction of change such information can assist water managers and farmers in developing relevant adaptation and mitigation plans for irrigation water management it is apparent from these outputs that under rcps 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 scenarios annual rainfall is projected to increase by 5 6 3 3 and 8 7 during 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively however rcp6 0 scenario shows a decrease in annual rainfall by 10 6 6 8 and 10 5 during 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively 3 1 2 reference evapotranspiration fig 8 illustrates an example of mean monthly reference evapotranspiration eto for january december of 2017 that was projected by using a single climate model ccsm4 under rcp4 5 scenario the overall projected annual eto is 1410 2 mm which is consistent with the expected observed eto values from the scheme area all gcms predict increase in future eto under rcp4 5 scenario with respect to the baseline period the largest annual mean change in eto 2 9 was obtained with csiro model and the lowest 0 4 was with hadgem2 cc model the largest mean monthly eto was obtained for the dry season march august with the highest value obtained for july and the lowest for november with all models 3 1 3 water demand projection irrigation requirements vary with the emission scenarios rcps 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 and that high irrigation requirement is obtained for march april where all irrigation service areas are fully planted the model outputs also reveal that the main wet season july december has no irrigation requirements due to heavy rainfall during that period 3 2 modeling hydro climatic parameters under climate change impacts 3 2 1 effective rainfall changes in effective rainfall differ considerably with the gcms and rcp scenarios with no general trend table 5 and fig 9 the effective rainfall is projected to increase during off season from the baseline value of 386 mm by 3 4 0 8 and 7 6 for 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp4 5 the percentage values in parenthesis are for rcp8 5 there is also a noticeable decrease of the effective rainfall 7 6 in the late century under rcp8 5 a similar nature of variation is observed in the main season with the exception of rcp6 0 scenario significant decrease in rainfall is observed with the csiro and hadgem2 es models while mpi esm lr and canesm2 models predicted marked increase in future effective rainfall the change in rainfall is generally not defined by the characteristics of a given model but it depends largely on the gcm s physical parameterizations chung and nkomozepi 2012 the prediction of effective rainfall is therefore a major source of uncertainty in impact assessments despite their variations most gcms predicted an increase in effective rainfall for all future scenarios under investigation this information will help understanding water management in rice irrigation in the future 3 2 2 reference evapotranspiration the annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures continuously increase in the 2020s 2050s and 2080s over the baseline period for the three rcp scenarios table 6 there is a general consensus in all gcm models with respect to temperature increase in the future under all three emission scenarios this implies that the scheme area under study is expected to be warmer in the future especially during the off dry season months this predicted future change is consistent with the ipcc findings for south east asia region stocker 2014 solomon et al 2007 table 6 also presents annual changes in reference evapotranspiration eto for the three future periods under the three rcp scenarios under the three rcps eto increases in the scheme area by 1 6 3 7 0 8 4 7 and 1 6 9 1 during 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 periods respectively with respect to the baseline period of 1976 2005 the highest eto is 1549 8 mm under rcp 8 5 during 2080s and the lowest eto is 1431 6 mm under rcp6 0 during 2020s similar to temperature change there is also consensus in the gcm projected annual changes in eto under all scenarios throughout the future periods with all models projecting future increase in eto as provided in table 7 significant increase in monthly eto is prominent during the dry season months march july fig 10 the highest increase is 14 2 under rcp 8 5 most severe scenario during the 2080s and the lowest increase is 0 2 under rcp 6 0 in the near future 2020s the analysis unequivocally reveals that the projected increase in temperature has a direct impact on eto and consequently will have the effect on crop water demand the projected increase in the annual eto fig 11 under the three rcp scenarios for the three future periods clearly demonstrates that irrigation requirements are expected to increase in the future therefore climate smart appropriate adaptation strategies will be crucial towards meeting crop water demand under future climatic conditions based on the projection future monthly changes in temperature for the three future periods under the three rcp scenarios with respect to baseline period are expected to increase in rcp8 5 scenario significant monthly increase in temperature is predicted with maximum increase between 3 5 c and 3 7 c more warming is estimated during the off season in the irrigation scheme compared to the main season the anticipated irrigation demands of the rice crop are examined for the future emission scenarios by accounting for the changes in rainfall and reference evapotranspiration fig 12 based on the gcm outputs demonstrates that more water will be needed in the future except in october and november the predicted trends of warming due to increase in temperature are expected to cause increase in reference evapotranspiration in the future periods 3 2 3 crop evapotranspiration paddy crop evapotranspiration etc was computed by using penman monteith model eq 5 based on the time varying crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration eto the seasonal crop evapotranspiration increases in the future periods over the baseline period following different trends for the three rcp scenarios and future periods table 8 on average etc for the off dry season varies from 1008 to 1021 mm 1 1 2 5 under rcp 4 5 1003 to 1029 mm 0 7 3 3 under rcp 6 0 and 1009 to 1058 mm 1 2 6 1 under rcp 8 5 scenarios similarly the variation is from 948 to 958 mm 0 6 1 7 under rcp 4 5 945 to 961 mm 0 2 2 0 under rcp 6 0 and 947 to 981 mm 0 5 4 1 under rcp 8 5 during the main season the highest etc for the worst case scenario rcp 8 5 is estimated to be 8 5 mm day 1 march april and 2 6 mm day 1 june july during the off season the lowest etc is 7 3 mm day 1 september october and 2 3 mm day 1 december january during the main season as expected etc is found higher in the dry season than in the wet season due to future increase in temperature and subsequent increase in eto in the dry season 3 2 4 irrigation water requirements irrigation requirements are higher in the off season compared to the main season for the off season the mean irrigation water requirement is projected to increase up to 0 1 613 mm under rcp 4 5 13 7 694 mm under rcp 6 0 and 10 5 675 mm under rcp 8 5 for 2080s period with respect to baseline period table 9 during the main season irrigation water requirements are projected to decrease in all three future periods and rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the projected decrease in irrigation water requirement for 2020s 2050s and 2080s is 5 4 382 mm 3 8 388 mm and 2 9 392 mm respectively under rcp 4 5 and 6 8 376 mm l 3 2 390 mm and 1 7 410 mm increase during 2080s respectively under rcp 8 5 the main reason for the decrease in irrigation water requirement is attributed to significant contribution from effective rainfall however the high medium rcp6 0 scenario exhibits the highest increase in irrigation water requirement in all future periods and seasons this would be possibly due to unavailability of data for this scenario at the archives of some gcms canesm2 cnrm cm5 hadgem2 cc and mpi esm lr the rcp 6 0 scenario should therefore be used with great caution in future application of the csdss rimis tool february to may of the off season will require more irrigation water in the 2080s under rcp 8 5 scenario with a maximum requirement of 29 4 in march fig 13 the average irrigation requirement would be the highest 5 2 mm day 1 during march april and lowest 1 9 mm day 1 during may june the first future period 2020s does not show much increase in irrigation water demand under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in the same manner the main season will be dominated by high rainfall events which will lead to less irrigation requirements especially in november and december it is revealed that effective rainfall in the study area starts exceeding the irrigation requirements in october and continues up to december january in the future irrigation water requirements in the scheme will vary significantly over the months during the off season and the increase in effective rainfall during the main season will compensate the high water demand of the off season consequently no irrigation will be required for some months e g november and december this result is partially supported by the findings of tukimat et al 2017 who also revealed that climate change will not affect water abundance in the south east asian countries since water demand will reduce due to increase in rainfall however the major challenge will be to manage the monthly variability of irrigation water demand in the command area failure to which would lead the irrigation system to much more uncertainty since the project is a run of the river irrigation scheme with no storage reservoir 4 conclusions a user friendly climate smart decision support system for rice irrigation management information system csdss rimis was developed and tested successfully for simulating climate scenarios to enhance planning and management of irrigation water under future climate forcing for a large scale irrigation scheme tanjung karang rice irrigation project in malaysia the outputs generated by the csdss rimis tool can be obtained through individual gcms and or multi models ensemble projection the outputs of the model reveal that the future challenge for efficacious irrigation in the tanjung karang project will be to properly manage monthly variability in water demand that could lead to uncertainty in water supply since the project is a run of the river irrigation scheme with no storage reservoir the predicted change in irrigation water demand at the scheme is a function of changing patterns of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration the csdss rimis tool can be utilized as a guide for managing water resources under climate change scenario it will promote appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies like construction of storage reservoir for rainwater harvesting that can lead to sustainable water use at farm level under climate forcing the advantage of the tool is the quick simulation of a very comprehensive information that allows water managers to make fast decision for paddy field water management the easy to use tool can also make climate change discussions more practical to water users who may not be familiar with such forums although the tool has been customized for local application in a tropical rice cultivation area it can be extended to other locations by taking into account historical station data gcms and data of the locations in spite of these advantages there are some limitations of the csdss rimis tool in this study a popular downscaling approach using change factors was used that has limitations compared to other approaches further studies may adopt more sophisticated approaches which will allow more detailed analysis of climate change impacts upgrading the gcms with missing outputs under rcp 6 0 scenario and addition of the lowest scenario rcp 2 5 which was not included in the current study are needed future studies should include estimation of demand based flows in the tertiary networks including recommended irrigation supply actual irrigation supply volume of water etc these parameters have not been included in the current study but would be important
