1805,agricultural drought ad is disastrous to natural and socioeconomic systems and the propagation of meteorological drought md plays an essential role in the occurrence of ad however how uncertainty affects the mechanism of propagation from md to ad remains unclear in this study a novel method called c vbmc is developed through coupling copula function with variational bayesian monte carlo vbmc the developed c vbmc is then applied to the aral sea basin to demonstrate its feasibility and capability results indicate that the method could effectively quantify the drought propagation probability under the impact of uncertainty several findings can be summarized 1 compared with the low elevation areas the propagation time and relationship between md and ad tend to be longer and weaker in spring and winter at mid high elevation areas 2 drought propagation characteristics are significantly affected by seasonality altitude potential evapotranspiration precipitation and soil moisture 3 the posterior distribution of copula parameter by vbmc is similar with markov chain monte carlo mcmc and vbmc only takes about 50 and 5 of the computation time required by mcmc for univariate and bivariate copula functions the results highlight the superiority and flexibility of vbmc for large datasets 4 the probability of ad occurrence and the uncertainty range are easily affected by same and more severe level md 5 the propagation probabilities tend to be underestimated without uncertainty impact and the uncertainty range is lower than 0 05 for most grids this study is helpful for drought warning management and disaster prevention systems keywords drought propagation copula uncertainty variational inference aral sea basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the context of global climate warming drought has become one of the most devastating natural hazards wu et al 2021 yang et al 2022a it is expected that there is a significant upward trend in the intensity and frequency of drought events in the world clarke et al 2021 hua et al 2022 drought often occurs due to the lack of precipitation yang et al 2020a high temperature luo et al 2017 and the subsequent high evapotranspiration tijdeman et al 2018 drought can result in huge losses to natural and socioeconomic systems xu et al 2021a 2022a among all socioeconomic activities agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to drought in developing countries huang et al 2022 yang et al 2022b in the past 50 years droughts have reduced global grain production by 9 10 resulting in a loss of 29 billion to the agricultural sector of the developing countries during 2005 2015 fao 2018 therefore it is necessary to improve drought warning management system to mitigate its negative impact and achieve sustainable development meteorological drought md is defined as the precipitation is lower than normal condition for a long time over a certain area wilhite and glantz 1985 with the further development of md the long term deficient precipitation may lead to the soil water dissipation until it affects the normal condition of plant growth and food production which can trigger the agricultural drought ad liu and sun 2020 ad can lead to crop yield reduction and degradation of natural and artificial vegetation increase the probability of wind sand disasters and soil erosion in the context of anthropogenic activities and climate change the impact of drought on agricultural yield is increasingly significant therefore if the propagation mechanism from md to ad is further investigated the loss of agriculture will be effectively controlled dai et al 2022 at the same time the relationship can be used to predict ad based on md conditions thereby providing support for regional agricultural drought management and disaster prevention in recent years the propagation characteristics between md and ad have attracted much attention li et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the characteristics of drought propagation including correlation coefficients drought propagation time and conditional probability distributions are easily influenced by soil characteristics land use types and meteorological variables in addition elevation plays an important role in drought propagation due to its association with vegetation covers and or snow processes zhang et al 2022 a variety of methods have been used for analyzing drought propagation since copula function has the advantage of modeling marginal distribution and multivariate dependent structure of drought variables it is convenient to quantify the drought propagation risk xu et al 2021b however copula has several shortcomings in the application such as how to verify the optimal marginal distribution and how to quantify the uncertainty of parameter estimation yang et al 2020b few research works were reported on analyzing the uncertainty of copula function in drought propagation the uncertainty in copula function mainly stems from parameters input data and structure the uncertainty of input data reflects the limitation of measurement structure uncertainty mainly arises from the underlying assumptions of copula function parameter uncertainty reflects the errors in input data and the epistemic errors in model structure teweldebrhan et al 2018 compared with other uncertainties parameter uncertainty has gained attention and benefited from a variety of technologies in recent years bayesian analysis has been increasingly applied to copula parameter estimation and uncertainty assessment wang et al 2022 yue et al 2022 markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling based on bayesian framework is increasingly applied to approximate posterior distributions pan et al 2022 however mcmc is intractable for a sized problem such as agricultural drought propagation as it is slow to sample and imposes a high computational cost to estimate a large scale parameter variable li et al 2021 as an alternative approach to approximate bayesian inference variational inference vi is scalable computationally efficient and broadly applicable for uncertainty analysis studies in many fields vi approximates posterior probability density through optimization instead of sampling representative with mcmc the goal of vi is to find a family of distribution that is closest to the true posterior distributions via maximizing the evidence lower bound elbo it is equivalent to minimizing the kullback leibler kl divergence compared with mcmc the merit of vi is that it is faster and more scalable to large datasets and the total number of required likelihood function evaluations is much smaller compared with mcmc however both vi and mcmc generally require either detailed information of the model or large number of model evaluations acerbi 2018 developed a variational bayesian monte carlo vbmc algorithm combines vi and gaussian process gp based active sampling bayesian quadrate vbmc is a state of the art vi based approach as it intends to be sample efficient without accessing detailed knowledge of the model this objective of this study is to combine copula and vbmc to quantify the propagation relationship and underlying uncertainties between md and ad the feasibility and applicability of c vbmc will be demonstrated in the aral sea basin asb that is a typical arid and semi arid area the main novelty and contribution of this study are 1 this is the first attempt to develop a novel method i e c vbmc through coupling copula function with vbmc to quantify the uncertainty impacts on drought propagation 2 vi based technique i e vbmc is firstly applied in climate domains as an alternative method of mcmc 3 the relationship and uncertainty of drought propagation between md and ad over asb are investigated with the impact of seasonality and elevation and the results are expected to support drought adapting strategies 2 methodology fig 1 shows the framework of c vbmc method standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized soil moisture index ssmi are used to identify md and ad in this study the pearson correlation coefficient is adopted to characterize the drought correlation and propagation time from md to ad copula is applied to model the joint probability distribution of md and ad vbmc based on variational inference algorithm is introduced as an alternative of mcmc to quantify the uncertainty during the drought propagation progress 2 1 drought index and propagation time as a widely used md monitoring and analysis indicator spei is calculated by precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration with various timescales the spei is obtained by using the inverse of the standard normal distribution at various time scales previous study has shown that the average renewal cycle of ad is 12 months the propagation time selected in this study is m months m 12 using the variations in the spei m with various timescales i e 1 12 months other than the single scale s spei can better represent the true md conditions according to the literature recommendation das et al 2022 the log logistic distribution is selected as the parametric distribution for spei similar to spei ssmi 1 is introduced as an analysis indicator to analyze the short time scale 1 month ad condition and the gamma distribution is selected each spei ssmi series has been classified 4 levels by drought severity including mild drought 1 spei ssmi 0 5 moderate drought 1 5 spei ssmi 1 severe drought 2 spei ssmi 1 5 and extreme drought 2 spei ssmi the drought propagation time dpt reflects the accumulated precipitation deficit time from the beginning of md to the onset of ad and it can be simplified into a correlation analysis between ssmi 1 and spei m in different accumulation periods for example the dpt is 4 months for ssmi in july summer it means that the accumulated precipitation deficit is from april spring and the accumulated precipitation deficit induces ad in july summer the pearson correlation coefficient between the two kinds of drought is calculated to determine the relationship between ssmi 1 and spei m at various timescales wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 the timescale m of spei corresponding to the maximum pearson correlation coefficient mpcc represents the drought propagation time a shorter propagation time of spei and ssmi indicates a faster response of soil moisture shortage to precipitation deficiency 2 2 copula theory copula function is powerful for constructing the dependence structure among bivariate random variables ansell and dalla valle 2022 in this study copula function is introduced to analyze the joint distribution for spei m and ssmi after mpcc and propagation time m are determined mathematically given two drought indices spei m and ssmi with marginal distributions f spei m s p e i and f ssmi s s m i their joint cumulative probability distribution f spei m s s m i s p e i s s m i can be expressed as follows 1 p s p e i m s p e i s s m i s s m i f spei m s s m i s p e i s s m i c f spei m s p e i f ssmi s s m i where f spei m s p e i and f ssmi s s m i are marginal cumulative distribution functions for bivariate variables spei m and ssmi in this study 5 parametric models of copula families are selected the mathematical description and parameter range are shown in table s1 according to the joint probability distribution formulated by copula function the conditional probability between ad and md is further test to estimate the probabilities of ad occurrences under md conditions for instance the occurrence probability of mild ad under mild md can be formulated as 2 p 1 s p e i m 0 5 1 s s m i 0 5 f spei m s s m i 0 5 0 5 f spei m s s m i 1 0 5 f spei m 0 5 f spei m 1 2 3 vbmc the variational bayesian monte carlo vbmc is a state of the art technique based on bayesian theory that connects variation inference vi and gaussian process gp based active sampling bayesian quadrature vbmc can simultaneously compute approximation of the model parameters bayesian posterior distribution and a lower bound to the model evidence with highly efficient computational ability the main steps of vbmc are described in algorithm s1 vi is used to find a simple proposal distribution that is closest to the true posterior distribution p θ y 0 over parameter θ the simple proposal distributions are referred to as the variational distributions in vi let the variational distributions be defined as q θ λ governed by the latent parameter variable matrix λ λ 1 λ 2 λ n r s n with the number of variational parameters s in each proposal variational distribution in vbmc s is mixed at 2 because a mixture of gaussian distribution with two parameters i e mean and variance are selected the difference between variational distribution q θ λ and true posterior distribution p θ y 0 is usually quantified by the kl divergence the kl divergence of vi is provided 3 k l q θ λ p θ y 0 ℓ λ log p y 0 which can be rewritten as 4 log p y 0 k l q θ λ p θ y 0 ℓ λ ℓ λ with 5 ℓ λ e q log p y 0 θ log q θ λ where e q means the expectation concerning q θ λ the goal of vi is to find a variational distribution q θ λ which is closest to the true posterior distribution p θ y 0 by minimizing the kl divergence however the computation of eq 3 is intractable because it requires the evaluation of log p y 0 that is unknown since kl divergence is non negative and log p y 0 is a constant minimizing the kl divergence is equivalent to maximizing ℓ λ i e evidence lower bound elbo in order to estimate the marginal likelihood gp based bayesian quadrature is introduced bayesian quadrature can obtain bayesian estimates of the mean and variance of non analytical integrals of the form f f x π x d x where f is a function of interest and π is a known probability distribution typically gp is used as a flexible class of models for unknown function approximations gp is defined by 1 a mean function about the mean at any point of the input space and 2 a positive definite covariance function or kernel function that sets the covariance between points conditioned on independent training inputs x x 1 x n and associated function values y f x the gp posterior will have latent posterior conditional mean and covariance c ξ x x c x x ξ φ in closed form where ξ x y is the set of training input data for the gp and φ is a hyperparameter vector for the gp posterior mean and covariance since integration is a linear operator the mean and variance of the integral f x π x d x are specified and expressed as follows 6 e f ξ f ξ x π x d x 7 v f ξ f c ξ x x π x d x π x d x crucially the integrals in eq 5 can be calculated analytically if f is a gp with gaussian kernel and π is a gaussian or mixture of gaussians in order to minimize the posterior variance of the final integral the choice of the input samples x is implemented for a given sample budget n max monte carlo sampling can be introduced to estimate the entropy of the variational posterior in eq 6 in this way stochastic gradient ascent is used to maximum elbo further implementation and mathematical derivations of vbmc are illustrated in acerbi 2018 3 case study and data copula vbmc method is applied to analyzing drought propagation and the uncertainty for the aral sea basin asb with an area of 2 48 106 km2 the asb is located in the core of eurasia 55 95 79 40 e and 35 17 47 82 n and covers five countries i e uzbekistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and kazakhstan with the impact of decreased precipitation and increased evaporation asb has become one of the hotspots of climate change and the drought over asb will be aggregated most parts of asb are vulnerable to droughts due to the fragile ecosystem intense water shortage and rapidly growing population guo et al 2018 jiang et al 2021 drought events have caused a huge loss on natural and socioeconomic systems for example the drought during 2000 2001 resulted in a direct loss of 800 million dollars to the agricultural sector bank 2006 guo et al 2022 despite the increasing drought risk the study on drought propagation over asb has received limited attention in recent years asb consists of two major tributaries the amu darya river and the syr darya river the precipitation and temperature in the asb are distributed with highly temporal heterogeneities characterized by cold moist winter and hot dry summer compared with the low elevation areas the precipitation is mainly concentrated in the mid high elevation areas xu et al 2022b with the increase of precipitation the vegetation cover in the mid high elevation areas is an important ecological security barrier in preventing wind sand fixation and water erosion especially in fragile regional ecosystems agriculture has a large contribution 10 45 to gross domestic product gdp and employs 20 50 of the labor force over asb due to the limited water resource in the asb the soil moisture is closely related to the changes of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration understanding the propagation relationship and uncertainty between md and ad is critical to the social economy in asb hamidov et al 2016 elevation determines the growth of crops all elevations 1500 m are suitable for rain fed cultivation zhang et al 2022 in order to discuss the impact of elevation on drought propagation asb is divided into two parts fig 2 low elevation areas elevation 1500 m and mid high elevation areas elevation 1500 m in order to fully understand the drought propagation characteristics between md and ad it is necessary to ensure that the selected data have high spatial resolution and long term time series according to the past study hu et al 2018 monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are provided by climatic research unit gridded time series cru ts https badc nerc ac uk data cru which are from 1949 to 2014 with a spatial resolution 0 5 0 5 monthly soil moisture data are collected from global land data assimilation system gldas https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas from 1949 to 2014 with a spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 in order to reduce system bias the data are interpolated to 0 25 digital elevation models dem are collected from shuttle radar topography mission https www gscloud cn home 4 result and discussion the spei with various timescales can reflect the md conditions and finally affect ad to quantify the propagation characteristics from md to ad the pearson correlation coefficients between spei m and ssmi 1 are calculated the maximum pearson correlation coefficient mpcc represents the response relationship of ad under md conditions the drought propagation time dpt is determined by the timescale of spei m corresponding to mpcc the dpt refers to the accumulated precipitation deficit in m months and further causes the soil moisture deficiency and pose threat to normal growth of crops following the previous study xu et al 2021b the relationship and propagation time based on monthly ssmi 1 series and spei m series are discussed for months and seasons spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november winter december january and february 4 1 relationship and propagation time from md to ad fig 3 a shows the spatial distribution of mpcc between ssmi 1 and spei m in the asb based on 2428 grid cells in different seasons and months the results show the correlation of md and ad in the asb varies significantly across seasons the seasonal and monthly variation illustrate that climatic factors e g precipitation and potential evapotranspiration have obvious impact on the relationship between ad and md more than 99 of grids are significantly correlated between spei and ssmi p 0 01 63 of grids in the asb show a significant relationship between ssmi and spei with mpcc 0 6 the mean mpcc for spring summer autumn and winter are 0 68 0 61 0 63 and 0 60 respectively compared with other seasons the correlation coefficients of spring and winter are highest and lowest respectively it might be attributed to the fact that the rainfall in the asb is mainly concentrated in spring with low potential evapotranspiration which leads to a close relationship between ssmi and spei in spring limited precipitation mainly supplements the shortage of soil moisture and does not form effective runoff as the temperature exceeds 0 the precipitation could effectively replenish the soil moisture in april and may with the decrease of precipitation the correlation coefficients between md and ad decrease significantly in july september due to the low surface temperature the snowfall could not directly supplement the soil moisture in winter besides climatic and seasonal factors the spatial distribution of mpcc is easily affected by the elevation distribution the mpcc distribution of four seasons and twelve months in low and mid high elevation areas are shown in fig 3b and c the results suggest that mpcc distribution is significantly varied with the elevation distribution in various months and seasons compared with the low elevation areas the mpcc are lower for spring and winter with the impact of dew point higher for summer and autumn in mid high elevation areas for example the mpcc in august are 0 48 and 0 71 for low and mid high elevation areas due to the perennial snow and frozen soil at mid high elevation areas in spring the linkage between md and ad reaches the lowest level 0 51 the low elevation areas tend to have low vegetation coverage the dynamic changes of soil moisture are closely related to climatic factors which results in the higher correlation coefficients between md and ad in spring with the more precipitation and less potential evapotranspiration in summer and autumn at mid high elevation areas md and ad have higher mpcc than the same seasons at low elevation areas furthermore the irrigation and other human activity are intensified at low elevation areas in summer and autumn in the context of climate change both the relationship and drought propagation time dpt between md and ad will be affected and changed the spatial distribution of dpt over different seasons and months in the asb are shown in fig 4 a the results suggest that the spatial distribution of dpt differ more significantly in spring especially in march and april than other seasons it is attributed to the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation the snow and frozen soil in winter and early spring i e march melt to replenish soil moisture as the temperature rises in spring and summer the long dpt illustrate that the ad in winter and spring should be partly attributed to the md in autumn even in summer since summer and autumn are the most important plant growing seasons crops need lots of water from the soil to maintain the growth artificial irrigation or precipitation are required to avoid ad with the impact of complex topography and climatic condition e g temperature atmospheric pressure wind speed the dpt in mountains varies significantly in different seasons in general the proportions of the pixels with the dpt within 3 months in the asb are 53 91 97 and 61 over various seasons with the impact of snow melt and deficient of precipitation the proportions of the pixels with the dpt within 3 months are highest 99 and lowest 29 for november and march respectively compared with the mountain areas the dpt between md and ad in plains are constantly shorter it illustrates that the ad in plain areas are closely related to the changes in regional precipitation potential evapotranspiration by global climate warming and water cycle intensification the dpt in low and mid high elevation areas are shown in fig 4b and c compared with the mid high elevation areas the dpt in low elevation areas are more dispersed the dpt in spring and winter show a significant difference in low and mid high elevation areas the dpt tend to be longer in mid high elevation areas specifically the mean dpt between md and ad are 2 90 2 82 and 6 60 5 57 months in spring winter for low and mid high elevation areas respectively in low elevation areas the proportions of the pixels with the dpt within 3 months are 62 and 72 for spring and winter respectively however the dpt over 3 months are 99 and 98 for spring and winter in mid high elevation areas van loon et al 2014 also found that the impact of seasonality on drought propagation is strong in mid high elevation regions where the snow accumulation hinders the recovery processes of agricultural drought in winter and early spring results suggest that elevation is significantly important for dpt in spring and winter via vegetation cover temperature and other climatic conditions the dpt in summer and autumn for low and mid high elevation areas are similar the dpt of almost all grids are within 3 months it is partly attributed to the precipitation shortage and the growth of plants in general the drought propagation characteristics i e mpcc and dpt over asb are influenced by seasonality and elevation dpt at mid high elevation areas tend to be prolonged in spring and winter compared with that at low elevation areas on the contrary the mpcc are lower in spring and winter and higher in summer and autumn at mid high elevation areas the reason may be that unlike the monsoon climate asb has an arid to semi arid continental climate which monthly precipitation is low in summer most rainfall occurs in winter and spring jiang et al 2021 furthermore the precipitation concentrates in mid high elevation areas instead of low elevation areas 4 2 impact factors of drought propagation ad refers to the insufficient water supply to meet the needs of plant growth and crop production md is the trigger of ad and has an important impact on agricultural crop loss compared with the regional drought propagation characteristics the impact of climatic factors and altitude on the seasonal drought propagation characteristics are more obvious li et al 2022a figs 3 and 4 show that mpcc and dpt significantly vary at different altitude and seasons especially in spring and winter the previous studies demonstrated that altitude can affect drought propagation characteristics due to the connection with temperature or land cover zhang et al 2022 the temperature and land cover further affect the process of drought propagation the relationship between altitude and mpcc dpt is calculated and shown in fig s1 altitude can significantly affect mpcc in spring and dpt in spring and winter with the increase of altitude the process of rain to snow occurs more frequently and hinders drought propagation moreover elevation is positively correlated with slope at high elevation areas the precipitation tends to rapidly transform to runoff instead of slowly replenish soil moisture the relationships between drought propagation characteristics and precipitation at different altitude areas are shown in fig s2 the results suggest that the relationships significantly vary with elevation and precipitation compared with mpcc at mid high elevation areas and dpt precipitation is a more important impact factor for mpcc at low elevation areas due to the low precipitation and insufficient soil moisture mpcc at low elevation areas is more sensitive with the precipitation ding et al 2021 precipitation can effectively replenish soil moisture as well as alleviate agricultural drought among all seasons the relationship between mpcc and precipitation in winter is weakest because the source of soil moisture is indirectly recharged from snowmelt besides the interception of precipitation snow by forest vegetation at high altitude can prolong the conversion time of precipitation snow to soil moisture leading to a prolonged dpt between md and ad yang et al 2022c except for precipitation potential evapotranspiration is another important climatic factor affecting drought propagation potential evapotranspiration a complex factor connected with temperature and vapor pressure affects the process by which precipitation replenishes soil moisture and soil moisture evaporation harris et al 2020 as shown in fig s3 the relationship between mpcc and potential evapotranspiration is obvious for most seasons however in summer and autumn the correlation coefficients are reversed at low and mid high elevation areas under the high potential evapotranspiration condition the water cycle at low elevation areas is accelerated rare precipitation evaporates quickly on the contrary high potential evapotranspiration at mid high elevation areas avoids runoff from precipitation and improves the response mechanism between ad and md the relationship between potential evapotranspiration and dpt is negative generally high potential evapotranspiration limits the accumulation of soil moisture and shorten dpt li et al 2022b the relationship between soil moisture and drought propagation characteristics is presented in fig s4 at low elevation areas the correlation coefficients are positive in summer and spring which are characterized by hot and dry the precipitation could directly replenish soil moisture and alleviate soil drought yang et al 2022c at mid high elevation areas the saturated soil moisture could promote the production of runoff by precipitation eventually resulting in a negative relationship between soil moisture and mpcc compared with mpcc dpt is positively correlated with soil moisture with the increase of sm the capacity of resisting md is raised and the dpt is prolonged in general drought propagation characteristics are affected by altitude precipitation potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture mpcc is susceptible to potential evapotranspiration and precipitation while dpt is mainly affected by altitude and soil moisture 4 3 comparison of mcmc and vbmc the posterior parameters distribution and computation time of vbmc and mcmc are discussed mcmc is used as a benchmark according to sadegh et al 2017 with the default settings fig 5 displays the posterior parameters probability density functions pdfs of the five copula functions table s1 using vbmc and mcmc in a random grid of the asb in general the posterior distribution of copula parameters calculated by vbmc matches quite well with that of mcmc except the second parameter of student t copula i e t θ2 the posterior of t θ2 is more narrow compared with that of mcmc it may be partially attributed to the non normal posterior distribution of the parameter and complex structure of student t copula function vbmc only captures the main part of pdf except similar results as mcmc in the copula parameter posterior distribution vbmc also greatly saves the computational cost in terms of the total number of iterations where each iteration corresponds to one likelihood function evaluation it is difficult to display the convergence trace of copula parameter for each grid as the asb with 2428 grids the parameter uncertainty analysis of five copula functions is randomly selected and discussed over the basin the convergences of vbmc and mcmc are diagnosed until the values of elbo do not change with the iteration and rhat is lower than 1 2 the iteration times using vbmc mcmc are 12 120 14 190 13 240 14 280 and 13 200 for gaussian clayton frank gumbel and student t copula function respectively furthermore more than 104 samples are usually needed in mcmc algorithm which require a huge number of likelihood function evaluations the results indicate a huge reduction in the likelihood function evaluations and its potential application to the uncertainty analysis of massive data in future studies alternatively the simulation efficiency of vbmc and mcmc can be compared through the total computational time in order to reduce computation time bias and illustrate its flexibility ten random pixels for each copula functions in the asb are selected to compare the mean computation time between vbmc and mcmc for five copula functions the estimation time using vbmc mcmc are 198 8 399 176 5 402 9 175 2 351 1 183 9 380 6 and 338 6 7510 seconds for gaussian clayton frank gumbel and student t copula function respectively as expected vbmc is more efficient in terms of computational time compared with mcmc despite it is difficult to directly compared the efficiency of vbmc and mcmc vbmc could produce a quite reasonable estimate in the limited time especially the complexity of the student t copula function makes it really expensive in computational cost for the mcmc approach in general the results demonstrate that vbmc can be considered as a reliable alternative of mcmc for quantifying copula parameter uncertainty vbmc could generate uncertainty analysis results similar to mcmc while taking only about 50 and 5 of the computation time required by mcmc for univariate and bivariate copula function calculations are carried out with amd r7 4800h processor and 16 gb ram using the personal laptop 4 4 propagation of drought severity and uncertainty analysis in this study c vbmc is used for modelling bivariate probability distribution to quantify monthly drought propagation risk and uncertainty analysis from md to ad at each grid scale 0 25 0 25 based on the propagation time a joint distribution between md and ad is modelled using the monthly ssmi 1 series and its corresponding spei m series for low and mid high elevation areas the probabilities of four ad levels under four md levels across four seasons are analyzed and discussed fig 6 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf for the different ad levels probability and related uncertainty range which reveals the regional different ad levels risk under different md levels in low and mid high elevation areas for various md ad pairs the cdf changes significantly in general with the increase of md severity level the cdf curve of moderate sever and extreme ad move from the left side to the right side of the panel furthermore ad is easily propagated by more severe and same level md for example as shown in fig 7 the regional mean probability of mild ad is quantified as 0 288 0 272 0 300 0 276 0 253 0 220 and 0 210 0 174 when mild moderate severe and extreme md occurs in low mid high elevation areas respectively moreover the mean probability of severe ad is quantified as 0 050 0 047 0 100 0 098 0 163 0 170 and 0 227 0 242 respectively the phenomenon is also found for moderate and extreme ad conditions fig s5 the results suggest that the propagation relationship from md to ad over the asb are peer to peer the cdf of ad probability under md for various seasons is noticeably different for example the mean probability of extreme ad is quantified as 0 105 0 112 0 019 0 074 0 044 0 045 and 0 091 0 027 when md occur for four seasons in low mid high elevation regions the seasons with the high propagation sensitivity from md to ad are spring and winter in low elevation areas the results are consistent with the spatial temporal distribution of precipitation from spring to winter the lower tail of the cdf shift to the top affected by the complex geographical and climatic conditions the mean probability of extreme ad in winter over mid high elevation areas is lowest specifically under the extreme md conditions the proportion of extreme ad with the probability lower than 0 01 is about 65 in mid high elevation areas as shown in fig 6 c vbmc could effectively quantify the uncertainty range of ad probability under various md conditions take the extreme ad as an example the regional mean propagation probability and uncertainty range are quantified as 0 24 and 0 23 0 28 the uncertainty range is not significantly notable by regional mean values however it is an important role in the analysis of ad probability for some grids for instance the severe ad probability at 68 625 e and 41 875 n is 0 34 under extreme md conditions in spring the uncertainty range is 0 17 0 43 as shown in fig 8 most of the maximum positive propagation probability changes under uncertainty impact maximum propagation probability under uncertainty minus propagation probability without uncertainty are lower than 0 05 under mild and severe md similar with propagation probability distribution the maximum positive propagation probability changes are easily affected by more severe and same level md figs 8 and s6 for example the maximum positive propagation probability changes of severe ad mainly concentrate on the severe and extreme md conditions a drought event usually begins when the drought index decreases below a threshold i e 0 5 in this study and may persist the mild drought 1 drought indices 0 5 or continue to fall to more severe level drought in contrast the drought terminates when the drought index rises above the threshold level schwalm et al 2017 during the development and recovery drought milder drought will be experienced similarly the propagation probability and uncertainty tend to be affected by more sever and same level md compared with the maximum positive propagation probability changes the maximum negative propagation probability changes minimum propagation probability under uncertainty minus propagation probability without uncertainty are less obvious fig s7 furthermore there is not obvious difference of uncertainty range for different elevation areas in general the uncertainty range under extreme md is always more obvious for different ad levels than under other levels of md conditions furthermore compared with other md conditions the cdf curve exhibits a wider range of changes in ad probability under extreme md these results indicate that the method of projecting ad by detecting the response relationship between ad and md is more difficult under extreme md condition more attention should be applied on the ad induced by extreme md the results illustrate the importance of uncertainty in drought propagation between md and ad 5 conclusions in this study a novel method named as c vbmc has been developed to investigate the drought propagation characteristics and make uncertainty estimates c vbmc firstly incorporates copula function and variational bayesian monte carlo within a general framework the developed method is applied and examined in the asb for various seasons to unveil the mechanism of drought propagation and the impact of uncertainty in order to demonstrate its flexibility and superiority the results of uncertainty estimates are compared with those of mcmc simulation the main findings of this study are as follows 1 in spring and winter the linkage between md and ad in the mid high elevation areas is weaker and the propagation time is longer compared with the low elevation areas 2 mpcc is susceptible to potential evapotranspiration and precipitation and dpt is mainly affected by elevation and soil moisture 3 compared with mcmc method vbmc can provide the similar posterior distribution of 5 copula functions with much less iterations and computational time the results illustrate the superiority and flexibility of vbmc for large datasets 4 the probability of agricultural drought occurrence synchronously increases with the severity of meteorological drought the uncertainty range of ad probability is not significant and could be almost neglected when the md severity is lower than ad severity in both low and mid high elevation areas more attention should

1805,agricultural drought ad is disastrous to natural and socioeconomic systems and the propagation of meteorological drought md plays an essential role in the occurrence of ad however how uncertainty affects the mechanism of propagation from md to ad remains unclear in this study a novel method called c vbmc is developed through coupling copula function with variational bayesian monte carlo vbmc the developed c vbmc is then applied to the aral sea basin to demonstrate its feasibility and capability results indicate that the method could effectively quantify the drought propagation probability under the impact of uncertainty several findings can be summarized 1 compared with the low elevation areas the propagation time and relationship between md and ad tend to be longer and weaker in spring and winter at mid high elevation areas 2 drought propagation characteristics are significantly affected by seasonality altitude potential evapotranspiration precipitation and soil moisture 3 the posterior distribution of copula parameter by vbmc is similar with markov chain monte carlo mcmc and vbmc only takes about 50 and 5 of the computation time required by mcmc for univariate and bivariate copula functions the results highlight the superiority and flexibility of vbmc for large datasets 4 the probability of ad occurrence and the uncertainty range are easily affected by same and more severe level md 5 the propagation probabilities tend to be underestimated without uncertainty impact and the uncertainty range is lower than 0 05 for most grids this study is helpful for drought warning management and disaster prevention systems keywords drought propagation copula uncertainty variational inference aral sea basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the context of global climate warming drought has become one of the most devastating natural hazards wu et al 2021 yang et al 2022a it is expected that there is a significant upward trend in the intensity and frequency of drought events in the world clarke et al 2021 hua et al 2022 drought often occurs due to the lack of precipitation yang et al 2020a high temperature luo et al 2017 and the subsequent high evapotranspiration tijdeman et al 2018 drought can result in huge losses to natural and socioeconomic systems xu et al 2021a 2022a among all socioeconomic activities agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to drought in developing countries huang et al 2022 yang et al 2022b in the past 50 years droughts have reduced global grain production by 9 10 resulting in a loss of 29 billion to the agricultural sector of the developing countries during 2005 2015 fao 2018 therefore it is necessary to improve drought warning management system to mitigate its negative impact and achieve sustainable development meteorological drought md is defined as the precipitation is lower than normal condition for a long time over a certain area wilhite and glantz 1985 with the further development of md the long term deficient precipitation may lead to the soil water dissipation until it affects the normal condition of plant growth and food production which can trigger the agricultural drought ad liu and sun 2020 ad can lead to crop yield reduction and degradation of natural and artificial vegetation increase the probability of wind sand disasters and soil erosion in the context of anthropogenic activities and climate change the impact of drought on agricultural yield is increasingly significant therefore if the propagation mechanism from md to ad is further investigated the loss of agriculture will be effectively controlled dai et al 2022 at the same time the relationship can be used to predict ad based on md conditions thereby providing support for regional agricultural drought management and disaster prevention in recent years the propagation characteristics between md and ad have attracted much attention li et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the characteristics of drought propagation including correlation coefficients drought propagation time and conditional probability distributions are easily influenced by soil characteristics land use types and meteorological variables in addition elevation plays an important role in drought propagation due to its association with vegetation covers and or snow processes zhang et al 2022 a variety of methods have been used for analyzing drought propagation since copula function has the advantage of modeling marginal distribution and multivariate dependent structure of drought variables it is convenient to quantify the drought propagation risk xu et al 2021b however copula has several shortcomings in the application such as how to verify the optimal marginal distribution and how to quantify the uncertainty of parameter estimation yang et al 2020b few research works were reported on analyzing the uncertainty of copula function in drought propagation the uncertainty in copula function mainly stems from parameters input data and structure the uncertainty of input data reflects the limitation of measurement structure uncertainty mainly arises from the underlying assumptions of copula function parameter uncertainty reflects the errors in input data and the epistemic errors in model structure teweldebrhan et al 2018 compared with other uncertainties parameter uncertainty has gained attention and benefited from a variety of technologies in recent years bayesian analysis has been increasingly applied to copula parameter estimation and uncertainty assessment wang et al 2022 yue et al 2022 markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling based on bayesian framework is increasingly applied to approximate posterior distributions pan et al 2022 however mcmc is intractable for a sized problem such as agricultural drought propagation as it is slow to sample and imposes a high computational cost to estimate a large scale parameter variable li et al 2021 as an alternative approach to approximate bayesian inference variational inference vi is scalable computationally efficient and broadly applicable for uncertainty analysis studies in many fields vi approximates posterior probability density through optimization instead of sampling representative with mcmc the goal of vi is to find a family of distribution that is closest to the true posterior distributions via maximizing the evidence lower bound elbo it is equivalent to minimizing the kullback leibler kl divergence compared with mcmc the merit of vi is that it is faster and more scalable to large datasets and the total number of required likelihood function evaluations is much smaller compared with mcmc however both vi and mcmc generally require either detailed information of the model or large number of model evaluations acerbi 2018 developed a variational bayesian monte carlo vbmc algorithm combines vi and gaussian process gp based active sampling bayesian quadrate vbmc is a state of the art vi based approach as it intends to be sample efficient without accessing detailed knowledge of the model this objective of this study is to combine copula and vbmc to quantify the propagation relationship and underlying uncertainties between md and ad the feasibility and applicability of c vbmc will be demonstrated in the aral sea basin asb that is a typical arid and semi arid area the main novelty and contribution of this study are 1 this is the first attempt to develop a novel method i e c vbmc through coupling copula function with vbmc to quantify the uncertainty impacts on drought propagation 2 vi based technique i e vbmc is firstly applied in climate domains as an alternative method of mcmc 3 the relationship and uncertainty of drought propagation between md and ad over asb are investigated with the impact of seasonality and elevation and the results are expected to support drought adapting strategies 2 methodology fig 1 shows the framework of c vbmc method standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized soil moisture index ssmi are used to identify md and ad in this study the pearson correlation coefficient is adopted to characterize the drought correlation and propagation time from md to ad copula is applied to model the joint probability distribution of md and ad vbmc based on variational inference algorithm is introduced as an alternative of mcmc to quantify the uncertainty during the drought propagation progress 2 1 drought index and propagation time as a widely used md monitoring and analysis indicator spei is calculated by precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration with various timescales the spei is obtained by using the inverse of the standard normal distribution at various time scales previous study has shown that the average renewal cycle of ad is 12 months the propagation time selected in this study is m months m 12 using the variations in the spei m with various timescales i e 1 12 months other than the single scale s spei can better represent the true md conditions according to the literature recommendation das et al 2022 the log logistic distribution is selected as the parametric distribution for spei similar to spei ssmi 1 is introduced as an analysis indicator to analyze the short time scale 1 month ad condition and the gamma distribution is selected each spei ssmi series has been classified 4 levels by drought severity including mild drought 1 spei ssmi 0 5 moderate drought 1 5 spei ssmi 1 severe drought 2 spei ssmi 1 5 and extreme drought 2 spei ssmi the drought propagation time dpt reflects the accumulated precipitation deficit time from the beginning of md to the onset of ad and it can be simplified into a correlation analysis between ssmi 1 and spei m in different accumulation periods for example the dpt is 4 months for ssmi in july summer it means that the accumulated precipitation deficit is from april spring and the accumulated precipitation deficit induces ad in july summer the pearson correlation coefficient between the two kinds of drought is calculated to determine the relationship between ssmi 1 and spei m at various timescales wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 the timescale m of spei corresponding to the maximum pearson correlation coefficient mpcc represents the drought propagation time a shorter propagation time of spei and ssmi indicates a faster response of soil moisture shortage to precipitation deficiency 2 2 copula theory copula function is powerful for constructing the dependence structure among bivariate random variables ansell and dalla valle 2022 in this study copula function is introduced to analyze the joint distribution for spei m and ssmi after mpcc and propagation time m are determined mathematically given two drought indices spei m and ssmi with marginal distributions f spei m s p e i and f ssmi s s m i their joint cumulative probability distribution f spei m s s m i s p e i s s m i can be expressed as follows 1 p s p e i m s p e i s s m i s s m i f spei m s s m i s p e i s s m i c f spei m s p e i f ssmi s s m i where f spei m s p e i and f ssmi s s m i are marginal cumulative distribution functions for bivariate variables spei m and ssmi in this study 5 parametric models of copula families are selected the mathematical description and parameter range are shown in table s1 according to the joint probability distribution formulated by copula function the conditional probability between ad and md is further test to estimate the probabilities of ad occurrences under md conditions for instance the occurrence probability of mild ad under mild md can be formulated as 2 p 1 s p e i m 0 5 1 s s m i 0 5 f spei m s s m i 0 5 0 5 f spei m s s m i 1 0 5 f spei m 0 5 f spei m 1 2 3 vbmc the variational bayesian monte carlo vbmc is a state of the art technique based on bayesian theory that connects variation inference vi and gaussian process gp based active sampling bayesian quadrature vbmc can simultaneously compute approximation of the model parameters bayesian posterior distribution and a lower bound to the model evidence with highly efficient computational ability the main steps of vbmc are described in algorithm s1 vi is used to find a simple proposal distribution that is closest to the true posterior distribution p θ y 0 over parameter θ the simple proposal distributions are referred to as the variational distributions in vi let the variational distributions be defined as q θ λ governed by the latent parameter variable matrix λ λ 1 λ 2 λ n r s n with the number of variational parameters s in each proposal variational distribution in vbmc s is mixed at 2 because a mixture of gaussian distribution with two parameters i e mean and variance are selected the difference between variational distribution q θ λ and true posterior distribution p θ y 0 is usually quantified by the kl divergence the kl divergence of vi is provided 3 k l q θ λ p θ y 0 ℓ λ log p y 0 which can be rewritten as 4 log p y 0 k l q θ λ p θ y 0 ℓ λ ℓ λ with 5 ℓ λ e q log p y 0 θ log q θ λ where e q means the expectation concerning q θ λ the goal of vi is to find a variational distribution q θ λ which is closest to the true posterior distribution p θ y 0 by minimizing the kl divergence however the computation of eq 3 is intractable because it requires the evaluation of log p y 0 that is unknown since kl divergence is non negative and log p y 0 is a constant minimizing the kl divergence is equivalent to maximizing ℓ λ i e evidence lower bound elbo in order to estimate the marginal likelihood gp based bayesian quadrature is introduced bayesian quadrature can obtain bayesian estimates of the mean and variance of non analytical integrals of the form f f x π x d x where f is a function of interest and π is a known probability distribution typically gp is used as a flexible class of models for unknown function approximations gp is defined by 1 a mean function about the mean at any point of the input space and 2 a positive definite covariance function or kernel function that sets the covariance between points conditioned on independent training inputs x x 1 x n and associated function values y f x the gp posterior will have latent posterior conditional mean and covariance c ξ x x c x x ξ φ in closed form where ξ x y is the set of training input data for the gp and φ is a hyperparameter vector for the gp posterior mean and covariance since integration is a linear operator the mean and variance of the integral f x π x d x are specified and expressed as follows 6 e f ξ f ξ x π x d x 7 v f ξ f c ξ x x π x d x π x d x crucially the integrals in eq 5 can be calculated analytically if f is a gp with gaussian kernel and π is a gaussian or mixture of gaussians in order to minimize the posterior variance of the final integral the choice of the input samples x is implemented for a given sample budget n max monte carlo sampling can be introduced to estimate the entropy of the variational posterior in eq 6 in this way stochastic gradient ascent is used to maximum elbo further implementation and mathematical derivations of vbmc are illustrated in acerbi 2018 3 case study and data copula vbmc method is applied to analyzing drought propagation and the uncertainty for the aral sea basin asb with an area of 2 48 106 km2 the asb is located in the core of eurasia 55 95 79 40 e and 35 17 47 82 n and covers five countries i e uzbekistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and kazakhstan with the impact of decreased precipitation and increased evaporation asb has become one of the hotspots of climate change and the drought over asb will be aggregated most parts of asb are vulnerable to droughts due to the fragile ecosystem intense water shortage and rapidly growing population guo et al 2018 jiang et al 2021 drought events have caused a huge loss on natural and socioeconomic systems for example the drought during 2000 2001 resulted in a direct loss of 800 million dollars to the agricultural sector bank 2006 guo et al 2022 despite the increasing drought risk the study on drought propagation over asb has received limited attention in recent years asb consists of two major tributaries the amu darya river and the syr darya river the precipitation and temperature in the asb are distributed with highly temporal heterogeneities characterized by cold moist winter and hot dry summer compared with the low elevation areas the precipitation is mainly concentrated in the mid high elevation areas xu et al 2022b with the increase of precipitation the vegetation cover in the mid high elevation areas is an important ecological security barrier in preventing wind sand fixation and water erosion especially in fragile regional ecosystems agriculture has a large contribution 10 45 to gross domestic product gdp and employs 20 50 of the labor force over asb due to the limited water resource in the asb the soil moisture is closely related to the changes of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration understanding the propagation relationship and uncertainty between md and ad is critical to the social economy in asb hamidov et al 2016 elevation determines the growth of crops all elevations 1500 m are suitable for rain fed cultivation zhang et al 2022 in order to discuss the impact of elevation on drought propagation asb is divided into two parts fig 2 low elevation areas elevation 1500 m and mid high elevation areas elevation 1500 m in order to fully understand the drought propagation characteristics between md and ad it is necessary to ensure that the selected data have high spatial resolution and long term time series according to the past study hu et al 2018 monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are provided by climatic research unit gridded time series cru ts https badc nerc ac uk data cru which are from 1949 to 2014 with a spatial resolution 0 5 0 5 monthly soil moisture data are collected from global land data assimilation system gldas https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas from 1949 to 2014 with a spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 in order to reduce system bias the data are interpolated to 0 25 digital elevation models dem are collected from shuttle radar topography mission https www gscloud cn home 4 result and discussion the spei with various timescales can reflect the md conditions and finally affect ad to quantify the propagation characteristics from md to ad the pearson correlation coefficients between spei m and ssmi 1 are calculated the maximum pearson correlation coefficient mpcc represents the response relationship of ad under md conditions the drought propagation time dpt is determined by the timescale of spei m corresponding to mpcc the dpt refers to the accumulated precipitation deficit in m months and further causes the soil moisture deficiency and pose threat to normal growth of crops following the previous study xu et al 2021b the relationship and propagation time based on monthly ssmi 1 series and spei m series are discussed for months and seasons spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november winter december january and february 4 1 relationship and propagation time from md to ad fig 3 a shows the spatial distribution of mpcc between ssmi 1 and spei m in the asb based on 2428 grid cells in different seasons and months the results show the correlation of md and ad in the asb varies significantly across seasons the seasonal and monthly variation illustrate that climatic factors e g precipitation and potential evapotranspiration have obvious impact on the relationship between ad and md more than 99 of grids are significantly correlated between spei and ssmi p 0 01 63 of grids in the asb show a significant relationship between ssmi and spei with mpcc 0 6 the mean mpcc for spring summer autumn and winter are 0 68 0 61 0 63 and 0 60 respectively compared with other seasons the correlation coefficients of spring and winter are highest and lowest respectively it might be attributed to the fact that the rainfall in the asb is mainly concentrated in spring with low potential evapotranspiration which leads to a close relationship between ssmi and spei in spring limited precipitation mainly supplements the shortage of soil moisture and does not form effective runoff as the temperature exceeds 0 the precipitation could effectively replenish the soil moisture in april and may with the decrease of precipitation the correlation coefficients between md and ad decrease significantly in july september due to the low surface temperature the snowfall could not directly supplement the soil moisture in winter besides climatic and seasonal factors the spatial distribution of mpcc is easily affected by the elevation distribution the mpcc distribution of four seasons and twelve months in low and mid high elevation areas are shown in fig 3b and c the results suggest that mpcc distribution is significantly varied with the elevation distribution in various months and seasons compared with the low elevation areas the mpcc are lower for spring and winter with the impact of dew point higher for summer and autumn in mid high elevation areas for example the mpcc in august are 0 48 and 0 71 for low and mid high elevation areas due to the perennial snow and frozen soil at mid high elevation areas in spring the linkage between md and ad reaches the lowest level 0 51 the low elevation areas tend to have low vegetation coverage the dynamic changes of soil moisture are closely related to climatic factors which results in the higher correlation coefficients between md and ad in spring with the more precipitation and less potential evapotranspiration in summer and autumn at mid high elevation areas md and ad have higher mpcc than the same seasons at low elevation areas furthermore the irrigation and other human activity are intensified at low elevation areas in summer and autumn in the context of climate change both the relationship and drought propagation time dpt between md and ad will be affected and changed the spatial distribution of dpt over different seasons and months in the asb are shown in fig 4 a the results suggest that the spatial distribution of dpt differ more significantly in spring especially in march and april than other seasons it is attributed to the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation the snow and frozen soil in winter and early spring i e march melt to replenish soil moisture as the temperature rises in spring and summer the long dpt illustrate that the ad in winter and spring should be partly attributed to the md in autumn even in summer since summer and autumn are the most important plant growing seasons crops need lots of water from the soil to maintain the growth artificial irrigation or precipitation are required to avoid ad with the impact of complex topography and climatic condition e g temperature atmospheric pressure wind speed the dpt in mountains varies significantly in different seasons in general the proportions of the pixels with the dpt within 3 months in the asb are 53 91 97 and 61 over various seasons with the impact of snow melt and deficient of precipitation the proportions of the pixels with the dpt within 3 months are highest 99 and lowest 29 for november and march respectively compared with the mountain areas the dpt between md and ad in plains are constantly shorter it illustrates that the ad in plain areas are closely related to the changes in regional precipitation potential evapotranspiration by global climate warming and water cycle intensification the dpt in low and mid high elevation areas are shown in fig 4b and c compared with the mid high elevation areas the dpt in low elevation areas are more dispersed the dpt in spring and winter show a significant difference in low and mid high elevation areas the dpt tend to be longer in mid high elevation areas specifically the mean dpt between md and ad are 2 90 2 82 and 6 60 5 57 months in spring winter for low and mid high elevation areas respectively in low elevation areas the proportions of the pixels with the dpt within 3 months are 62 and 72 for spring and winter respectively however the dpt over 3 months are 99 and 98 for spring and winter in mid high elevation areas van loon et al 2014 also found that the impact of seasonality on drought propagation is strong in mid high elevation regions where the snow accumulation hinders the recovery processes of agricultural drought in winter and early spring results suggest that elevation is significantly important for dpt in spring and winter via vegetation cover temperature and other climatic conditions the dpt in summer and autumn for low and mid high elevation areas are similar the dpt of almost all grids are within 3 months it is partly attributed to the precipitation shortage and the growth of plants in general the drought propagation characteristics i e mpcc and dpt over asb are influenced by seasonality and elevation dpt at mid high elevation areas tend to be prolonged in spring and winter compared with that at low elevation areas on the contrary the mpcc are lower in spring and winter and higher in summer and autumn at mid high elevation areas the reason may be that unlike the monsoon climate asb has an arid to semi arid continental climate which monthly precipitation is low in summer most rainfall occurs in winter and spring jiang et al 2021 furthermore the precipitation concentrates in mid high elevation areas instead of low elevation areas 4 2 impact factors of drought propagation ad refers to the insufficient water supply to meet the needs of plant growth and crop production md is the trigger of ad and has an important impact on agricultural crop loss compared with the regional drought propagation characteristics the impact of climatic factors and altitude on the seasonal drought propagation characteristics are more obvious li et al 2022a figs 3 and 4 show that mpcc and dpt significantly vary at different altitude and seasons especially in spring and winter the previous studies demonstrated that altitude can affect drought propagation characteristics due to the connection with temperature or land cover zhang et al 2022 the temperature and land cover further affect the process of drought propagation the relationship between altitude and mpcc dpt is calculated and shown in fig s1 altitude can significantly affect mpcc in spring and dpt in spring and winter with the increase of altitude the process of rain to snow occurs more frequently and hinders drought propagation moreover elevation is positively correlated with slope at high elevation areas the precipitation tends to rapidly transform to runoff instead of slowly replenish soil moisture the relationships between drought propagation characteristics and precipitation at different altitude areas are shown in fig s2 the results suggest that the relationships significantly vary with elevation and precipitation compared with mpcc at mid high elevation areas and dpt precipitation is a more important impact factor for mpcc at low elevation areas due to the low precipitation and insufficient soil moisture mpcc at low elevation areas is more sensitive with the precipitation ding et al 2021 precipitation can effectively replenish soil moisture as well as alleviate agricultural drought among all seasons the relationship between mpcc and precipitation in winter is weakest because the source of soil moisture is indirectly recharged from snowmelt besides the interception of precipitation snow by forest vegetation at high altitude can prolong the conversion time of precipitation snow to soil moisture leading to a prolonged dpt between md and ad yang et al 2022c except for precipitation potential evapotranspiration is another important climatic factor affecting drought propagation potential evapotranspiration a complex factor connected with temperature and vapor pressure affects the process by which precipitation replenishes soil moisture and soil moisture evaporation harris et al 2020 as shown in fig s3 the relationship between mpcc and potential evapotranspiration is obvious for most seasons however in summer and autumn the correlation coefficients are reversed at low and mid high elevation areas under the high potential evapotranspiration condition the water cycle at low elevation areas is accelerated rare precipitation evaporates quickly on the contrary high potential evapotranspiration at mid high elevation areas avoids runoff from precipitation and improves the response mechanism between ad and md the relationship between potential evapotranspiration and dpt is negative generally high potential evapotranspiration limits the accumulation of soil moisture and shorten dpt li et al 2022b the relationship between soil moisture and drought propagation characteristics is presented in fig s4 at low elevation areas the correlation coefficients are positive in summer and spring which are characterized by hot and dry the precipitation could directly replenish soil moisture and alleviate soil drought yang et al 2022c at mid high elevation areas the saturated soil moisture could promote the production of runoff by precipitation eventually resulting in a negative relationship between soil moisture and mpcc compared with mpcc dpt is positively correlated with soil moisture with the increase of sm the capacity of resisting md is raised and the dpt is prolonged in general drought propagation characteristics are affected by altitude precipitation potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture mpcc is susceptible to potential evapotranspiration and precipitation while dpt is mainly affected by altitude and soil moisture 4 3 comparison of mcmc and vbmc the posterior parameters distribution and computation time of vbmc and mcmc are discussed mcmc is used as a benchmark according to sadegh et al 2017 with the default settings fig 5 displays the posterior parameters probability density functions pdfs of the five copula functions table s1 using vbmc and mcmc in a random grid of the asb in general the posterior distribution of copula parameters calculated by vbmc matches quite well with that of mcmc except the second parameter of student t copula i e t θ2 the posterior of t θ2 is more narrow compared with that of mcmc it may be partially attributed to the non normal posterior distribution of the parameter and complex structure of student t copula function vbmc only captures the main part of pdf except similar results as mcmc in the copula parameter posterior distribution vbmc also greatly saves the computational cost in terms of the total number of iterations where each iteration corresponds to one likelihood function evaluation it is difficult to display the convergence trace of copula parameter for each grid as the asb with 2428 grids the parameter uncertainty analysis of five copula functions is randomly selected and discussed over the basin the convergences of vbmc and mcmc are diagnosed until the values of elbo do not change with the iteration and rhat is lower than 1 2 the iteration times using vbmc mcmc are 12 120 14 190 13 240 14 280 and 13 200 for gaussian clayton frank gumbel and student t copula function respectively furthermore more than 104 samples are usually needed in mcmc algorithm which require a huge number of likelihood function evaluations the results indicate a huge reduction in the likelihood function evaluations and its potential application to the uncertainty analysis of massive data in future studies alternatively the simulation efficiency of vbmc and mcmc can be compared through the total computational time in order to reduce computation time bias and illustrate its flexibility ten random pixels for each copula functions in the asb are selected to compare the mean computation time between vbmc and mcmc for five copula functions the estimation time using vbmc mcmc are 198 8 399 176 5 402 9 175 2 351 1 183 9 380 6 and 338 6 7510 seconds for gaussian clayton frank gumbel and student t copula function respectively as expected vbmc is more efficient in terms of computational time compared with mcmc despite it is difficult to directly compared the efficiency of vbmc and mcmc vbmc could produce a quite reasonable estimate in the limited time especially the complexity of the student t copula function makes it really expensive in computational cost for the mcmc approach in general the results demonstrate that vbmc can be considered as a reliable alternative of mcmc for quantifying copula parameter uncertainty vbmc could generate uncertainty analysis results similar to mcmc while taking only about 50 and 5 of the computation time required by mcmc for univariate and bivariate copula function calculations are carried out with amd r7 4800h processor and 16 gb ram using the personal laptop 4 4 propagation of drought severity and uncertainty analysis in this study c vbmc is used for modelling bivariate probability distribution to quantify monthly drought propagation risk and uncertainty analysis from md to ad at each grid scale 0 25 0 25 based on the propagation time a joint distribution between md and ad is modelled using the monthly ssmi 1 series and its corresponding spei m series for low and mid high elevation areas the probabilities of four ad levels under four md levels across four seasons are analyzed and discussed fig 6 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf for the different ad levels probability and related uncertainty range which reveals the regional different ad levels risk under different md levels in low and mid high elevation areas for various md ad pairs the cdf changes significantly in general with the increase of md severity level the cdf curve of moderate sever and extreme ad move from the left side to the right side of the panel furthermore ad is easily propagated by more severe and same level md for example as shown in fig 7 the regional mean probability of mild ad is quantified as 0 288 0 272 0 300 0 276 0 253 0 220 and 0 210 0 174 when mild moderate severe and extreme md occurs in low mid high elevation areas respectively moreover the mean probability of severe ad is quantified as 0 050 0 047 0 100 0 098 0 163 0 170 and 0 227 0 242 respectively the phenomenon is also found for moderate and extreme ad conditions fig s5 the results suggest that the propagation relationship from md to ad over the asb are peer to peer the cdf of ad probability under md for various seasons is noticeably different for example the mean probability of extreme ad is quantified as 0 105 0 112 0 019 0 074 0 044 0 045 and 0 091 0 027 when md occur for four seasons in low mid high elevation regions the seasons with the high propagation sensitivity from md to ad are spring and winter in low elevation areas the results are consistent with the spatial temporal distribution of precipitation from spring to winter the lower tail of the cdf shift to the top affected by the complex geographical and climatic conditions the mean probability of extreme ad in winter over mid high elevation areas is lowest specifically under the extreme md conditions the proportion of extreme ad with the probability lower than 0 01 is about 65 in mid high elevation areas as shown in fig 6 c vbmc could effectively quantify the uncertainty range of ad probability under various md conditions take the extreme ad as an example the regional mean propagation probability and uncertainty range are quantified as 0 24 and 0 23 0 28 the uncertainty range is not significantly notable by regional mean values however it is an important role in the analysis of ad probability for some grids for instance the severe ad probability at 68 625 e and 41 875 n is 0 34 under extreme md conditions in spring the uncertainty range is 0 17 0 43 as shown in fig 8 most of the maximum positive propagation probability changes under uncertainty impact maximum propagation probability under uncertainty minus propagation probability without uncertainty are lower than 0 05 under mild and severe md similar with propagation probability distribution the maximum positive propagation probability changes are easily affected by more severe and same level md figs 8 and s6 for example the maximum positive propagation probability changes of severe ad mainly concentrate on the severe and extreme md conditions a drought event usually begins when the drought index decreases below a threshold i e 0 5 in this study and may persist the mild drought 1 drought indices 0 5 or continue to fall to more severe level drought in contrast the drought terminates when the drought index rises above the threshold level schwalm et al 2017 during the development and recovery drought milder drought will be experienced similarly the propagation probability and uncertainty tend to be affected by more sever and same level md compared with the maximum positive propagation probability changes the maximum negative propagation probability changes minimum propagation probability under uncertainty minus propagation probability without uncertainty are less obvious fig s7 furthermore there is not obvious difference of uncertainty range for different elevation areas in general the uncertainty range under extreme md is always more obvious for different ad levels than under other levels of md conditions furthermore compared with other md conditions the cdf curve exhibits a wider range of changes in ad probability under extreme md these results indicate that the method of projecting ad by detecting the response relationship between ad and md is more difficult under extreme md condition more attention should be applied on the ad induced by extreme md the results illustrate the importance of uncertainty in drought propagation between md and ad 5 conclusions in this study a novel method named as c vbmc has been developed to investigate the drought propagation characteristics and make uncertainty estimates c vbmc firstly incorporates copula function and variational bayesian monte carlo within a general framework the developed method is applied and examined in the asb for various seasons to unveil the mechanism of drought propagation and the impact of uncertainty in order to demonstrate its flexibility and superiority the results of uncertainty estimates are compared with those of mcmc simulation the main findings of this study are as follows 1 in spring and winter the linkage between md and ad in the mid high elevation areas is weaker and the propagation time is longer compared with the low elevation areas 2 mpcc is susceptible to potential evapotranspiration and precipitation and dpt is mainly affected by elevation and soil moisture 3 compared with mcmc method vbmc can provide the similar posterior distribution of 5 copula functions with much less iterations and computational time the results illustrate the superiority and flexibility of vbmc for large datasets 4 the probability of agricultural drought occurrence synchronously increases with the severity of meteorological drought the uncertainty range of ad probability is not significant and could be almost neglected when the md severity is lower than ad severity in both low and mid high elevation areas more attention should be paid to ad induced by extreme md conditions overall this study illustrates that vbmc is a better alternative mcmc for uncertainty analysis of drought propagation the results of study can improve the understanding of the drought propagation mechanism and provide decision supports of drought management in the future however several limitations exist in this study firstly this study mainly discusses the uncertainty from parameters data uncertainty analysis is not investigated secondly the physical mechanisms in drought propagation are unclear and the impact of geophysical and climatic factors is not quantified thirdly human activity e g irrigation socioeconomic policy is not fully considered in drought propagation credit authorship contribution statement q zhang conceptualization

1806,the pearl river delta prd is one of the largest urbanized areas in both area and population and also suffers increasing flooding hazards in the context of climate change and anthropogenic interventions the co occurrence of multiple upstream flooding drivers compound flooding over different upstream channels often exacerbates stronger impacts on downstream water levels compared with their isolated occurrence it is particularly important to derive more reliable risk estimations of extreme water levels in downstream channels of a nested river system by considering the spatial dependence between multiple upstream floods and downstream water levels in this study we present an approach termed the high dimensional conditional probability hdcp approach to capture the probabilistic dependence behavior of upstream floods and downstream water level events at the prd and estimate the extreme water levels likelihood and event impacted areas under the multiple upstream flooding the prd as one of the most vulnerable regions to extreme floods in china was used as a case study to test the applicability of the hdcp approach first the hdcp is used to model the conditional dependence of upstream floods and downstream water levels based on the canonical vine copula then different flood scenarios are investigated by estimating the occurrence likelihood of downstream water level events and their spatial patterns the final part identifies the changes in the occurrence likelihood variability of extreme water level events after strong human interventions results indicate that the upstream flooding over the xijiang river dominates the occurrence likelihood of extreme water level events over the prd and the beijiang river plays a secondary role after strong human interventions the effect of the beijiang river has been strengthened while the effect of the xijaing river has been weakened the proposed hdcp approach is not only applicable to the prd area dominated by multiple upstream rivers as mentioned in this study but it is also promising in detecting the spatial occurrence likelihood of other hydrometeorological variables in other areas with different climates and topographical conditions and formulating regional development strategies for policymakers in water resources and disaster drought risk managements against single compound extreme events keywords extreme water levels conditional dependence upstream downstream linkages pearl river delta human interventions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the pearl river delta prd is one of the most rapidly urbanized and developed economic areas in china besides the prd is also the most vulnerable region to extreme floods in the context of climate change and anthropogenic interfaces yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2021 in the past when human interventions were limited water level changes in prd were mainly affected by the natural changes in upstream discharges zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 liu et al 2019a strong anthropogenic interventions have significantly altered the natural evolution of the pearl river basin prb river system han et al 2022 wu et al 2016 wei et al 2021 luo et al 2007 the cascade reservoirs and dams in the main tributaries of the prb i e the xijiang river and beijiang river have also strongly affected the magnitudes of discharges hydrograph and river hydrologic characteristics of the prb normally severe flooding events occur not only in a single river channel but also in several tributaries of a nested catchment the co occurrence of multiple upstream flooding generally exerts much stronger impacts on downstream water levels compared with their isolated occurrence the consideration of the spatial dependence between multiple upstream floods and downstream water levels is essential to generate reliable risk estimation of extreme water levels in downstream channels of a complicated river system a multivariate model is thus expected to model the spatial dependence between upstream floods and downstream water levels and estimate the concurrent risk of such compound events the hydrological frequency analysis generally employs univariate probability distributions yet this may result in under overestimate the concurrent risk with a given event salvadori and de michele 2004 merz and blöschl 2008 laux et al 2011 in fact the hydrologic events mostly involve joint behavior of different random variables e g discharge and water levels or the same variable over different locations for instance if a given hydrological event is widespread over a domain the univariate frequency analysis may not be reliable enough to assess the spatial concurrent likelihood thus a better understanding of concurrent hydrological events needs to model their joint dependence structure via a multivariate approach to date the copula has emerged as a promising and superior approach to flexibly model the joint dependence structure of multiple variables compared to the classical multivariate distributions such as a multivariate gaussian it also has an advantage in characterizing the dependence structure independently from the marginal distributions favre et al 2004 genest and favre 2007 chen et al 2019 the copula has been well employed in numerous hydrological applications such as the risk identification of extreme events ganguli and reddy 2013 chang et al 2016 flood return periods requena et al 2013 hydrological prediction liu et al 2015 liu et al 2016 dependence between extreme events aghakouchak et al 2010 and frequency analysis salvadori and de michele 2004 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 mirabbasi et al 2012 bárdossy and li 2008 in addition a variety of copula based methods have been further developed to model the dependence between extreme events for example a copula based bayesian network approach was proposed to analyze flood risk and prediction kong et al 2019 ballarin et al 2021 proposed a copula based drought assessment framework for risk assessment of extreme drought events despite this generality theoretical developments and applications of parametric copulas are mostly limited in bivariate cases that is to say the commonly used parametric copulas have restrictions in multivariate modeling at higher dimensions e g the dimensions greater than three due to parameter restrictions and computationally intensive formulations this thus limits its application in multiple site involved frequency analysis for compound hydrological events furthermore most copula based studies were conducted in the context of unconditional assessments to determine the contribution of upstream flooding compound flooding to the downstream water levels regarding the current study a conditional relationship needs to be established this thus can measure the conditional impacts of upstream flooding on downstream water level events vine copula also known as pair copula constructions pccs allows for modeling multivariate dependencies with high flexibility for any dimensions aas et al 2009 bevacqua et al 2017 bedford and cooke 2001 brechmann et al 2013 joe et al 2010 several studies did pioneer work by using the vine copula in risk assessment for example bevacqua et al 2017 used the vine copula to model the conditional probability distribution of river streamflow and sea levels given meteorological variables to estimate the compound flood risk to quantify the impact of dry hot extreme events on vegetation dynamics li et al 2021 developed a vine copula based probability model in this study considering the spatial temporal correlation of the flood events between multiple upstream and downstream we attempt to present a high dimensional conditional probability hdcp approach by using the vine copula as a baseline model to assess the spatial concurrence likelihood of downstream extreme water levels under the effect of multiple upstream flooding the prb is used as a study case area to apply the presented approach the approach is threefold 1 utilizing the vine copula as a base model to model the probabilistic dependence behavior between upstream floods and downstream water levels 2 quantifying the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels and their spatial patterns given various upstream flooding conditions 3 identifying the occurrence likelihood variability of extreme water level events as a result of human interventions the likelihood estimation of concurrent hydrological events could be beneficial to the water resources management mitigation and preparation for potential floods 2 case study sites and dataset 2 1 study site and target species the prd located in the southern part of china is a highly complicated hydrologic network system which is an alluvial delta formed by three major tributaries the xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river of the pearl river fig 1 the prd has been strongly affected by climate change and intensive human activities such as dam and reservoir constructions sand excavation in the channels channel dredging after 1990 a few large reservoirs were constructed in the xijiang river and beijiang river with increasing reservoir capacity indices liu et al 2014 the total storage capacity of dams reached 538 108 m3 by 2006 which accounts for 24 7 of the xijiang river s annual water volume liu et al 2018b another human interventions were the large scale sand excavation activities since the mid 1980s the earliest sand excavation activities occurred close to the ss station the second wave sand excavation activities have occurred close to sj station sand excavation activities have been continued for approximately 20 years in prd in particular sand excavation activities from 1986 to 2003 in the prd resulted in average down cutting depths of 0 59 1 7 m and 0 34 4 43 m in the main channels of the xijaing river and beijiang river respectively luo et al 2007 in particular since the 1980s the prd has been experiencing a rapid urbanization process and economic development with a huge population boom as a result the hydrodynamic characteristics of the pearl river system have been significantly making the prd one of the most vulnerable river deltas to flooding in the world 2 2 dataset in this study time series of monthly streamflow from 2 gauging stations and time series of monthly water levels from 13 gauging stations were collected fig 1 which are available from the pearl river hydrological yearbooks the discharge in the prd is affected by seasonal rainfall and about 80 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in the flood season april september gaoyao gy and shijiao sj stations are the upstream streamflow stations fig 1 as the key control station in the prd we considered five configurations by identifying the effect of upstream flooding denoted as the q variable on downstream water levels denoted as the z variable at different stations table 1 specifically q variables streamflow at gy and sj upstream discharge of the prb represent the predictors z variables water levels at 13 stations represent the predicted variables in this study we used the same predictors because the downstream water levels at gauging stations are driven by the similar hydrological influence of upstream discharges the data during the flooding seasons from april to september were involved in the following analyses 3 methodology 3 1 correlation between upstream floods and downstream water levels in order to further verify the spatial response patterns of occurrence likelihood of water level to upstream flooding the correlations between downstream water levels and upstream discharge were calculated using the pearson correlation coefficients for each water level station in the study region pearson s correlation analysis was performed between the downstream water levels and upstream discharge series during the flooding period as follows 1 r z g y c o r r z n q gy r z s j c o r r z n q sj where zn is the water level at the n th station qgy is the discharge at the gy station qsj is the discharge at the sj station r z g y indicates the correlation coefficient between zn and qgy and r z s j indicates the correlation coefficient between zn and qsj correlation coefficients ranging 0 9 1 0 indicate very highly correlation correlation coefficients ranging 0 7 0 9 indicate variables highly correlation correlation coefficients between 0 5 and 0 7 indicate moderately correlation correlation coefficients only ranging 0 3 0 5 indicate a low correlation correlation coefficients less than 0 3 indicate very low correlation to show the correlation coefficients between various water levels and discharges associated with their spatial patterns we also employed the idw interpolation method 3 2 vine copula copula offers a general framework to model the probabilistic dependence behavior from different variables sklar 1959 however in higher dimensional e g d 3 scenarios owing to the limitations of a large number of parameters and complexity the copulas mainly referring to bivariate copulas are difficult to be applied liu et al 2018a 2021 sadegh et al 2017 to overcome these limitations joe 1996 and aas et al 2009 developed vine copulas which are a hierarchy of pair copula constructions for multidimensional cases regular vines include two simple sub classes canonical vine copulas c vine copulas and drawable vine copulas d vine copulas as an illustration here we mainly employed c vine copulas to construct the conditional probability model the joint density function of the n dimensional c vine copula is 2 f x 1 x n k 1 n f k x k i 1 n 1 j 1 n i c i i j 1 i 1 f x i x 1 x i 1 f x i j x 1 x i 1 where fk xk k 1 n denotes the n marginal densities and ci i j 1 i 1 represents the bivariate copula densities more details about the c vine copula can be found in some previous studies aas et al 2009 bevacqua et al 2017 bedford and cooke 2001 brechmann et al 2013 joe et al 2010 to understand the decomposition of c vine structure a 3 dimensional canonical vine structure 3c vine is taken as the example to show the pair copula of vine structure in fig 2 fig 2 depicts a graphical model of a c vine with two trees this graphical representation illustrates the ordering of the variables in the first tree variable 1 plays a pivotal role variable 2 has this pivotal role in the second tree and the possible pair of variable 2 with variable 3 is modeled conditionally on variable 1 for instance the joint density function of a 3c vine can be expressed as 3 f 123 f 1 f 2 f 3 c 12 c 13 c 23 1 where x1 x2 and x3 indicate three different variables c 1 2 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 is simply denoted as c 12 representing the density function of pair copula with marginal distributions f 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 c 23 1 representing the conditional copula density the marginal conditional distribution functions e g f x v for an m dimensional vector ν v 1 v m can be written as brechmann et al 2013 brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 4 h x ν θ f x ν c x v j ν j f x ν j f v j ν j f v j ν j where v j j 1 m is an arbitrary component of ν ν j v 1 v j 1 v j 1 v m denotes the vector ν but excluding component v j the bivariate copula function is indicated as c x v j ν j h function is introduced here as the conditional distribution function based on the 3c vine structure we can derive the conditional cumulative distribution function f u 3 u 1 u 2 which is also a conditional prediction model for the variable x3 given other variables x 1 x 2 based on eqs 3 and 4 f u 3 u 1 u 2 can be computed by recursively applying the h function liu et al 2015 one can derive x 3 from the following equation 5 f u 3 u 1 u 2 h h u 3 u 1 θ 13 h u 2 u 1 θ 12 θ 23 1 here the parameters to be estimated are θ θ 13 θ 12 θ 23 1 θ is the set of parameters of different conditional copulas in the 3c vine structure and uk k 1 2 3 is the marginal cumulative distribution function cdf of x 1 x 3 the variable x 3 is the predicted variable and the variables x 1 and x 2 are the conditioning variables i e predictors 3 3 a high dimensional conditional probability hdcp approach based on vine copula according to the joint density of the n dimensional c vine structure presented in eq 1 a c vine structure with a certain order for given data can be fitted using all of the pair copulas conditional bivariate copulas we take the 3c vine as an illustration the conditional probability model eq 5 can also be written according to the c vine structure fig 2 the higher dimensional conditional prediction models can also be obtained by recursively applying the h function the general form of eq 5 can be written as 6 f u j u 1 u j 1 u i h h u j u 1 u j 1 h u i u 1 u j 1 where the argument h u j u 1 u j 1 and h u i u 1 u j 1 1 j i can be obtained recursively according to eq 4 brechmann et al 2013 next we introduce the τ th copula quantile curve chen et al 2009 ren et al 2014 liu et al 2018a to simulate u 3 based on eq 5 and derived the inverse distribution function of the c vine structure fig 2 regarding the 3c vine the τ th conditional quantile function of x 3 q x 3 τ x 1 x 2 can be obtained by the recursive computation 7 x 3 q x 3 τ x 1 x 2 f 1 u 3 f 1 h 1 h 1 τ h u 2 u 1 θ 12 θ 23 1 u 1 θ 13 we are able to derive the variable x 3 predicted variable given variables x 1 x 2 predictors based on a 3c vine it should be mentioned that higher dimensional conditional probability models e g 4c vine or higher d can also be obtained by recursively applying the h function in a similar way as illustrated in fig 3 given q 1 and q 2 predictors i e upstream streamflow the 4 dimensional conditional distribution function f z 1 z 2 q 1 q 2 of predicted variables z 1 z 2 downstream water levels at different stations can be obtained by recursively applying the h function given q 1 and q 2 the 5 dimensional conditional distribution function f z 1 z 2 z 3 q 1 q 2 of predicted variables z 1 z 2 z 3 can also be obtained by recursively applying the h function in this paper all the calculation processes of the hdcp approach are based on two r packages i e vinecopula and cdvinecopulaconditional schepsmeier et al 2015 gaussian student t clayton frank gumbel and joe copula are used as the pair copula family to build the 4c vine or 5c vine conditional model the selection of the pair copulas in the 4c vine 5c vine conditional model was determined by the akaike information criterion aic schepsmeier et al 2015 finally we can estimate the concurrence likelihood of extreme water levels at various upstream flooding conditions to show the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels and their spatial patterns we used of the inverse distance weight idw interpolation method the idw method allows the spatial interpolation of occurrence likelihood water levels to over an area the explanation and calculation of the idw method are available in the supplementary material 4 results 4 1 spatial correlation patterns between upstream floods and downstream water levels moreover we further investigated the relationships between water levels at multiple stations and discharges of different upper channels through correlation analysis fig 4 presents the spatial patterns of the pearson correlation coefficients of zn q gy and zn q sj of the prb during the flooding season of 1965 2016 for most regions of the prb the downstream water levels indicate highly positive correlations with the discharges at the gy station fig 4a and the downstream water levels have moderately positive correlations with the discharge at the sj station fig 4b specifically for the relationship of zn q gy the correlations coefficient is around 0 7 0 96 for the relationship of zn q sj the correlations coefficient is about 0 33 0 5 this suggests the downstream water levels are dominantly determined by upstream discharges at the gy station of the prb besides the cumulative deviation curve test was used to test the trend of the annual average water levels of prb from 1965 to 2016 fig 5 indicates two different periods i e the period of 1965 1988 with less human interventions and the period of 1998 2016 with the significant human interventions the explanation and calculation of the cumulative departure are available in the supplementary material to test whether the strengths of these relationships vary under the effect of strong human interventions we validated the variations in correlations over different periods 1965 1988 and 1998 2016 fig 6 comparisons reveal that an insignificant decrease in the correlations of zn q gy can be found in most regions of the prb during 1998 2016 as compared to 1965 1988 fig 6a a large increase in the correlations of zn q sj can be found in most regions of the prb during 1998 2016 as compared to 1965 1988 fig 6b in summary the impact of strong human interventions on the correlations between discharges at sj and downstream water levels seems substantially enhances while human interventions have less influences on the correlations between discharges at gy and downstream water levels 4 2 reliability verification of the hdcp approach in order to model the dependence between the downstream water levels and the upstream flooding the marginal distributions of the variables mentioned in the hdcp approach need to be fitted table 1 here we considered several theoretical distributions including gamma logistic lognormal normal and weibull distributions to fit the variables and the most appropriate one was determined by chi squared statistic based on the fitdistrplus r package delignette muller and dutang 2015 then we considered a set of copula functions mentioned in section 3 2 to construct the hdcp approach the best dependence model was determined by the minimum aic values our approach can generate random samples here the samples are monthly average water levels of pseudo characteristics for the predicted variables the generated samples are compared with the observations at each water level station here the stations are mentioned in table 1 we have included the pearson s correlation coefficient p and other three quantitative statistics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr to test the applicability of the hdcp approach in five configurations the five configurations ⅰ ⅴ are mentioned in table 1 the formulas for these metrics are available in the supplementary material in general model simulation can be treated as satisfactory if nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 and if pbias 25 moriasi et al 2007 and if p 0 70 profillidis et al 2019 in the current study table 2 shows the nse is 0 52 0 82 pbias is 8 90 0 70 rsr is 0 42 0 69 and p is 0 72 0 91 over multiple stations this also reflects that the hdcp approach is generally able to capture the conditional dependence between upstream floods and downstream water levels in the prd 4 3 spatial occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels under compound upstream flooding we take the 95th and 75th quantiles of upstream discharges for the two discharge stations i e the gy and sj stations as extremely high and high flooding respectively then we set up two upstream flooding conditions the first condition when gy occurs 75 flooding and sj occurs 95 flooding and the second condition when gy occurs 95 flooding and sj occurs 75 flooding for the first condition the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels below 80 covers most of the prd area fig 7 a for the second condition as shown in fig 7b the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in most areas of the prb is greater than 85 especially over 90 in some areas of the western prb i e the nh ma gz sd zd and ls water level stations compared with the first condition the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels over multiple water level stations except mk and ss stations increased by 5 to 22 under the second condition in addition we also examined the difference in extreme water levels across the prb area under the two conditions as shown in fig 7c for the first condition the downstream water levels in most parts of prb except mk and ss stations range from 0 15 to 2 00 m compared with the first condition the water levels at most stations in the northern part of prb increased by 0 09 0 64 m under the second condition fig 7d during the flooding period it can also be found that the flooding condition at gy station xijiang river generally dominates the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in the prd 4 4 occurrence likelihood variability under the effect of strong human interventions as a densely populated and urbanized region the prd has been subject to intense human activities fig 8 illustrates a comparison of the well fitted pdfs during the flooding seasons from april to september of 1965 1988 with less human interventions and 1998 2016 with significant human interventions for water level and discharge at the 15 stations there are also apparent variations in pdf curve shapes over the two different periods indicating the stronger human effects for most stations the likelihood of higher values of the two variables tends to decrease after significant human interventions we performed a similar analysis for the period with less human interventions the period 1965 1988 and the period with significant human interventions the period 1998 2016 as illustrated in fig 9 the results enable a comparison of changes in the extreme water levels and their occurrence likelihood at a given compound upstream flooding over the above two periods i e using the results of the period1998 2016 minus those of the period 1965 1988 for the first upstream flooding condition fig 9a the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in the northwest parts of the prb increased after strong human interventions i e mk station increased by 13 and ss station increased by 4 and these stations are mainly concentrated in the western parts of foshan city besides during the second period we did not observe any significant decrease in the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in parts of the southern prb i e the rq ma ssj bsw zy and dls stations decreased by 3 6 for the second upstream flooding condition fig 9b there are no significant differences in the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels across most parts of the prb after strong human interventions except the mk and ss stations the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in parts of the southeastern prb decreased in the period of 1998 2016 i e mk ss and gz stations decreased by 20 4 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 9c d we also provided the maps of changes in extreme water levels under different upstream flooding conditions during the flooding seasons from april to september of 1965 1988 and 1998 2016 for the first upstream flooding condition fig 9c no significant decrease was observed in extreme water levels across the prb during 1998 2016 with strong human interventions except for the northwest parts of the prb i e the extreme water level at mk ss gz and nh stations decreased by 1 42 m 1 59 m 1 20 m and 1 12 m respectively for the second upstream flooding condition fig 9d the extreme water levels decreased significantly throughout the northwest parts of the prb and extreme water levels decreased greater than 1 77 m mainly occurred in mk and ss stations the results indicate that strong human interventions have a direct effect on the extreme water levels and their occurrence likelihood in the northwest parts of the prb when gy station occurs extremely high flooding the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in the northwest parts of the prb decreased during 1998 2016 with strong human interventions besides when sj station occurs extremely high flooding the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in the northwest parts of the prb increased after strong human interventions 4 5 discussion and conclusions it has been reported that the relationship between the water levels and discharges can provide guidelines for flood prevention and water resources management luo et al 2007 such relationship depends on the shape size slope roughness of the river channel and discharge according to luo et al 2007 the sand excavation activities over all the prd had caused dramatic riverbed degradation with 0 59 1 73 m 0 34 4 43 m and 1 77 6 48 m deepening on average in the xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river respectively based on existing hydraulic simulation liu et al 2019b the down cutting of riverbed has caused the change of the hydrodynamic characteristics the relationship between discharges and water levels in the upper part of the prd e g gy sj mk and ss stations additionally lin et al 2017 found that the streamflow in prd is also affected by climate change and reservoirs operations in other words human interventions such as sand excavation activities and reservoir constructions have directly or indirectly altered the dimensions of the streambed or stream channel and changed the redistribution of water in the prd thus leading to the variation in the temporal and spatial distribution of water levels in this regard we first compared the correlations between water levels at multiple stations and the discharge of single upper channel during the two periods the period of 1965 1988 with less human interventions and the period of 1998 2016 with the significant human interventions it can be found that the variations in correlations between discharges from the beijiang river and downstream water levels were substantially enhanced while the variations in correlations between discharges from the xijiang river and downstream water levels decreased insignificantly fig 6 this is because the decreased water levels caused by sand excavation activities led to a redistribution of discharges from xijiang river and beijiang river wang et al 2021 during the flood season the fluvial dynamics are much stronger than the tidal dynamics in the prd hence in such flood season the water levels in the prd are not mainly controlled by the tide but by the runoff from xijaing river and beijiang river in general the correlations between discharges from the beijiang river and downstream water levels were enhanced after sand excavation activities in addition the morphology of the river channels within the prd has changed unevenly since the 1980s which in turn affects the variation in the temporal and spatial distribution of extreme water levels in the prd zhang et al 2009 however the linear correlation between water levels at multiple stations and the discharge of single upper channel seems unable to capture the inhomogeneous spatiotemporal variations fig 6 therefore we present an hdcp approach as mentioned in section 3 for assessing the spatial concurrence likelihood of downstream extreme water levels under the multiple upstream flooding over the prd the presented approach allows for estimating the extreme water levels likelihood and event impacted areas under multiple upstream flooding conditions we set two upstream flooding conditions i e the first condition when gy occurs 75 flooding and sj occurs 95 flooding and the second condition when gy occurs 95 flooding and sj occurs 75 flooding the changes in the likelihood of the two conditions are thus compared the results indicate that the flooding condition of the xijiang river dominates the occurrence likelihood of extreme water level events in the prd while the flooding condition of the beijiang river plays a secondary role this is because about 77 of the river discharge entering the prd is from the xijiang river while only 15 of the river discharge is from the beijiang river lu et al 2007 this study also focused on assessing the occurrence likelihood variability of extreme water level events as a result of human interventions during the periods with less human interventions the water level changes are dominantly affected by the natural changes in river discharges in the prd zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2019a feng et al 2021 from the1990s to the early 2000s due to reckless sand excavation in the prd the natural river channels of the prb were substantially deepened liu et al 2019a additionally since the 1990s the construction and operation of cascade reservoirs in upper river channels i e the xijiang river and beijiang river have resulted in a continuous reduction in the streamflow of the xijiang river and beijiang river liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019a in general the probabilistic behavior of hydrological variables has been greatly impacted by the strong anthropogenic interventions in the prd in recent years given the well fitted marginal distribution of hydrological variables of two periods 1965 1988 and 1998 2016 we built the conditional dependence structure based on the hdcp approach the probability density functions at the 15 prd stations show that the likelihood of higher values decreases during the period of 1998 2016 to some extent as compared to the period of 1965 1988 besides the hdcp approach identifies the occurrence likelihood variability of extreme water level events associated with the effect of strong human interventions specifically the changes in the likelihood of the two conditions during the above two periods are compared the results reveal that the extreme water levels and their occurrence likelihood in the northwest regions of the prb respond significantly to the strong human interventions especially in the mk ss gz and nh areas fig 9 due to the intense sand excavation activities around the mk and ss stations the water levels were strongly disturbed by the sand excavation activities in the prd wang et al 2021 the quantity of sand extraction activities in the upper part of the prd is much larger than the lower part as a consequence the uneven down cutting in the riverbed of the deltaic channels has affected the variation in the temporal and spatial distribution of the correlation structures of upstream discharges and downstream water levels in the prd region we also noticed that in the northwest regions of the prb the effect of upstream flooding from the xijiang river the gy station on the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels has been slightly weakened while the effect of upstream flooding from the beijiang river the sj station has been substantially strengthened during the period of 1998 2016 with strong human activities this is mainly attributable to the decreased discharge from the xijiang river caused by reservoir operation and the redistribution of water caused by sand excavation activities in the prd during the flood season the decreases in discharges from the xijiang river lead to the decrease of extreme water levels in the prd yet the down cutting of the riverbed around the ss station due to sand excavation activities and it also modulates the river discharge division at junctions in the prd thus more river discharge could flow into the beijiang river networks wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2009 this fact confirms that when upstream extreme floods are dominated by the discharge from the beijiang river the northwest part of the prd has an increased risk of flood hazards there is a need to clarify that the physical processes are rarely considered in the hdcp approach with the rapid development of coastal cities estuarine environments have been drastically changed by human interventions that considerably alter hydrodynamics and geomorphologies therefore it is necessary to apply the numerical or analytical model to explore the development and the physical mechanisms of the extreme flood events in the future in addition it should be mentioned that the presented approach is based on average data and we considered several theoretical distributions e g gamma logistic lognormal normal and weibull distributions to fit the data we used the 75th and 95th percentile to reflect the extreme conditions inspired by some existing studies beniston 2009 hao et al 2013 in our study these percentiles were used to delineate relatively high intensity flood and extreme flood conditions yet several studies have also documented that multivariate extreme value distributions can be more effective to represent the extreme behavior of the events heffernan and tawn 2004 developed a conditional approach to reveal complex extremal dependences of a d dimensional random variable coles et al 1999 applied the multivariate extreme distributions to quantify the dependence of multivariate extreme values westra and sisson 2011 used the max stable processes to assess the non stationarity in extreme precipitation from multiple locations these approaches have numerous hydrological applications and they are particularly effective for analyzing correlation structure in extreme cases therefore a potential improvement of the hdcp approach is to include other extreme value distributions to fit the marginal distribution of monthly daily maximum water levels we would like to highlight that despite the limited records the proposed method performs satisfactorily in capturing the dependency structure between multiple variables the hdcp approach could be further extended in modeling the dependence structures of other hydrometeorological variables of interest e g sea level precipitation and temperature and offer additional insights for decision makers water drought management and risk assessment furthermore previous studies found that the evolution of the river channels in the prd entered into an adjustment state after the prohibition of sand excavation activities liu et al 2019a yang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 these results indicate that the relationship between the water level and discharge in the prd may maintain stability in the future therefore assuming the main rules of management in the prd are unchanged the

1806,the pearl river delta prd is one of the largest urbanized areas in both area and population and also suffers increasing flooding hazards in the context of climate change and anthropogenic interventions the co occurrence of multiple upstream flooding drivers compound flooding over different upstream channels often exacerbates stronger impacts on downstream water levels compared with their isolated occurrence it is particularly important to derive more reliable risk estimations of extreme water levels in downstream channels of a nested river system by considering the spatial dependence between multiple upstream floods and downstream water levels in this study we present an approach termed the high dimensional conditional probability hdcp approach to capture the probabilistic dependence behavior of upstream floods and downstream water level events at the prd and estimate the extreme water levels likelihood and event impacted areas under the multiple upstream flooding the prd as one of the most vulnerable regions to extreme floods in china was used as a case study to test the applicability of the hdcp approach first the hdcp is used to model the conditional dependence of upstream floods and downstream water levels based on the canonical vine copula then different flood scenarios are investigated by estimating the occurrence likelihood of downstream water level events and their spatial patterns the final part identifies the changes in the occurrence likelihood variability of extreme water level events after strong human interventions results indicate that the upstream flooding over the xijiang river dominates the occurrence likelihood of extreme water level events over the prd and the beijiang river plays a secondary role after strong human interventions the effect of the beijiang river has been strengthened while the effect of the xijaing river has been weakened the proposed hdcp approach is not only applicable to the prd area dominated by multiple upstream rivers as mentioned in this study but it is also promising in detecting the spatial occurrence likelihood of other hydrometeorological variables in other areas with different climates and topographical conditions and formulating regional development strategies for policymakers in water resources and disaster drought risk managements against single compound extreme events keywords extreme water levels conditional dependence upstream downstream linkages pearl river delta human interventions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the pearl river delta prd is one of the most rapidly urbanized and developed economic areas in china besides the prd is also the most vulnerable region to extreme floods in the context of climate change and anthropogenic interfaces yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2021 in the past when human interventions were limited water level changes in prd were mainly affected by the natural changes in upstream discharges zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 liu et al 2019a strong anthropogenic interventions have significantly altered the natural evolution of the pearl river basin prb river system han et al 2022 wu et al 2016 wei et al 2021 luo et al 2007 the cascade reservoirs and dams in the main tributaries of the prb i e the xijiang river and beijiang river have also strongly affected the magnitudes of discharges hydrograph and river hydrologic characteristics of the prb normally severe flooding events occur not only in a single river channel but also in several tributaries of a nested catchment the co occurrence of multiple upstream flooding generally exerts much stronger impacts on downstream water levels compared with their isolated occurrence the consideration of the spatial dependence between multiple upstream floods and downstream water levels is essential to generate reliable risk estimation of extreme water levels in downstream channels of a complicated river system a multivariate model is thus expected to model the spatial dependence between upstream floods and downstream water levels and estimate the concurrent risk of such compound events the hydrological frequency analysis generally employs univariate probability distributions yet this may result in under overestimate the concurrent risk with a given event salvadori and de michele 2004 merz and blöschl 2008 laux et al 2011 in fact the hydrologic events mostly involve joint behavior of different random variables e g discharge and water levels or the same variable over different locations for instance if a given hydrological event is widespread over a domain the univariate frequency analysis may not be reliable enough to assess the spatial concurrent likelihood thus a better understanding of concurrent hydrological events needs to model their joint dependence structure via a multivariate approach to date the copula has emerged as a promising and superior approach to flexibly model the joint dependence structure of multiple variables compared to the classical multivariate distributions such as a multivariate gaussian it also has an advantage in characterizing the dependence structure independently from the marginal distributions favre et al 2004 genest and favre 2007 chen et al 2019 the copula has been well employed in numerous hydrological applications such as the risk identification of extreme events ganguli and reddy 2013 chang et al 2016 flood return periods requena et al 2013 hydrological prediction liu et al 2015 liu et al 2016 dependence between extreme events aghakouchak et al 2010 and frequency analysis salvadori and de michele 2004 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 mirabbasi et al 2012 bárdossy and li 2008 in addition a variety of copula based methods have been further developed to model the dependence between extreme events for example a copula based bayesian network approach was proposed to analyze flood risk and prediction kong et al 2019 ballarin et al 2021 proposed a copula based drought assessment framework for risk assessment of extreme drought events despite this generality theoretical developments and applications of parametric copulas are mostly limited in bivariate cases that is to say the commonly used parametric copulas have restrictions in multivariate modeling at higher dimensions e g the dimensions greater than three due to parameter restrictions and computationally intensive formulations this thus limits its application in multiple site involved frequency analysis for compound hydrological events furthermore most copula based studies were conducted in the context of unconditional assessments to determine the contribution of upstream flooding compound flooding to the downstream water levels regarding the current study a conditional relationship needs to be established this thus can measure the conditional impacts of upstream flooding on downstream water level events vine copula also known as pair copula constructions pccs allows for modeling multivariate dependencies with high flexibility for any dimensions aas et al 2009 bevacqua et al 2017 bedford and cooke 2001 brechmann et al 2013 joe et al 2010 several studies did pioneer work by using the vine copula in risk assessment for example bevacqua et al 2017 used the vine copula to model the conditional probability distribution of river streamflow and sea levels given meteorological variables to estimate the compound flood risk to quantify the impact of dry hot extreme events on vegetation dynamics li et al 2021 developed a vine copula based probability model in this study considering the spatial temporal correlation of the flood events between multiple upstream and downstream we attempt to present a high dimensional conditional probability hdcp approach by using the vine copula as a baseline model to assess the spatial concurrence likelihood of downstream extreme water levels under the effect of multiple upstream flooding the prb is used as a study case area to apply the presented approach the approach is threefold 1 utilizing the vine copula as a base model to model the probabilistic dependence behavior between upstream floods and downstream water levels 2 quantifying the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels and their spatial patterns given various upstream flooding conditions 3 identifying the occurrence likelihood variability of extreme water level events as a result of human interventions the likelihood estimation of concurrent hydrological events could be beneficial to the water resources management mitigation and preparation for potential floods 2 case study sites and dataset 2 1 study site and target species the prd located in the southern part of china is a highly complicated hydrologic network system which is an alluvial delta formed by three major tributaries the xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river of the pearl river fig 1 the prd has been strongly affected by climate change and intensive human activities such as dam and reservoir constructions sand excavation in the channels channel dredging after 1990 a few large reservoirs were constructed in the xijiang river and beijiang river with increasing reservoir capacity indices liu et al 2014 the total storage capacity of dams reached 538 108 m3 by 2006 which accounts for 24 7 of the xijiang river s annual water volume liu et al 2018b another human interventions were the large scale sand excavation activities since the mid 1980s the earliest sand excavation activities occurred close to the ss station the second wave sand excavation activities have occurred close to sj station sand excavation activities have been continued for approximately 20 years in prd in particular sand excavation activities from 1986 to 2003 in the prd resulted in average down cutting depths of 0 59 1 7 m and 0 34 4 43 m in the main channels of the xijaing river and beijiang river respectively luo et al 2007 in particular since the 1980s the prd has been experiencing a rapid urbanization process and economic development with a huge population boom as a result the hydrodynamic characteristics of the pearl river system have been significantly making the prd one of the most vulnerable river deltas to flooding in the world 2 2 dataset in this study time series of monthly streamflow from 2 gauging stations and time series of monthly water levels from 13 gauging stations were collected fig 1 which are available from the pearl river hydrological yearbooks the discharge in the prd is affected by seasonal rainfall and about 80 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in the flood season april september gaoyao gy and shijiao sj stations are the upstream streamflow stations fig 1 as the key control station in the prd we considered five configurations by identifying the effect of upstream flooding denoted as the q variable on downstream water levels denoted as the z variable at different stations table 1 specifically q variables streamflow at gy and sj upstream discharge of the prb represent the predictors z variables water levels at 13 stations represent the predicted variables in this study we used the same predictors because the downstream water levels at gauging stations are driven by the similar hydrological influence of upstream discharges the data during the flooding seasons from april to september were involved in the following analyses 3 methodology 3 1 correlation between upstream floods and downstream water levels in order to further verify the spatial response patterns of occurrence likelihood of water level to upstream flooding the correlations between downstream water levels and upstream discharge were calculated using the pearson correlation coefficients for each water level station in the study region pearson s correlation analysis was performed between the downstream water levels and upstream discharge series during the flooding period as follows 1 r z g y c o r r z n q gy r z s j c o r r z n q sj where zn is the water level at the n th station qgy is the discharge at the gy station qsj is the discharge at the sj station r z g y indicates the correlation coefficient between zn and qgy and r z s j indicates the correlation coefficient between zn and qsj correlation coefficients ranging 0 9 1 0 indicate very highly correlation correlation coefficients ranging 0 7 0 9 indicate variables highly correlation correlation coefficients between 0 5 and 0 7 indicate moderately correlation correlation coefficients only ranging 0 3 0 5 indicate a low correlation correlation coefficients less than 0 3 indicate very low correlation to show the correlation coefficients between various water levels and discharges associated with their spatial patterns we also employed the idw interpolation method 3 2 vine copula copula offers a general framework to model the probabilistic dependence behavior from different variables sklar 1959 however in higher dimensional e g d 3 scenarios owing to the limitations of a large number of parameters and complexity the copulas mainly referring to bivariate copulas are difficult to be applied liu et al 2018a 2021 sadegh et al 2017 to overcome these limitations joe 1996 and aas et al 2009 developed vine copulas which are a hierarchy of pair copula constructions for multidimensional cases regular vines include two simple sub classes canonical vine copulas c vine copulas and drawable vine copulas d vine copulas as an illustration here we mainly employed c vine copulas to construct the conditional probability model the joint density function of the n dimensional c vine copula is 2 f x 1 x n k 1 n f k x k i 1 n 1 j 1 n i c i i j 1 i 1 f x i x 1 x i 1 f x i j x 1 x i 1 where fk xk k 1 n denotes the n marginal densities and ci i j 1 i 1 represents the bivariate copula densities more details about the c vine copula can be found in some previous studies aas et al 2009 bevacqua et al 2017 bedford and cooke 2001 brechmann et al 2013 joe et al 2010 to understand the decomposition of c vine structure a 3 dimensional canonical vine structure 3c vine is taken as the example to show the pair copula of vine structure in fig 2 fig 2 depicts a graphical model of a c vine with two trees this graphical representation illustrates the ordering of the variables in the first tree variable 1 plays a pivotal role variable 2 has this pivotal role in the second tree and the possible pair of variable 2 with variable 3 is modeled conditionally on variable 1 for instance the joint density function of a 3c vine can be expressed as 3 f 123 f 1 f 2 f 3 c 12 c 13 c 23 1 where x1 x2 and x3 indicate three different variables c 1 2 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 is simply denoted as c 12 representing the density function of pair copula with marginal distributions f 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 c 23 1 representing the conditional copula density the marginal conditional distribution functions e g f x v for an m dimensional vector ν v 1 v m can be written as brechmann et al 2013 brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 4 h x ν θ f x ν c x v j ν j f x ν j f v j ν j f v j ν j where v j j 1 m is an arbitrary component of ν ν j v 1 v j 1 v j 1 v m denotes the vector ν but excluding component v j the bivariate copula function is indicated as c x v j ν j h function is introduced here as the conditional distribution function based on the 3c vine structure we can derive the conditional cumulative distribution function f u 3 u 1 u 2 which is also a conditional prediction model for the variable x3 given other variables x 1 x 2 based on eqs 3 and 4 f u 3 u 1 u 2 can be computed by recursively applying the h function liu et al 2015 one can derive x 3 from the following equation 5 f u 3 u 1 u 2 h h u 3 u 1 θ 13 h u 2 u 1 θ 12 θ 23 1 here the parameters to be estimated are θ θ 13 θ 12 θ 23 1 θ is the set of parameters of different conditional copulas in the 3c vine structure and uk k 1 2 3 is the marginal cumulative distribution function cdf of x 1 x 3 the variable x 3 is the predicted variable and the variables x 1 and x 2 are the conditioning variables i e predictors 3 3 a high dimensional conditional probability hdcp approach based on vine copula according to the joint density of the n dimensional c vine structure presented in eq 1 a c vine structure with a certain order for given data can be fitted using all of the pair copulas conditional bivariate copulas we take the 3c vine as an illustration the conditional probability model eq 5 can also be written according to the c vine structure fig 2 the higher dimensional conditional prediction models can also be obtained by recursively applying the h function the general form of eq 5 can be written as 6 f u j u 1 u j 1 u i h h u j u 1 u j 1 h u i u 1 u j 1 where the argument h u j u 1 u j 1 and h u i u 1 u j 1 1 j i can be obtained recursively according to eq 4 brechmann et al 2013 next we introduce the τ th copula quantile curve chen et al 2009 ren et al 2014 liu et al 2018a to simulate u 3 based on eq 5 and derived the inverse distribution function of the c vine structure fig 2 regarding the 3c vine the τ th conditional quantile function of x 3 q x 3 τ x 1 x 2 can be obtained by the recursive computation 7 x 3 q x 3 τ x 1 x 2 f 1 u 3 f 1 h 1 h 1 τ h u 2 u 1 θ 12 θ 23 1 u 1 θ 13 we are able to derive the variable x 3 predicted variable given variables x 1 x 2 predictors based on a 3c vine it should be mentioned that higher dimensional conditional probability models e g 4c vine or higher d can also be obtained by recursively applying the h function in a similar way as illustrated in fig 3 given q 1 and q 2 predictors i e upstream streamflow the 4 dimensional conditional distribution function f z 1 z 2 q 1 q 2 of predicted variables z 1 z 2 downstream water levels at different stations can be obtained by recursively applying the h function given q 1 and q 2 the 5 dimensional conditional distribution function f z 1 z 2 z 3 q 1 q 2 of predicted variables z 1 z 2 z 3 can also be obtained by recursively applying the h function in this paper all the calculation processes of the hdcp approach are based on two r packages i e vinecopula and cdvinecopulaconditional schepsmeier et al 2015 gaussian student t clayton frank gumbel and joe copula are used as the pair copula family to build the 4c vine or 5c vine conditional model the selection of the pair copulas in the 4c vine 5c vine conditional model was determined by the akaike information criterion aic schepsmeier et al 2015 finally we can estimate the concurrence likelihood of extreme water levels at various upstream flooding conditions to show the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels and their spatial patterns we used of the inverse distance weight idw interpolation method the idw method allows the spatial interpolation of occurrence likelihood water levels to over an area the explanation and calculation of the idw method are available in the supplementary material 4 results 4 1 spatial correlation patterns between upstream floods and downstream water levels moreover we further investigated the relationships between water levels at multiple stations and discharges of different upper channels through correlation analysis fig 4 presents the spatial patterns of the pearson correlation coefficients of zn q gy and zn q sj of the prb during the flooding season of 1965 2016 for most regions of the prb the downstream water levels indicate highly positive correlations with the discharges at the gy station fig 4a and the downstream water levels have moderately positive correlations with the discharge at the sj station fig 4b specifically for the relationship of zn q gy the correlations coefficient is around 0 7 0 96 for the relationship of zn q sj the correlations coefficient is about 0 33 0 5 this suggests the downstream water levels are dominantly determined by upstream discharges at the gy station of the prb besides the cumulative deviation curve test was used to test the trend of the annual average water levels of prb from 1965 to 2016 fig 5 indicates two different periods i e the period of 1965 1988 with less human interventions and the period of 1998 2016 with the significant human interventions the explanation and calculation of the cumulative departure are available in the supplementary material to test whether the strengths of these relationships vary under the effect of strong human interventions we validated the variations in correlations over different periods 1965 1988 and 1998 2016 fig 6 comparisons reveal that an insignificant decrease in the correlations of zn q gy can be found in most regions of the prb during 1998 2016 as compared to 1965 1988 fig 6a a large increase in the correlations of zn q sj can be found in most regions of the prb during 1998 2016 as compared to 1965 1988 fig 6b in summary the impact of strong human interventions on the correlations between discharges at sj and downstream water levels seems substantially enhances while human interventions have less influences on the correlations between discharges at gy and downstream water levels 4 2 reliability verification of the hdcp approach in order to model the dependence between the downstream water levels and the upstream flooding the marginal distributions of the variables mentioned in the hdcp approach need to be fitted table 1 here we considered several theoretical distributions including gamma logistic lognormal normal and weibull distributions to fit the variables and the most appropriate one was determined by chi squared statistic based on the fitdistrplus r package delignette muller and dutang 2015 then we considered a set of copula functions mentioned in section 3 2 to construct the hdcp approach the best dependence model was determined by the minimum aic values our approach can generate random samples here the samples are monthly average water levels of pseudo characteristics for the predicted variables the generated samples are compared with the observations at each water level station here the stations are mentioned in table 1 we have included the pearson s correlation coefficient p and other three quantitative statistics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr to test the applicability of the hdcp approach in five configurations the five configurations ⅰ ⅴ are mentioned in table 1 the formulas for these metrics are available in the supplementary material in general model simulation can be treated as satisfactory if nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 and if pbias 25 moriasi et al 2007 and if p 0 70 profillidis et al 2019 in the current study table 2 shows the nse is 0 52 0 82 pbias is 8 90 0 70 rsr is 0 42 0 69 and p is 0 72 0 91 over multiple stations this also reflects that the hdcp approach is generally able to capture the conditional dependence between upstream floods and downstream water levels in the prd 4 3 spatial occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels under compound upstream flooding we take the 95th and 75th quantiles of upstream discharges for the two discharge stations i e the gy and sj stations as extremely high and high flooding respectively then we set up two upstream flooding conditions the first condition when gy occurs 75 flooding and sj occurs 95 flooding and the second condition when gy occurs 95 flooding and sj occurs 75 flooding for the first condition the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels below 80 covers most of the prd area fig 7 a for the second condition as shown in fig 7b the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in most areas of the prb is greater than 85 especially over 90 in some areas of the western prb i e the nh ma gz sd zd and ls water level stations compared with the first condition the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels over multiple water level stations except mk and ss stations increased by 5 to 22 under the second condition in addition we also examined the difference in extreme water levels across the prb area under the two conditions as shown in fig 7c for the first condition the downstream water levels in most parts of prb except mk and ss stations range from 0 15 to 2 00 m compared with the first condition the water levels at most stations in the northern part of prb increased by 0 09 0 64 m under the second condition fig 7d during the flooding period it can also be found that the flooding condition at gy station xijiang river generally dominates the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in the prd 4 4 occurrence likelihood variability under the effect of strong human interventions as a densely populated and urbanized region the prd has been subject to intense human activities fig 8 illustrates a comparison of the well fitted pdfs during the flooding seasons from april to september of 1965 1988 with less human interventions and 1998 2016 with significant human interventions for water level and discharge at the 15 stations there are also apparent variations in pdf curve shapes over the two different periods indicating the stronger human effects for most stations the likelihood of higher values of the two variables tends to decrease after significant human interventions we performed a similar analysis for the period with less human interventions the period 1965 1988 and the period with significant human interventions the period 1998 2016 as illustrated in fig 9 the results enable a comparison of changes in the extreme water levels and their occurrence likelihood at a given compound upstream flooding over the above two periods i e using the results of the period1998 2016 minus those of the period 1965 1988 for the first upstream flooding condition fig 9a the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in the northwest parts of the prb increased after strong human interventions i e mk station increased by 13 and ss station increased by 4 and these stations are mainly concentrated in the western parts of foshan city besides during the second period we did not observe any significant decrease in the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in parts of the southern prb i e the rq ma ssj bsw zy and dls stations decreased by 3 6 for the second upstream flooding condition fig 9b there are no significant differences in the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels across most parts of the prb after strong human interventions except the mk and ss stations the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in parts of the southeastern prb decreased in the period of 1998 2016 i e mk ss and gz stations decreased by 20 4 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 9c d we also provided the maps of changes in extreme water levels under different upstream flooding conditions during the flooding seasons from april to september of 1965 1988 and 1998 2016 for the first upstream flooding condition fig 9c no significant decrease was observed in extreme water levels across the prb during 1998 2016 with strong human interventions except for the northwest parts of the prb i e the extreme water level at mk ss gz and nh stations decreased by 1 42 m 1 59 m 1 20 m and 1 12 m respectively for the second upstream flooding condition fig 9d the extreme water levels decreased significantly throughout the northwest parts of the prb and extreme water levels decreased greater than 1 77 m mainly occurred in mk and ss stations the results indicate that strong human interventions have a direct effect on the extreme water levels and their occurrence likelihood in the northwest parts of the prb when gy station occurs extremely high flooding the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in the northwest parts of the prb decreased during 1998 2016 with strong human interventions besides when sj station occurs extremely high flooding the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels in the northwest parts of the prb increased after strong human interventions 4 5 discussion and conclusions it has been reported that the relationship between the water levels and discharges can provide guidelines for flood prevention and water resources management luo et al 2007 such relationship depends on the shape size slope roughness of the river channel and discharge according to luo et al 2007 the sand excavation activities over all the prd had caused dramatic riverbed degradation with 0 59 1 73 m 0 34 4 43 m and 1 77 6 48 m deepening on average in the xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river respectively based on existing hydraulic simulation liu et al 2019b the down cutting of riverbed has caused the change of the hydrodynamic characteristics the relationship between discharges and water levels in the upper part of the prd e g gy sj mk and ss stations additionally lin et al 2017 found that the streamflow in prd is also affected by climate change and reservoirs operations in other words human interventions such as sand excavation activities and reservoir constructions have directly or indirectly altered the dimensions of the streambed or stream channel and changed the redistribution of water in the prd thus leading to the variation in the temporal and spatial distribution of water levels in this regard we first compared the correlations between water levels at multiple stations and the discharge of single upper channel during the two periods the period of 1965 1988 with less human interventions and the period of 1998 2016 with the significant human interventions it can be found that the variations in correlations between discharges from the beijiang river and downstream water levels were substantially enhanced while the variations in correlations between discharges from the xijiang river and downstream water levels decreased insignificantly fig 6 this is because the decreased water levels caused by sand excavation activities led to a redistribution of discharges from xijiang river and beijiang river wang et al 2021 during the flood season the fluvial dynamics are much stronger than the tidal dynamics in the prd hence in such flood season the water levels in the prd are not mainly controlled by the tide but by the runoff from xijaing river and beijiang river in general the correlations between discharges from the beijiang river and downstream water levels were enhanced after sand excavation activities in addition the morphology of the river channels within the prd has changed unevenly since the 1980s which in turn affects the variation in the temporal and spatial distribution of extreme water levels in the prd zhang et al 2009 however the linear correlation between water levels at multiple stations and the discharge of single upper channel seems unable to capture the inhomogeneous spatiotemporal variations fig 6 therefore we present an hdcp approach as mentioned in section 3 for assessing the spatial concurrence likelihood of downstream extreme water levels under the multiple upstream flooding over the prd the presented approach allows for estimating the extreme water levels likelihood and event impacted areas under multiple upstream flooding conditions we set two upstream flooding conditions i e the first condition when gy occurs 75 flooding and sj occurs 95 flooding and the second condition when gy occurs 95 flooding and sj occurs 75 flooding the changes in the likelihood of the two conditions are thus compared the results indicate that the flooding condition of the xijiang river dominates the occurrence likelihood of extreme water level events in the prd while the flooding condition of the beijiang river plays a secondary role this is because about 77 of the river discharge entering the prd is from the xijiang river while only 15 of the river discharge is from the beijiang river lu et al 2007 this study also focused on assessing the occurrence likelihood variability of extreme water level events as a result of human interventions during the periods with less human interventions the water level changes are dominantly affected by the natural changes in river discharges in the prd zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2019a feng et al 2021 from the1990s to the early 2000s due to reckless sand excavation in the prd the natural river channels of the prb were substantially deepened liu et al 2019a additionally since the 1990s the construction and operation of cascade reservoirs in upper river channels i e the xijiang river and beijiang river have resulted in a continuous reduction in the streamflow of the xijiang river and beijiang river liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019a in general the probabilistic behavior of hydrological variables has been greatly impacted by the strong anthropogenic interventions in the prd in recent years given the well fitted marginal distribution of hydrological variables of two periods 1965 1988 and 1998 2016 we built the conditional dependence structure based on the hdcp approach the probability density functions at the 15 prd stations show that the likelihood of higher values decreases during the period of 1998 2016 to some extent as compared to the period of 1965 1988 besides the hdcp approach identifies the occurrence likelihood variability of extreme water level events associated with the effect of strong human interventions specifically the changes in the likelihood of the two conditions during the above two periods are compared the results reveal that the extreme water levels and their occurrence likelihood in the northwest regions of the prb respond significantly to the strong human interventions especially in the mk ss gz and nh areas fig 9 due to the intense sand excavation activities around the mk and ss stations the water levels were strongly disturbed by the sand excavation activities in the prd wang et al 2021 the quantity of sand extraction activities in the upper part of the prd is much larger than the lower part as a consequence the uneven down cutting in the riverbed of the deltaic channels has affected the variation in the temporal and spatial distribution of the correlation structures of upstream discharges and downstream water levels in the prd region we also noticed that in the northwest regions of the prb the effect of upstream flooding from the xijiang river the gy station on the occurrence likelihood of extreme water levels has been slightly weakened while the effect of upstream flooding from the beijiang river the sj station has been substantially strengthened during the period of 1998 2016 with strong human activities this is mainly attributable to the decreased discharge from the xijiang river caused by reservoir operation and the redistribution of water caused by sand excavation activities in the prd during the flood season the decreases in discharges from the xijiang river lead to the decrease of extreme water levels in the prd yet the down cutting of the riverbed around the ss station due to sand excavation activities and it also modulates the river discharge division at junctions in the prd thus more river discharge could flow into the beijiang river networks wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2009 this fact confirms that when upstream extreme floods are dominated by the discharge from the beijiang river the northwest part of the prd has an increased risk of flood hazards there is a need to clarify that the physical processes are rarely considered in the hdcp approach with the rapid development of coastal cities estuarine environments have been drastically changed by human interventions that considerably alter hydrodynamics and geomorphologies therefore it is necessary to apply the numerical or analytical model to explore the development and the physical mechanisms of the extreme flood events in the future in addition it should be mentioned that the presented approach is based on average data and we considered several theoretical distributions e g gamma logistic lognormal normal and weibull distributions to fit the data we used the 75th and 95th percentile to reflect the extreme conditions inspired by some existing studies beniston 2009 hao et al 2013 in our study these percentiles were used to delineate relatively high intensity flood and extreme flood conditions yet several studies have also documented that multivariate extreme value distributions can be more effective to represent the extreme behavior of the events heffernan and tawn 2004 developed a conditional approach to reveal complex extremal dependences of a d dimensional random variable coles et al 1999 applied the multivariate extreme distributions to quantify the dependence of multivariate extreme values westra and sisson 2011 used the max stable processes to assess the non stationarity in extreme precipitation from multiple locations these approaches have numerous hydrological applications and they are particularly effective for analyzing correlation structure in extreme cases therefore a potential improvement of the hdcp approach is to include other extreme value distributions to fit the marginal distribution of monthly daily maximum water levels we would like to highlight that despite the limited records the proposed method performs satisfactorily in capturing the dependency structure between multiple variables the hdcp approach could be further extended in modeling the dependence structures of other hydrometeorological variables of interest e g sea level precipitation and temperature and offer additional insights for decision makers water drought management and risk assessment furthermore previous studies found that the evolution of the river channels in the prd entered into an adjustment state after the prohibition of sand excavation activities liu et al 2019a yang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 these results indicate that the relationship between the water level and discharge in the prd may maintain stability in the future therefore assuming the main rules of management in the prd are unchanged the

1807,fractured aquifers are particularly vulnerable to seawater intrusion swi but the mechanism of swi in such aquifers remains largely unknown this study aims to investigate the influence of tides on swi in fractured aquifers through laboratory experiments and numerical models six fractured aquifers and one homogeneous aquifer were employed to conduct laboratory and numerical experiments to preliminary analyze the comprehensive effects of tides and fractures on salinity distributions flow fields and submarine groundwater discharge sgd sensitivity analyses were performed to further explore the impact of each fracture characteristic i e horizontal position vertical position length and orientation on swi properties i e saltwater wedge mixing saline volume and concentration distribution under non tidal and tidal conditions the results indicate that tides can expand the variation range of most swi properties in fractured aquifers and alter the influence patterns of fracture characteristics fractures tend to converge around freshwater and their effect on swi properties depends on their relative position to the saltwater toe length tl reached its maximum when the fractures had just separated from the saltwater wedge and were fully submerged in freshwater longer fractures promoted swi and relieved the tides restriction on tl moreover horizontal fractures can significantly amplify high concentration 50 90 saltwater distribution sgd and upper saline plume usp with the help of tides while vertical fractures only had an impact on the mixing zone these results have important implications for improving our understanding of comprehensive impact of tides and fractures on swi in coastal subsurface environments keywords seawater intrusion fractured aquifers laboratory experiments tides sutra data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seawater intrusion swi is a global issue in coastal aquifers abdoulhalik et al 2022 martínez pérez et al 2022 caused by factors such as groundwater extraction land use change climate variations and sea level fluctuations werner et al 2013 sebben et al 2015 aquifer heterogeneity and hydrodynamic boundary conditions have been recognized as key factors influencing swi giese and barthel 2021 werner et al 2013 dagan and zeitoun 1998 the strong heterogeneity makes it difficult to characterize the preferential flow pathways in fractured aquifers sebben et al 2015 berkowitz 2002 fractured aquifers are particularly susceptible to swi arthur et al 2007 as observed in various countries including the us italy japan and south korea giese and barthel 2021 macallister et al 2018 park et al 2012 salem and osman 2017 tides as one of the most common hydrodynamic conditions play a crucial role in determining the location and shape of the saltwater wedge and mixing zone maria et al 2015a robinson et al 2007a xin et al 2010 they have also been observed to impact the extent of swi in deep saline water layer of fractured aquifers park et al 2012 however laboratory studies on swi in fractured aquifers are still in their early stages etsias et al 2021 and the influence of tides on swi in fractured aquifers remains unclear research on heterogeneous aquifers in general has provided insights into the role of fractures in the absence of comprehensive swi research in fractured aquifers random heterogeneous aquifers can cause steady state saltwater wedge to be closer to the sea compared to homogeneous aquifers with an equal average permeability kerrou and renard 2010 coastal aquifers are also often approximated as stratified heterogeneous aquifers li and boufadel 2010 xia et al 2010 and a high permeability interlayer located at the lower part of the coastal aquifer will result in less swi liu et al 2014 saubhagya et al 2018 have proposed a new parameter transmissivity centroid elevation tce to characterize the extend of swi which is essentially controlled by elevation of preferential flow paths or high permeability layers the layered heterogeneous aquifer also plays a decisive role in the width of the mixing zone with refraction and dispersion of the streamline widening the mixing zone in the low permeability layer above the high permeability layer lu et al 2013 therefore as a unique heterogeneous structure fractures can significantly impact the properties of saltwater wedge and mixing zone the multi scale and high contrast heterogeneous nature of fractured aquifers presents significant challenges for numerical modeling and laboratory experiments hajibeygi et al 2011 vujević et al 2014 etsias et al 2021 to address these challenges various numerical simulation methods have been developed including implicit and explicit fracture models such as equivalent porous medium epm models and dual porosity models dpm for implicit models and discrete fracture matrix dfm models and discrete fracture network dfn models for explicit models epm model can significantly simplify the modeling process and reduce computational complexity but at the cost of oversimplification romanazzi et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 berre et al 2018 on the other hand dfm and dfn models explicitly represent the fractures leading to more accurate results but at a higher computational cost these models have been shown to perform better than epm models in simulating swi in aquifers with a few discrete fractures dagan and zeitoun 1998 sebben et al 2015 salem and osman 2017 sebben et al 2015 found that the extension of the saltwater wedge was influenced by the number and position of horizontal fractures through a dfn model while epm models may seriously overestimate the swi range koohbor et al 2019 used a dfn model and darcy s law to quantitatively analyze the impact of fracture characteristics such as position conductivity and number on saltwater distribution recently etsias et al 2021 conducted the first swi laboratory experiments in aquifers with a single fracture revealing that hydraulic gradient and fracture characteristics are critical factors affecting swi although the impact of hydrodynamic boundary conditions on swi has been extensively studied the effects of tides on swi in fractured aquifers remain to be explored tides significantly affect groundwater recirculation robinson et al 2007a 2007b greskowiak 2014 salinity distributions werner and lockington 2006 and the extent of swi kuan et al 2012 werner et al 2013 in coastal aquifers during high tide seawater infiltrates the beach and exfiltrates the aquifer during low tides creating a faster seawater circulation cell in the intertidal zone than the density driven circulation cell in the saltwater wedge robinson et al 2007b vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 this tide induced seawater circulation contributes to larger amounts of saltwater components of submarine groundwater discharge sgd than density driven seawater circulation resulting in a significant increase in total sgd in certain circumstances such as a small beach slope high tidal amplitudes and high hydraulic conductivity tide induced seawater circulation could create an upper saline plume usp in the intertidal zone in addition to the classical saltwater wedge boufadel 2000 robinson et al 2007b fang et al 2021 meanwhile tidal oscillations also enhance the mixing in both confined inouchi et al 1990 and unconfined ataie ashtiani et al 1999 aquifers moreover the presence of usp pushes the freshwater discharge zone fdz down to the low tide mark reducing the extent of the saltwater wedge in unconfined aquifers kuan et al 2012 however despite extensive studies on the effects of tides on groundwater flow and salinity distribution in homogenous coastal aquifers the effects of tides on swi in fractured aquifers remain largely unknown the current study aims to investigate the impact of tides on swi in unconfined fractured aquifers to compare the results obtained under tidal conditions all laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were also conducted under non tidal conditions the experimental setups included seven scenarios one homogeneous aquifer and six fractured aquifers with different fracture positions and orientations sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the effects of each fracture characteristic i e horizontal position vertical position length and orientation on swi properties i e saltwater wedge mixing zone saline volume and usp volume under non tidal and tidal conditions furthermore an analysis of the concentration distribution was presented to show the combined effects of tides and fractures on the fresh saltwater transition zone based on sensitivity analysis results our results provide novel and constructive insights into the interplay between tidal oscillations and fractures and contribute to a profound understanding of the complex hydrodynamics and heterogeneity in swi 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments the experiments were performed in a 4 m length 0 8 m height 0 02 m width sand tank shown in fig 1 a the sand tank was constructed from tempered glass and mounted on a steel platform two reservoirs one containing freshwater and the other containing saltwater were on the ground on the both sides of the setup the saltwater reservoir sent saltwater to its upper saltwater tank through a pump and the freshwater reservoir sent freshwater to the sand tank through a peristaltic pump the mesh screens were embedded on both sides of the sand tank to prevent sand from entering reservoirs the saltwater tank and freshwater reservoir can automatically control the water level and flux respectively at the seaward end the excess saltwater in the saltwater tank was drained by the overflow outlet to maintain a constant water level 0 54 m the landward reservoir was supplied with freshwater at a fixed rate 6 10 7 m3 s simulating a fixed freshwater flux from the landward boundary to the aquifer under the tidal conditions the tide generator can set the amplitude 0 04 m and period 60 s to control the overflow outlet moving up and down around mean sea level 0 54 m to simulate tidal oscillations kuan et al 2019 during the experiments both the salinity and water level in the near shore zone were monitored the sand tank was packed with well sorted sand with a uniform particle size of 1 mm and relatively uniform with d 50 0 37 mm median diameter the sieve size that 50 of sand grains pass through and d 90 d 10 2 68 d 90 and d 10 are respectively the sieve size that 90 and 10 of sand grains pass through to create an unconfined coastal aquifer with a height of 0 7 m bounded by a sloping beach surface with a slope of 0 25 the sand porosity was measured to be 0 45 using oven drying saturated sand samples method the sand hydraulic conductivity was 1 3 10 2 m s measured by darcy column tests which was converted to 1 33 10 9 m2 permeability in order to meet sutra model setting machine made stainless steel tubes with 0 8 mm openings uniformly distributed on the surface were used to simulate fractures with lengths of 1 m and 0 4 m respectively fig 1 b the cross section size of the tubes was 1 cm thickness 2 cm width thereby their width was comparable to the thickness of sand tank 2 cm following the suggestion of etsias et al 2021 the fracture porosity was set to 1 the fracture permeability was 3 99 10 7 m2 calibrated by numerical simulation which also satisfied the fracture matrix permeability ratio 102 kf km 104 derived by matthäi and belayneh 2004 from the field data to avoid trapped air bubbles in the sand the sand tank was wet packed using an incremental filling method the stainless steel tubes were placed horizontally or vertically in the predetermined position during the sand filling ensuring that the sand completely wrapped the tube without leaving any gaps the saltwater was prepared by adding 35 g of sodium chloride nacl into 1 l of deionized water red food dye e129 allura red ac granular was added to the saltwater to track saltwater distributions during laboratory experiments the density of freshwater and dyed saltwater was determined to 1 000 kg m3 and 1 025 kg m3 respectively to maintain a constant saltwater concentration high concentration saltwater with a concentration of 100 kg m3 was slowly added to the saltwater reservoir every two hours as the saltwater became diluted during the experiments seven sets of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of fractures on swi under non tidal and tidal boundary conditions a homogeneous aquifer experiment was used as a benchmark case while six fractured aquifers experiments were carried out the x z coordinate system with the lower left corner of the sand tank as the origin was established as fractures have a thickness of 0 01 m the positions of horizontal fractures are presented by the coordinates of the midpoint of their bottom edges and the positions of vertical fractures are presented by the coordinates of the midpoint of their left edges previous studies have shown that the change of fracture position is an important variable vujević et al 2014 sebben et al 2015 etsias et al 2021 combined with our model size and preset experimental results we also considered different fracture positions the horizontal fracture in the first four experiments were located at 0 5 m 0 35 m 1 m 0 35 m 1 5 m 0 35 m and 1 m 0 2 m and the vertical fracture in the last two experiments were located at 0 8 m 0 3 m and 1 8 m 0 3 m in the interests of clarity the laboratory aquifers will henceforth be referred to according to their corresponding fracture position and orientation homogeneous non tidal tidal case fig 3 a1 and 3 b1 horizontal left non tidal tidal case fig 3 a2 and 3 b2 horizontal middle non tidal tidal case fig 3 a3 and 3 b3 horizontal right non tidal tidal case fig 3 a4 and 3 b4 horizontal low non tidal tidal case fig 3 a5 and 3 b5 vertical left non tidal tidal case fig 3 a6 and 3 b6 and vertical right non tidal tidal case fig 3 a7 and 3 b7 tidal experiments were initially run to steady state without tides i e the non tidal cases tidal oscillations were then superimposed and experiments were run until the dynamic quasi steady state for both heads and concentrations were reached a digital camera canon ixus 175 recorded the experimental images at five minute intervals 2 2 numerical model the variable saturated variable density flow and solute transport model sutra voss and provost 2008 and the dfm model with fractures being modeled discretely as 2 d elements were employed to validate the observed results in the sand tank experiments the governing equations used in sutra refer to the user manual voss and provost 2008 and not repeat here for brief sutra has been extensively used and validated in previous studies to simulate swi in fractured coastal aquifers yager and ratcliffe 2010 gassiat et al 2013 kuan et al 2019 the conceptual diagram of the 2 d numerical model is illustrated in fig 2 a and has the same basic setup as the laboratory experiments table 1 no regional recharge or evapotranspiration was considered so no water or solute fluxes crossing the top boundary the bottom of the aquifer was set to be impermeable no flux the inland boundary right side was set as a fixed flux boundary with zero salinity freshwater the sea boundary left side was set as the fixed head boundary in the non tidal condition while varied with the tidal level in the tidal condition according to 1 h t h msl a sin 2 π t τ where h t is the tidal level varying with t hmsl is the mean sea level a is the tidal amplitude and τ is the tidal period table 1 the seawater concentration was set to be constant at 35 ppt mass fraction parts per thousand the sea boundary section below the sea level was subject to the hydrostatic pressure given by the depth of the seawater so it was specified pressure boundary the section above the sea level was treated as 1 if the nodes were saturated in the previous time step and above the tidal level in the present time step they were considered part of a seepage face with atmospheric pressure 2 if the exposed nodes were unsaturated at the previous time step they were treated as a no flow boundary xin et al 2010 darcy flow was considered in both matrix and fracture etsias et al 2021 the maximum velocity within the fracture was 0 06 m s and the reynolds number was 600 indicating that the flow in the fracture was in accordance with darcy flow the model domain was discretized into 48 521 nodes and 48 000 elements in all cases the discretization was based on the numerical stability criterion of grid péclet number pe δl α l 4 where δl l is the groundwater flow distance between two sides of an element hughes sanford 2004 the maximum pe under the discretization scheme was 1 2 which met the criterion unsaturated flow was simulated utilizing the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 van genuchten parameters were determined according to values measured in laboratory testing for sands of comparable size and we referred to kuan et al 2019 for the values five variables were used to quantitatively analyze the behaviors of swi under non tidal and tidal models fig 2 b these variables include toe length tl average width of the mixing zone wmean maximum width of the mixing zone wpeak mixing volume vm saline volume v and usp volume vusp tl is the distance between the vertical seaward boundary and the point where the 50 salinity contour line intersects the aquifer bottom etsias et al 2021 kuan et al 2012 lu et al 2013 maria et al 2015a sebben et al 2015 wmean and wpeak represent the average and maximum vertical distance respectively between 10 and 90 normalized concentration contour lines calculated according to w z in fig 2 b lu et al 2013 lu and luo 2010 vm represents the mixing zone volume bounded by the 10 and 90 normalized concentration contour lines maria et al 2015a 2015b v and vusp are the volume of saltwater in the saltwater wedge and usp respectively with a concentration higher than 50 etsias et al 2021 the study conducted numerical simulations to match the experiments and performed sensitivity analyses to verify the reliability and accuracy of the experiments and supplement the experimental results 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results and analysis 3 1 1 salinity distributions fig 3 illustrates the salinity distributions in homogenous and fractured aquifers under both non tidal and tidal conditions the first column a1 a7 and second column b1 b7 showed laboratory images under non tidal and tidal conditions respectively the corresponding numerical results of each case of tidal conditions were displayed in the third column c1 c7 the thick black lines represent the fractures and the thin black lines are the 50 saltwater concentration extracted from corresponding numerical simulations rows 2 to 7 present the different influences of fracture characteristics on swi under non tidal and tidal conditions with varying positions and orientations of the fractures the numerical results were consistent with the experimental results indicating the effectiveness of the numerical model the results under non tidal condition showed that the presence of fractures had varying degrees of enhancement to swi in comparison to homogeneous non tidal case fig 3 a1 fractures located farther away from the sea were able to contact more freshwater resulting in a further inland extension of the saltwater wedge fig 3 a2 3 a4 fractures located higher elevations fig 3 a3 also caused a greater convergence of freshwater which reduced the pressure on the saltwater wedge below the fracture in contrast fractures located at lower elevations created a thin saltwater wedge fig 3 a5 due to the restriction imposed by the fracture vertical fractures fig 3 a6 and 3 a7 had a weaker impact on the shape of the saltwater wedge than horizontal fractures because the horizontal fractures were approximate parallel to the flow allowing for greater convergence of freshwater however the mixing zone was enhanced when the vertical fracture crossed the fresh saltwater interface fig 3 a6 the above results of non tidal condition showed that the position and direction of the fracture significantly impacted the tl and the width of the mixing zone which is consistent with previous studies on swi in fractured aquifers sebben et al 2015 koohbor et al 2019 etsias et al 2021 under tidal condition the tl was still positively correlated with the distance between fracture and sea fig 3 b2 3 b4 the fracture broadened the fdz when fracture s left end was close to it fig 3 b3 leading to a thinner saltwater wedge compared to the homogeneous tidal case fig 3 b1 tides enhanced fresh saltwater mixing in the vicinity of the horizontal fracture that was proximal to the saltwater wedge and the usp fig 3 b2 and 3 b3 suggesting that comprehensive effect of fractures and tides promote lateral dispersion of saltwater furthermore unlike in the horizontal low non tidal case where the fracture located close to the aquifer base restricted the height of the saltwater wedge fig 3 a5 in the horizontal low tidal case the fracture attracted the saltwater wedge resulting in a slightly higher saltwater wedge in fig 3 b5 than in fig 3 b3 however vertical fractures had little effect on the shape of the saltwater wedge and their effect on the mixing zone was not visually obvious in fig 3 b6 and 3 b7 indicating that the influence of vertical fractures is small regardless of the presence of tides additionally horizontal fractures significantly affected the shape and volume of the usp and enhanced the mixing zone around them especially when in contact with the usp fig 3 b2 and 3 b3 however the effect of the fracture weakened as it moved away from the usp either horizontally fig 3 b4 or vertically fig 3 b5 table 2 shows the ratios of tl between each case of fractured aquifers and the corresponding case of the homogeneous aquifer where tl values in homogeneous non tidal and tidal cases fig 3 a1 and 3 b1 were 2 11 m and 1 18 m respectively in middle horizontal fractured aquifers tides intensified the promotion effect of fracture on tl as the distance between the fracture and the sea increased tl increased by 9 22 3 and 29 9 i e 0 19 m 0 47 m 0 63 m in the non tidal cases fig 3 a2 3 a4 and by 58 3 65 and 83 3 i e 0 69 m 0 77 m 0 98 m in the tidal cases fig 3 b2 3 b4 additionally tides changed the influence pattern of fracture height on tl table 2 horizontal middle and horizontal low which was also reflected in the differences in the saltwater wedge thickness between the low and high fracture cases however the changes in tl for vertical fracture cases were less than 2 table 3 presents the ratios of wmean and v for each case of fractured aquifers compared to the corresponding case of the homogeneous aquifer the wmean for the homogeneous cases fig 3 a1 and 3 b1 were 0 044 m and 0 148 m respectively while v were 0 0108 m3 and 0 0062 m3 in the non tidal cases fig 3 a2 3 a4 the wmean ratio increased with the distance between the fracture and sea and was related to the length of the fracture in contact with freshwater and the position of the low velocity zone which located below and above the fracture etsias et al 2021 in the horizontal low non tidal case fig 3 a5 a larger freshwater area above the low fracture led to a larger wmean compared to the horizontal middle non tidal case fig 3 a3 tides also had an impact on the relationship between fractures and wmean with larger increases in wmean ratios observed in the tidal cases fig 3 b2 and 3 b3 compared to non tidal cases fig 3 a2 and 3 a3 this was because the fdz allowed the fracture to be separated from the short saltwater wedge at the position near the sea providing a low salt concentration area for low velocity zone the decrease in wmean in fig 3 b4 indicated that the distance between saltwater and the fracture was crucial for the mixing zone in the horizontal low tidal case fig 3 b5 high concentration saltwater occupied the low velocity zone below the fracture limiting the value of wmean vertical fractures increased wmean under both non tidal and tidal conditions when in contact with the saltwater wedge fig 3 a6 and 3 b6 as another important indicator for evaluating the degree of swi in fractured aquifers v could be enhanced by fractures under both non tidal and tidal conditions even with the limitation of a low facture on the saltwater wedge fig 3 a5 v only reduced by 1 84 compared to the homogenous non tidal case fig 3 a1 under tidal condition the maximum of v occurred closer to the sea compared to the non tidal condition after reaching the maximum v decreased with the increase of the horizontal distance between fractures and saltwater under both non tidal fig 3 a3 and 3 a4 and tidal conditions fig 3 b2 3 b4 moreover the v of horizontal middle cases and horizontal low cases in table 3 again demonstrated that tides reversed the effect of a low fracture on the saltwater wedge however the effect of a vertical fracture on v remained small under the two conditions 3 1 2 flow velocity vector fields to further investigate the intrinsic kinetic mechanism of swi in fractured aquifers we analyzed the flow velocity vectors field in the horizontal middle tidal case fig 3 b3 using sutra the velocities during the four stages of a tidal cycle referencing the intertidal flow patterns shown by robinson et al 2007b and ataie ashtiani et al 1999 are presented in fig 4 a 4 d for comparison the results of a non tidal fractured condition and a homogeneous period averaged tidal condition were presented in fig 4 e and 4 f respectively compared to the homogeneous case shown in fig 4 f the presence of the fracture significantly changed the flow field distribution fig 4 a 4 d the four stages of the tidal cycle revealed that flow was converged by the fracture and transported through the fracture as a result the flow velocity in the fracture was much higher than that in the surrounding matrix leading to velocity difference between the fracture and matrix the phenomenon observed in both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations was explained by the fact that the saltwater dispersed to the freshwater area with lower velocity forming a wide range of mixing zone the flow direction within fracture towards the inland during high tide fig 4 b indicating saltwater can be transformed inland by fracture under tidal condition meanwhile it can be observed that the velocity of freshwater in the upper and lower sides of the fracture decreases less than that in the non tidal case fig 4 e which is because the tides changed groundwater flow pattern robinson et al 2007a 2007b furthermore it can also be observed that the positions of freshwater discharge were different under non tidal and tidal conditions 3 1 3 groundwater recirculation across the aquifer ocean interface the presence of fractures had a significant impact on sgd which is composed of net freshwater discharge and seawater recirculation when considering the effects of tides the formula for sgd can be simplified as li et al 1999 2 q sgd q f q t q d where qf is the inland fresh groundwater discharge qt is calculated as the total inflow across the interface landward of the fdz and qd is the total inflow across the interface seaward of the fdz relevant dimensionless physical quantities were utilized in this analysis to evaluate the change in the proportion of each component of sgd in the fractured aquifer and to quantify the recirculation of saltwater and freshwater across the aquifer ocean interface robinson et al 2007a 2007b to distinguish between tidally driven and density driven seawater recirculation two separate recirculation percentages were calculated i e tidally driven recirculation percent tdr 3 tdr q t q f q t q d 100 q t q sgd 100 and density driven recirculation percent ddr 4 ddr q d q f q t q d 100 q d q sgd 100 in fig 5 the impact of fractures on sgd components in the horizontal middle tidal case fig 3 b3 was examined in fig 5 b in comparison with the homogeneous tidal case fig 3 b1 the figure displays the total inflow and outflow along the aquifer ocean interface throughout the tidal cycle which includes three distinctive exchange zones the tidally driven recirculation zone trz the fdz and the density driven recirculation zone drz due to the tidal forcing on a sloping beach boundary an asymmetric exchange pattern which leads to the formation of seawater recirculation in the intertidal zone and the usp was formed on a tide averaged basis fig 5 a shows that the tidally driven inflow occurred in the upper intertidal zone in the homogeneous aquifer with the largest inflow and negligible outflow near the high tide level from the high tide level to low tide level the inflow gradually decreased to its lowest level close to 0 while the outflow gradually increased reaching its maximum near the low tide level in the fdz the outflow decreased towards the sea direction while the inflow increased to a small peak then both the inflow and outflow decreased towards the sea in the drz in contrast in the fractured aquifer fig 5 b due to the accelerated seawater recirculation in the saltwater wedge and usp the amounts of both inflow and outflow were obviously larger compared to the homogeneous case the inflow remained high in the trz and did not reach zero leading to a larger sgd in the fractured aquifer 0 135 kg s than in the homogenous aquifer 0 079 kg s the presence of the fracture contributed to the expansion of the fdz and the reduction of the drz this is due to the freshwater was converged by the fracture and discharged from the left end which squeezed the upper part of saltwater wedge towards the sea furthermore the fracture caused a reduction in freshwater above it and facilitated the rapid movement of saltwater and freshwater during tidal oscillations fig 4 thereby enhancing the tidally driven recirculation this resulted in the expansion of the trz and an increase in the discharge in the usp fig 6 presents an analysis of the proportion of sgd components in both the homogeneous and fractured aquifers discussed above in the homogeneous case the tdr was 69 4 and the ddr was 29 3 however in the fractured case the tdr was significantly higher at 88 1 while the ddr was much lower at 11 2 this shows that the fracture greatly enhanced the effect of tides on seawater recirculation as a result in the fractured aquifer the primary driver of sgd was the tidally driven recirculation in the usp rather than the density driven recirculation in the saltwater wedge this result is consistent with the changes in the drz and trz caused by fractures reflecting the opposite effects of fractures on the upper part of the saltwater wedge inhibition and the usp promotion it shows that the relative position between fractures and saltwater is an important factor affecting the specific effects of fractures 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis focuses on the effects of the horizontal positions vertical positions lengths and orientations of fractures on swi properties under non tidal and tidal conditions the variables include tl wpeak wmean mixing volume fraction vm f saline volume fraction v f and usp volume fraction vusp f the v f vm f and vusp f are the fraction of v vm vusp in the whole aquifer respectively the numerical model employed in the analysis uses the same size and parameter values as those in the experiments table 1 3 2 1 horizontal positions of horizontal oriented fractures the first sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of the horizontal position of a single fixed length 1 m horizontal fracture on swi seven numerical experiments were conducted under both non tidal and tidal conditions the horizontal fractures were placed separated by 0 5 m and started at 0 5 m 0 35 m results from the last 3 experiments were similar so only the concentration fields from the first five sets of experiments were presented in fig 7 the variables in all experiments were analyzed in fig 8 fig 7 and fig 8 illustrate that under tidal conditions the variables of swi had a wider range of variation under tidal conditions compared to non tidal conditions specifically the differences in swi properties between the aquifers with fractures near the sea fig 7 a1 7 a3 7 b1 7 b3 and the homogeneous aquifer fig 3 a1 and 3 b1 were larger under tidal conditions than non tidal conditions this finding suggests that tides intensified the impact of the horizontal position of the fracture on swi under both non tidal and tidal conditions most swi variables initially increased and then decreased to constant values as the fracture approached inland this was because the fracture moved from inside the saltwater wedge to the freshwater area increasing its ability to converge freshwater and allowing the low velocity freshwater zone to exit the high salinity area as the fracture moved further away from the sea saltwater gradually unable to reach the area influenced by the fracture and its impact decreased fig 8 a shows that tl had similar increasing and decreasing trends under both non tidal and tidal conditions however the inhibition of tides on the saltwater wedge caused tl values to be smaller than non tidal cases and the tl dropped rapidly due to the thin saltwater wedge as shown in fig 8 b tides also increased the values and ranges of the three mixing zone factors under non tidal cases wmean and vm f reached their maximum values when the main mixing zone transformed from above to below the fracture fig 7 a3 where sufficient saltwater was under the attraction of a long low velocity zone wpeak reached its maximum in fig 7 a2 where the saltwater wedge was cut by fracture that saltwater filled the left side of the low velocity zone vertically under tidal conditions the maximum values of wpeak wmean and vm f were appeared when the fracture was closer to the sea fig 7 b2 compared to the non tidal condition these maximum values were approximately 1 46 2 12 and 3 5 times the values in the homogeneous case respectively this is due to the fdz and short saltwater wedge which allowed the fracture to be in full contact with both freshwater and high speed circulating seawater in the usp fig 8 c illustrates that the variation of v f was different under the two conditions with the largest value in tidal cases being lower than the smallest value in non tidal cases under tidal condition v f reached its maximum in fig 7 b1 where freshwater directly discharged into the sea through the fracture then v f decreased as the freshwater became less concentrated thus the saltwater wedge was squeezed left and down on the other hand the variation of vusp f fig 8 d was similar to the mixing zone factors fig 8 b in fig 7 b2 the largest vusp f occurred when most freshwater around the usp was converged by the fracture fig 4 then the fracture attraction to usp gradually reduced as usp gradually left the low velocity zone 3 2 2 vertical positions of horizontal oriented fractures the second sensitivity analysis examined the impact of changing the vertical position of a single fixed length 1 m horizontal fracture on swi under both non tidal and tidal conditions the horizontal fractures were placed at 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m and 0 4 m from the bottom of the aquifer and the horizontal position was fixed at 1 m from the sea fig 9 fig 9 presents the concentration fields of the four cases while fig 10 illustrates the variation of swi variables the variations in all variables were different under non tidal and tidal conditions indicating that tides changed the impact pattern of fracture vertical position on swi under non tidal condition fractures located at higher vertical positions can contact more freshwater which promoted the length of the saltwater wedge when the fracture was entirely inside the saltwater wedge fig 9 a1 the saltwater wedge was similar to that in the homogeneous aquifer since the saltwater wedge in the homogeneous aquifer fig 3 a1 was thicker than the second lowest height of the fracture fig 9 a2 the fracture initially limited the thickness of the saltwater wedge but then promoted it fig 9 a3 and 9 a4 under tidal conditions the fracture could contact much freshwater at the lowest position but the small space below it restricted the low velocity zone fig 9 b1 as the fracture height increased its promotion of the tl first increased with the expansion of low velocity zone fig 9 b1 and 9 b2 and then decreased as the vertical distance between the fracture and saltwater wedge increased fig 9 b3 and 9 b4 moreover when the fracture height exceeded the thickness of the saltwater wedge in the homogeneous case the effect on saltwater wedge thickness changed from being limited fig 9 b1 to being promoted fig 9 b2 9 b4 therefore the relative positions of the fracture and saltwater wedge determined fracture effects and the differences in the saltwater wedge s thickness and length in the homogeneous aquifer under tidal and non tidal conditions were the reason for the different fracture influence patterns as shown in fig 10 a and 10 c tl and v f were proportional to the height of the fracture under non tidal condition while them increased first and then decreased under tidal condition which was consistent with the effect of the fracture on saltwater wedge mentioned above in fig 10 b under non tidal conditions the three mixing factors increased and then decreased as the fracture became higher this is due to the fact that the vertical space for the mixing zone above the fracture and the degree of contact between the fracture and freshwater having opposing patterns thus the variation range of wmean was only 3 4 cm under tidal conditions as the fracture height increased there was more saltwater under the influence of low velocity zone while the fracture was closer to the seawater rapid circulation area usp thus wmean and wpeak and vm were positively correlated with the height of fractures and their variation ranges were much larger than those under non tidal condition in fig 10 d the vusp f was positively correlated with the fracture height it is worth noting that after the fracture reached a certain height the usp underwent a dramatic dispersion and a large area of high concentration saltwater appeared which was the main reason for the increase of vusp 3 2 3 length of horizontal oriented fractures the effect of the fracture length on swi was investigated under non tidal and tidal conditions in the third sensitivity analysis the horizontal fractures were located in the middle of the aquifer with facture lengths of 0 5 m 1 m 1 5 m and 2 m respectively fig 11 excessive fracture length would cause the length of saltwater wedge to exceed the study area so longer fracture was not considered fig 11 and fig 12 present the concentration fields and swi variables which demonstrated that fracture length was a key factor in increasing the degree of swi under both non tidal and tidal conditions as shown in fig 12 a tl was positively correlated with the fracture length under both conditions increasing fracture length expanded the low velocity zone of freshwater below the fracture resulting in the extension of the saltwater wedge interestingly the reduction in saltwater wedge caused by tides was relieved when the fracture was long enough fig 11 resulting in the tidal tl curve approaching the non tidal curve fig 12 a the larger low velocity zone also resulted in a larger mixing zone under both non tidal and tidal conditions the variation ranges and slopes of the three curves under tidal conditions were much larger than those under non tidal conditions indicating that tides increased the impact of fracture length fig 12 b similarly a longer fracture also caused a significant increase in v f fig 12 c although v f still limited by tides which was also reflected by the saltwater wedge thickness fig 11 the vusp f was also positively correlated with fracture length fig 12 d but the variation range was smaller than that in fig 8 d and fig 10 d because the fractures were not long enough to reach the area close to the usp 3 2 4 vertical oriented fractures vary in horizontal directions the fourth sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of the horizontal position of vertical fractures on swi the vertical fractures were placed at different horizontal positions of the aquifer spaced 0 2 m apart and began with 0 6 m 0 35 m since the phenomenon of the last 3 cases were similar the concentration fields of the first 5 sets of experiments were only presented in fig 13 while the swi variables in all experiments were analyzed in fig 14 fig 13 and fig 14 present the concentration fields and swi variables the results show that the impact of vertical fractures was mainly on the mixing zone while the impact on other swi variables was little the quantitative analyses in fig 14 a 14 c and 14 d revealed that vertical fractures had little effect on tl v f and vusp f under both non tidal and tidal conditions under tidal condition the vertical fractures left the saltwater area at the horizontal position closer to the sea than that under non tidal condition making the curves of the tidal case approach constant lines the peak of tl and v f of tidal condition was due to the reduction of mixing and the acceleration of freshwater discharge fig 13 b2 vertical fractures could significantly enhance the mixing parameters under both conditions fig 14 b under non tidal conditions the factors increased to the maximum and then decreased gradually the mixing zone mainly appeared on the downstream side of the vertical fracture etsias et al 2021 as the fracture approaching inland the space on the downstream side of the fracture and the contact degree between the fracture and saltwater exhibited opposite changing patterns therefore the maximum values of the three mixing parameters appeared in the middle of the saltwater wedge and the variation of wmean was small under tidal conditions due to the short saltwater wedge the impact of vertical fractures on swi is only significant in areas very close to the sea and the affected area was much smaller than under non tidal condition in the case closest to the sea fig 13 b1 the vertical fracture contacted with the usp forming a large mixing zone but the usp volume decreased as the fracture left the saltwater area the mixing factors dropped rapidly and then stabilized at constant values fig 14 b 3 2 5 impact of fracture characteristics on concentration distribution this section investigated the impact of fracture characteristics on the spatial concentration distribution of the transition zone at the bottom of the aquifer under both non tidal and tidal conditions this analysis is based on the research conducted by maria et al 2015a who found that periodic oscillation of sea level caused by tides had the largest impact on the spreading of the interface at the bottom of the aquifer fig 15 showed the toe lengths defined by 10 50 and 90 concentration contour lines under non tidal orange thick columns and tidal blue thin columns conditions the figure also presented the tl ratios which compared the tl values of tidal condition l to those of non tidal condition lnt for the 10 50 and 90 concentration contour lines with dotted dashed and solid curves fig 15 shows that under non tidal conditions the concentration distributions were relatively uniform and concentrated and was little affected by fracture characteristics as shown by the close proximity of the three tl columns in each subfigure under tidal conditions the differences of the three columns increased in each subfigure especially the 90 column showed a significant decrease compared to the others this result indicated that tides intensified the concentration distribution in transition zone at the bottom of aquifer especially on high concentration saltwater the tl ratio curves had different trend in each subfigure showing the influence patterns of each fracture characteristic on concentration distribution was different the 10 and 50 tl ratio curves showed a high degree of consistency in all subfigures suggesting that the effect of tides and fractures on the low and middle concentration ends were similar however the variation pattern of the 90 tl ratio curves differed significantly from the others in each subfigure indicating that tides and fractures altered the distribution of high concentration saltwater end of the transition zone in fig 15 a the 10 and 50 tl ratios dropped to low values after the first three cases and then gradually increased to constant values while the 90 tl ratio only maintained high value at the first two cases the change of the distance between the 50 and 90 curves indicated that the degree of the high concentration saltwater distribution increased with the horizontal fracture horizontal position changed from the sea boundary fracture position 0 5 m 0 35 m to the tail of the saltwater wedge fracture position 1 5 m 0 35 m then significantly weakened with the fracture left the saltwater area in fig 15 b as the horizontal fracture height increased the three tl ratios first increased and then decreased while the gap between 50 and 90 curves increased this result shows that the degree of high concentration distribution increased proportionally with the fracture height fig 15 c shows that the 10 and 50 tl ratio curves increased with the horizontal fracture length and a long fracture could limit the effect of tides on low and middle concentration saltwater meanwhile as the fracture became longer gap between 50 and 90 curves increased indicating that the degree of the distribution of high concentration saltwater became larger fig 15 d showed that all three tl ratio curves were nearly horizontal and the distances between the curves were nearly the same indicating that the effects of vertical fractures on different concentration saltwater were similar 4 conclusion this study investigated the impact of tides on swi in fractured coastal aquifers laboratory experiments were conducted in six fractured aquifers and one homogeneous aquifer under both non tidal and tidal conditions and numerical models were used to reconstruct the experiments and analyze the results the analysis included variables such as toe length tl average width of the mixing zone wmean maximum width of the mixing zone wpeak mixing volume fraction vm f saline volume fraction v f and usp volume fraction vusp f additionally the study explored the impact of fractures on the flow fields and sgd under tidal condition sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying the horizontal positions vertical positions lengths of horizontal fractures and horizontal positions of vertical fractures the resulting concentration distribution of saltwater in the transition zone at the bottom of the aquifer was then analyzed the major findings are as follows 1 horizontal fractures had a significant impact on the degree of swi under both non tidal and tidal conditions while vertical fractures mainly influenced the mixing zone the presence of fractures resulted in the formation of a low velocity freshwater area on both sides which attracted saltwater and enhanced mixing the effect of fracture on swi properties depended on the relative position between the fracture and saltwater compared to the non tidal condition tides changed the effect pattern of fracture characteristics and enhanced the variation ranges of most swi properties offshore fractures accelerated the tidally driven seawater recirculation increasing the sgd and the ratio of tidally driven recirculation 2 the horizontal position of the fracture was crucial to the degree of contact between the fracture and saltwater freshwater which determined the impact of fractures on swi tl mixing zone factors and vsup f initially increased and then decreased with the position of the fracture the maximum tl was observed when the fracture was at the boundary of the saltwater wedge and fully located in the freshwater area indicating that sufficient contact between the fracture and both saltwater saltwater wedge or usp and freshwater was crucial for mixing the effect of fractures on swi was more pronounced under tidal condition which enhanced most swi properties 3 the effect of horizontal fracture height on swi properties was influenced by tides which constrained the length and thickness of the saltwater wedge compared to non tidal conditions whether the fracture restricted or attracted the saltwater wedge depended on its height relative to the saltwater wedge of the homogeneous aquifer as a result the variations of tl and v differed between tidal and non tidal conditions in addition to the saltwater wedge the usp also contributed to the varying mixing zone factors under tidal and non tidal conditions 4 all swi properties showed a positive correlation with the length of the fracture under both non tidal and tidal conditions the length of the fracture had a moderating effect on the length of the saltwater wedge under tidal condition a longer fracture was observed to weaken the impact of tides on the length of saltwater wedge to some extent 5 vertical fractures had a limited impact on most swi properties under both non tidal and tidal condition with the exception of the width of the mixing zone which was significantly influenced when vertical fractures approached inland under tidal condition the mixing zone factors showed small variations except when the fracture contacted with the usp 6 tides and horizontal fractures significantly have a substantial impact on the concentration distribution in the fresh saltwater transition zone at the bottom of aquifer leading to the migration of high seaward and low landward concentration saltwater in opposite directions the toe lengths defined by 10 50 and 90 salt concentrations were similar under non tidal condition but the 90 toe length was significantly reduced by tides additionally horizontal fractures influenced the distribution of concentrations particularly in the high concentration areas the extent of the high concentration saltwater distribution was directly proportional to the height length of the fracture and reached a peak where the fracture horizontally separated from the non tidal saltwater wedge these findings have significant implications for managing fractured aquifers in real world despite the simplification of the geological structure further research will explore swi in aquifers with more complex fracture geometries such as varying numbers and network structures and consider more complex hydraulic conditions to expand the conclusions of this study declaration

1807,fractured aquifers are particularly vulnerable to seawater intrusion swi but the mechanism of swi in such aquifers remains largely unknown this study aims to investigate the influence of tides on swi in fractured aquifers through laboratory experiments and numerical models six fractured aquifers and one homogeneous aquifer were employed to conduct laboratory and numerical experiments to preliminary analyze the comprehensive effects of tides and fractures on salinity distributions flow fields and submarine groundwater discharge sgd sensitivity analyses were performed to further explore the impact of each fracture characteristic i e horizontal position vertical position length and orientation on swi properties i e saltwater wedge mixing saline volume and concentration distribution under non tidal and tidal conditions the results indicate that tides can expand the variation range of most swi properties in fractured aquifers and alter the influence patterns of fracture characteristics fractures tend to converge around freshwater and their effect on swi properties depends on their relative position to the saltwater toe length tl reached its maximum when the fractures had just separated from the saltwater wedge and were fully submerged in freshwater longer fractures promoted swi and relieved the tides restriction on tl moreover horizontal fractures can significantly amplify high concentration 50 90 saltwater distribution sgd and upper saline plume usp with the help of tides while vertical fractures only had an impact on the mixing zone these results have important implications for improving our understanding of comprehensive impact of tides and fractures on swi in coastal subsurface environments keywords seawater intrusion fractured aquifers laboratory experiments tides sutra data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seawater intrusion swi is a global issue in coastal aquifers abdoulhalik et al 2022 martínez pérez et al 2022 caused by factors such as groundwater extraction land use change climate variations and sea level fluctuations werner et al 2013 sebben et al 2015 aquifer heterogeneity and hydrodynamic boundary conditions have been recognized as key factors influencing swi giese and barthel 2021 werner et al 2013 dagan and zeitoun 1998 the strong heterogeneity makes it difficult to characterize the preferential flow pathways in fractured aquifers sebben et al 2015 berkowitz 2002 fractured aquifers are particularly susceptible to swi arthur et al 2007 as observed in various countries including the us italy japan and south korea giese and barthel 2021 macallister et al 2018 park et al 2012 salem and osman 2017 tides as one of the most common hydrodynamic conditions play a crucial role in determining the location and shape of the saltwater wedge and mixing zone maria et al 2015a robinson et al 2007a xin et al 2010 they have also been observed to impact the extent of swi in deep saline water layer of fractured aquifers park et al 2012 however laboratory studies on swi in fractured aquifers are still in their early stages etsias et al 2021 and the influence of tides on swi in fractured aquifers remains unclear research on heterogeneous aquifers in general has provided insights into the role of fractures in the absence of comprehensive swi research in fractured aquifers random heterogeneous aquifers can cause steady state saltwater wedge to be closer to the sea compared to homogeneous aquifers with an equal average permeability kerrou and renard 2010 coastal aquifers are also often approximated as stratified heterogeneous aquifers li and boufadel 2010 xia et al 2010 and a high permeability interlayer located at the lower part of the coastal aquifer will result in less swi liu et al 2014 saubhagya et al 2018 have proposed a new parameter transmissivity centroid elevation tce to characterize the extend of swi which is essentially controlled by elevation of preferential flow paths or high permeability layers the layered heterogeneous aquifer also plays a decisive role in the width of the mixing zone with refraction and dispersion of the streamline widening the mixing zone in the low permeability layer above the high permeability layer lu et al 2013 therefore as a unique heterogeneous structure fractures can significantly impact the properties of saltwater wedge and mixing zone the multi scale and high contrast heterogeneous nature of fractured aquifers presents significant challenges for numerical modeling and laboratory experiments hajibeygi et al 2011 vujević et al 2014 etsias et al 2021 to address these challenges various numerical simulation methods have been developed including implicit and explicit fracture models such as equivalent porous medium epm models and dual porosity models dpm for implicit models and discrete fracture matrix dfm models and discrete fracture network dfn models for explicit models epm model can significantly simplify the modeling process and reduce computational complexity but at the cost of oversimplification romanazzi et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 berre et al 2018 on the other hand dfm and dfn models explicitly represent the fractures leading to more accurate results but at a higher computational cost these models have been shown to perform better than epm models in simulating swi in aquifers with a few discrete fractures dagan and zeitoun 1998 sebben et al 2015 salem and osman 2017 sebben et al 2015 found that the extension of the saltwater wedge was influenced by the number and position of horizontal fractures through a dfn model while epm models may seriously overestimate the swi range koohbor et al 2019 used a dfn model and darcy s law to quantitatively analyze the impact of fracture characteristics such as position conductivity and number on saltwater distribution recently etsias et al 2021 conducted the first swi laboratory experiments in aquifers with a single fracture revealing that hydraulic gradient and fracture characteristics are critical factors affecting swi although the impact of hydrodynamic boundary conditions on swi has been extensively studied the effects of tides on swi in fractured aquifers remain to be explored tides significantly affect groundwater recirculation robinson et al 2007a 2007b greskowiak 2014 salinity distributions werner and lockington 2006 and the extent of swi kuan et al 2012 werner et al 2013 in coastal aquifers during high tide seawater infiltrates the beach and exfiltrates the aquifer during low tides creating a faster seawater circulation cell in the intertidal zone than the density driven circulation cell in the saltwater wedge robinson et al 2007b vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 this tide induced seawater circulation contributes to larger amounts of saltwater components of submarine groundwater discharge sgd than density driven seawater circulation resulting in a significant increase in total sgd in certain circumstances such as a small beach slope high tidal amplitudes and high hydraulic conductivity tide induced seawater circulation could create an upper saline plume usp in the intertidal zone in addition to the classical saltwater wedge boufadel 2000 robinson et al 2007b fang et al 2021 meanwhile tidal oscillations also enhance the mixing in both confined inouchi et al 1990 and unconfined ataie ashtiani et al 1999 aquifers moreover the presence of usp pushes the freshwater discharge zone fdz down to the low tide mark reducing the extent of the saltwater wedge in unconfined aquifers kuan et al 2012 however despite extensive studies on the effects of tides on groundwater flow and salinity distribution in homogenous coastal aquifers the effects of tides on swi in fractured aquifers remain largely unknown the current study aims to investigate the impact of tides on swi in unconfined fractured aquifers to compare the results obtained under tidal conditions all laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were also conducted under non tidal conditions the experimental setups included seven scenarios one homogeneous aquifer and six fractured aquifers with different fracture positions and orientations sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the effects of each fracture characteristic i e horizontal position vertical position length and orientation on swi properties i e saltwater wedge mixing zone saline volume and usp volume under non tidal and tidal conditions furthermore an analysis of the concentration distribution was presented to show the combined effects of tides and fractures on the fresh saltwater transition zone based on sensitivity analysis results our results provide novel and constructive insights into the interplay between tidal oscillations and fractures and contribute to a profound understanding of the complex hydrodynamics and heterogeneity in swi 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments the experiments were performed in a 4 m length 0 8 m height 0 02 m width sand tank shown in fig 1 a the sand tank was constructed from tempered glass and mounted on a steel platform two reservoirs one containing freshwater and the other containing saltwater were on the ground on the both sides of the setup the saltwater reservoir sent saltwater to its upper saltwater tank through a pump and the freshwater reservoir sent freshwater to the sand tank through a peristaltic pump the mesh screens were embedded on both sides of the sand tank to prevent sand from entering reservoirs the saltwater tank and freshwater reservoir can automatically control the water level and flux respectively at the seaward end the excess saltwater in the saltwater tank was drained by the overflow outlet to maintain a constant water level 0 54 m the landward reservoir was supplied with freshwater at a fixed rate 6 10 7 m3 s simulating a fixed freshwater flux from the landward boundary to the aquifer under the tidal conditions the tide generator can set the amplitude 0 04 m and period 60 s to control the overflow outlet moving up and down around mean sea level 0 54 m to simulate tidal oscillations kuan et al 2019 during the experiments both the salinity and water level in the near shore zone were monitored the sand tank was packed with well sorted sand with a uniform particle size of 1 mm and relatively uniform with d 50 0 37 mm median diameter the sieve size that 50 of sand grains pass through and d 90 d 10 2 68 d 90 and d 10 are respectively the sieve size that 90 and 10 of sand grains pass through to create an unconfined coastal aquifer with a height of 0 7 m bounded by a sloping beach surface with a slope of 0 25 the sand porosity was measured to be 0 45 using oven drying saturated sand samples method the sand hydraulic conductivity was 1 3 10 2 m s measured by darcy column tests which was converted to 1 33 10 9 m2 permeability in order to meet sutra model setting machine made stainless steel tubes with 0 8 mm openings uniformly distributed on the surface were used to simulate fractures with lengths of 1 m and 0 4 m respectively fig 1 b the cross section size of the tubes was 1 cm thickness 2 cm width thereby their width was comparable to the thickness of sand tank 2 cm following the suggestion of etsias et al 2021 the fracture porosity was set to 1 the fracture permeability was 3 99 10 7 m2 calibrated by numerical simulation which also satisfied the fracture matrix permeability ratio 102 kf km 104 derived by matthäi and belayneh 2004 from the field data to avoid trapped air bubbles in the sand the sand tank was wet packed using an incremental filling method the stainless steel tubes were placed horizontally or vertically in the predetermined position during the sand filling ensuring that the sand completely wrapped the tube without leaving any gaps the saltwater was prepared by adding 35 g of sodium chloride nacl into 1 l of deionized water red food dye e129 allura red ac granular was added to the saltwater to track saltwater distributions during laboratory experiments the density of freshwater and dyed saltwater was determined to 1 000 kg m3 and 1 025 kg m3 respectively to maintain a constant saltwater concentration high concentration saltwater with a concentration of 100 kg m3 was slowly added to the saltwater reservoir every two hours as the saltwater became diluted during the experiments seven sets of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of fractures on swi under non tidal and tidal boundary conditions a homogeneous aquifer experiment was used as a benchmark case while six fractured aquifers experiments were carried out the x z coordinate system with the lower left corner of the sand tank as the origin was established as fractures have a thickness of 0 01 m the positions of horizontal fractures are presented by the coordinates of the midpoint of their bottom edges and the positions of vertical fractures are presented by the coordinates of the midpoint of their left edges previous studies have shown that the change of fracture position is an important variable vujević et al 2014 sebben et al 2015 etsias et al 2021 combined with our model size and preset experimental results we also considered different fracture positions the horizontal fracture in the first four experiments were located at 0 5 m 0 35 m 1 m 0 35 m 1 5 m 0 35 m and 1 m 0 2 m and the vertical fracture in the last two experiments were located at 0 8 m 0 3 m and 1 8 m 0 3 m in the interests of clarity the laboratory aquifers will henceforth be referred to according to their corresponding fracture position and orientation homogeneous non tidal tidal case fig 3 a1 and 3 b1 horizontal left non tidal tidal

left non tidal tidal case fig 3 a6 and 3 b6 and vertical right non tidal tidal case fig 3 a7 and 3 b7 tidal experiments were initially run to steady state without tides i e the non tidal cases tidal oscillations were then superimposed and experiments were run until the dynamic quasi steady state for both heads and concentrations were reached a digital camera canon ixus 175 recorded the experimental images at five minute intervals 2 2 numerical model the variable saturated variable density flow and solute transport model sutra voss and provost 2008 and the dfm model with fractures being modeled discretely as 2 d elements were employed to validate the observed results in the sand tank experiments the governing equations used in sutra refer to the user manual voss and provost 2008 and not repeat here for brief sutra has been extensively used and validated in previous studies to simulate swi in fractured coastal aquifers yager and ratcliffe 2010 gassiat et al 2013 kuan et al 2019 the conceptual diagram of the 2 d numerical model is illustrated in fig 2 a and has the same basic setup as the laboratory experiments table 1 no regional recharge or evapotranspiration was considered so no water or solute fluxes crossing the top boundary the bottom of the aquifer was set to be impermeable no flux the inland boundary right side was set as a fixed flux boundary with zero salinity freshwater the sea boundary left side was set as the fixed head boundary in the non tidal condition while varied with the tidal level in the tidal condition according to 1 h t h msl a sin 2 π t τ where h t is the tidal level varying with t hmsl is the mean sea level a is the tidal amplitude and τ is the tidal period table 1 the seawater concentration was set to be constant at 35 ppt mass fraction parts per thousand the sea boundary section below the sea level was subject to the hydrostatic pressure given by the depth of the seawater so it was specified pressure boundary the section above the sea level was treated as 1 if the nodes were saturated in the previous time step and above the tidal level in the present time step they were considered part of a seepage face with atmospheric pressure 2 if the exposed nodes were unsaturated at the previous time step they were treated as a no flow boundary xin et al 2010 darcy flow was considered in both matrix and fracture etsias et al 2021 the maximum velocity within the fracture was 0 06 m s and the reynolds number was 600 indicating that the flow in the fracture was in accordance with darcy flow the model domain was discretized into 48 521 nodes and 48 000 elements in all cases the discretization was based on the numerical stability criterion of grid péclet number pe δl α l 4 where δl l is the groundwater flow distance between two sides of an element hughes sanford 2004 the maximum pe under the discretization scheme was 1 2 which met the criterion unsaturated flow was simulated utilizing the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 van genuchten parameters were determined according to values measured in laboratory testing for sands of comparable size and we referred to kuan et al 2019 for the values five variables were used to quantitatively analyze the behaviors of swi under non tidal and tidal models fig 2 b these variables include toe length tl average width of the mixing zone wmean maximum width of the mixing zone wpeak mixing volume vm saline volume v and usp volume vusp tl is the distance between the vertical seaward boundary and the point where the 50 salinity contour line intersects the aquifer bottom etsias et al 2021 kuan et al 2012 lu et al 2013 maria et al 2015a sebben et al 2015 wmean and wpeak represent the average and maximum vertical distance respectively between 10 and 90 normalized concentration contour lines calculated according to w z in fig 2 b lu et al 2013 lu and luo 2010 vm represents the mixing zone volume bounded by the 10 and 90 normalized concentration contour lines maria et al 2015a 2015b v and vusp are the volume of saltwater in the saltwater wedge and usp respectively with a concentration higher than 50 etsias et al 2021 the study conducted numerical simulations to match the experiments and performed sensitivity analyses to verify the reliability and accuracy of the experiments and supplement the experimental results 3 results and

conditions were displayed in the third column c1 c7 the thick black lines represent the fractures and the thin black lines are the 50 saltwater concentration extracted from corresponding numerical simulations rows 2 to 7 present the different influences of fracture characteristics on swi under non tidal and tidal conditions with varying positions and orientations of the fractures the numerical results were consistent with the experimental results indicating the effectiveness of the numerical model the results under non tidal condition showed that the presence of fractures had varying degrees of enhancement to swi in comparison to homogeneous non tidal case fig 3 a1 fractures located farther away from the sea were able to contact more freshwater resulting in a further inland extension of the saltwater wedge fig 3 a2 3 a4 fractures located higher elevations fig 3 a3 also caused a greater convergence of freshwater which reduced the pressure on the saltwater wedge below the fracture in contrast fractures located at lower elevations created a thin saltwater wedge fig 3 a5 due to the restriction imposed by the fracture vertical fractures fig 3 a6 and 3 a7 had a weaker impact on the shape of the saltwater wedge than horizontal fractures because the horizontal fractures were approximate parallel to the flow allowing for greater convergence of freshwater however the mixing zone was enhanced when the vertical fracture crossed the fresh saltwater interface fig 3 a6 the above results of non tidal condition showed that the position and direction of the fracture significantly impacted the tl and the width of the mixing zone which is consistent with previous studies on swi in fractured aquifers sebben et al 2015 koohbor et al 2019 etsias et al 2021 under tidal condition the tl was still positively correlated with the distance between fracture and sea fig 3 b2 3 b4 the fracture broadened the fdz when fracture s left end was close to it fig 3 b3 leading to a thinner saltwater wedge compared to the homogeneous tidal case fig 3 b1 tides enhanced fresh saltwater mixing in the vicinity of the horizontal fracture that was proximal to the saltwater wedge and the usp fig 3 b2 and 3 b3 suggesting that comprehensive effect of fractures and tides promote lateral dispersion of saltwater furthermore unlike in the horizontal low non tidal case where the fracture located close to the aquifer base restricted the height of the saltwater wedge fig 3 a5 in the horizontal low tidal case the fracture attracted the saltwater wedge resulting in a slightly higher saltwater wedge in fig 3 b5 than in fig 3 b3 however vertical fractures had little effect on the shape of the saltwater wedge and their effect on the mixing zone was not visually obvious in fig 3 b6 and 3 b7 indicating that the influence of vertical fractures is small regardless of the presence of tides additionally horizontal fractures significantly affected the shape and volume of the usp and enhanced the mixing zone around them especially when in contact with the usp fig 3 b2 and 3 b3 however the effect of the fracture weakened as it moved away from the usp either horizontally fig 3 b4 or vertically fig 3 b5 table 2 shows the ratios of tl between each case of fractured aquifers and the corresponding case of the homogeneous aquifer where tl values in homogeneous non tidal and tidal cases fig 3 a1 and 3 b1 were 2 11 m and 1 18 m respectively in middle horizontal fractured aquifers tides intensified the promotion effect of fracture on tl as the distance between the fracture and the sea increased tl increased by 9 22 3 and 29 9 i e 0 19 m 0 47 m 0 63 m in the non tidal cases fig 3 a2 3 a4 and by 58 3 65 and 83 3 i e 0 69 m 0 77 m 0 98 m in the tidal cases fig 3 b2 3 b4 additionally tides changed the influence pattern of fracture height on tl table 2 horizontal middle and horizontal low which was also reflected in the differences in the saltwater wedge thickness between the low and high fracture cases however the changes in tl for vertical fracture cases were less than 2 table 3 presents the ratios of wmean and v for each case of fractured aquifers compared to the corresponding case of the homogeneous aquifer the wmean for the homogeneous cases fig 3 a1 and 3 b1 were 0 044 m and 0 148 m respectively while v were 0 0108 m3 and 0 0062 m3 in the non tidal cases fig 3 a2 3 a4 the wmean ratio increased with the distance between the fracture and sea and was related to the length of the fracture in contact with freshwater and the position of the low velocity zone which located below and above the fracture etsias et al 2021 in the horizontal low non tidal case fig 3 a5 a larger freshwater area above the low fracture led to a larger wmean compared to the horizontal middle non tidal case fig 3 a3 tides also had an impact on the relationship between fractures and wmean with larger increases in wmean ratios observed in the tidal cases fig 3 b2 and 3 b3 compared to non tidal cases fig 3 a2 and 3 a3 this was because the fdz allowed the fracture to be separated from the short saltwater wedge at the position near the sea providing a low salt concentration area for low velocity zone the decrease in wmean in fig 3 b4 indicated that the distance between saltwater and the fracture was crucial for the mixing zone in the horizontal low tidal case fig 3 b5 high concentration saltwater occupied the low velocity zone below the fracture limiting the value of wmean vertical fractures increased wmean under both non tidal and tidal conditions when in contact with the saltwater wedge fig 3 a6 and 3 b6 as another important indicator for evaluating the degree of swi in fractured aquifers v could be enhanced by fractures under both non tidal and tidal conditions even with the limitation of a low facture on the saltwater wedge fig 3 a5 v only reduced by 1 84 compared to the homogenous non tidal case fig 3 a1 under tidal condition the maximum of v occurred closer to the sea compared to the non tidal condition after reaching the maximum v decreased with the increase of the horizontal distance between fractures and saltwater under both non tidal fig 3 a3 and 3 a4 and tidal conditions fig 3 b2 3 b4 moreover the v of horizontal middle cases and horizontal low cases in table 3 again demonstrated that tides reversed the effect of a low fracture on the saltwater wedge however the effect of a vertical fracture on v remained small under the two conditions 3 1 2 flow velocity vector fields to further investigate the intrinsic kinetic mechanism of swi in fractured aquifers we analyzed the flow velocity vectors field in the horizontal middle tidal case fig 3 b3 using sutra the velocities during the four stages of a tidal cycle referencing the intertidal flow patterns shown by robinson et al 2007b and ataie ashtiani et al 1999 are presented in fig 4 a 4 d for comparison the results of a non tidal fractured condition and a homogeneous period averaged tidal condition were presented in fig 4 e and 4 f respectively compared to the homogeneous case shown in fig 4 f the presence of the fracture significantly changed the flow field distribution fig 4 a 4 d the four stages of the tidal cycle revealed that flow was converged by the fracture and transported through the fracture as a result the flow velocity in the fracture was much higher than that in the surrounding matrix leading to velocity difference between the fracture and matrix the phenomenon observed in both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations was explained by the fact that the saltwater dispersed to the freshwater area with lower velocity forming a wide range of mixing zone the flow direction within fracture towards the inland during high tide fig 4 b indicating saltwater can be transformed inland by fracture under tidal condition meanwhile it can be observed that the velocity of freshwater in the upper and lower sides of the fracture decreases less than that in the non tidal case fig 4 e which is because the tides changed groundwater flow pattern robinson et al 2007a 2007b furthermore it can also be observed that the positions of freshwater discharge were different under non tidal and tidal conditions 3 1 3 groundwater recirculation across the aquifer ocean interface the presence of fractures had a significant impact on sgd which is composed of net freshwater discharge and seawater recirculation when considering the effects of tides the formula for sgd can be simplified as li et al 1999 2 q sgd q f q t q d where qf is the inland fresh groundwater discharge qt is calculated as the total inflow across the interface landward of the fdz and qd is the total inflow across the interface seaward of the fdz relevant dimensionless physical quantities were utilized in this analysis to evaluate the change in the proportion of each component of sgd in the fractured aquifer and to quantify the recirculation of saltwater and freshwater across the aquifer ocean interface robinson et al 2007a 2007b to distinguish between tidally driven and density driven seawater recirculation two separate recirculation percentages were calculated i e tidally driven recirculation percent tdr 3 tdr q t q f q t q d 100 q t q sgd 100 and density driven recirculation percent ddr 4 ddr q d q f q t q d 100 q d q sgd 100 in fig 5 the impact of fractures on sgd components in the horizontal middle tidal case fig 3 b3 was examined in fig 5 b in comparison with the homogeneous tidal case fig 3 b1 the figure displays the total inflow and outflow along the aquifer ocean interface throughout the tidal cycle which includes three distinctive exchange zones the tidally driven recirculation zone trz the fdz and the density driven recirculation zone drz due to the tidal forcing on a sloping beach boundary an asymmetric exchange pattern which leads to the formation of seawater recirculation in the intertidal zone and the usp was formed on a tide averaged basis fig 5 a shows that the tidally driven inflow occurred in the upper intertidal zone in the homogeneous aquifer with the largest inflow and negligible outflow near the high tide level from the high tide level to low tide level the inflow gradually decreased to its lowest level close to 0 while the outflow gradually increased reaching its maximum near the low tide level in the fdz the outflow decreased towards the sea direction while the inflow increased to a small peak then both the inflow and outflow decreased towards the sea in the drz in contrast in the fractured aquifer fig 5 b due to the accelerated seawater recirculation in the saltwater wedge and usp the amounts of both inflow and outflow were obviously larger compared to the homogeneous case the inflow remained high in the trz and did not reach zero leading to a larger sgd in the fractured aquifer 0 135 kg s than in the homogenous aquifer 0 079 kg s the presence of the fracture contributed to the expansion of the fdz and the reduction of the drz this is due to the freshwater was converged by the fracture and discharged from the left end which squeezed the upper part of saltwater wedge towards the sea furthermore the fracture caused a reduction in freshwater above it and facilitated the rapid movement of saltwater and freshwater during tidal oscillations fig 4 thereby enhancing the tidally driven recirculation this resulted in the expansion of the trz and an increase in the discharge in the usp fig 6 presents an analysis of the proportion of sgd components in both the homogeneous and fractured aquifers discussed above in the homogeneous case the tdr was 69 4 and the ddr was 29 3 however in the fractured case the tdr was significantly higher at 88 1 while the ddr was much lower at 11 2 this shows that the fracture greatly enhanced the effect of tides on seawater recirculation as a result in the fractured aquifer the primary driver of sgd was the tidally driven recirculation in the usp rather than the density driven recirculation in the saltwater wedge this result is consistent with the changes in the drz and trz caused by fractures reflecting the opposite effects of fractures on the upper part of the saltwater wedge inhibition and the usp promotion it shows that the relative position between fractures and saltwater is an important factor affecting the specific effects of fractures 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis focuses on the effects of the horizontal positions vertical positions lengths and orientations of fractures on swi properties under non tidal and tidal conditions the variables include tl wpeak wmean mixing volume fraction vm f saline volume fraction v f and usp volume fraction vusp f the v f vm f and vusp f are the fraction of v vm vusp in the whole aquifer respectively the numerical model employed in the analysis uses the same size and parameter values as those in the experiments table 1 3 2 1 horizontal positions of horizontal oriented fractures the first sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of the horizontal position of a single fixed length 1 m horizontal fracture on swi seven numerical experiments were conducted under both non tidal and tidal conditions the horizontal fractures were placed separated by 0 5 m and started at 0 5 m 0 35 m results from the last 3 experiments were similar so only the concentration fields from the first five sets of experiments were presented in fig 7 the variables in all experiments were analyzed in fig 8 fig 7 and fig 8 illustrate that under tidal conditions the variables of swi had a wider range of variation under tidal conditions compared to non tidal conditions specifically the differences in swi properties between the aquifers with fractures near the sea fig 7 a1 7 a3 7 b1 7 b3 and the homogeneous aquifer fig 3 a1 and 3 b1 were larger under tidal conditions than non tidal conditions this finding suggests that tides intensified the impact of the horizontal position of the fracture on swi under both non tidal and tidal conditions most swi variables initially increased and then decreased to constant values as the fracture approached inland this was because the fracture moved from inside the saltwater wedge to the freshwater area increasing its ability to converge freshwater and allowing the low velocity freshwater zone to exit the high salinity area as the fracture moved further away from the sea saltwater gradually unable to reach the area influenced by the fracture and its impact decreased fig 8 a shows that tl had similar increasing and decreasing trends under both non tidal and tidal conditions however the inhibition of tides on the saltwater wedge caused tl values to be smaller than non tidal cases and the tl dropped rapidly due to the thin saltwater wedge as shown in fig 8 b tides also increased the values and ranges of the three mixing zone factors under non tidal cases wmean and vm f reached their maximum values when the main mixing zone transformed from above to below the fracture fig 7 a3 where sufficient saltwater was under the attraction of a long low velocity zone wpeak reached its maximum in fig 7 a2 where the saltwater wedge was cut by fracture that saltwater filled the left side of the low velocity zone vertically under tidal conditions the maximum values of wpeak wmean and vm f were appeared when the fracture was closer to the sea fig 7 b2 compared to the non tidal condition these maximum values were approximately 1 46 2 12 and 3 5 times the values in the homogeneous case respectively this is due to the fdz and short saltwater wedge which allowed the fracture to be in full contact with both freshwater and high speed circulating seawater in the usp fig 8 c illustrates that the variation of v f was different under the two conditions with the largest value in tidal cases being lower than the smallest value in non tidal cases under tidal condition v f reached its maximum in fig 7 b1 where freshwater directly discharged into the sea through the fracture then v f decreased as the freshwater became less concentrated thus the saltwater wedge was squeezed left and down on the other hand the variation of vusp f fig 8 d was similar to the mixing zone factors fig 8 b in fig 7 b2 the largest vusp f occurred when most freshwater around the usp was converged by the fracture fig 4 then the fracture attraction to usp gradually reduced as usp gradually left the low velocity zone 3 2 2 vertical positions of horizontal oriented fractures the second sensitivity analysis examined the impact of changing the vertical position of a single fixed length 1 m horizontal fracture on swi under both non tidal and tidal conditions the horizontal fractures were placed at 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m and 0 4 m from the bottom of the aquifer and the horizontal position was fixed at 1 m from the sea fig 9 fig 9 presents the concentration fields of the four cases while fig 10 illustrates the variation of swi variables the variations in all variables were different under non tidal and tidal conditions indicating that tides changed the impact pattern of fracture vertical position on swi under non tidal condition fractures located at higher vertical positions can contact more freshwater which promoted the length of the saltwater wedge when the fracture was entirely inside the saltwater wedge fig 9 a1 the saltwater wedge was similar to that in the homogeneous aquifer since the saltwater wedge in the homogeneous aquifer fig 3 a1 was thicker than the second lowest height of the fracture fig 9 a2 the fracture initially limited the thickness of the saltwater wedge but then promoted it fig 9 a3 and 9 a4 under tidal conditions the fracture could contact much freshwater at the lowest position but the small space below it restricted the low velocity zone fig 9 b1 as the fracture height increased its promotion of the tl first increased with the expansion of low velocity zone fig 9 b1 and 9 b2 and then decreased as the vertical distance between the fracture and saltwater wedge increased fig 9 b3 and 9 b4 moreover when the fracture height exceeded the thickness of the saltwater wedge in the homogeneous case the effect on saltwater wedge thickness changed from being limited fig 9 b1 to being promoted fig 9 b2 9 b4 therefore the relative positions of the fracture and saltwater wedge determined fracture effects and the differences in the saltwater wedge s thickness and length in the homogeneous aquifer under tidal and non tidal conditions were the reason for the different fracture influence patterns as shown in fig 10 a and 10 c tl and v f were proportional to the height of the fracture under non tidal condition while them increased first and then decreased under tidal condition which was consistent with the effect of the fracture on saltwater wedge mentioned above in fig 10 b under non tidal conditions the three mixing factors increased and then decreased as the fracture became higher this is due to the fact that the vertical space for the mixing zone above the fracture and the degree of contact between the fracture and freshwater having opposing patterns thus the variation range of wmean was only 3 4 cm under tidal conditions as the fracture height increased there was more saltwater under the influence of low velocity zone while the fracture was closer to the seawater rapid circulation area usp thus wmean and wpeak and vm were positively correlated with the height of fractures and their variation ranges were much larger than those under non tidal condition in fig 10 d the vusp f was positively correlated with the fracture height it is worth noting that after the fracture reached a certain height the usp underwent a dramatic dispersion and a large area of high concentration saltwater appeared which was the main reason for the increase of vusp 3 2 3 length of horizontal oriented fractures the effect of the fracture length on swi was investigated under non tidal and tidal conditions in the third sensitivity analysis the horizontal fractures were located in the middle of the aquifer with facture lengths of 0 5 m 1 m 1 5 m and 2 m respectively fig 11 excessive fracture length would cause the length of saltwater wedge to exceed the study area so longer fracture was not considered fig 11 and fig 12 present the concentration fields and swi variables which demonstrated that fracture length was a key factor in increasing the degree of swi under both non tidal and tidal conditions as shown in fig 12 a tl was positively correlated with the fracture length under both conditions increasing fracture length expanded the low velocity zone of freshwater below the fracture resulting in the extension of the saltwater wedge interestingly the reduction in saltwater wedge caused by tides was relieved when the fracture was long enough fig 11 resulting in the tidal tl curve approaching the non tidal curve fig 12 a the larger low velocity zone also resulted in a larger mixing zone under both non tidal and tidal conditions the variation ranges and slopes of the three curves under tidal conditions were much larger than those under non tidal conditions indicating that tides increased the impact of fracture length fig 12 b similarly a longer fracture also caused a significant increase in v f fig 12 c although v f still limited by tides which was also reflected by the saltwater wedge thickness fig 11 the vusp f was also positively correlated with fracture length fig 12 d but the variation range was smaller than that in fig 8 d and fig 10 d because the fractures were not long enough to reach the area close to the usp 3 2 4 vertical oriented fractures vary in horizontal directions the fourth sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of the horizontal position of vertical fractures on swi the vertical fractures were placed at different horizontal positions of the aquifer spaced 0 2 m apart and began with 0 6 m 0 35 m since the phenomenon of the last 3 cases were similar the concentration fields of the first 5 sets of experiments were only presented in fig 13 while the swi variables in all experiments were analyzed in fig 14 fig 13 and fig 14 present the concentration fields and swi variables the results show that the impact of vertical fractures was mainly on the mixing zone while the impact on other swi variables was little the quantitative analyses in fig 14 a 14 c and 14 d revealed that vertical fractures had little effect on tl v f and vusp f under both non tidal and tidal conditions under tidal condition the vertical fractures left the saltwater area at the horizontal position closer to the sea than that under non tidal condition making the curves of the tidal case approach constant lines the peak of tl and v f of tidal condition was due to the reduction of mixing and the acceleration of freshwater discharge fig 13 b2 vertical fractures could significantly enhance the mixing parameters under both conditions fig 14 b under non tidal conditions the factors increased to the maximum and then decreased gradually the mixing zone mainly appeared on the downstream side of the vertical fracture etsias et al 2021 as the fracture approaching inland the space on the downstream side of the fracture and the contact degree between the fracture and saltwater exhibited opposite changing patterns therefore the maximum values of the three mixing parameters appeared in the middle of the saltwater wedge and the variation of wmean was small under tidal conditions due to the short saltwater wedge the impact of vertical fractures on swi is only significant in areas very close to the sea and the affected area was much smaller than under non tidal condition in the case closest to the sea fig 13 b1 the vertical fracture contacted with the usp forming a large mixing zone but the usp volume decreased as the fracture left the saltwater area the mixing factors dropped rapidly and then stabilized at constant values fig 14 b 3 2 5 impact of fracture characteristics on concentration distribution this section investigated the impact of fracture characteristics on the spatial concentration distribution of the transition zone at the bottom of the aquifer under both non tidal and tidal conditions this analysis is based on the research conducted by maria et al 2015a who found that periodic oscillation of sea level caused by tides had the largest impact on the spreading of the interface at the bottom of the aquifer fig 15 showed the toe lengths defined by 10 50 and 90 concentration contour lines under non tidal orange thick columns and tidal blue thin columns conditions the figure also presented the tl ratios which compared the tl values of tidal condition l to those of non tidal condition lnt for the 10 50 and 90 concentration contour lines with dotted dashed and solid curves fig 15 shows that under non tidal conditions the concentration distributions were relatively uniform and concentrated and was little affected by fracture characteristics as shown by the close proximity of the three tl columns in each subfigure under tidal conditions the differences of the three columns increased in each subfigure especially the 90 column showed a significant decrease compared to the others this result indicated that tides intensified the concentration distribution in transition zone at the bottom of aquifer especially on high concentration saltwater the tl ratio curves had different trend in each subfigure showing the influence patterns of each fracture characteristic on concentration distribution was different the 10 and 50 tl ratio curves showed a high degree of consistency in all subfigures suggesting that the effect of tides and fractures on the low and middle concentration ends were similar however the variation pattern of the 90 tl ratio curves differed significantly from the others in each subfigure indicating that tides and fractures altered the distribution of high concentration saltwater end of the transition zone in fig 15 a the 10 and 50 tl ratios dropped to low values after the first three cases and then gradually increased to constant values while the 90 tl ratio only maintained high value at the first two cases the change of the distance between the 50 and 90 curves indicated that the degree of the high concentration saltwater distribution increased with the horizontal fracture horizontal position changed from the sea boundary fracture position 0 5 m 0 35 m to the tail of the saltwater wedge fracture position 1 5 m 0 35 m then significantly weakened with the fracture left the saltwater area in fig 15 b as the horizontal fracture height increased the three tl ratios first increased and then decreased while the gap between 50 and 90 curves increased this result shows that the degree of high concentration distribution increased proportionally with the fracture height fig 15 c shows that the 10 and 50 tl ratio curves increased with the horizontal fracture length and a long fracture could limit the effect of tides on low and middle concentration saltwater meanwhile as the fracture became longer gap between 50 and 90 curves increased indicating that the degree of the distribution of high concentration saltwater became larger fig 15 d showed that all three tl ratio curves were nearly horizontal and the distances between the curves were nearly the same indicating that the effects of vertical fractures on different concentration saltwater were similar 4 conclusion this study investigated the impact of tides on swi in fractured coastal aquifers laboratory experiments were conducted in six fractured aquifers and one homogeneous aquifer under both non tidal and tidal conditions and numerical models were used to reconstruct the experiments and analyze the results the analysis included variables such as toe length tl average width of the mixing zone wmean maximum width of the mixing zone wpeak mixing volume fraction vm f saline volume fraction v f and usp volume fraction vusp f additionally the study explored the impact of fractures on the flow fields and sgd under tidal condition sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying the horizontal positions vertical positions lengths of horizontal fractures and horizontal positions of vertical fractures the resulting concentration distribution of saltwater in the transition zone at the bottom of the aquifer was then analyzed the major findings are as follows 1 horizontal fractures had a significant impact on the degree of swi under both non tidal and tidal conditions while vertical fractures mainly influenced the mixing zone the presence of fractures resulted in the formation of a low velocity freshwater area on both sides which attracted saltwater and enhanced mixing the effect of fracture on swi properties depended on the relative position between the fracture and saltwater compared to the non tidal condition tides changed the effect pattern of fracture characteristics and enhanced the variation ranges of most swi properties offshore fractures accelerated the tidally driven seawater recirculation increasing the sgd and the ratio of tidally driven recirculation 2 the horizontal position of the fracture was crucial to the degree of contact between the fracture and saltwater freshwater which determined the impact of fractures on swi tl mixing zone factors and vsup f initially increased and then decreased with the position of the fracture the maximum tl was observed when the fracture was at the boundary of the saltwater wedge and fully located in the freshwater area indicating that sufficient contact between the fracture and both saltwater saltwater wedge or usp and freshwater was crucial for mixing the effect of fractures on swi was more pronounced under tidal condition which enhanced most swi properties 3 the effect of horizontal fracture height on swi properties was influenced by tides which constrained the length and thickness of the saltwater wedge compared to non tidal conditions whether the fracture restricted or attracted the saltwater wedge depended on its height relative to the saltwater wedge of the homogeneous aquifer as a result the variations of tl and v differed between tidal and non tidal conditions in addition to the saltwater wedge the usp also contributed to the varying mixing zone factors under tidal and non tidal conditions 4 all swi properties showed a positive correlation with the length of the fracture under both non tidal and tidal conditions the length of the fracture had a moderating effect on the length of the saltwater wedge under tidal condition a longer fracture was observed to weaken the impact of tides on the length of saltwater wedge to some extent 5 vertical fractures had a limited impact on most swi properties under both non tidal and tidal condition with the exception of the width of the mixing zone which was significantly influenced when vertical fractures approached inland under tidal condition the mixing zone factors showed small variations except when the fracture contacted with the usp 6 tides and horizontal fractures significantly have a substantial impact on the concentration distribution in the fresh saltwater transition zone at the bottom of aquifer leading to the migration of high seaward and low landward concentration saltwater in opposite directions the toe lengths defined by 10 50 and 90 salt concentrations were similar under non tidal condition but the 90 toe length was significantly reduced by tides additionally horizontal fractures influenced the distribution of concentrations particularly in the high concentration areas the extent of the high concentration saltwater distribution was directly proportional to the height length of the fracture and reached a peak where the fracture horizontally separated from the non tidal saltwater wedge these findings have significant implications for managing fractured aquifers in real world despite the simplification of the geological structure further research will explore swi in aquifers with more complex fracture geometries such as varying numbers and network structures and consider more complex hydraulic conditions to expand the conclusions of this study declaration

1808,frost damage in mid latitude loess regions is mainly caused by the coupled soil water and heat transfer during freezing thawing ft processes in this paper to better understand the thermo hydraulic th behaviors of seasonally frozen loess field monitoring and assessment were performed on the loess plateau china with a quasi distributed opto electronic sensing system this system successfully captured the spatiotemporal variations in multivariables of seasonally frozen soil in near real time including in situ soil temperature unfrozen water content and ice content the monitoring datasets collected during the 2020 2021 winter offer unique insight into the th behaviors of freezing point fp depression in situ soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc and cryosuction the findings highlight the importance of acquiring sfccs under natural boundary conditions and confirm the applicability of laboratory obtained fp in determining in situ soil freezing depth furthermore the study reveals that soil matric suction considering the presence of ice is the primary driving force of water migration during ft finally errors in field monitoring are discussed which arise from two aspects the special features of loess and imperfections in monitoring schemes this assessment of the coupled th responses to climate changes in loess offers valuable theoretical guidance for optimizing engineering construction schemes and mitigating geohazards in mid latitude loess regions keywords loess fiber optic sensing ice content soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc thermo hydraulic redistribution field monitoring data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction loess is mainly distributed in mid latitude regions with semiarid continental and monsoonal climates covering approximately 10 of the global continental area wang et al 2016 its unique structural characteristics such as highly porous unsaturated loose silt size aggregates and vertical capillaries wen and yan 2014 make it highly sensitive to changes in heat and water particularly under seasonally freezing thawing ft cycles the physical properties of loess undergo significant changes due to coupled soil water and heat transfer frey and mcclelland 2009 which further leads to many geological hazards and engineering problems e g slope instability landslides frost heave induced soil cracks and foundation settlements lai et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 therefore it is essential to comprehensively understand the key thermo hydraulic th behaviors influenced by inevitable soil ft cycles in the field to provide valuable theoretical guidance for engineering construction design and geological disaster prevention in cold regions xu et al 2019 over the years numerous investigations have been conducted on th behaviors during ft cryosuction described as the increase in matric suction in the frozen zone with increasing ice content and resulting in a redistribution of soil moisture to the freezing front hayashi 2013 is a critical th process in this context several studies have attempted to explain the components and determine the most appropriate representation of cryosuction considering pressure temperature matric osmotic and gravity however there is currently no consensus on this topic fu et al 2022 another significant behavior is the depression of the freezing point fp which is essential to estimate the soil fp to judge whether the soil is frozen or not the fp depression is expected to be affected by the liquid water content textural composition solute concentration and pore pressure of the soil zhang et al 2022 over the past few decades capillary theory the gibbs thomson effect and electrolyte solution theory have been introduced to reveal the underlying mechanisms of fp depression dash et al 2006 however these theories only consider one of the aforementioned effects and no unified theory seems to explain all the empirical rules of fp depression alone to data zhou et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 furthermore the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc which refers to the unique relationship between unfrozen water content and sub freezing temperature zhou et al 2018 is a fundamental constitutive relationship in interpreting frozen soil properties and simulating the water heat transfer process ren et al 2017 sfccs have been extensively studied in laboratory using various techniques ranging from tensiometers to frequency domain reflectometry fdr and nuclear magnetic resonance lara et al 2020 however these techniques have certain limitations as there is no perfect method to accurately quantify unfrozen water content in frozen soils moreover no theory has yet adequately explained how capillary action chai et al 2018 surface effects dash 1989 and electrical double layer actions jin et al 2020 function to form unfrozen water during the freezing process therefore existing sfcc expressions have not been sufficiently or quantitatively supported jin et al 2020 the main reason for the above difficulties in th behavior characterization can be categorized into two aspects first the uncertainty of in situ soil properties hinders a proper fundamental understanding of the th behaviors leading to deviations in the assessment of the dynamic ft processes kurylyk and watanabe 2013 qualifying th behaviors relies on accurate depictions of basic th properties e g soil temperature t s gradient unfrozen water content θ w and ice content θ i which are difficult to directly and continuously measure in the field qi et al 2008 viklander 1998 wu et al 2021c among these properties efficient acquisition of θ i is essential for understanding the mechanism of th behaviors zhou et al 2015 several laboratory techniques have been developed for determining θ i including gas dilatometry nuclear magnetic resonance nmr dielectric spectroscopy and the heat pulse probe hpp method liu and si 2011 he and dyck 2013 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2020 some improved methods have also been presented to indirectly estimate θ i with a combination of two independent techniques cheng et al 2013 kojima et al 2020 however for in situ heterogeneous soils few suitable methods exist to monitor the spatiotemporal variation in θ i without damaging soil structures fu et al 2022 recently wu et al 2021a proposed the actively heated fiber bragg grating ah fbg method for θ i measurement in well controlled laboratory conditions however this method does not consider the migration nature of unfrozen water under an open system sun et al 2021 applied ah fbg for total water content measurement in the field without considering the influence of ice on soil thermal properties therefore the field applicability of the ah fbg method for moisture measurement in cold regions needs further improvement second existing investigations on soil th behaviors were generally performed on disturbed soil samples at or near thermal equilibrium leading to deviations in its application to soils that seldom reach thermodynamic equilibrium under natural boundary conditions lara et al 2020 many available studies on sfccs are based on laboratory investigations and are inappropriate for analyzing the ft process of in situ soil at disequilibrium a few field studies flerchinger et al 2004 he et al 2015 have quantitatively examined sfccs and pointed out the importance of in situ sfccs in understanding the th behavior of frozen soil additionally the in situ soil ft state has typically been inferred from temperature observations alone and classified based on a 0 c threshold which is not ideal for ground ft classification lara et al 2020 however analyses of fp depression considering cryosuction are rarely verified and applied in the field in this study a combined fiber optic heat pulse dielectric referred to as combined opto electronic sensing approach was proposed to simultaneously measure in situ soil temperature t s unfrozen water content θ w and ice content θ i providing critical parameters for th behavior characterization a quasi distributed opto electronic sensing system was further established at a site located on the loess plateau china enabling continuous observations of the spatiotemporal distribution of soil temperature and moisture over the winter seasons in near real time the system offers a unique opportunity to investigate the th behaviors of frozen loess under natural boundary conditions the field monitoring results during the 2020 2021 winter are presented in this paper the critical datasets allow us to decipher fp depression in situ sfcc and matric suction considering ice contents which promote the analysis of water migration due to cryosuction 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field monitoring was performed in huining county gansu province china which is located on the northwest loess plateau 35 36 49 n 104 58 54 e fig 1 a and b show the location and satellite image of the study site respectively the region is characterized by a middle temperate semiarid climate with an average annual air temperature of 6 9 c and average annual precipitation of 180 450 mm historically the recorded lowest air temperature in this study area was 23 3 seasonally frozen loess is widely distributed in the area as shown in fig 1 c according to the geotechnical investigation data the groundwater table is below 30 m and groundwater recharge for the near surface soil is rare only one precipitation event with a 3 8 mm accumulated rainfall occurred from dec 20 2020 to feb 15 2021 making the recharge of precipitation in this period negligible therefore soil properties in this area are mainly influenced by temperature and little water is replenished at the study site the typical covering layer in the study area is quaternary loess soil with a thickness of up to 10 20 m where silty clay is dominant fig 2 a shows the soil grain size distribution with the particle fractions determined according to the united states department of agriculture usda soil textural classification the physical properties of the loess are shown in table 1 and classified as silty clay with low plasticity according to the unified soil classification system uscs fig 2 b shows the swcc based on the well known van genuchten model the soil matric suction data for the swcc curve were obtained using a soil water potential sensor teros 21 meter group 2022 the volumetric water contents were recorded by the ec 5 soil moisture sensor decagon device inc 2016 key parameters in the van genuchten model were obtained through curve fitting using the least square method the upper t 0 and lower t l temperature limits of the dramatic phase change zone are 0 3 and 3 8 respectively which are obtained in the laboratory for soil specimens with different initial mass water contents of 12 16 24 and 26 wu et al 2021a t 0 represents the fp acting as the threshold at which the soil starts to freeze and most of the ice water conversion primarily occurs in the dramatic phase change zone the t 0 value is preliminarily utilized as an important criterion for determining the freezing depth in field monitoring whose applicability will be verified in the following section 2 2 field instrumentation the objective of this study was to develop an automated subsurface sensing system to keep track of the soil th behaviors during the ft process fig 3 illustrates the schematic vertical cross section of the sensing system including ah fbg sensors fdr probes data collectors a power supply and a weather station the combined opto electronic sensing approach based on ah fbg and fdr sensors was applied to monitor shallow soil temperature and moisture of the in situ loess fig 3 shows the structure of the ah fbg sensor which combines the fiber optic cable electrical resistance aluminum oxide tube and stainless protector flange and tip to eliminate the strain effect fbgs are installed in the hole of the aluminum oxide tube with one end loosened for temperature sensing six fbgs are connected in series with a spacing of 20 cm the electrical resistance passes through the aluminum oxide tube in a loop for active heating the aluminum oxide tube as a proctor and heat conducting medium has high thermal conductivity and strong hardness the ah fbg sensors are efficient for soil thermophysical property and moisture field parameter measurements two ah fbg sensors were fixed in parallel with a spacing of 1 4 cm one of which worked as an actively heated sensor and the other as a t s measured sensor the ah fbg sensing points are located at depths of 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm 100 cm and 120 cm all fiber optic sensors were arranged in series to form a fiber optic cable for quasi distributed measurement of t s and θ i real time θ w was obtained using fdr probes nh148 40 manufactured by wuhan zhongke nenghui technology development co ltd with a resolution of 0 001 m3 m3 an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m3 and an operating temperature range of 40 80 more details can be found at https www nengh com productsstd 239 html five fdr probes were inserted into the ground at the corresponding depths of the measuring points of the ah fbg sensor above 100 cm depth the data collectors in this study consist of an interrogator and a data collection box the interrogator nzs fbg a02 produced by suzhou nanzee sensing co ltd was connected to all fiber optic sensors and continually read their wavelength data the data collection box was responsible for the data acquisition of fdr probes both collectors were equipped with wireless transmission modules to transmit all field data to the cloud system allowing real time remote capture of subsurface information the power supply comprises a solar panel that powers the entire system and a power transformer that acts as the heating controller to provide stable heating power for ah fbg sensors daily meteorological data were obtained from a weather station including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction net radiation and rainfall amount the sensors were deployed by digging hole installing backfilling the entire system was then set up installed and debugged in december 2020 field monitoring was performed from dec 20 2020 to mar 10 2021 the ah fbg sensor was heated four times a day and each heating cycle lasted for ten minutes at t 0 00 6 00 12 00 and 18 00 with an applied power during the heat pulses of 10 8 w m to minimize measurement errors due to heating these parameters were carefully determined based on previous researches de vries 1952 wechsler 1966 cao et al 2021 sun et al 2021 as well as experimental studies on the influence of heating on ice melting wu et al 2021a 2 3 soil temperature and moisture monitoring 2 3 1 fbg sensors for soil temperature monitoring over the past forty years a range of fiber optic sensing technologies have been developed and successfully applied for geo hydrological monitoring schenato 2017 zhang and xue 2019 among these technologies raman scattering based distributed temperature sensing dts is widely used and has shown significant potential in estimating soil moisture and groundwater flux for large scale and long distance cases selker et al 2006 bense et al 2016 del val et al 2021 however the relatively low spatial resolution and temperature measurement accuracy of dts limit the precise measurement of moisture distribution in shallow soil layers in contrast fbg sensing technology can overcome these limitations through special demodulation techniques fig 4 a illustrates the working principle of the fbg as shown in fig 4 if a bragg grating is written into a segment of a ge doped optical fiber the grating will reflect a narrow spectral part of light at a specific wavelength λ b when broadband light is injected into the fiber core zhu et al 2015 for a loose optical fiber without any strain λ b is only sensitive to the change in temperature δt which can be calculated as 1 δ t δ λ b λ b c t where δλ b is the wavelength shift and ct 1 is the wavelength sensitivity coefficient for temperature which are determined via laboratory calibration tests zhu et al 2021 equation 1 is available for temperature sensing with an accuracy of 0 1 and a range of 40 60 c an important feature of this technology is that fbgs with different λ b can be connected in series to form a quasi distributed temperature sensing array as shown in fig 4 additionally when combined with the hpp method fbg sensors can detect temperature changes in frozen soil at different depths during active heating this methodology is called actively heated fbg ah fbg sensing technology 2 3 2 combined opto electronic sensing approach for moisture monitoring of frozen soil this paper proposes a combined opto electronic sensing approach to determine the in situ θ i in a straightforward way the working principle is presented in fig 5 the improved ah fbg technology is applied here for measuring thermal conductivity λ as the fiber optic component of the proposed approach fdr technology is used to obtain θ w as the electronic component of the approach accordingly θ i can be calculated using the relationship between λ and θ w θ i specifically the combined opto electronic sensing approach involves four steps first the côté and konrad model c k model côté and konrad 2006 is selected here to describe the relationship between λ and θ w θ i this model has been successfully applied by cao et al 2021 to calculate λ of frozen soil used in this study in this model soil λ can be expressed by 2 λ s r k 2 λ s 1 n λ w θ w λ i θ i χ 10 η n 1 k 2 1 s r where s r is the degree of saturation s r θ w θ i n θ w and θ i are the volumetric contents of soil water and ice m3 m3 respectively λ w λ i λ s are the thermal conductivities of water ice and solids w m respectively n is the soil void ratio k 2 is a parameter related to the grain size distribution χ w m and η are parameters related to particle shape under frozen conditions k 2 1 7 0 95 0 85 and 0 25 are assigned for well graded gravels and coarse sands medium and fine sands silts and clays and peat respectively χ 0 75 w m c and η 1 2 are assigned to natural soils which are determined and validated by a series of experimental data in the literature côté and konrad 2011 second in situ θ w is obtained using the fdr probe which indirectly measures soil water content by determining the bulk dielectric constant from frequency variations of an electromagnetic pulse propagated into the soil third in situ λ is measured by the ah fbg sensor which is based on fbg temperature sensing technology and an infinite linear heat source model wu et al 2021b sun et al 2021 assuming that an ah fbg sensor is embedded in homogeneous soil and electrically heated for a period of time fig 5 the temperature time history curve is expressed as benítez buelga et al 2016 3 δ t t q 4 π λ ln t c where t is the heating duration s δ t t is the temperature change q is the heating power of the linear heat source w m and c is a constant related to the soil thermal diffusivity sensor radius and thermal resistance between the sensor and soil according to eq 3 the slope k of that regression can be expressed as 4 k δ t t 2 δ t t 1 ln t 2 ln t 1 where δ t t 1 and δ t t 2 are the temperature values at times t 1 and t 2 respectively if t is sufficiently large or the sensor radius is very small λ can be inferred from he et al 2018 5 λ q 4 π k eqs 4 and 5 are applied to λ determination of unfrozen and frozen soils with homogeneous properties whose accuracy has been confirmed by wu et al 2021b however it should be noted that the in situ soil temperature and physical properties are heterogeneous with depth there is not only radial heat conduction in the soil but also longitudinal heat transfer inside the ah fbg sensor tube as shown in fig 5 specifically the heating rate of the soil layer with low water content is higher than that of the soil layer with high water content leading to longitudinal heat transfer inside the sensor tube during heating processes similarly differences in initial soil temperatures also cause differences in heat flow inside the soil at different locations liu et al 2023 longitudinal heat transfer affects the temperature time history curves recorded by the fbgs and introduces errors for k and λ to reduce errors caused by longitudinal heat transfer the artificial neural network ann method is applied in this analysis as shown in fig 5 a three layer backpropagation bp neural network model containing one input layer several hidden layers and one output layer is implemented the input variables are soil temperatures of adjacent measurements t s k of adjacent measurements k a and k of measuring point k m the output variable is the corrected k of the measuring point k substituting the corrected k into eq 5 the modified λ can be obtained eliminating the influence of longitudinal heat transfer finally substituting λ obtained by ah fbg and θ w measured by fdr into the c k model eq 2 the in situ θ i of the frozen soil can be back calculated based on the results of θ i and θ w θ t can be obtained accordingly using the combined opto electronic sensing approach the critical moisture properties of in situ frozen soil can be continuously measured providing a better understanding of the thermal and hydraulic behaviors during the freeze thaw process 2 4 soil thermo hydraulic behaviors characterization fig 6 shows a schematic diagram of soil th behaviors during the ft process when the ground surface is exposed to an air temperature t a below the fp t 0 where water and ice are in equilibrium with equal free energy unsteady heat flow is initiated the freezing front progresses into the soil and the pore water is transformed into ice ice applies pressure against restraining boundaries and liquid water presents as adsorbed films and capillary water on the surfaces of soil particles in equilibrium with ice konrad and morgenstern 1980 cryosuction related to a pressure difference between ice and water leads to more water migration from the unfrozen zone into the frozen zone xu et al 2019 heat transfer accompanying water migration affects soil temperature distribution simultaneously when sufficient water accumulates an ice lens forms the thickness and spacing of the ice lenses depend on the relative magnitudes of the freezing rate and water availability penner 1961 as shown in fig 6 the zone above the freezing front is treated as the frozen fringe which is defined as the partially frozen zone between the ice lens and the warmest soil with pore ice miller 1972 the intricate internal structure of the frozen fringe presents considerable complexity as numerous physical parameters and behaviors related to the coupled soil water and heat transfer surrounding the fringe undergo significant alterations during distinct freezing stages this complexity poses a challenge to accurately determining these parameters and behaviors in this study basic parameters were obtained by field monitoring as introduced above then the th behaviors of the frozen fringe were characterized as follows first due to cryosuction the fp t in the soil under unsaturated conditions can be derived from soil moisture data the specific method is as follows dall amico et al 2011 6 t t 0 g t 0 273 15 l f φ t 0 where l f is the latent heat of ice water change j kg g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 and φ t 0 is the matric suction based on θ t which increases with decreasing θ w as ice replaces water the soil freezing process resembles the process of soil drying koopmans and miller 1966 according to the freezing drying assumption φ t 0 subjected to freezing conditions can be calculated from the swcc according to the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 7 θ t θ r θ s θ r 1 α φ t 0 n m where θ s and θ r cm3 cm3 are the saturated and residual water contents respectively and α n and m are the parameters of the model obtained by curve fitting second the sfcc of the field loess at different depths can be derived by monitoring data θ w and t s anderson and tice 1972 developed an empirical power curve to express the sfcc 8 θ w ρ d ρ w a t b where a and b are model parameters and are determined by curve fitting third the driving force of water migration the water energy state and movement direction in frozen soil are mainly determined by the soil matric suction in general known as cryosuction as shown in fig 6 under the t s gradient t s the unfrozen water adsorbed on the soil surface shows asymmetry r 1 r 2 fu et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 causing an unfrozen water imbalance and resulting in water migration migratory unfrozen water is divided into two layers film water and capillary water xu et al 2001 the matric suction is related to the pressure difference acting on the layers fig 6 which is affected by the soil temperatures and moisture contents soil matric suction φ t 0 corresponding to θ t without considering the effect of ice is unreasonable as ice pressure significantly affects the coupled th interaction alternatively the matric suction φ t of frozen soil considering ice existence and thus successfully characterizing water migration is expressed as dall amico et al 2011 9 φ t φ t ρ w l f g t 273 15 t t t t φ t 0 t t in summary the overall framework and linkage between different monitored parameters are shown in fig 7 in situ t s is used to determine whether the soil is frozen and to determine the freezing depth through its distribution the φ t related to θ i and θ w is the driving force of water migration fig 7 also shows the interactive behaviors between the physical fields the water ice phase change is controlled by the thermal field which ultimately changes the behaviors of the hydraulic field in turn the water migration accompanied by heat transport and changes in soil λ alter the t s distribution 3 results and analyses 3 1 field temperature distribution fig 8 demonstrates the variations in daily air temperature t a net radiation r n and t s distribution during the 2020 2021 winter solar radiation fluctuations cause notable changes in both t a and r n which in turn influence t s therefore these three parameters are theoretically coordinated which is also evident from the monitoring data in fig 8 in this study t a was selected for data analysis as it is more accessible in most cases fig 8 illustrates the close relationship between t s and t a as shown in fig 8 c it is clear that t s changed greater in shallower soil and was relatively stable below a depth of 80 cm the average t s at 80 cm depth was 0 45 higher than t 0 0 3 indicating that the maximum freezing depth was less than 80 cm therefore only the monitoring data above 80 cm depth were considered in the following sections 3 2 freezing depth and process considering t 0 as the freezing temperature the depth of the t 0 isotherm is the freezing depth the thickness of the dramatic phase transition zone is calculated by measuring the distance between the t 0 and t l isotherms which were extracted from fig 8 b and are shown in fig 9 a it is apparent from fig 9 a that unidirectional freezing started prior to the field monitoring period and reached its maximum level in mid january 2021 the maximum freezing depth 76 1 cm occurred on jan 22 2021 subsequently the frozen soil entered the thawing period from the upper and bottom simultaneously in early february as heat transformed from the external environment and deep soil respectively the freezing front is located at the freezing depth and the frost penetration rate r fp can be calculated as the change rate of the freezing depth with time during the ft process which is shown in fig 9 b by carefully considering the r fp and t a values the ft process can be divided into five stages as shown in table 2 and fig 9 during stage i the freezing front penetrated rapidly toward deeper soil with a higher r fp the soil above it froze quickly resulting in significant and complex changes in soil properties the field ground was then kept in a frozen state with an r fp of 1 1 cm d during stage ii and then started to thaw at stage iii with an r fp of 3 1 cm d during stages iv and v most of the monitored soil masses were under unfrozen conditions therefore to investigate the th behaviors of the frozen loess the following analyses mainly focused on the first three stages involving the freezing process 3 3 soil moisture distribution fig 10 a and b plots the θ w and θ i evolution at different depths during the first three stages as t s decreased and the frozen fringe moved deeper from 47 cm to 67 cm in stage i pore water was converted to ice resulting in a decrease in θ w and an increase in θ i although the freezing depth remained relatively stable in stage ⅱ the monitoring results suggest that migrated water froze as evidenced by a slight decrease in θ w and a continuous increase in θ i during stage iii as t s increased and the frozen soil at a depth of 0 76 1 cm started to thaw melting ice led to a decrease in θ i and an increase in θ w as θ w or θ i fails to fully characterize the phase change of in situ and migrated water separately it is necessary to identify the θ t development fig 10 c presents the variation in θ t at different depths as depicted in fig 10 c θ t at depths of 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm fluctuated greatly with the ft process θ t increased mainly at stages ⅰ remained stable at stage ⅱ and decreased at stage iii the most significant finding from fig 10 c is that the θ t changes reflected the amount of migrated water from the unfrozen zone into the frozen fringe during freezing for example θ t at 60 cm depth slightly decreased before dec 30 and abruptly increased after that this phenomenon can be explained by water migration from the unfrozen zone to the frozen fringe in fig 9 a the soil at 60 cm depth started to freeze on dec 30 and remained in the frozen fringe until stage iv consequently the unfrozen water flowed away from a depth of 60 cm and resulted in a slight decrease before this day then the water migrated to and accumulated inside the frozen fringe causing a rapid increase in θ t on dec 30 correspondingly the θ t at 80 cm depth which is always unfrozen decreased at the same time due to upward water flow from the unfrozen zone it should also be noted that there are some data gaps during the test because of system errors 3 4 in situ sfcc the sfcc is associated with the freezing temperature making it essential to determine fp first the calculated fp t at 60 cm depth is derived using eqs 6 and 7 as depicted in fig 11 multiply phenomena can be observed from fig 11 first t is characterized via field monitoring which fluctuated with changes in soil moisture as a result of the decreasing θ t t at 60 cm depth progressively declines reaching its minimum value on dec 29 once the soil started to freeze from dec 30 to feb 11 t increased rapidly to 0 32 and then remained stable second the comparison of t t 0 and t s indicates the freezing state where t 0 represents the measured fp in the laboratory when t s is higher or lower than t t 0 the soil is correspondingly unfrozen or frozen a strong consistency between t 0 and t was presented validating the use of t 0 isotherm as the freezing depth in section 3 2 however discrepancies exist between the calculated t and the actual data from dec 30 to 31 and feb 11 to 14 this deviation may be due to the complex soil properties in the dramatic phase change zone where t s is close to the freezing point shown in fig 11 nevertheless the analysis of t demonstrates that laboratory measurements of freezing points can be utilized to determine whether the soil is frozen or not in the field the sub temperature sfccs at different depths are shown in fig 12 the sfccs at different depths exhibit a significant difference particularly at a depth of 60 cm where it is higher than the other two depths however this finding differs from the sfcc characteristics observed in previous laboratory experiments where the volume of residual unfrozen water was stable and changed little with external factors tang et al 2018 this result can be attributed to several explanations 1 the concept of the sfcc is used to describe the quantity and energy status of unfrozen water at equilibrated states in frozen freezing soils where the total soil water content is constant koopmans and miller 1966 however in situ soils in the field may seldom reach thermal and hydraulic dynamic equilibrium due to transient boundary conditions such as air temperature precipitation and variable snowpack depth these conditions lead to water redistribution and changes in the total water content which can cause differences in the sfcc characteristics compared to laboratory experiments he et al 2015 2 the field t s mainly depended on air temperature and changed periodically in contrast monotonic ft cycles rarely occur in the field which differs from well controlled laboratory conditions 3 the lowest t s observed was only 1 53 at 60 cm 4 09 at 40 cm and 8 65 at 20 cm the range of t s at 60 cm depth was not wide enough to promote the water ice phase transition compared to the other depths therefore pore water still exists in liquid form resulting in inconsistencies in sfccs in summary affected by the moisture migration induced by boundary conditions and temperature fluctuation the sfcc obtained via field monitoring is different from that under the laboratory test this conclusion demonstrates the irrationality of applying laboratory results to in situ engineering case studies as the sfcc is the fundamental constitutive relationship that governs the water and heat transfer process and the th properties of frozen soils it is essential to acquire the sfccs of soils in nonequilibrium under these circumstances caution must be exercised when applying sfcc expressions developed using the clausius clapeyron equation in the field in this paper the widely used empirical power curve eq 8 was utilized and the parameters were determined through curving fitting as shown in fig 12 the empirical power curves generally exhibited good agreement with monitoring data with high r 2 which verified the feasibility of applying this model in seasonally frozen loess 3 5 thermo hydraulic redistribution fig 13 provides an intuitive representation of the measured t s and water redistribution during freezing as t s decreased from dec 20 2020 to jan 16 2021 the freezing front moved toward the deep soil and θ t above the freezing front increased correspondingly this visually illustrates the phenomenon of pore water migration upward and gathering in the frozen fringe during freezing to characterize the driving force of water transport in the frozen fringe data at 60 cm depth were selected for analysis and plotted in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 b φ t and φ t 0 increased before dec 30 indicating a gradually intensifying upward water flow correspondingly the ice saturations at 20 cm and 40 cm where the unfrozen water accumulated continued to rise simultaneously in fig 14 a however φ t and φ t 0 decreased sharply on dec 30 when the ice saturation at 60 cm depth increased rapidly this phenomenon is attributed to water migration inside the frozen fringe the most striking observation from fig 14 is the significant differences between φ t and φ t 0 with the development of the freezing process this gradually increasing gap implies the unneglected impact of ice pressure on the cryosuction effect moreover a positive correlation was found between φ t and ice saturation at 60 cm depth which further suggests that it is more reasonable to characterize water migration in frozen soil with φ t with consideration of cryosuction it is worth noting that the ice saturations were relatively stable at 20 cm and 40 cm but continued to rise at 60 cm after dec 30 this difference is possibly due to the water ice phase change which is accompanied by an increased solid phase and reduced void ratio leading to a decrease in hydraulic conductivity ji et al 2021 once the soil at a depth of 60 cm began to freeze less water could pass through hindering the continued accumulation of water above the frozen fringe therefore the migrating water accumulated in the frozen fringe and then converted to ice resulting in the rising ice saturation of the soil at a depth of 60 cm but remaining constant at depths of 20 cm and 40 cm fig 14 a the th interaction was also reflected in the synchronous change trend of t s and φ t in fig 14 b on the one hand water ice phase change and soil matric suction φ t are affected by soil temperatures as discussed earlier on the other hand the heat mass migration accompanied by water flow melts the ice inducing a thinner water film on the warmer side of the particle than on the colder side microscopically rempel et al 2001 simultaneously there is a relatively larger λ of frozen soil compared to that of unfrozen soil due to the water ice phase transition yu et al 2020 this leads to a larger t s in the frozen zones on a macro level it should be noted that in addition to water migration from the unfrozen zone infiltration due to precipitation and snowmelt as well as evaporation at the soil surface can significantly affect the distribution of soil temperature and moisture which are the two most important controls on water and energy transport between the atmosphere and the ground cuo et al 2015 however the dramatic reduction in soil permeability due to freezing will limit the infiltration depth niu and yang 2006 for regions with a small amount of winter rainfall and snowfall such as the study area in this paper it is reasonable to neglect the infiltration and evaporation effects in analyzing the coupled th redistribution of subsurface soil in summary this study investigated the soil temperature and water redistribution inside the frozen soil and their interaction using field monitoring data the results showed that the variation in φ t can effectively characterize water migration due to cryosuction 4 discussions the combined opto electronic sensing system used for field monitoring in the loess plateau has provided basic parameters t s θ w θ i θ t of seasonally frozen loess however the accuracy of field monitoring data can be affected by several factors the sources of error can generally be categorized into two aspects the special features of loess and imperfections in the monitoring schemes 4 1 errors from features of loess the first factor is the effect of frost on soil structure loess is composed of unsaturated loose silt size aggregates with micropores and vertical capillaries during the freezing process ice crystals formed by the ice water phase change are unevenly distributed in the pores influencing soil structure development consolidation deformation and particle translocation van vliet lano 2010 fig 15 a shows the excavated loess with pores and ice crystals easily observable on the soil surface additionally ice segregation usually in the form of a lens can open shrink fissures in the unfrozen substratum van vliet lano 2010 cracks fig 15 b and c along the depth cause unavoidable unevenness in soil properties although loess is typically considered homogeneous the growth of ice crystals and vertical fissures weaken this feature to a certain extent this soil structural property inhomogeneity affects the heat and moisture transfer characteristics ultimately reducing the accuracy of field monitoring the second factor is the ft environment as shown in fig 15 d t s fluctuated with the change between day and night which is equivalent to a short ft process especially in the shallowly buried soil layer the effect of ft cycles on soil composition and physical properties e g thermal conductivities elastic modulus effective cohesion etc has been confirmed li et al 2020 with the number of cycles being an important factor as the number of cycles increases changes in soil physical parameters become more significant unless the number exceeds a certain threshold value wu et al 2021c thus multiple ft cycles over time accompanied by soil property changes in this study could introduce some errors into moisture monitoring however since the impact of ft cycles on the characteristic variables mainly exists in the first ft cycle the errors would not be too notable to affect monitoring reliability 4 2 errors from monitoring schemes the imperfection of the monitoring schemes can be categorized into three aspects first a phase change can be caused by active heating for one heating period fig 15 e shows the temperature changes of the measured ah fbg sensors located 1 4 cm away from the active heated sensor the maximum temperature rise was up to 1 7 indicating possible ice melting during heating this is especially true for the soil in the dramatic phase change zone which is extremely sensitive to temperature the soil composition and properties changed significantly due to heating and heat transfer thus making it difficult to accurately measure ice content however a temperature change of 1 7 would not lead to severe phase changes in frozen soil at low temperatures second there were missing data between quasi distributed measurement points it is known that the parameters at the freezing front are more meaningful where the water moves and gathers in this study the distance 20 cm between adjacent measuring points failed to keep track of the dynamics of the freezing front possibly leading to key information loss for example the freezing depth was between 60 and 80 cm for nearly forty days from dec 29 2020 to feb 16 2021 and the measuring points located at 60 cm and 80 cm could not accurately capture the data of the freezing front resulting in errors in the analysis of th behavior last but not least there were some issues with the monitoring time the monitoring started on dec 20 2020 when the shallow soil had already frozen and the freezing depth was 47 3 cm as shown in fig 9 a therefore the monitoring failed to capture the complete freezing process and the shallow monitoring points failed to capture critical information in the frost fringe for analysis as a result there were not enough valid data to better reveal the mechanism of cryosuction in summary various natural and system factors introduce a certain degree of uncertainty to the monitoring process to mitigate these uncertainties several measures can be implemented such as 1 utilizing artificial intelligence methods to correct natural errors which may be a viable approach 2 enhancing the experimental setup by decreasing the distance between monitoring points at crucial locations and extending the monitoring duration to capture more significant and comprehensive information and 3 advancing theoretical improvements for moisture parameter measurements particularly the measurement of frozen soil ice content in the dramatic phase transition zone characterized by unstable properties 5 conclusions this paper presents the field monitoring and assessment of the thermo hydraulic th behaviors of frozen loess using a quasi distributed opto electronic sensing system the system involves a novel combined opto electronic sensing approach capable of measuring in situ soil temperature t s unfrozen water content θ w and ice content θ i by employing the system in the loess plateau china the freezing thawing ft process was observed and the thermo hydraulic th behaviors were characterized through multivariable monitoring of subsurface soil the following conclusions are drawn in this study 1 the effectiveness of the combined opto electronic sensing system was confirmed by field monitoring the in situ θ i considering ice water coexistence and heterogeneity of in situ t s and physical properties along with depth was successfully obtained the distribution of soil moisture was further quantitatively characterized providing critical parameters for the analysis of the ft process 2 multivariable monitoring of in situ loess revealed unidirectional freezing and bidirectional melting processes in the 2020 2021 winter the soil temperature and water redistribution as well as their interaction during the rapid freezing stage were well illustrated through field monitoring 3 the soil freezing point τ fluctuated with moisture content due to cryosuction comparing τ with the soil freezing point τ 0 obtained in the laboratory illustrates that laboratory measurements of the freezing point are applicable to assess whether the soil is frozen or not as well as to determine the freezing depth in the field 4 the observed sfccs differ at various depths and deviate from those measured in the laboratory emphasizing the significance of accurately obtaining in situ sfccs for field engineering case studies the feasibility of using the empirical power curve to represent the sfcc has been confirmed as indicated by a high r 2 value 5 the influence of ice pressure on the cryosuction effect has been confirmed to be non negligible soil matric suction considering the presence of ice has been effectively demonstrated to characterize water migration in frozen soil the present study illustrates that opto electronic sensing opens a window for understanding the th coupling and ft mechanism of frozen loess the potential of this methodology warrants further exploration nevertheless certain challenges remain to be addressed such as changes in soil properties during multiple ft cycles and phase change effects induced by active heating future research should focus on more in depth theoretical analyses and technical enhancements to establish

1808,frost damage in mid latitude loess regions is mainly caused by the coupled soil water and heat transfer during freezing thawing ft processes in this paper to better understand the thermo hydraulic th behaviors of seasonally frozen loess field monitoring and assessment were performed on the loess plateau china with a quasi distributed opto electronic sensing system this system successfully captured the spatiotemporal variations in multivariables of seasonally frozen soil in near real time including in situ soil temperature unfrozen water content and ice content the monitoring datasets collected during the 2020 2021 winter offer unique insight into the th behaviors of freezing point fp depression in situ soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc and cryosuction the findings highlight the importance of acquiring sfccs under natural boundary conditions and confirm the applicability of laboratory obtained fp in determining in situ soil freezing depth furthermore the study reveals that soil matric suction considering the presence of ice is the primary driving force of water migration during ft finally errors in field monitoring are discussed which arise from two aspects the special features of loess and imperfections in monitoring schemes this assessment of the coupled th responses to climate changes in loess offers valuable theoretical guidance for optimizing engineering construction schemes and mitigating geohazards in mid latitude loess regions keywords loess fiber optic sensing ice content soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc thermo hydraulic redistribution field monitoring data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction loess is mainly distributed in mid latitude regions with semiarid continental and monsoonal climates covering approximately 10 of the global continental area wang et al 2016 its unique structural characteristics such as highly porous unsaturated loose silt size aggregates and vertical capillaries wen and yan 2014 make it highly sensitive to changes in heat and water particularly under seasonally freezing thawing ft cycles the physical properties of loess undergo significant changes due to coupled soil water and heat transfer frey and mcclelland 2009 which further leads to many geological hazards and engineering problems e g slope instability landslides frost heave induced soil cracks and foundation settlements lai et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 therefore it is essential to comprehensively understand the key thermo hydraulic th behaviors influenced by inevitable soil ft cycles in the field to provide valuable theoretical guidance for engineering construction design and geological disaster prevention in cold regions xu et al 2019 over the years numerous investigations have been conducted on th behaviors during ft cryosuction described as the increase in matric suction in the frozen zone with increasing ice content and resulting in a redistribution of soil moisture to the freezing front hayashi 2013 is a critical th process in this context several studies have attempted to explain the components and determine the most appropriate representation of cryosuction considering pressure temperature matric osmotic and gravity however there is currently no consensus on this topic fu et al 2022 another significant behavior is the depression of the freezing point fp which is essential to estimate the soil fp to judge whether the soil is frozen or not the fp depression is expected to be affected by the liquid water content textural composition solute concentration and pore pressure of the soil zhang et al 2022 over the past few decades capillary theory the gibbs thomson effect and electrolyte solution theory have been introduced to reveal the underlying mechanisms of fp depression dash et al 2006 however these theories only consider one of the aforementioned effects and no unified theory seems to explain all the empirical rules of fp depression alone to data zhou et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 furthermore the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc which refers to the unique relationship between unfrozen water content and sub freezing temperature zhou et al 2018 is a fundamental constitutive relationship in interpreting frozen soil properties and simulating the water heat transfer process ren et al 2017 sfccs have been extensively studied in laboratory using various techniques ranging from tensiometers to frequency domain reflectometry fdr and nuclear magnetic resonance lara et al 2020 however these techniques have certain limitations as there is no perfect method to accurately quantify unfrozen water content in frozen soils moreover no theory has yet adequately explained how capillary action chai et al 2018 surface effects dash 1989 and electrical double layer actions jin et al 2020 function to form unfrozen water during the freezing process therefore existing sfcc expressions have not been sufficiently or quantitatively supported jin et al 2020 the main reason for the above difficulties in th behavior characterization can be categorized into two aspects first the uncertainty of in situ soil properties hinders a proper fundamental understanding of the th behaviors leading to deviations in the assessment of the dynamic ft processes kurylyk and watanabe 2013 qualifying th behaviors relies on accurate depictions of basic th properties e g soil temperature t s gradient unfrozen water content θ w and ice content θ i which are difficult to directly and continuously measure in the field qi et al 2008 viklander 1998 wu et al 2021c among these properties efficient acquisition of θ i is essential for understanding the mechanism of th behaviors zhou et al 2015 several laboratory techniques have been developed for determining θ i including gas dilatometry nuclear magnetic resonance nmr dielectric spectroscopy and the heat pulse probe hpp method liu and si 2011 he and dyck 2013 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2020 some improved methods have also been presented to indirectly estimate θ i with a combination of two independent techniques cheng et al 2013 kojima et al 2020 however for in situ heterogeneous soils few suitable methods exist to monitor the spatiotemporal variation in θ i without damaging soil structures fu et al 2022 recently wu et al 2021a proposed the actively heated fiber bragg grating ah fbg method for θ i measurement in well controlled laboratory conditions however this method does not consider the migration nature of unfrozen water under an open system sun et al 2021 applied ah fbg for total water content measurement in the field without considering the influence of ice on soil thermal properties therefore the field applicability of the ah fbg method for moisture measurement in cold regions needs further improvement second existing investigations on soil th behaviors were generally performed on disturbed soil samples at or near thermal equilibrium leading to deviations in its application to soils that seldom reach thermodynamic equilibrium under natural boundary conditions lara et al 2020 many available studies on sfccs are based on laboratory investigations and are inappropriate for analyzing the ft process of in situ soil at disequilibrium a few field studies flerchinger et al 2004 he et al 2015 have quantitatively examined sfccs and pointed out the importance of in situ sfccs in understanding the th behavior of frozen soil additionally the in situ soil ft state has typically been inferred from temperature observations alone and classified based on a 0 c threshold which is not ideal for ground ft classification lara et al 2020 however analyses of fp depression considering cryosuction are rarely verified and applied in the field in this study a combined fiber optic heat pulse dielectric referred to as combined opto electronic sensing approach was proposed to simultaneously measure in situ soil temperature t s unfrozen water content θ w and ice content θ i providing critical parameters for th behavior characterization a quasi distributed opto electronic sensing system was further established at a site located on the loess plateau china enabling continuous observations of the spatiotemporal distribution of soil temperature and moisture over the winter seasons in near real time the system offers a unique opportunity to investigate the th behaviors of frozen loess under natural boundary conditions the field monitoring results during the 2020 2021 winter are presented in this paper the critical datasets allow us to decipher fp depression in situ sfcc and matric suction considering ice contents which promote the analysis of water migration due to cryosuction 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field monitoring was performed in huining county gansu province china which is located on the northwest loess plateau 35 36 49 n 104 58 54 e fig 1 a and b show the location and satellite image of the study site respectively the region is characterized by a middle temperate semiarid climate with an average annual air temperature of 6 9 c and average annual precipitation of 180 450 mm historically the recorded lowest air temperature in this study area was 23 3 seasonally frozen loess is widely distributed in the area as shown in fig 1 c according to the geotechnical investigation data the groundwater table is below 30 m and groundwater recharge for the near surface soil is rare only one precipitation event with a 3 8 mm accumulated rainfall occurred from dec 20 2020 to feb 15 2021 making the recharge of precipitation in this period negligible therefore soil properties in this area are mainly influenced by temperature and little water is replenished at the study site the typical covering layer in the study area is quaternary loess soil with a thickness of up to 10 20 m where silty clay is dominant fig 2 a shows the soil grain size distribution with the particle fractions determined according to the united states department of agriculture usda soil textural classification the physical properties of the loess are shown in table 1 and classified as silty clay with low plasticity according to the unified soil classification system uscs fig 2 b shows the swcc based on the well known van genuchten model the soil matric suction data for the swcc curve were obtained using a soil water potential sensor teros 21 meter group 2022 the volumetric water contents were recorded by the ec 5 soil moisture sensor decagon device inc 2016 key parameters in the van genuchten model were obtained through curve fitting using the least square method the upper t 0 and lower t l temperature limits of the dramatic phase change zone are 0 3 and 3 8 respectively which are obtained in the laboratory for soil specimens with different initial mass water contents of 12 16 24 and 26 wu et al 2021a t 0 represents the fp acting as the threshold at which the soil starts to freeze and most of the ice water conversion primarily occurs in the dramatic phase change zone the t 0 value is preliminarily utilized as an important criterion for determining the freezing depth in field monitoring whose applicability will be verified in the following section 2 2 field instrumentation the objective of this study was to develop an automated subsurface sensing system to keep track of the soil th behaviors during the ft process fig 3 illustrates the schematic vertical cross section of the sensing system including ah fbg sensors fdr probes data collectors a power supply and a weather station the combined opto electronic sensing approach based on ah fbg and fdr sensors was applied to monitor shallow soil temperature and moisture of the in situ loess fig 3 shows the structure of the ah fbg sensor which combines the fiber optic cable electrical resistance aluminum oxide tube and stainless protector flange and tip to eliminate the strain effect fbgs are installed in the hole of the aluminum oxide tube with one end loosened for temperature sensing six fbgs are connected in series with a spacing of 20 cm the electrical resistance passes through the aluminum oxide tube in a loop for active heating the aluminum oxide tube as a proctor and heat conducting medium has high thermal conductivity and strong hardness the ah fbg sensors are efficient for soil thermophysical property and moisture field parameter measurements two ah fbg sensors were fixed in parallel with a spacing of 1 4 cm one of which worked as an actively heated sensor and the other as a t s measured sensor the ah fbg sensing points are located at depths of 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm 100 cm and 120 cm all fiber optic sensors were arranged in series to form a fiber optic cable for quasi distributed measurement of t s and θ i real time θ w was obtained using fdr probes nh148 40 manufactured by wuhan zhongke nenghui technology development co ltd with a resolution of 0 001 m3 m3 an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m3 and an operating temperature range of 40 80 more details can be found at https www nengh com productsstd 239 html five fdr probes were inserted into the ground at the corresponding depths of the measuring points of the ah fbg sensor above 100 cm depth the data collectors in this study consist of an interrogator and a data collection box the interrogator nzs fbg a02 produced by suzhou nanzee sensing co ltd was connected to all fiber optic sensors and continually read their wavelength data the data collection box was responsible for the data acquisition of fdr probes both collectors were equipped with wireless transmission modules to transmit all field data to the cloud system allowing real time remote capture of subsurface information the power supply comprises a solar panel that powers the entire system and a power transformer that acts as the heating controller to provide stable heating power for ah fbg sensors daily meteorological data were obtained from a weather station including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction net radiation and rainfall amount the sensors were deployed by digging hole installing backfilling the entire system was then set up installed and debugged in december 2020 field monitoring was performed from dec 20 2020 to mar 10 2021 the ah fbg sensor was heated four times a day and each heating cycle lasted for ten minutes at t 0 00 6 00 12 00 and 18 00 with an applied power during the heat pulses of 10 8 w m to minimize measurement errors due to heating these parameters were carefully determined based on previous researches de vries 1952 wechsler 1966 cao et al 2021 sun et al 2021 as well as experimental studies on the influence of heating on ice melting wu et al 2021a 2 3 soil temperature and moisture monitoring 2 3 1 fbg sensors for soil temperature monitoring over the past forty years a range of fiber optic sensing technologies have been developed and successfully applied for geo hydrological monitoring schenato 2017 zhang and xue 2019 among these technologies raman scattering based distributed temperature sensing dts is widely used and has shown significant potential in estimating soil moisture and groundwater flux for large scale and long distance cases selker et al 2006 bense et al 2016 del val et al 2021 however the relatively low spatial resolution and temperature measurement accuracy of dts limit the precise measurement of moisture distribution in shallow soil layers in contrast fbg sensing technology can overcome these limitations through special demodulation techniques fig 4 a illustrates the working principle of the fbg as shown in fig 4 if a bragg grating is written into a segment of a ge doped optical fiber the grating will reflect a narrow spectral part of light at a specific wavelength λ b when broadband light is injected into the fiber core zhu et al 2015 for a loose optical fiber without any strain λ b is only sensitive to the change in temperature δt which can be calculated as 1 δ t δ λ b λ b c t where δλ b is the wavelength shift and ct 1 is the wavelength sensitivity coefficient for temperature which are determined via laboratory calibration tests zhu et al 2021 equation 1 is available for temperature sensing with an accuracy of 0 1 and a range of 40 60 c an important feature of this technology is that fbgs with different λ b can be connected in series to form a quasi distributed temperature sensing array as shown in fig 4 additionally when combined with the hpp method fbg sensors can detect temperature changes in frozen soil at different depths during active heating this methodology is called actively heated fbg ah fbg sensing technology 2 3 2 combined opto electronic sensing approach for moisture monitoring of frozen soil this paper proposes a combined opto electronic sensing approach to determine the in situ θ i in a straightforward way the working principle is presented in fig 5 the improved ah fbg technology is applied here for measuring thermal conductivity λ as the fiber optic component of the proposed approach fdr technology is used to obtain θ w as the electronic component of the approach accordingly θ i can be calculated using the relationship between λ and θ w θ i specifically the combined opto electronic sensing approach involves four steps first the côté and konrad model c k model côté and konrad 2006 is selected here to describe the relationship between λ and θ w θ i this model has been successfully applied by cao et al 2021 to calculate λ of frozen soil used in this study in this model soil λ can be expressed by 2 λ s r k 2 λ s 1 n λ w θ w λ i θ i χ 10 η n 1 k 2 1 s r where s r is the degree of saturation s r θ w θ i n θ w and θ i are the volumetric contents of soil water and ice m3 m3 respectively λ w λ i λ s are the thermal conductivities of water ice and solids w m respectively n is the soil void ratio k 2 is a parameter related to the grain size distribution χ w m and η are parameters related to particle shape under frozen conditions k 2 1 7 0 95 0 85 and 0 25 are assigned for well graded gravels and coarse sands medium and fine sands silts and clays and peat respectively χ 0 75 w m c and η 1 2 are assigned to natural soils which are determined and validated by a series of experimental data in the literature côté and konrad 2011 second in situ θ w is obtained using the fdr probe which indirectly measures soil water content by determining the bulk dielectric constant from frequency variations of an electromagnetic pulse propagated into the soil third in situ λ is measured by the ah fbg sensor which is based on fbg temperature sensing technology and an infinite linear heat source model wu et al 2021b sun et al 2021 assuming that an ah fbg sensor is embedded in homogeneous soil and electrically heated for a period of time fig 5 the temperature time history curve is expressed as benítez buelga et al 2016 3 δ t t q 4 π λ ln t c where t is the heating duration s δ t t is the temperature change q is the heating power of the linear heat source w m and c is a constant related to the soil thermal diffusivity sensor radius and thermal resistance between the sensor and soil according to eq 3 the slope k of that regression can be expressed as 4 k δ t t 2 δ t t 1 ln t 2 ln t 1 where δ t t 1 and δ t t 2 are the temperature values at times t 1 and t 2 respectively if t is sufficiently large or the sensor radius is very small λ can be inferred from he et al 2018 5 λ q 4 π k eqs 4 and 5 are applied to λ determination of unfrozen and frozen soils with homogeneous properties whose accuracy has been confirmed by wu et al 2021b however it should be noted that the in situ soil temperature and physical properties are heterogeneous with depth there is not only radial heat conduction in the soil but also longitudinal heat transfer inside the ah fbg sensor tube as shown in fig 5 specifically the heating rate of the soil layer with low water content is higher than that of the soil layer with high water content leading to longitudinal heat transfer inside the sensor tube during heating processes similarly differences in initial soil temperatures also cause differences in heat flow inside the soil at different locations liu et al 2023 longitudinal heat transfer affects the temperature time history curves recorded by the fbgs and introduces errors for k and λ to reduce errors caused by longitudinal heat transfer the artificial neural network ann method is applied in this analysis as shown in fig 5 a three layer backpropagation bp neural network model containing one input layer several hidden layers and one output layer is implemented the input variables are soil temperatures of adjacent measurements t s k of adjacent measurements k a and k of measuring point k m the output variable is the corrected k of the measuring point k substituting the corrected k into eq 5 the modified λ can be obtained eliminating the influence of longitudinal heat transfer finally substituting λ obtained by ah fbg and θ w measured by fdr into the c k model eq 2 the in situ θ i of the frozen soil can be back calculated based on the results of θ i and θ w θ t can be obtained accordingly using the combined opto electronic sensing approach the critical moisture properties of in situ frozen soil can be continuously measured providing a better understanding of the thermal and hydraulic behaviors during the freeze thaw process 2 4 soil thermo hydraulic behaviors characterization fig 6 shows a schematic diagram of soil th behaviors during the ft process when the ground surface is exposed to an air temperature t a below the fp t 0 where water and ice are in equilibrium with equal free energy unsteady heat flow is initiated the freezing front progresses into the soil and the pore water is transformed into ice ice applies pressure against restraining boundaries and liquid water presents as adsorbed films and capillary water on the surfaces of soil particles in equilibrium with ice konrad and morgenstern 1980 cryosuction related to a pressure difference between ice and water leads to more water migration from the unfrozen zone into the frozen zone xu et al 2019 heat transfer accompanying water migration affects soil temperature distribution simultaneously when sufficient water accumulates an ice lens forms the thickness and spacing of the ice lenses depend on the relative magnitudes of the freezing rate and water availability penner 1961 as shown in fig 6 the zone above the freezing front is treated as the frozen fringe which is defined as the partially frozen zone between the ice lens and the warmest soil with pore ice miller 1972 the intricate internal structure of the frozen fringe presents considerable complexity as numerous physical parameters and behaviors related to the coupled soil water and heat transfer surrounding the fringe undergo significant alterations during distinct freezing stages this complexity poses a challenge to accurately determining these parameters and behaviors in this study basic parameters were obtained by field monitoring as introduced above then the th behaviors of the frozen fringe were characterized as follows first due to cryosuction the fp t in the soil under unsaturated conditions can be derived from soil moisture data the specific method is as follows dall amico et al 2011 6 t t 0 g t 0 273 15 l f φ t 0 where l f is the latent heat of ice water change j kg g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 and φ t 0 is the matric suction based on θ t which increases with decreasing θ w as ice replaces water the soil freezing process resembles the process of soil drying koopmans and miller 1966 according to the freezing drying assumption φ t 0 subjected to freezing conditions can be calculated from the swcc according to the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 7 θ t θ r θ s θ r 1 α φ t 0 n m where θ s and θ r cm3 cm3 are the saturated and residual water contents respectively and α n and m are the parameters of the model obtained by curve fitting second the sfcc of the field loess at different depths can be derived by monitoring data θ w and t s anderson and tice 1972 developed an empirical power curve to express the sfcc 8 θ w ρ d ρ w a t b where a and b are model parameters and are determined by curve fitting third the driving force of water migration the water energy state and movement direction in frozen soil are mainly determined by the soil matric suction in general known as cryosuction as shown in fig 6 under the t s gradient t s the unfrozen water adsorbed on the soil surface shows asymmetry r 1 r 2 fu et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 causing an unfrozen water imbalance and resulting in water migration migratory unfrozen water is divided into two layers film water and capillary water xu et al 2001 the matric suction is related to the pressure difference acting on the layers fig 6 which is affected by the soil temperatures and moisture contents soil matric suction φ t 0 corresponding to θ t without considering the effect of ice is unreasonable as ice pressure significantly affects the coupled th interaction alternatively the matric suction φ t of frozen soil considering ice existence and thus successfully characterizing water migration is expressed as dall amico et al 2011 9 φ t φ t ρ w l f g t 273 15 t t t t φ t 0 t t in summary the overall framework and linkage between different monitored parameters are shown in fig 7 in situ t s is used to determine whether the soil is frozen and to determine the freezing depth through its distribution the φ t related to θ i and θ w is the driving force of water migration fig 7 also shows the interactive behaviors between the physical fields the water ice phase change is controlled by the thermal field which ultimately changes the behaviors of the hydraulic field in turn the water migration accompanied by heat transport and changes in soil λ alter the t s distribution 3 results and analyses 3 1 field temperature distribution fig 8 demonstrates the variations in daily air temperature t a net radiation r n and t s distribution during the 2020 2021 winter solar radiation fluctuations cause notable changes in both t a and r n which in turn influence t s therefore these three parameters are theoretically coordinated which is also evident from the monitoring data in fig 8 in this study t a was selected for data analysis as it is more accessible in most cases fig 8 illustrates the close relationship between t s and t a as shown in fig 8 c it is clear that t s changed greater in shallower soil and was relatively stable below a depth of 80 cm the average t s at 80 cm depth was 0 45 higher than t 0 0 3 indicating that the maximum freezing depth was less than 80 cm therefore only the monitoring data above 80 cm depth were considered in the following sections 3 2 freezing depth and process considering t 0 as the freezing temperature the depth of the t 0 isotherm is the freezing depth the thickness of the dramatic phase transition zone is calculated by measuring the distance between the t 0 and t l isotherms which were extracted from fig 8 b and are shown in fig 9 a it is apparent from fig 9 a that unidirectional freezing started prior to the field monitoring period and reached its maximum level in mid january 2021 the maximum freezing depth 76 1 cm occurred on jan 22 2021 subsequently the frozen soil entered the thawing period from the upper and bottom simultaneously in early february as heat transformed from the external environment and deep soil respectively the freezing front is located at the freezing depth and the frost penetration rate r fp can be calculated as the change rate of the freezing depth with time during the ft process which is shown in fig 9 b by carefully considering the r fp and t a values the ft process can be divided into five stages as shown in table 2 and fig 9 during stage i the freezing front penetrated rapidly toward deeper soil with a higher r fp the soil above it froze quickly resulting in significant and complex changes in soil properties the field ground was then kept in a frozen state with an r fp of 1 1 cm d during stage ii and then started to thaw at stage iii with an r fp of 3 1 cm d during stages iv and v most of the monitored soil masses were under unfrozen conditions therefore to investigate the th behaviors of the frozen loess the following analyses mainly focused on the first three stages involving the freezing process 3 3 soil moisture distribution fig 10 a and b plots the θ w and θ i evolution at different depths during the first three stages as t s decreased and the frozen fringe moved deeper from 47 cm to 67 cm in stage i pore water was converted to ice resulting in a decrease in θ w and an increase in θ i although the freezing depth remained relatively stable in stage ⅱ the monitoring results suggest that migrated water froze as evidenced by a slight decrease in θ w and a continuous increase in θ i during stage iii as t s increased and the frozen soil at a depth of 0 76 1 cm started to thaw melting ice led to a decrease in θ i and an increase in θ w as θ w or θ i fails to fully characterize the phase change of in situ and migrated water separately it is necessary to identify the θ t development fig 10 c presents the variation in θ t at different depths as depicted in fig 10 c θ t at depths of 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm fluctuated greatly with the ft process θ t increased mainly at stages ⅰ remained stable at stage ⅱ and decreased at stage iii the most significant finding from fig 10 c is that the θ t changes reflected the amount of migrated water from the unfrozen zone into the frozen fringe during freezing for example θ t at 60 cm depth slightly decreased before dec 30 and abruptly increased after that this phenomenon can be explained by water migration from the unfrozen zone to the frozen fringe in fig 9 a the soil at 60 cm depth started to freeze on dec 30 and remained in the frozen fringe until stage iv consequently the unfrozen water flowed away from a depth of 60 cm and resulted in a slight decrease before this day then the water migrated to and accumulated inside the frozen fringe causing a rapid increase in θ t on dec 30 correspondingly the θ t at 80 cm depth which is always unfrozen decreased at the same time due to upward water flow from the unfrozen zone it should also be noted that there are some data gaps during the test because of system errors 3 4 in situ sfcc the sfcc is associated with the freezing temperature making it essential to determine fp first the calculated fp t at 60 cm depth is derived using eqs 6 and 7 as depicted in fig 11 multiply phenomena can be observed from fig 11 first t is characterized via field monitoring which fluctuated with changes in soil moisture as a result of the decreasing θ t t at 60 cm depth progressively declines reaching its minimum value on dec 29 once the soil started to freeze from dec 30 to feb 11 t increased rapidly to 0 32 and then remained stable second the comparison of t t 0 and t s indicates the freezing state where t 0 represents the measured fp in the laboratory when t s is higher or lower than t t 0 the soil is correspondingly unfrozen or frozen a strong consistency between t 0 and t was presented validating the use of t 0 isotherm as the freezing depth in section 3 2 however discrepancies exist between the calculated t and the actual data from dec 30 to 31 and feb 11 to 14 this deviation may be due to the complex soil properties in the dramatic phase change zone where t s is close to the freezing point shown in fig 11 nevertheless the analysis of t demonstrates that laboratory measurements of freezing points can be utilized to determine whether the soil is frozen or not in the field the sub temperature sfccs at different depths are shown in fig 12 the sfccs at different depths exhibit a significant difference particularly at a depth of 60 cm where it is higher than the other two depths however this finding differs from the sfcc characteristics observed in previous laboratory experiments where the volume of residual unfrozen water was stable and changed little with external factors tang et al 2018 this result can be attributed to several explanations 1 the concept of the sfcc is used to describe the quantity and energy status of unfrozen water at equilibrated states in frozen freezing soils where the total soil water content is constant koopmans and miller 1966 however in situ soils in the field may seldom reach thermal and hydraulic dynamic equilibrium due to transient boundary conditions such as air temperature precipitation and variable snowpack depth these conditions lead to water redistribution and changes in the total water content which can cause differences in the sfcc characteristics compared to laboratory experiments he et al 2015 2 the field t s mainly depended on air temperature and changed periodically in contrast monotonic ft cycles rarely occur in the field which differs from well controlled laboratory conditions 3 the lowest t s observed was only 1 53 at 60 cm 4 09 at 40 cm and 8 65 at 20 cm the range of t s at 60 cm depth was not wide enough to promote the water ice phase transition compared to the other depths therefore pore water still exists in liquid form resulting in inconsistencies in sfccs in summary affected by the moisture migration induced by boundary conditions and temperature fluctuation the sfcc obtained via field monitoring is different from that under the laboratory test this conclusion demonstrates the irrationality of applying laboratory results to in situ engineering case studies as the sfcc is the fundamental constitutive relationship that governs the water and heat transfer process and the th properties of frozen soils it is essential to acquire the sfccs of soils in nonequilibrium under these circumstances caution must be exercised when applying sfcc expressions developed using the clausius clapeyron equation in the field in this paper the widely used empirical power curve eq 8 was utilized and the parameters were determined through curving fitting as shown in fig 12 the empirical power curves generally exhibited good agreement with monitoring data with high r 2 which verified the feasibility of applying this model in seasonally frozen loess 3 5 thermo hydraulic redistribution fig 13 provides an intuitive representation of the measured t s and water redistribution during freezing as t s decreased from dec 20 2020 to jan 16 2021 the freezing front moved toward the deep soil and θ t above the freezing front increased correspondingly this visually illustrates the phenomenon of pore water migration upward and gathering in the frozen fringe during freezing to characterize the driving force of water transport in the frozen fringe data at 60 cm depth were selected for analysis and plotted in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 b φ t and φ t 0 increased before dec 30 indicating a gradually intensifying upward water flow correspondingly the ice saturations at 20 cm and 40 cm where the unfrozen water accumulated continued to rise simultaneously in fig 14 a however φ t and φ t 0 decreased sharply on dec 30 when the ice saturation at 60 cm depth increased rapidly this phenomenon is attributed to water migration inside the frozen fringe the most striking observation from fig 14 is the significant differences between φ t and φ t 0 with the development of the freezing process this gradually increasing gap implies the unneglected impact of ice pressure on the cryosuction effect moreover a positive correlation was found between φ t and ice saturation at 60 cm depth which further suggests that it is more reasonable to characterize water migration in frozen soil with φ t with consideration of cryosuction it is worth noting that the ice saturations were relatively stable at 20 cm and 40 cm but continued to rise at 60 cm after dec 30 this difference is possibly due to the water ice phase change which is accompanied by an increased solid phase and reduced void ratio leading to a decrease in hydraulic conductivity ji et al 2021 once the soil at a depth of 60 cm began to freeze less water could pass through hindering the continued accumulation of water above the frozen fringe therefore the migrating water accumulated in the frozen fringe and then converted to ice resulting in the rising ice saturation of the soil at a depth of 60 cm but remaining constant at depths of 20 cm and 40 cm fig 14 a the th interaction was also reflected in the synchronous change trend of t s and φ t in fig 14 b on the one hand water ice phase change and soil matric suction φ t are affected by soil temperatures as discussed earlier on the other hand the heat mass migration accompanied by water flow melts the ice inducing a thinner water film on the warmer side of the particle than on the colder side microscopically rempel et al 2001 simultaneously there is a relatively larger λ of frozen soil compared to that of unfrozen soil due to the water ice phase transition yu et al 2020 this leads to a larger t s in the frozen zones on a macro level it should be noted that in addition to water migration from the unfrozen zone infiltration due to precipitation and snowmelt as well as evaporation at the soil surface can significantly affect the distribution of soil temperature and moisture which are the two most important controls on water and energy transport between the atmosphere and the ground cuo et al 2015 however the dramatic reduction in soil permeability due to freezing will limit the infiltration depth niu and yang 2006 for regions with a small amount of winter rainfall and snowfall such as the study area in this paper it is reasonable to neglect the infiltration and evaporation effects in analyzing the coupled th redistribution of subsurface soil in summary this study investigated the soil temperature and water redistribution inside the frozen soil and their interaction using field monitoring data the results showed that the variation in φ t can effectively characterize water migration due to cryosuction 4 discussions the combined opto electronic sensing system used for field monitoring in the loess plateau has provided basic parameters t s θ w θ i θ t of seasonally frozen loess however the accuracy of field monitoring data can be affected by several factors the sources of error can generally be categorized into two aspects the special features of loess and imperfections in the monitoring schemes 4 1 errors from features of loess the first factor is the effect of frost on soil structure loess is composed of unsaturated loose silt size aggregates with micropores and vertical capillaries during the freezing process ice crystals formed by the ice water phase change are unevenly distributed in the pores influencing soil structure development consolidation deformation and particle translocation van vliet lano 2010 fig 15 a shows the excavated loess with pores and ice crystals easily observable on the soil surface additionally ice segregation usually in the form of a lens can open shrink fissures in the unfrozen substratum van vliet lano 2010 cracks fig 15 b and c along the depth cause unavoidable unevenness in soil properties although loess is typically considered homogeneous the growth of ice crystals and vertical fissures weaken this feature to a certain extent this soil structural property inhomogeneity affects the heat and moisture transfer characteristics ultimately reducing the accuracy of field monitoring the second factor is the ft environment as shown in fig 15 d t s fluctuated with the change between day and night which is equivalent to a short ft process especially in the shallowly buried soil layer the effect of ft cycles on soil composition and physical properties e g thermal conductivities elastic modulus effective cohesion etc has been confirmed li et al 2020 with the number of cycles being an important factor as the number of cycles increases changes in soil physical parameters become more significant unless the number exceeds a certain threshold value wu et al 2021c thus multiple ft cycles over time accompanied by soil property changes in this study could introduce some errors into moisture monitoring however since the impact of ft cycles on the characteristic variables mainly exists in the first ft cycle the errors would not be too notable to affect monitoring reliability 4 2 errors from monitoring schemes the imperfection of the monitoring schemes can be categorized into three aspects first a phase change can be caused by active heating for one heating period fig 15 e shows the temperature changes of the measured ah fbg sensors located 1 4 cm away from the active heated sensor the maximum temperature rise was up to 1 7 indicating possible ice melting during heating this is especially true for the soil in the dramatic phase change zone which is extremely sensitive to temperature the soil composition and properties changed significantly due to heating and heat transfer thus making it difficult to accurately measure ice content however a temperature change of 1 7 would not lead to severe phase changes in frozen soil at low temperatures second there were missing data between quasi distributed measurement points it is known that the parameters at the freezing front are more meaningful where the water moves and gathers in this study the distance 20 cm between adjacent measuring points failed to keep track of the dynamics of the freezing front possibly leading to key information loss for example the freezing depth was between 60 and 80 cm for nearly forty days from dec 29 2020 to feb 16 2021 and the measuring points located at 60 cm and 80 cm could not accurately capture the data of the freezing front resulting in errors in the analysis of th behavior last but not least there were some issues with the monitoring time the monitoring started on dec 20 2020 when the shallow soil had already frozen and the freezing depth was 47 3 cm as shown in fig 9 a therefore the monitoring failed to capture the complete freezing process and the shallow monitoring points failed to capture critical information in the frost fringe for analysis as a result there were not enough valid data to better reveal the mechanism of cryosuction in summary various natural and system factors introduce a certain degree of uncertainty to the monitoring process to mitigate these uncertainties several measures can be implemented such as 1 utilizing artificial intelligence methods to correct natural errors which may be a viable approach 2 enhancing the experimental setup by decreasing the distance between monitoring points at crucial locations and extending the monitoring duration to capture more significant and comprehensive information and 3 advancing theoretical improvements for moisture parameter measurements particularly the measurement of frozen soil ice content in the dramatic phase transition zone characterized by unstable properties 5 conclusions this paper presents the field monitoring and assessment of the thermo hydraulic th behaviors of frozen loess using a quasi distributed opto electronic sensing system the system involves a novel combined opto electronic sensing approach capable of measuring in situ soil temperature t s unfrozen water content θ w and ice content θ i by employing the system in the loess plateau china the freezing thawing ft process was observed and the thermo hydraulic th behaviors were characterized through multivariable monitoring of subsurface soil the following conclusions are drawn in this study 1 the effectiveness of the combined opto electronic sensing system was confirmed by field monitoring the in situ θ i considering ice water coexistence and heterogeneity of in situ t s and physical properties along with depth was successfully obtained the distribution of soil moisture was further quantitatively characterized providing critical parameters for the analysis of the ft process 2 multivariable monitoring of in situ loess revealed unidirectional freezing and bidirectional melting processes in the 2020 2021 winter the soil temperature and water redistribution as well as their interaction during the rapid freezing stage were well illustrated through field monitoring 3 the soil freezing point τ fluctuated with moisture content due to cryosuction comparing τ with the soil freezing point τ 0 obtained in the laboratory illustrates that laboratory measurements of the freezing point are applicable to assess whether the soil is frozen or not as well as to determine the freezing depth in the field 4 the observed sfccs differ at various depths and deviate from those measured in the laboratory emphasizing the significance of accurately obtaining in situ sfccs for field engineering case studies the feasibility of using the empirical power curve to represent the sfcc has been confirmed as indicated by a high r 2 value 5 the influence of ice pressure on the cryosuction effect has been confirmed to be non negligible soil matric suction considering the presence of ice has been effectively demonstrated to characterize water migration in frozen soil the present study illustrates that opto electronic sensing opens a window for understanding the th coupling and ft mechanism of frozen loess the potential of this methodology warrants further exploration nevertheless certain challenges remain to be addressed such as changes in soil properties during multiple ft cycles and phase change effects induced by active heating future research should focus on more in depth theoretical analyses and technical enhancements to establish a robust th monitoring network through these efforts valuable insights can be gained for geohazard mitigation in cold regions credit authorship contribution statement hong hu zhu conceptualization

1809,to develop effective adaptation strategies for climate change particularly in regions where water is scarce it is crucial to comprehend and quantify how hydrological responses are influenced by anthropogenic activities and climate change the primary concern nowadays is to identify the hydrologic sensitive and resilient catchment under these diverse conditions thus a framework is developed in this study to analyse the hydrologic sensitivity and resiliency of a catchment incorporating the elasticity based budyko approach the developed framework is applied to three neighbouring catchments brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha in eastern india that have received less attention in light of resiliency and sensitivity perspectives the budyko approach is first applied using hydro climatic records of historical phase 1979 2018 and then extended for future phase 2025 2064 under four different shared socioeconomic pathways ssps 1 2 6 2 4 5 3 7 0 and 5 8 5 of coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 projections which will provide new insights to the hydrological community the results highlight that streamflow variations of the subarnarekha is more sensitive to anthropogenic activities in all time phases in contrast the brahmani and baitarani are more sensitive to climate change in future phases during historical phase the brahmani and baitarani are identified to be resilient catchments with high water yield and dry climate whereas the subarnarekha is found to be sensitive catchment exhibiting low water yield and dry climate however in future phase all three catchments are predicted to be resilient characterized by high water yield and wet climate the major inference from this study is excess anthropogenic activities can disrupt the anticipated hydrological functioning of a catchment particularly under critical climatic conditions which can result in decreasing hydrological resiliency the finding of this study mainly highlights the response of a hydrological system to climate change and anthropogenic activities to explore the approach of sensitivity and resiliency from a socio hydrological perspective keywords budyko method climate change anthropogenic activities hydrologic sensitivity hydrologic resiliency cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 drivers of streamflow variations and their attribution analysis water resources the interdisciplinary domain of hydrology climate sciences and anthropogenic activities are essential for sustainable development and resilience of the earth however climate change and anthropogenic activity two of the most important aspects have a direct impact on the hydrological cycle requiring more reliable planning and utilisation of water resources piao et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 in this context anticipating the hydrological response to climate change and anthropogenic has become an emerging challenge ma et al 2015 wang and stephenson 2018 additionally global warming has emerged as one of the most catastrophic environmental issues towards the end of the century bonneuil et al 2021 abbass et al 2022 further with the intense industrialization and social economic advancement the impact of anthropogenic activities became even more pronounced leading to a spate of environmental and ecological concerns such as global soil degradation animal habitat loss and so forth reyilai et al 2016 as a result this anthropogenic stress on the ecological systems has reached a stage where abrupt environmental change is suspected and global sustainability has become a mere realistic option d odorico et al 2018 therefore with the uncertain aspects of future climate it is critical to comprehend the dynamics of human water connection i e socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2014 as a criterion of sustainable hydrological responses to these altering variables catchment resilience is therefore an alarming concern for hydrologists and needs to be explored conceptually with practical significance streamflow the fundamental component of the hydrology cycle is the reflection of several hydrological processes notably climatic forcing precipitation and temperature catchmentmorphology slope and elevation subsurface geology and anthropogenic activity construction of reservoir dam land use changes and excessive water extraction swain et al 2020 the influence of the aforementioned drivers on significant variations in the streamflow patterns of worldwide catchments is documented earlier swain et al 2021 several methodologies have been developed over time in previous studies to implement attribution analysis of climate change and anthropogenic activities on streamflow variations including paired catchment approach empirically statistical approach elasticity or sensitivity based approach eco hydrological approach decomposition approach and physically based hydrological modelling approach gao et al 2016 dey and mishra 2017 for the last few decades hydrologists have used the conceptual budyko framework budyko 1948 1974 to understand how water and energy are related to the land surface considering the water and energy limits of evaporation the purpose of the budyko framework is to comprehend the underlying physical and hydrological mechanisms of the catchment locations in the budyko domain wang and hejazi 2011 berghuijs et al 2020 gan et al 2021 and to develop the stochastic and deterministic methods for evaluating the sensitivity of streamflow variations to climatic change and basin characteristics liu et al 2019 chen et al 2021 concerning evapotranspiration and discharge the budyko framework depicts the link between precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pet and actual evapotranspiration aet it signifies that as the aridity index ai which is denoted by pet p increases the component of precipitation segregated to streamflow decreases sposito 2017 and also explains the significance of the evaporative index ei which is denoted by aet p the ability of the catchments to preserve this functioning as predicted by the budyko curve following disruptions is defined as resilience creed et al 2014 though resiliency is typically characterised as a system s ability to absorb disruption without affecting its function or structure walker and salt 2017 hydrologic resiliency can be defined as a set of systematic properties with three dimensional concepts i e absorptive adaptive and transformative from the perspective of a hydrologic system mao et al 2017 the linking of resiliency and catchment hydrology with the budyko framework is justified in previous studies creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 sinha et al 2018 further two quantitative metrics have been developed dynamic deviation d which indicates the change in ei of a catchment concerning the budyko curve as climate changes and elasticity e which measures the ability of a catchment to maintain water partitioning constant with the budyko curve as climate changes in this sense hydrologic sensitivity is the converse of elasticity and can be used to identify unstable hydrologic catchments domínguez tuda and gutiérrez jurado 2021 even if prior studies used resiliency concepts at basin scale attribution analysis to determine whether it is resistant to human activities or climate change sinha et al 2018 gleeson et al 2020 omer et al 2020 wamucii et al 2021 cao et al 2022 only a few studies have focused on the idea of hydrologic sensitivity in light of climate change and anthropogenic stress domínguez tuda and gutiérrez jurado 2021 therefore analysing the changes in hydrologic response with variations in climatic forcing and anthropogenic stress is a way to identify the catchments where hydrologic patterns are altering to define the sensitivity and resiliency of a catchment 1 2 scope of this study until now the developed methods in earlier studies only represented the resiliency of a catchment considering the changes in hydrologic responses due to climate variability and intense anthropogenic activities by incorporating the elasticity concept however the identification and significance of sensitive catchments are less explored in general the address of the resiliency and sensitivity of a catchment in the future climate is limited based on the above critical appraisal the present study aims to analyse the hydrologic sensitivity and resiliency of three neighbouring eastern india catchments incorporating the conceptual budyko framework the resiliency and sensitivity of the study area are further assessed in the future population exposure employing the bias corrected general circulation model gcm outputs of coupled model intercomparison project 6 cmip6 experiments under four different shared socioeconomic pathways ssps climate change scenarios these ssps are ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the entire analysis is presented for 40 years of the observed climate historical phase 1979 2018 and the projected climate future phase 2020 2059 the layout overall methodology framework is outlined in fig 1 in this study we aim to address the following research questions 1 how to deal with multiple change points in the hydro climatic variables of a catchment to analyse the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities 2 how to address the attributions of anthropogenic activities along with climate change on streamflow variations when information related to anthropogenic activities in the catchment is limited 3 how to identify the most hydrologic sensitive and resilient catchment when the study area is subjected to diverse hydro climatic variations and 4 how a socio hydrological system responds to disruption and future uncertainty making now an ideal opportunity to investigate the approach of sensitivity and resiliency from a socio hydrological perspective 2 methodology 2 1 change point analysis method to detect the abrupt change and its significance in the hydro climatic variables precipitation temperature and streamflow the sequential version of the mann kendall test is applied sneyers 1990 douglas et al 2000 zhao et al 2015 nourani et al 2018 the forward sequential values of the test statistic u d j are calculated as 1 u d j d j e d j var d j where e d j and var d j are mean and variance of the test statistic d j given by 2 d j 1 j n j the values of x j mean time series j 1 n are compared with x i i 1 j 1 at each comparison the number of cases x j x i is counted and denoted as n j the sequence of u d j is termed as a forward series the same method is then applied to the inversed series to get a backward sequence the abrupt shifts in the observed variables are the intersection of the forward series and backward series with the highest significance value which is found between the confidence intervals based on the breakpoint with a high significance value the study period is divided into a baseline and an impacted period 2 2 conceptualization of the budyko framework the budyko curve is developed by many researchers with practical applications to date schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 turc 1954 pike 1964 fu 1981 the conceptual budyko hypothesis is introduced to study the potential impacts of changing climate and human activities on mean annual streamflow variations budyko 1974 the budyko approach explains the catchment scale long term water balance concept the conceptual water balance equation for a long term period is given by 3 ds dt p q a e t where p is the mean annual precipitation q total streamflow of a catchment aet is the actual evapotranspiration from the catchment and ds dt is the change in water storage per time step however for a long analysis period say 5 10 years the soil water storage is assumed to be a steady state condition i e ds dt 0 tekleab et al 2011 sinha et al 2018 further using the budyko developed relation of ai represents climate condition ei represents hydrologic response and catchment characteristics ω the budyko type equation used in this study is given by 4 aet p 1 pet p 1 pet p 1 ω the budyko approach is based on the principle of water and energy limits total available energy limits evapotranspiration in a humid state ai less than 1 and water availability limits evapotranspiration in an arid state ai 1 the conceptual representation of the budyko curve along with variations of ai and ei are shown in fig 2 a researchers have included catchment factors including vegetation type soil qualities and topography into water balance and proposed formulation with a parameter to describe the budyko framework zhang et al 2001 fu et al 2007 yang et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 using the related budyko type equations as outlined in table 1 these parameters can be estimated using long term discharge precipitation and pet quantities while accounting for a negligible change in water storage under the budyko type equation two separation approaches are developed so far to quantify the potential contributions of climate change and human activities jiang et al 2015 these approaches are outlined as the sensitivity elasticity approach and decomposition approach schaake and waggoner 1990 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 the elasticity based approach evaluates the sensitivity of streamflow variation to the change in climate variables using streamflow elasticity coefficients while the decomposition approach estimates the relative contributions independently without using any sensitivity coefficients sinha et al 2018 the elasticity based budyko approach integrating the non parametric and analytical methods uses the elasticity coefficients that are determined from the observed hydro climatic variables empirically sankarasubramanian et al 2001 for analysing the effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration on streamflow variation an analytical elasticity based budyko hypothesis is proposed arora 2002 the detailed algorithm used in this study is outlined in subsequent steps i streamflow elasticity coefficient analysis the conceptual budyko curve depicts the predictability of responses of a catchment to changing climate the parametric budyko equations incorporate basin properties into the budyko framework enabling a more accurate depiction of precipitation segregation thus the equation given by fu 1981 is selected for this analysis out of eight available budyko formulations highlighted in table 1 the formulation given by fu 1981 considers a parametric function ω which represents the vegetation cover of a catchment following gao et al 2016 the interlinking of long term water balance components is expressed by 5 q p a e t p p f ϕ where f ϕ is the function of aet p further assuming p pet and ω as independent variables the total differential reflecting the variations in streamflow due to climate change is stated as 6 d q c q c p d p q c p e t d p e t further the relative variation in streamflow is expressed as 7 d q c q p q q c p dp p pet q q c p d p e t pet 8 d q c θ p dp p θ pet d p e t pet where θ p and θ pet are the elasticity coefficients of streamflow to precipitation and pet respectively these elasticity coefficients are estimated as follows 9 θ p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ 10 θ pet ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ as the θ p θ pet 1 from eq 9 and 10 the streamflow variations due to changing climate cc is given by 11 δ q cc θ p δ p p θ pet δ p e t pet q where δ p and δ p e t are the changes in average annual precipitation and average annual potential evapotranspiration from the baseline period to the impacted period θ p δ p p q and θ pet δ p e t pet q are the variation in streamflow due to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration changes respectively ii analysis of streamflow variation attributions using the results of abrupt change analysis the study period is divided into two sub periods baseline period and assessment period usually the baseline signifies less anthropogenic stress in that period therefore the total streamflow variation is expressed as 12 δ q t q ip q bp 13 δ q t δ q cc δ q aa δ q p δ q pet δ q aa where δ q t is the total streamflow variations q ip and q bp are the average annual streamflow of impacted and baseline periods respectively δ q cc δ q aa δ q p and δ q pet are the changes in streamflow due to climate change anthropogenic activities precipitation and pet respectively further the relative contributions of precipitation λ p pet λ pet and anthropogenic activities λ aa to streamflow change are calculated as 14 λ p δ q p δ q t 100 15 λ pet δ q pet δ q t 100 16 λ aa δ q aa δ q t 100 2 3 formulation of hydrologic sensitivity and resiliency a new concept is presented in this study to define the most sensitive or resilient hydrologic catchment based on the variation of ei and ai the hydrologic sensitivity h s is portrayed by variation in ei to ai from the impacted period to the baseline period and expressed as 17 h s δ e i δ a i e i ip e i bp a i ip a i bp where the sensitive catchment is indicated as h s 1 the most resilient catchment is represented when h s 1 it is noteworthy that this method represents the resiliency and sensitivity of a catchment irrespective of wet and dry conditions present in the baseline and impacted period further the catchment conditions in light of hydrologic response variation and changing climate are represented in fig 2 b and 2 c here the hydrologic response is illustrated through variation in water yield climate change is presented in terms of the cool wet and warm dry periods in the figure hydrologic sensitivity is represented by coloured quadrants red and green or yellow and blue the coloured area shows the relation of interannual absolute changes in ei δei and ai δai which signifies h s 1 the remaining regions represent the resilient area the figure has four quadrants portraying the possible directions of climate change and hydrologic response variation water yield the significance of each quadrant is given as follows i δ e i δ a i low water yield and dry climate i i δ e i δ a i low water yield and wet climate i i i δ e i δ a i high water yield and wet climate i v δ e i δ a i high water yield and dry climate 3 study area and data sources 3 1 background of the study area three interstate neighbouring catchments brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha of eastern india are selected for this study fig 3 the subarnarekha catchment 19 121 km2 is located in eastern india and is 442 km long stretching from 20 29 n to 23 00 n in latitude and 85 00 e to 87 53 e in longitude this basin is adjacent to the brahmani catchment 36 800 km2 which is 799 km long and extends from 20 28 n to 23 35 n in latitude and 83 52 e to 87 50 e in longitude the brahmani catchment along with the baitarani catchment 12 094 km2 which is 360 km long and stretches from 20 30 n to 22 20 n in latitude and 85 05 e to 87 05 e in longitude drains into the bay of bengal these are the major catchments of eastern india spanning over jharkhand odisha chhattisgarh and west bengal states and known for significant contributions to agriculture fisheries and industrial sectors the land use types of the study area are agricultural land water bodies fallow and wasteland forest class and developed urban land visakh et al 2019 deb et al 2021 the anthropogenic activities like the rengali reservoir and salandi dam are located upstream of jenapur and anandapur gauging stations of the brahmani and baitarani catchments swain et al 2020 within the subarnarekha catchment the getalsud reservoir is there at upstream of muri and the chandil reservoir located between muri and jamshedpur gauging location is also present singh giri 2018 hence it provides an interesting research opportunity to explore streamflow changes due to climate change and anthropogenic activities that are likely to affect the flow regimes of the study area since these catchments are in the subtropical monsoon climate zone annual report 2011 12 the monsoon months june july august and september are the primary source of precipitation 80 on an annual scale these catchments are reported as flood prone catchments of india in earlier studies rai et al 2018 dahm et al 2019 gaur et al 2021 however these catchments as a part of central northeast india are classified as drought prone areas due to increased drought occurrences and their magnitudes in future climate change scenarios ojha et al 2013 bisht et al 2019 suman and maity 2021 hence the study of catchment resiliency in light of these diverse extreme events is a contemporary challenge in the present scenarios which needs to be addressed in a futuristic way 3 2 historical hydro climatic data sources the main data required for this analysis are precipitation temperature streamflow aet and pet the observed climatic variables precipitation min and max temperature are obtained on a daily scale from the india meteorological department imd pune rajeevan et al 2006 pai et al 2015 which have been earlier used for attribution analysis of climate change and land use variation on streamflow at different regional scales chawla and mujumdar 2015 sinha et al 2018 swain et al 2021 the daily observed streamflow data is collected from the central water commission cwc bhubaneswar for the gauging stations the aet and pet data are obtained from calibrated soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model the details of the input data required model calibration and validation are explained by swain et al 2020 the swat setups of the study area are calibrated and validated separately at a monthly timescale the gauging stations considered for the brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha catchments are jenapur anandapur and ghatshila respectively the best fit model parameters and model performances are outlined in table s1 and figure s1 which are provided in supporting information 3 3 future climatic data sources the sensitivity and resiliency analysis in the future time phase is carried out using the gcm data of cmip6 experiments the future analysis is mainly presented in ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios which reflect different socio economic families namely sustainability middle of the road regional rivalry and fossil fuel development respectively meinshausen et al 2020 the precipitation maximum and minimum temperature outputs from cmip6 are applied in this study which is bias corrected by empirical quantile mapping eqm method and available in 0 25 x 0 25 lon spatial resolution mishra et al 2020 these datasets are available at https zenodo org record 3873998 y5jkfxzbw2w these bias corrected future datasets are widely used for extreme climatic event analysis dixit et al 2022 pandey et al 2022 samantaray et al 2022 das et al 2023 however the future perspective of hydrologic sensitivity and resiliency is not explored in cmip6 experiments out of the 13 available gcms the ec earth3 model is chosen for this study as it has been reported to be more suitable for the study area and its nearby catchments than the other models mahato et al 2022 reddy saravanan 2023 fig 4 illustrates the annual precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum of imd and ec earth3 models from 1979 to 2014 to visually represent the spread and skewness of these variables this visualization provides a comprehensive understanding of how these variables vary over time in both models the observations indicate that the maximum and minimum temperatures of the brahmani and subarnarekha catchments appear to be higher in the ec earth3 model than in the imd however there is a good agreement in the variation of precipitation between the imd data and ec earth3 model data for all three catchments thus the selected model is considered to represent the future resilient and sensitive catchment the years 2020 to 2059 are taken as the future phase in this study using the best fit model parameters as given in table s1 the calibrated swat models are simulated for future ssps employing precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum of the selected ec earth3 model to obtain future pet aet and streamflow 4 results and discussion 4 1 change point detection analysis as this study aims to present the attribution analysis of climate change and anthropogenic activities on streamflow variations the presence of abrupt change is detected in the streamflow variables for the study area employing the sq mann kendall test the test statistics for the streamflow of the study area are outlined in table 2 six shift points in total are identified in the streamflow of the brahmani catchment with the changing point years being 1981 1985 1993 1994 2011 and 2013 a total of eight change points are detected in the baitarani catchment the corresponding changing point years are 1982 1983 1987 1990 1993 1994 2003 and 2006 however only three change points are noticed in the subarnarekha catchment and those are 1984 2004 and 2007 the highest significance value is noted in the year 2007 with the estimated significance value αe of 1 43 while the observed highest significance value is in 1994 for the brahmani αe 1 92 and baitarani αe 1 64 catchments further the abrupt changes in average annual precipitation and annual mean temperature is performed using the sq mann kendall test to compare the above results of streamflow which are presented in fig 5 in the year 1994 the brahmani catchment shows a common change point for all three hydro climatic variables streamflow precipitation and mean temperature the mean temperature of the baitarani catchment indicates the year 1994 as a common change point with the streamflow whereas no change points are detected in the precipitation similarly the precipitation and streamflow of the subarnarekha catchment are showing a common change point in the year 2007 following these change point analyses the entire study period is parted into two sub periods i e the period before the abrupt shift is the baseline period and the period after that is considered to be an impacted period thus the historical phase 1979 2018 is divided into two sub periods for further attribution analysis the years 1979 to 1994 are assumed as the baseline period while the years 1995 to 2018 are taken as the impacted period in the brahmani and baitarani catchments for the subarnarekha catchment the baseline period is from 1979 to 2007 and the rest years are the impacted period 2008 2018 the hydro climatic variations with a linear trend line are shown for these periods along with four ssps 1 2 6 2 4 5 3 7 0 and 5 8 5 are shown in fig 6 the trend analysis is performed at a 5 significance level in the figure the symbol δ represents the slope of the trend a positive value of δ indicates an upward trend whereas a negative value indicates a downward trend the p value shown in the plot is the estimated significance value from the figure it can be observed that there is a significant trend in the streamflow during the baseline period with an estimated p value of 0 023 for the brahmani catchment under the ssp5 8 5 scenario both precipitation and streamflow are exhibiting a significant upward trend with p values of 0 026 and 0 007 respectively similar to the brahmani catchment the baitarani catchment is also exhibiting a significant upward trend under the ssp5 8 5 scenario with an estimated p value of around 0 02 however there is no significant trend is found in the subarnarekha catchment even though no significant trend is observed the fluctuations in hydro climatic variables upward and downward are still worth studying as they can have an impact on catchment responses as well as on attribution analysis swain et al 2021 4 2 attribution analysis of streamflow variations water energy based budyko approach is used in this study for climate change and human activities attribution analysis in the brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha catchments the long term precipitation pet and streamflow are considered for this analysis following the water energy balance principle precipitation in a catchment is partitioned into evapotranspiration and streamflow initially it is assumed that the hydrological response of a catchment is controlled by the climate variables precipitation and temperature further it is modified by including the basin characteristics as a controlling factor for variation in hydrologic responses using the budyko algorithms of eq 4 to 16 the elasticity coefficients of streamflow variations to precipitation θ p and pet θ pet to streamflow variations are evaluated and the values are presented in table 3 the summation of elasticity coefficient values should be 1 as discussed in the conceptualization of the budyko framework section in our study θ p is 2 02 and θ pet is 1 02 for the brahmani catchment in the historical phase for the baitarani catchment θ p is 1 97 and θ pet is 0 97 while these values are 1 85 and 0 85 for the subarnarekha catchment similarly the summation of the obtained θ p and θ pet are observed to be 1 in future scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp 5 8 5 for all three catchments thus the type of budyko framework selected for this analysis i e fu 1981 is suitable for the brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha catchments the contribution of precipitation pet and human activities to the streamflow variations for both historical and future phases are shown in fig 7 a positive value indicates the contribution to the increase in streamflow while a negative value suggests the contribution towards a decrease in streamflow the contribution results show that brahmani and subarnarekha catchments are more sensitive to anthropogenic activities in the historical phase the λ aa for the brahmani catchment is 66 11 while for the subarnarekha catchment it is 79 66 change in catchment properties is thus found to be the major driver of the variations in the observed streamflow for these two catchments in contrast to anthropogenic activities climate change is found to have comparatively less contribution to the streamflow variations in the brahmani and subarnarekha catchments climate change λ p λ pet is observed to contribute 33 90 in the brahmani catchment and 20 34 in the subarnarekha catchment in the future phase the streamflow of the brahmani catchment is increasing as compared to the historical phase while in the subranarekha catchment the streamflow is decreasing in the ssp1 2 6 scenario of the brahmani catchment there is a significant contribution in streamflow variation from precipitation λ p 66 76 as compared to pet λ pet 31 66 and anthropogenic activities λ aa 1 58 in contrast there is a moderate contribution of precipitation λ p 44 62 and 53 63 respectively and human activities λ aa 43 36 and 35 77 respectively to streamflow variations and a minor from pet λ pet less than13 in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios in the ssp5 8 5 scenario there is a notable contribution from anthropogenic activities λ aa 49 78 followed by precipitation λ p 40 12 while slight from pet λ pet 10 10 under ssp1 2 6 there are positive contributions observed from both precipitation λ p and pet λ pet by 35 41 and 6 01 respectively while negative contributions from anthropogenic activities λ aa by 58 58 to streamflow variation of the subarnarekha catchment similar trends are observed under other scenarios ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 where streamflow variations are attributed to positive contributions of precipitation and pet while negatively affected by human activities the results of the baitarani catchment showed that there is a 32 2 contribution of precipitation to streamflow variations during the historical period additionally there is a 17 66 contribution of pet which can be attributed to increasing temperatures and other climatic factors on the other hand there is a negative contribution of 50 14 from anthropogenic activities in the catchment during the same period however in future scenarios the results of attribution analysis are more complex and different in the specific scenario with a decrease in streamflow in ssp1 2 6 the contributions of both precipitation λ p and pet λ pet are suggesting an increase in streamflow in ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 the contribution of pet is dominant as compared to p λ p and anthropogenic activities λ aa in ssp5 8 5 there is an increase in contributions of precipitation λ p and pet λ pet indicating an increase in streamflow these results suggest that future changes in streamflow in the study area are strongly influenced by the interplay between precipitation pet and anthropogenic activities which are in turn affected by different socio economic scenarios this implies that the effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change on streamflow vary across different catchments and time frames and indicating the need for water management strategies that account for spatial and temporal variations of these drivers 4 3 resiliency metrics of the study area the aridity index ai and the evaporative index ei are calculated using precipitation pet and aet of the study area the variations of these two indices are summarised in table 4 for both historical and future scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp 5 8 5 it is observed that the ai which represents the climate condition of a catchment is higher than the ei for the brahmani and baitarani catchment in the historical phase the estimated ai 0 9 in the baseline and impacted periods implies that both the catchments are very close to the water limited region arid region as portrayed in fig 3 based on the variations of ai and ei values from the assessment period to the impacted period the hydrologic sensitivity hs value is found to be 0 50 for the brahmani catchment and 0 73 for the baitarani catchment the estimated hs value of less than 1 signifies that both catchments are resilient however the estimated eis of the baseline and impacted periods are 1 for the subarnarekha catchment which indicates that the catchment is in the water limited region arid region the value of hs is 4 60 which is 1 indicating that the subarnarekha catchment is sensitive in the historical phase the future scenarios show that all catchments have hs values less than 1 indicating that they are resilient catchments in all four ssps of the future phase when compared to the historical phase the change in ai and ei over both historical and future scenarios are presented in fig 8 the change of ei in the brahmani catchment is 0 007 whereas the change in ai is 0 015 similarly for the baitarani catchment the estimated δei and δai values are 0 003 and 0 003 respectively this signifies that the brahmani and baitarani catchments lie in high water yield and dry climate zone as shown in fig 2 the reason is when the deviation in ei is positive δei i e more aet the water yield is low q the amount of water remaining on the surface of the catchment after evapotranspiration and when the deviation in ei is negative δei i e less aet the water yield is high q a catchment has high elasticity to climate change and anthropogenic activities when there is a small deviation in ei relative to the change in ai and that is identified as a resilient condition as well however the subarnarekha catchment lies in low water yield and dry climate with positive ei and ai deviations in the historical phase in the future scenarios negative deviations in ei and ai are observed in all three catchments indicating that they will tend to have high water yield with a wet climate in all four ssps of the future phase when compared to the historical phase 4 4 implication and scope of this study this study extended the conceptual budyko framework to identify the resilient and sensitive catchment at a regional scale focusing on the eastern india catchments the selected catchments i e brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha are rain fed ones and the major source of agricultural water demand das et al 2018 compared to other available studies on the application of budyko analysis at the indian scale this study highlights the identification of sensitivity and resiliency based on the hydrologic sensitivity parameter the simplicity of the conceptual budyko framework makes it more feasible to incorporate than other available large scale hydrological models greve et al 2020 the findings of this study can be beneficial in assessing the complex interaction between climate and watershed characteristics and how they collectively influence catchment hydrology additionally this study will provide a scientific reference for the potential hydrological changes that can occur based on specific catchment parameters and climate conditions it is a recent study to analyse variations in catchment scale hydrological responses in the context of watershed resiliency under multiple ssps of recently updated cmip6 gcms the findings from the attribution analysis of this study suggest that the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities varied across the catchments in the brahmani and baitarani catchments climate change is observed to be a major contributing factor in streamflow variation an earlier study revealed that has played a crucial role in hydrological changes of the brahmani and baitarani catchments swain et al 2020 on the other hand land use change is the primary driver of hydrological changes in the subarnarekha catchment which is one of the major categories of anthropogenic activities in the historical phase the study of gaur et al 2021 observed that the subarnarekha catchment has undergone significant and rapid lulc changes over the last several decades along with climate change in addition to this the subarnarekha catchment is highly vulnerable to various anthropogenic activities including deforestation overgrazing poor farming practices and lack of proper runoff storage kumari pandey 2022 furthermore this study highlights the significance of ai and ei variations for historical and future time phases it is worth mentioning that regardless of the wet and dry conditions prevailing during the considered period ai and ei variations show the resiliency and sensitivity of a catchment effectively an earlier study on catchment resilience in india found that in the historical phase 1988 2011 the brahmani and baitarani catchments were resilient while the subarnarekha catchment was non resilient sinha et al 2018 even their study showed that watershed characteristics considered as anthropogenic activities have a significant impact on the water balance of these catchments as evidenced by the high ai values observed in each of them the current study also noticed similar results with anthropogenic activities making significant contributions to hydrological changes in the respective catchments as observed in trend analysis in our study increasing trends of precipitation decreasing trends in actual evapotranspiration aet and potential evapotranspiration pet in some ssp scenarios which could lead to an increase in streamflow may be the reason for high water yield and wet climate in future scenarios the significance of high water yield and wet climate in future ssps could be a concern for flood related hazards and needs to be explored in future scenarios thus the analysis of the hydrological response of a catchment to climate change and anthropogenic activities is necessary for sustainable socio hydrological development this study acknowledges that uncertainties in the analysis may impact the accuracy of parameter quantification in the development of the contribution analysis framework climatic variability and anthropogenic activities are treated as independent factors however it is important to note that the relationship between these two is complex and interdependent as they both contribute to hydrological systems the elasticity based method applied to the budyko hypothesis assumes that long term soil water storage changes are negligible however this parameter is dependent on the geological and soil properties of a catchment and there is no definitive evidence to support this assumption wu et al 2017 the inclusion of additional factors such as groundwater storage to attribution analysis may have a secondary impact on the variability of streamflow de lavenne et al 2022 human interference such as water withdrawals inflows and water management practices can further alter the pattern of streamflow variability which is not considered in this study it is important to note that anthropogenic activities encompass a wide range of practices and therefore it is essential to differentiate and quantify their relative effects on hydrological changes in catchments sinha et al 2018 however obtaining such distinction requires a large amount of data which is one of the major challenges for research in india consideration of future land use changes can be integrated with this framework to predict the hydrological changes under future land use change scenarios 5 conclusions in this study the elasticity based budyko conceptual approach is applied in brhamni baitarani and subarnarekha catchment to study the hydrologic resiliency and sensitivity considering observed hydro climatic records from 1979 to 2018 the applicability of the budyko approach is analyzed in the historical phase then the framework is employed to study the hydrologic resiliency and sensitivity in the future phase 2025 2064 under four diverse ssps 1 2 6 2 4 5 3 7 0 and 5 8 5 of ec earth3 projections from cmip6 the major conclusions from this study are as follows 1 the sequential mann kendall test results are convincing since it detects multiple change points by generating forward and backward series from the available hydro climatic data the highest significance value which is a common point for maximum variables is selected as the change point of the study area the year 1994 is observed to be a change point in the brahmani and baitarani catchment while the year 2007 is for the subarnarekha catchment 2 the contributions of anthropogenic activities are noticed to have more contributions to the streamflow variation in all three catchments 3 the future streamflow variations in the subarnarekha catchment are more sensitive to anthropogenic activities in all ssp scenarios while the brahamni and baitarani catchments are sensitive to climate change 4 the brahmani and baitarani catchment is identified to be a resilient catchment with high water yield and dry climate in the historical phase however the subarnarekha catchment is observed to be a sensitive one with low water yield and a dry climate 5 in the future phase all three catchments are found to be resilient with high water yield and a wet climate the findings of the study are helpful to hydrologists as they provide valuable insights into the hydrologic resiliency and sensitivity of the three neighbouring catchments under different climatic and anthropogenic scenarios the analysis of the contributions of anthropogenic activities to streamflow variations is useful to prioritize actions for reducing the impact of human activities on water resources the identification of resilient and sensitive catchments can help to focus attention on vulnerable areas that may require special management practices furthermore the use of future projections under different scenarios will help to anticipate the potential impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water resources this can assist in the development of adaptation and mitigation measures to reduce the impact of these factors on water availability and quality these insights may be beneficial for water management strategies and decision making processes for sustainable water use in future hydrologic conditions

1809,to develop effective adaptation strategies for climate change particularly in regions where water is scarce it is crucial to comprehend and quantify how hydrological responses are influenced by anthropogenic activities and climate change the primary concern nowadays is to identify the hydrologic sensitive and resilient catchment under these diverse conditions thus a framework is developed in this study to analyse the hydrologic sensitivity and resiliency of a catchment incorporating the elasticity based budyko approach the developed framework is applied to three neighbouring catchments brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha in eastern india that have received less attention in light of resiliency and sensitivity perspectives the budyko approach is first applied using hydro climatic records of historical phase 1979 2018 and then extended for future phase 2025 2064 under four different shared socioeconomic pathways ssps 1 2 6 2 4 5 3 7 0 and 5 8 5 of coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 projections which will provide new insights to the hydrological community the results highlight that streamflow variations of the subarnarekha is more sensitive to anthropogenic activities in all time phases in contrast the brahmani and baitarani are more sensitive to climate change in future phases during historical phase the brahmani and baitarani are identified to be resilient catchments with high water yield and dry climate whereas the subarnarekha is found to be sensitive catchment exhibiting low water yield and dry climate however in future phase all three catchments are predicted to be resilient characterized by high water yield and wet climate the major inference from this study is excess anthropogenic activities can disrupt the anticipated hydrological functioning of a catchment particularly under critical climatic conditions which can result in decreasing hydrological resiliency the finding of this study mainly highlights the response of a hydrological system to climate change and anthropogenic activities to explore the approach of sensitivity and resiliency from a socio hydrological perspective keywords budyko method climate change anthropogenic activities hydrologic sensitivity hydrologic resiliency cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 drivers of streamflow variations and their attribution analysis water resources the interdisciplinary domain of hydrology climate sciences and anthropogenic activities are essential for sustainable development and resilience of the earth however climate change and anthropogenic activity two of the most important aspects have a direct impact on the hydrological cycle requiring more reliable planning and utilisation of water resources piao et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 in this context anticipating the hydrological response to climate change and anthropogenic has become an emerging challenge ma et al 2015 wang and stephenson 2018 additionally global warming has emerged as one of the most catastrophic environmental issues towards the end of the century bonneuil et al 2021 abbass et al 2022 further with the intense industrialization and social economic advancement the impact of anthropogenic activities became even more pronounced leading to a spate of environmental and ecological concerns such as global soil degradation animal habitat loss and so forth reyilai et al 2016 as a result this anthropogenic stress on the ecological systems has reached a stage where abrupt environmental change is suspected and global sustainability has become a mere realistic option d odorico et al 2018 therefore with the uncertain aspects of future climate it is critical to comprehend the dynamics of human water connection i e socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2014 as a criterion of sustainable hydrological responses to these altering variables catchment resilience is therefore an alarming concern for hydrologists and needs to be explored conceptually with practical significance streamflow the fundamental component of the hydrology cycle is the reflection of several hydrological processes notably climatic forcing precipitation and temperature catchmentmorphology slope and elevation subsurface geology and anthropogenic activity construction of reservoir dam land use changes and excessive water extraction swain et al 2020 the influence of the aforementioned drivers on significant variations in the streamflow patterns of worldwide catchments is documented earlier swain et al 2021 several methodologies have been developed over time in previous studies to implement attribution analysis of climate change and anthropogenic activities on streamflow variations including paired catchment approach empirically statistical approach elasticity or sensitivity based approach eco hydrological approach decomposition approach and physically based hydrological modelling approach gao et al 2016 dey and mishra 2017 for the last few decades hydrologists have used the conceptual budyko framework budyko 1948 1974 to understand how water and energy are related to the land surface considering the water and energy limits of evaporation the purpose of the budyko framework is to comprehend the underlying physical and hydrological mechanisms of the catchment locations in the budyko domain wang and hejazi 2011 berghuijs et al 2020 gan et al 2021 and to develop the stochastic and deterministic methods for evaluating the sensitivity of streamflow variations to climatic change and basin characteristics liu et al 2019 chen et al 2021 concerning evapotranspiration and discharge the budyko framework depicts the link between precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pet and actual evapotranspiration aet it signifies that as the aridity index ai which is denoted by pet p increases the component of precipitation segregated to streamflow decreases sposito 2017 and also explains the significance of the evaporative index ei which is denoted by aet p the ability of the catchments to preserve this functioning as predicted by the budyko curve following disruptions is defined as resilience creed et al 2014 though resiliency is typically characterised as a system s ability to absorb disruption without affecting its function or structure walker and salt 2017 hydrologic resiliency can be defined as a set of systematic properties with three dimensional concepts i e absorptive adaptive and transformative from the perspective of a hydrologic system mao et al 2017 the linking of resiliency and catchment hydrology with the budyko framework is justified in previous studies creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 sinha et al 2018 further two quantitative metrics have been developed dynamic deviation d which indicates the change in ei of a catchment concerning the budyko curve as climate changes and elasticity e which measures the ability of a catchment to maintain water partitioning constant with the budyko curve as climate changes in this sense hydrologic sensitivity is the converse of elasticity and can be used to identify unstable hydrologic catchments domínguez tuda and gutiérrez jurado 2021 even if prior studies used resiliency concepts at basin scale attribution analysis to determine whether it is resistant to human activities or climate change sinha et al 2018 gleeson et al 2020 omer et al 2020 wamucii et al 2021 cao et al 2022 only a few studies have focused on the idea of hydrologic sensitivity in light of climate change and anthropogenic stress domínguez tuda and gutiérrez jurado 2021 therefore analysing the changes in hydrologic response with variations in climatic forcing and anthropogenic stress is a way to identify the catchments where hydrologic patterns are altering to define the sensitivity and resiliency of a catchment 1 2 scope of this study until now the developed methods in earlier studies only represented the resiliency of a catchment considering the changes in hydrologic responses due to climate variability and intense anthropogenic activities by incorporating the elasticity concept however the identification and significance of sensitive catchments are less explored in general the address of the resiliency and sensitivity of a catchment in the future climate is limited based on the above critical appraisal the present study aims to analyse the hydrologic sensitivity and resiliency of three neighbouring eastern india catchments incorporating the conceptual budyko framework the resiliency and sensitivity of the study area are further assessed in the future population exposure employing the bias corrected general circulation model gcm outputs of coupled model intercomparison project 6 cmip6 experiments under four different shared socioeconomic pathways ssps climate change scenarios these ssps are ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the entire analysis is presented for 40 years of the observed climate historical phase 1979 2018 and the projected climate future phase 2020 2059 the layout overall methodology framework is outlined in fig 1 in this study we aim to address the following research questions 1 how to deal with multiple change points in the hydro climatic variables of a catchment to analyse the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities 2 how to address the attributions of anthropogenic activities along with climate change on streamflow variations when information related to anthropogenic activities in the catchment is limited 3 how to identify the most hydrologic sensitive and resilient catchment when the study area is subjected to diverse hydro climatic variations and 4 how a socio hydrological system responds to disruption and future uncertainty making now an ideal opportunity to investigate the approach of sensitivity and resiliency from a socio hydrological perspective 2 methodology 2 1 change point analysis method to detect the abrupt change and its significance in the hydro climatic variables precipitation temperature and streamflow the sequential version of the mann kendall test is applied sneyers 1990 douglas et al 2000 zhao et al 2015 nourani et al 2018 the forward sequential values of the test statistic u d j are calculated as 1 u d j d j e d j var d j where e d j and var d j are mean and variance of the test statistic d j given by 2 d j 1 j n j the values of x j mean time series j 1 n are compared with x i i 1 j 1 at each comparison the number of cases x j x i is counted and denoted as n j the sequence of u d j is termed as a forward series the same method is then applied to the inversed series to get a backward sequence the abrupt shifts in the observed variables are the intersection of the forward series and backward series with the highest significance value which is found between the confidence intervals based on the breakpoint with a high significance value the study period is divided into a baseline and an impacted period 2 2 conceptualization of the budyko framework the budyko curve is developed by many researchers with practical applications to date schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 turc 1954 pike 1964 fu 1981 the conceptual budyko hypothesis is introduced to study the potential impacts of changing climate and human activities on mean annual streamflow variations budyko 1974 the budyko approach explains the catchment scale long term water balance concept the conceptual water balance equation for a long term period is given by 3 ds dt p q a e t where p is the mean annual precipitation q total streamflow of a catchment aet is the actual evapotranspiration from the catchment and ds dt is the change in water storage per time step however for a long analysis period say 5 10 years the soil water storage is assumed to be a steady state condition i e ds dt 0 tekleab et al 2011 sinha et al 2018 further using the budyko developed relation of ai represents climate condition ei represents hydrologic response and catchment characteristics ω the budyko type equation used in this study is given by 4 aet p 1 pet p 1 pet p 1 ω the budyko approach is based on the principle of water and energy limits total available energy limits evapotranspiration in a humid state ai less than 1 and water availability limits evapotranspiration in an arid state ai 1 the conceptual representation of the budyko curve along with variations of ai and ei are shown in fig 2 a researchers have included catchment factors including vegetation type soil qualities and topography into water balance and proposed formulation with a parameter to describe the budyko framework zhang et al 2001 fu et al 2007 yang et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 using the related budyko type equations as outlined in table 1 these parameters can be estimated using long term discharge precipitation and pet quantities while accounting for a negligible change in water storage under the budyko type equation two separation approaches are developed so far to quantify the potential contributions of climate change and human activities jiang et al 2015 these approaches are outlined as the sensitivity elasticity approach and decomposition approach schaake and waggoner 1990 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 the elasticity based approach evaluates the sensitivity of streamflow variation to the change in climate variables using streamflow elasticity coefficients while the decomposition approach estimates the relative contributions independently without using any sensitivity coefficients sinha et al 2018 the elasticity based budyko approach integrating the non parametric and analytical methods uses the elasticity coefficients that are determined from the observed hydro climatic variables empirically sankarasubramanian et al 2001 for analysing the effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration on streamflow variation an analytical elasticity based budyko hypothesis is proposed arora 2002 the detailed algorithm used in this study is outlined in subsequent steps i streamflow elasticity coefficient analysis the conceptual budyko curve depicts the predictability of responses of a catchment to changing climate the parametric budyko equations incorporate basin properties into the budyko framework enabling a more accurate depiction of precipitation segregation thus the equation given by fu 1981 is selected for this analysis out of eight available budyko formulations highlighted in table 1 the formulation given by fu 1981 considers a parametric function ω which represents the vegetation cover of a catchment following gao et al 2016 the interlinking of long term water balance components is expressed by 5 q p a e t p p f ϕ where f ϕ is the function of aet p further assuming p pet and ω as independent variables the total differential reflecting the variations in streamflow due to climate change is stated as 6 d q c q c p d p q c p e t d p e t further the relative variation in streamflow is expressed as 7 d q c q p q q c p dp p pet q q c p d p e t pet 8 d q c θ p dp p θ pet d p e t pet where θ p and θ pet are the elasticity coefficients of streamflow to precipitation and pet respectively these elasticity coefficients are estimated as follows 9 θ p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ 10 θ pet ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ as the θ p θ pet 1 from eq 9 and 10 the streamflow variations due to changing climate cc is given by 11 δ q cc θ p δ p p θ pet δ p e t pet q where δ p and δ p e t are the changes in average annual precipitation and average annual potential evapotranspiration from the baseline period to the impacted period θ p δ p p q and θ pet δ p e t pet q are the variation in streamflow due to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration changes respectively ii analysis of streamflow variation attributions using the results of abrupt change analysis the study period is divided into two sub periods baseline period and assessment period usually the baseline signifies less anthropogenic stress in that period therefore the total streamflow variation is expressed as 12 δ q t q ip q bp 13 δ q t δ q cc δ q aa δ q p δ q pet δ q aa where δ q t is the total streamflow variations q ip and q bp are the average annual streamflow of impacted and baseline periods respectively δ q cc δ q aa δ q p and δ q pet are the changes in streamflow due to climate change anthropogenic activities precipitation and pet respectively further the relative contributions of precipitation λ p pet λ pet and anthropogenic activities λ aa to streamflow change are calculated as 14 λ p δ q p δ q t 100 15 λ pet δ q pet δ q t 100 16 λ aa δ q aa δ q t 100 2 3 formulation of hydrologic sensitivity and resiliency a new concept is presented in this study to define the most sensitive or resilient hydrologic catchment based on the variation of ei and ai the hydrologic sensitivity h s is portrayed by variation in ei to ai from the impacted period to the baseline period and expressed as 17 h s δ e i δ a i e i ip e i bp a i ip a i bp where the sensitive catchment is indicated as h s 1 the most resilient catchment is represented when h s 1 it is noteworthy that this method represents the resiliency and sensitivity of a catchment irrespective of wet and dry conditions present in the baseline and impacted period further the catchment conditions in light of hydrologic response variation and changing climate are represented in fig 2 b and 2 c here the hydrologic response is illustrated through variation in water yield climate change is presented in terms of the cool wet and warm dry periods in the figure hydrologic sensitivity is represented by coloured quadrants red and green or yellow and blue the coloured area shows the relation of interannual absolute changes in ei δei and ai δai which signifies h s 1 the remaining regions represent the resilient area the figure has four quadrants portraying the possible directions of climate change and hydrologic response variation water yield the significance of each quadrant is given as follows i δ e i δ a i low water yield and dry climate i i δ e i δ a i low water yield and wet climate i i i δ e i δ a i high water yield and wet climate i v δ e i δ a i high water yield and dry climate 3 study area and data sources 3 1 background of the study area three interstate neighbouring catchments brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha of eastern india are selected for this study fig 3 the subarnarekha catchment 19 121 km2 is located in eastern india and is 442 km long stretching from 20 29 n to 23 00 n in latitude and 85 00 e to 87 53 e in longitude this basin is adjacent to the brahmani catchment 36 800 km2 which is 799 km long and extends from 20 28 n to 23 35 n in latitude and 83 52 e to 87 50 e in longitude the brahmani catchment along with the baitarani catchment 12 094 km2 which is 360 km long and stretches from 20 30 n to 22 20 n in latitude and 85 05 e to 87 05 e in longitude drains into the bay of bengal these are the major catchments of eastern india spanning over jharkhand odisha chhattisgarh and west bengal states and known for significant contributions to agriculture fisheries and industrial sectors the land use types of the study area are agricultural land water bodies fallow and wasteland forest class and developed urban land visakh et al 2019 deb et al 2021 the anthropogenic activities like the rengali reservoir and salandi dam are located upstream of jenapur and anandapur gauging stations of the brahmani and baitarani catchments swain et al 2020 within the subarnarekha catchment the getalsud reservoir is there at upstream of muri and the chandil reservoir located between muri and jamshedpur gauging location is also present singh giri 2018 hence it provides an interesting research opportunity to explore streamflow changes due to climate change and anthropogenic activities that are likely to affect the flow regimes of the study area since these catchments are in the subtropical monsoon climate zone annual report 2011 12 the monsoon months june july august and september are the primary source of precipitation 80 on an annual scale these catchments are reported as flood prone catchments of india in earlier studies rai et al 2018 dahm et al 2019 gaur et al 2021 however these catchments as a part of central northeast india are classified as drought prone areas due to increased drought occurrences and their magnitudes in future climate change scenarios ojha et al 2013 bisht et al 2019 suman and maity 2021 hence the study of catchment resiliency in light of these diverse extreme events is a contemporary challenge in the present scenarios which needs to be addressed in a futuristic way 3 2 historical hydro climatic data sources the main data required for this analysis are precipitation temperature streamflow aet and pet the observed climatic variables precipitation min and max temperature are obtained on a daily scale from the india meteorological department imd pune rajeevan et al 2006 pai et al 2015 which have been earlier used for attribution analysis of climate change and land use variation on streamflow at different regional scales chawla and mujumdar 2015 sinha et al 2018 swain et al 2021 the daily observed streamflow data is collected from the central water commission cwc bhubaneswar for the gauging stations the aet and pet data are obtained from calibrated soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model the details of the input data required model calibration and validation are explained by swain et al 2020 the swat setups of the study area are calibrated and validated separately at a monthly timescale the gauging stations considered for the brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha catchments are jenapur anandapur and ghatshila respectively the best fit model parameters and model performances are outlined in table s1 and figure s1 which are provided in supporting information 3 3 future climatic data sources the sensitivity and resiliency analysis in the future time phase is carried out using the gcm data of cmip6 experiments the future analysis is mainly presented in ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios which reflect different socio economic families namely sustainability middle of the road regional rivalry and fossil fuel development respectively meinshausen et al 2020 the precipitation maximum and minimum temperature outputs from cmip6 are applied in this study which is bias corrected by empirical quantile mapping eqm method and available in 0 25 x 0 25 lon spatial resolution mishra et al 2020 these datasets are available at https zenodo org record 3873998 y5jkfxzbw2w these bias corrected future datasets are widely used for extreme climatic event analysis dixit et al 2022 pandey et al 2022 samantaray et al 2022 das et al 2023 however the future perspective of hydrologic sensitivity and resiliency is not explored in cmip6 experiments out of the 13 available gcms the ec earth3 model is chosen for this study as it has been reported to be more suitable for the study area and its nearby catchments than the other models mahato et al 2022 reddy saravanan 2023 fig 4 illustrates the annual precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum of imd and ec earth3 models from 1979 to 2014 to visually represent the spread and skewness of these variables this visualization provides a comprehensive understanding of how these variables vary over time in both models the observations indicate that the maximum and minimum temperatures of the brahmani and subarnarekha catchments appear to be higher in the ec earth3 model than in the imd however there is a good agreement in the variation of precipitation between the imd data and ec earth3 model data for all three catchments thus the selected model is considered to represent the future resilient and sensitive catchment the years 2020 to 2059 are taken as the future phase in this study using the best fit model parameters as given in table s1 the calibrated swat models are simulated for future ssps employing precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum of the selected ec earth3 model to obtain future pet aet and streamflow 4 results and discussion 4 1 change point detection analysis as this study aims to present the attribution analysis of climate change and anthropogenic activities on streamflow variations the presence of abrupt change is detected in the streamflow variables for the study area employing the sq mann kendall test the test statistics for the streamflow of the study area are outlined in table 2 six shift points in total are identified in the streamflow of the brahmani catchment with the changing point years being 1981 1985 1993 1994 2011 and 2013 a total of eight change points are detected in the baitarani catchment the corresponding changing point years are 1982 1983 1987 1990 1993 1994 2003 and 2006 however only three change points are noticed in the subarnarekha catchment and those are 1984 2004 and 2007 the highest significance value is noted in the year 2007 with the estimated significance value αe of 1 43 while the observed highest significance value is in 1994 for the brahmani αe 1 92 and baitarani αe 1 64 catchments further the abrupt changes in average annual precipitation and annual mean temperature is performed using the sq mann kendall test to compare the above results of streamflow which are presented in fig 5 in the year 1994 the brahmani catchment shows a common change point for all three hydro climatic variables streamflow precipitation and mean temperature the mean temperature of the baitarani catchment indicates the year 1994 as a common change point with the streamflow whereas no change points are detected in the precipitation similarly the precipitation and streamflow of the subarnarekha catchment are showing a common change point in the year 2007 following these change point analyses the entire study period is parted into two sub periods i e the period before the abrupt shift is the baseline period and the period after that is considered to be an impacted period thus the historical phase 1979 2018 is divided into two sub periods for further attribution analysis the years 1979 to 1994 are assumed as the baseline period while the years 1995 to 2018 are taken as the impacted period in the brahmani and baitarani catchments for the subarnarekha catchment the baseline period is from 1979 to 2007 and the rest years are the impacted period 2008 2018 the hydro climatic variations with a linear trend line are shown for these periods along with four ssps 1 2 6 2 4 5 3 7 0 and 5 8 5 are shown in fig 6 the trend analysis is performed at a 5 significance level in the figure the symbol δ represents the slope of the trend a positive value of δ indicates an upward trend whereas a negative value indicates a downward trend the p value shown in the plot is the estimated significance value from the figure it can be observed that there is a significant trend in the streamflow during the baseline period with an estimated p value of 0 023 for the brahmani catchment under the ssp5 8 5 scenario both precipitation and streamflow are exhibiting a significant upward trend with p values of 0 026 and 0 007 respectively similar to the brahmani catchment the baitarani catchment is also exhibiting a significant upward trend under the ssp5 8 5 scenario with an estimated p value of around 0 02 however there is no significant trend is found in the subarnarekha catchment even though no significant trend is observed the fluctuations in hydro climatic variables upward and downward are still worth studying as they can have an impact on catchment responses as well as on attribution analysis swain et al 2021 4 2 attribution analysis of streamflow variations water energy based budyko approach is used in this study for climate change and human activities attribution analysis in the brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha catchments the long term precipitation pet and streamflow are considered for this analysis following the water energy balance principle precipitation in a catchment is partitioned into evapotranspiration and streamflow initially it is assumed that the hydrological response of a catchment is controlled by the climate variables precipitation and temperature further it is modified by including the basin characteristics as a controlling factor for variation in hydrologic responses using the budyko algorithms of eq 4 to 16 the elasticity coefficients of streamflow variations to precipitation θ p and pet θ pet to streamflow variations are evaluated and the values are presented in table 3 the summation of elasticity coefficient values should be 1 as discussed in the conceptualization of the budyko framework section in our study θ p is 2 02 and θ pet is 1 02 for the brahmani catchment in the historical phase for the baitarani catchment θ p is 1 97 and θ pet is 0 97 while these values are 1 85 and 0 85 for the subarnarekha catchment similarly the summation of the obtained θ p and θ pet are observed to be 1 in future scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp 5 8 5 for all three catchments thus the type of budyko framework selected for this analysis i e fu 1981 is suitable for the brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha catchments the contribution of precipitation pet and human activities to the streamflow variations for both historical and future phases are shown in fig 7 a positive value indicates the contribution to the increase in streamflow while a negative value suggests the contribution towards a decrease in streamflow the contribution results show that brahmani and subarnarekha catchments are more sensitive to anthropogenic activities in the historical phase the λ aa for the brahmani catchment is 66 11 while for the subarnarekha catchment it is 79 66 change in catchment properties is thus found to be the major driver of the variations in the observed streamflow for these two catchments in contrast to anthropogenic activities climate change is found to have comparatively less contribution to the streamflow variations in the brahmani and subarnarekha catchments climate change λ p λ pet is observed to contribute 33 90 in the brahmani catchment and 20 34 in the subarnarekha catchment in the future phase the streamflow of the brahmani catchment is increasing as compared to the historical phase while in the subranarekha catchment the streamflow is decreasing in the ssp1 2 6 scenario of the brahmani catchment there is a significant contribution in streamflow variation from precipitation λ p 66 76 as compared to pet λ pet 31 66 and anthropogenic activities λ aa 1 58 in contrast there is a moderate contribution of precipitation λ p 44 62 and 53 63 respectively and human activities λ aa 43 36 and 35 77 respectively to streamflow variations and a minor from pet λ pet less than13 in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios in the ssp5 8 5 scenario there is a notable contribution from anthropogenic activities λ aa 49 78 followed by precipitation λ p 40 12 while slight from pet λ pet 10 10 under ssp1 2 6 there are positive contributions observed from both precipitation λ p and pet λ pet by 35 41 and 6 01 respectively while negative contributions from anthropogenic activities λ aa by 58 58 to streamflow variation of the subarnarekha catchment similar trends are observed under other scenarios ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 where streamflow variations are attributed to positive contributions of precipitation and pet while negatively affected by human activities the results of the baitarani catchment showed that there is a 32 2 contribution of precipitation to streamflow variations during the historical period additionally there is a 17 66 contribution of pet which can be attributed to increasing temperatures and other climatic factors on the other hand there is a negative contribution of 50 14 from anthropogenic activities in the catchment during the same period however in future scenarios the results of attribution analysis are more complex and different in the specific scenario with a decrease in streamflow in ssp1 2 6 the contributions of both precipitation λ p and pet λ pet are suggesting an increase in streamflow in ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 the contribution of pet is dominant as compared to p λ p and anthropogenic activities λ aa in ssp5 8 5 there is an increase in contributions of precipitation λ p and pet λ pet indicating an increase in streamflow these results suggest that future changes in streamflow in the study area are strongly influenced by the interplay between precipitation pet and anthropogenic activities which are in turn affected by different socio economic scenarios this implies that the effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change on streamflow vary across different catchments and time frames and indicating the need for water management strategies that account for spatial and temporal variations of these drivers 4 3 resiliency metrics of the study area the aridity index ai and the evaporative index ei are calculated using precipitation pet and aet of the study area the variations of these two indices are summarised in table 4 for both historical and future scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp 5 8 5 it is observed that the ai which represents the climate condition of a catchment is higher than the ei for the brahmani and baitarani catchment in the historical phase the estimated ai 0 9 in the baseline and impacted periods implies that both the catchments are very close to the water limited region arid region as portrayed in fig 3 based on the variations of ai and ei values from the assessment period to the impacted period the hydrologic sensitivity hs value is found to be 0 50 for the brahmani catchment and 0 73 for the baitarani catchment the estimated hs value of less than 1 signifies that both catchments are resilient however the estimated eis of the baseline and impacted periods are 1 for the subarnarekha catchment which indicates that the catchment is in the water limited region arid region the value of hs is 4 60 which is 1 indicating that the subarnarekha catchment is sensitive in the historical phase the future scenarios show that all catchments have hs values less than 1 indicating that they are resilient catchments in all four ssps of the future phase when compared to the historical phase the change in ai and ei over both historical and future scenarios are presented in fig 8 the change of ei in the brahmani catchment is 0 007 whereas the change in ai is 0 015 similarly for the baitarani catchment the estimated δei and δai values are 0 003 and 0 003 respectively this signifies that the brahmani and baitarani catchments lie in high water yield and dry climate zone as shown in fig 2 the reason is when the deviation in ei is positive δei i e more aet the water yield is low q the amount of water remaining on the surface of the catchment after evapotranspiration and when the deviation in ei is negative δei i e less aet the water yield is high q a catchment has high elasticity to climate change and anthropogenic activities when there is a small deviation in ei relative to the change in ai and that is identified as a resilient condition as well however the subarnarekha catchment lies in low water yield and dry climate with positive ei and ai deviations in the historical phase in the future scenarios negative deviations in ei and ai are observed in all three catchments indicating that they will tend to have high water yield with a wet climate in all four ssps of the future phase when compared to the historical phase 4 4 implication and scope of this study this study extended the conceptual budyko framework to identify the resilient and sensitive catchment at a regional scale focusing on the eastern india catchments the selected catchments i e brahmani baitarani and subarnarekha are rain fed ones and the major source of agricultural water demand das et al 2018 compared to other available studies on the application of budyko analysis at the indian scale this study highlights the identification of sensitivity and resiliency based on the hydrologic sensitivity parameter the simplicity of the conceptual budyko framework makes it more feasible to incorporate than other available large scale hydrological models greve et al 2020 the findings of this study can be beneficial in assessing the complex interaction between climate and watershed characteristics and how they collectively influence catchment hydrology additionally this study will provide a scientific reference for the potential hydrological changes that can occur based on specific catchment parameters and climate conditions it is a recent study to analyse variations in catchment scale hydrological responses in the context of watershed resiliency under multiple ssps of recently updated cmip6 gcms the findings from the attribution analysis of this study suggest that the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities varied across the catchments in the brahmani and baitarani catchments climate change is observed to be a major contributing factor in streamflow variation an earlier study revealed that has played a crucial role in hydrological changes of the brahmani and baitarani catchments swain et al 2020 on the other hand land use change is the primary driver of hydrological changes in the subarnarekha catchment which is one of the major categories of anthropogenic activities in the historical phase the study of gaur et al 2021 observed that the subarnarekha catchment has undergone significant and rapid lulc changes over the last several decades along with climate change in addition to this the subarnarekha catchment is highly vulnerable to various anthropogenic activities including deforestation overgrazing poor farming practices and lack of proper runoff storage kumari pandey 2022 furthermore this study highlights the significance of ai and ei variations for historical and future time phases it is worth mentioning that regardless of the wet and dry conditions prevailing during the considered period ai and ei variations show the resiliency and sensitivity of a catchment effectively an earlier study on catchment resilience in india found that in the historical phase 1988 2011 the brahmani and baitarani catchments were resilient while the subarnarekha catchment was non resilient sinha et al 2018 even their study showed that watershed characteristics considered as anthropogenic activities have a significant impact on the water balance of these catchments as evidenced by the high ai values observed in each of them the current study also noticed similar results with anthropogenic activities making significant contributions to hydrological changes in the respective catchments as observed in trend analysis in our study increasing trends of precipitation decreasing trends in actual evapotranspiration aet and potential evapotranspiration pet in some ssp scenarios which could lead to an increase in streamflow may be the reason for high water yield and wet climate in future scenarios the significance of high water yield and wet climate in future ssps could be a concern for flood related hazards and needs to be explored in future scenarios thus the analysis of the hydrological response of a catchment to climate change and anthropogenic activities is necessary for sustainable socio hydrological development this study acknowledges that uncertainties in the analysis may impact the accuracy of parameter quantification in the development of the contribution analysis framework climatic variability and anthropogenic activities are treated as independent factors however it is important to note that the relationship between these two is complex and interdependent as they both contribute to hydrological systems the elasticity based method applied to the budyko hypothesis assumes that long term soil water storage changes are negligible however this parameter is dependent on the geological and soil properties of a catchment and there is no definitive evidence to support this assumption wu et al 2017 the inclusion of additional factors such as groundwater storage to attribution analysis may have a secondary impact on the variability of streamflow de lavenne et al 2022 human interference such as water withdrawals inflows and water management practices can further alter the pattern of streamflow variability which is not considered in this study it is important to note that anthropogenic activities encompass a wide range of practices and therefore it is essential to differentiate and quantify their relative effects on hydrological changes in catchments sinha et al 2018 however obtaining such distinction requires a large amount of data which is one of the major challenges for research in india consideration of future land use changes can be integrated with this framework to predict the hydrological changes under future land use change scenarios 5 conclusions in this study the elasticity based budyko conceptual approach is applied in brhamni baitarani and subarnarekha catchment to study the hydrologic resiliency and sensitivity considering observed hydro climatic records from 1979 to 2018 the applicability of the budyko approach is analyzed in the historical phase then the framework is employed to study the hydrologic resiliency and sensitivity in the future phase 2025 2064 under four diverse ssps 1 2 6 2 4 5 3 7 0 and 5 8 5 of ec earth3 projections from cmip6 the major conclusions from this study are as follows 1 the sequential mann kendall test results are convincing since it detects multiple change points by generating forward and backward series from the available hydro climatic data the highest significance value which is a common point for maximum variables is selected as the change point of the study area the year 1994 is observed to be a change point in the brahmani and baitarani catchment while the year 2007 is for the subarnarekha catchment 2 the contributions of anthropogenic activities are noticed to have more contributions to the streamflow variation in all three catchments 3 the future streamflow variations in the subarnarekha catchment are more sensitive to anthropogenic activities in all ssp scenarios while the brahamni and baitarani catchments are sensitive to climate change 4 the brahmani and baitarani catchment is identified to be a resilient catchment with high water yield and dry climate in the historical phase however the subarnarekha catchment is observed to be a sensitive one with low water yield and a dry climate 5 in the future phase all three catchments are found to be resilient with high water yield and a wet climate the findings of the study are helpful to hydrologists as they provide valuable insights into the hydrologic resiliency and sensitivity of the three neighbouring catchments under different climatic and anthropogenic scenarios the analysis of the contributions of anthropogenic activities to streamflow variations is useful to prioritize actions for reducing the impact of human activities on water resources the identification of resilient and sensitive catchments can help to focus attention on vulnerable areas that may require special management practices furthermore the use of future projections under different scenarios will help to anticipate the potential impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water resources this can assist in the development of adaptation and mitigation measures to reduce the impact of these factors on water availability and quality these insights may be beneficial for water management strategies and decision making processes for sustainable water use in future hydrologic conditions
