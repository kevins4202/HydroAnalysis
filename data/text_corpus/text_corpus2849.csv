pollutant related problems has raised concern among people due to their high toxicity and bio accumulative nature during the last few decades there have been a marked increase in use of toxic dyes by the paper leather and textile industries 1 consumption of water containing dyes can cause serious health issues such as neurological renal reproductive and intestinal dysfunctionality etc 2 3 industrial dye such as malachite green mg contributes to water and soil pollution mg is mainly used in leather cosmetics pharmaceutical and plastic industries 4 5 color of dyes act as a shield and affects the penetration of sunlight into water decrease in sunlight availability decreases the photosynthesis process which ultimately affects the quality of aquatic life 6 7 mg is dangerous to freshwater animals in acute or chronic disclosure and is extremely noxious to mammalian cells and organs like kidney liver spleen lung and skin it also forms carcinogenic degradation products which further results in secondary pollution that affects the quality and purity of water 8 10 so their removal from the water bodies is necessary so to make the water worth of usage several technologies have been used or explored for their removal from water these include reverse osmosis adsorption biosorption 11 13 photocatalytic degradation 14 17 ion exchange 18 19 electrochemical degradation 20

material because of its exceptional properties 42 it has potential applications in nuclear food processing automobile chemical pharmaceuticals petroleum vacuum manufacturing and mining industries 21 43 it derive its supreme adsorptive abilities from its internal pore structure which can be categorized into microporous mesoporous and macroporous 44 46 due to its extraordinary surface area and porous structure ac is a potential adsorbent for extensive range of persistent pollutants for it s activation two different approaches physical and chemical are widely employed the major difference between two approaches is the temperature requirement and activating agents physical activation implicates the activation by oxidizing gases air carbon dioxide and steam etc at temperature range of 650 900 c however in case chemical approach naoh fecl3 and koh are used as the activating agent with low temperature requirement in range of 300 500 c temperature conditions effects its porous nature chief perks of chemical over physical approach includes large surface area low temperature requirement and minimized reaction completion time in the present paper pinus roxburghii cone based activated

degassed at 200 c under vacuum before starting n2 adsorption the ph zero point of charge is a characteristic technique for determining the point of neutral charge on the surface phpzc of prcac was determined by ph drift method 48 batch experiments were performed in which 50 ml of 0 01 m nacl solutions were mixed with 150 mg prcac with solution ph 2 4 6 8 and 10 all the test sets were agitated at 240 rpm for 48 h in an incubator shaker at 25 c the final ph was noted after 48 h after equilibrium point acquired plot between initial and final ph gives the phpzc of prcac 49 2 4 adsorption of mg

typical process 20 mg prcac was added to 30 ml of 60 ppm mg solution all the experiments were performed in thermostatic shaker at 25 c with 200 rpm after equilibrium point solution was centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 5 min and remained mg concentration was analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer percent uptake and amount of adsorption per unit mass of prcac at equilibrium qe mg g was evaluated by following equations 50 51 1 q e c o c e m v 2 a d s o r p t i o n c o c e c o 100 exploration of equilibrium data is important for specifying the type of adsorption and nature of bonding between the adsorbate molecules and adsorbent it also helps in understanding the operating mechanism in the adsorption process in this study langmuir freundlich temkin and redlich peterson isotherms have been investigated for understanding the nature of adsorption for kinetic studies 20 mg prcac was dispersed into 60 ppm mg solution and placed in a thermostatic shaker with conditions as mentioned before the aliquots of sample were taken at various time intervals between 10 80 min centrifuged and analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer 2 5 desorption studies desorption studies are important for generalizing the reusable nature of synthesized material in typical process mg was firstly adsorbed onto prcac after adsorption the sample was washed with double distilled water and dried in hot air oven afterwards for desorption studies the dried sample was dipped into 2 different solutions of 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh after reaction completion 10 h the desorption was calculated by 52 3 d e s o r p t i o n c d c a 100 where c d and c a denotes the concentration of desorbed dye and adsorbed dye ppm respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization prcac before and after adsorption of mg molecules has been characterized by ftir and sem the changes in the absorbance of functional groups before and after the adsorption are shown in fig 1 a b fig 1 a shows the adsorption peaks of prcac before adsorption peak at 2976 cm 1 is due to the c h stretching 53 however cc stretching band has been ascertained by the peak at 1595 cm 1 54 peaks between 700 470 cm 1 are assigned to the cc stretching peak at 3443 cm 1 is ascribed to the presence of hydroxyl groups 55 fig 1 b shows the peaks of prcac after adsorption of mg malachite green shows characteristic finger print region in the range of 1550 500 cm 1 for the monosubstituted and para substituted benzene rings 56 a sharp peak at 2868 cm 1 is observed for the c h stretching of ch3 groups 57 the peak at 1550 cm 1 is characteristic for the cc aromatic stretching of benzene ring 58 59 all the characteristic peaks of the prcac shows the change after adsorption of mg the morphological analysis of prcac before and after adsorption of mg has been determined by sem and the results are presented in fig 1 c d sem depicts the highly porous nature of prcac fig 1 c high porosity introduced can be due to the activation treatment and temperature effect fig 1 d shows the surface of prcac after adsorption of mg molecules adsorption onto the surface and into the pores are clearly visible n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of prcac has been presented in fig 2 a graph indicate the mesoporous nature with type iv isotherm table 2 revealed the surface area of prcac to be 202 m2 g and total pore volume of 8 57 cm3 g the average pore size has been found to be 5 2 nm chemical activation and high synthesizing temperature can be considered as the factor for the obtained surface area and pore size the size of mg molecules as reported is 1 4 nm 1 1 nm 0 5 nm 60 which shows that it can be easily adsorbed onto prcac surface and into the pores and is thus considered as the model pollutant electrostatic interactions or repulsions play crucial role in adsorption process phpzc of prcac has been found to be 8 4 which implies the positively charge surface of prcac below this value and negatively charge surface above it fig 2 b 3 2 adsorption of mg onto prcac the mesoporous nature of prcac allowed the adsorption of dye onto its surface through electrostatic interactions the adsorbed prcac can easily be removed from the water by filtration thus reducing the secondary pollution the effects of various factors has been studied and reported in fig 3 a d 3 2 1 effect of time and mg concentration adsorption of mg by prcac was highly affected by its initial concentration variation in adsorption of mg w r t contact time at different mg concentrations 30 60 and 90 ppm has been presented in fig 3 a results have generalized that the uptake of mg was constantly increasing upto equilibrium viz 60 min and thereafter became steady variation of mg uptake with changes in initial concentrations has been observed to be very fast in the initial stages due to high ratio of prcac active site to mg molecules and after equilibrium point attainment no significant change has occurred this can probably be due to the saturation of the maximum adsorption limit onto prcac maximum uptake has been observed at 60 ppm initial mg concentration after 60 min 3 2 2 effect of temperature and ph it can be generally found that rise in temperature strengthens the rate of adsorption 61 62 however in the present study temperature has different effects on the adsorption of mg onto prcac fig 3 b signifies the maximum adsorption at 25 c and further temperature increase decreased the uptake signifying the exothermic adsorption process solution ph influences the rate of adsorption to a greater influence as it governs the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate 63 effect of ph on mg adsorption onto prcac has been studied at various ph values in the range of 3 8 results of ph effect on percent adsorption are shown in fig 3 c and it has been found that maximum adsorption occurred at ph 6 the ph effect can be explained in relation to the phpzc value the phpzc value of prcac as calculated was 8 4 denoting that at ph 6 the surface to be positively charged at this ph mg molecules are either neutral or slightly negatively charged thus showing their maximum interactions with prcac ultimately resulting in high adsorption rate 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dose the effect of varying adsorbent dosage has been analyzed for adsorption of mg in range of 10 50 mg adsorption of mg molecules increased upto 20 mg fig 3 d and then decreased increase in concentration of prcac above 20 mg decreased the adsorption rate which may be due to the agglomeration of the prcac particles decrease may also be due the reduction in the accessibility to active adsorption sites 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism mg is a green colored dye having positively charged surface synthesized prcac s surface was enriched with functional groups such as cooh and oh electrostatic and π π interactions could be considered to be the major ones favoring the mg adsorption onto prcac 64 the ph of the dye solution also influenced the interaction extent since the surface properties of prcac varied extensively under different ph solutions scheme 2 presents the probable interaction mechanism between mg molecules and prcac 3 3 adsorption isotherms in the present study in order to derive the exact mechanism of adsorption followed by mg molecules onto prcac below presented isotherms models were employed according to langmuir isotherm monolayer adsorption of adsorbate molecules onto the adsorbent of homogeneous energy sites takes place linearized form of langmuir isotherm is 65 66 4 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m here the values of qm and kl were calculated from the slope and intercept of the isotherm which was plotted between ce qe versus ce 67 freundlich isotherm denotes the multilayer adsorption on the energetically heterogeneous adsorbent surface 68 its linear equation is given as 5 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e the value of 1 n determines the type of adsorption process which can be evaluated from the linear plot of log qe and log ce temkin isotherm model assumes that heat of adsorption in the layer would reduce linearly instead of logarithmic linear form of this model is plotted between qe and lnce and is given by the following equation 69 6 q e b t ln k t b t l n c e where temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant kt is determined from the intercept and heat of sorption constant bt from the slope redlich peterson isotherm is a three parameter model it is basically a combined version of two models langmuir and freundlich and it s linear form is given as 70 7 l n c e q e β l n c e l n a linear plot of ln ce qe versus ln ce helps in evaluating the redlich peterson constants where β and a are determined from the slope and intercept respectively fig 4 shows the isotherm studies and values of various constants derived from them were presented in table 3 assessment of r2 values of all models have generalized the maximum ability of langmuir isotherm model in better explaining the adsorption process maximum adsorption capacity of prcac for mg as calculated from langmuir model is 250 mg g all isotherm studies have been analyzed at room temperature langmuir isotherm constant kl specifies the extent of interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate molecules which ultimately concludes the extent of adsorption in freundlich isotherm the value of 1 n specifies the ability of an adsorbent for a specific adsorbate and also the favorability of the undertaking adsorption process 53 in our case the value of 1 n is 0 715 less than 1 which indicates that the adsorption process was favorable at low as well as at high adsorbate concentrations 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetic studies helps in determining the rate and physical or chemical nature of adsorption process pseudo first order kinetics is based on the hypothesis that the mechanism following the adsorption is more inclined towards the physisorption nature 71 it can be explained by the following equation 8 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 2 303 t where k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant and its value was calculated from the slope of linear plot between time t versus log qe qt pseudo second order kinetics signifies the inclination of the adsorption process towards chemisorption 72 equation given by ho and mckay for pseudo second order kinetics is given as 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 specifies the rate constant for pseudo second order kinetics g mg min qt is the measure of mg adsorbed at time t mg g and qe is the amount of mg adsorbed at equilibrium mg g applicability of kinetic model has been ascertained by the comparison of correlation coefficient value results indicated the suitability of pseudo second order in describing the absorption process and various obtained has been presented in fig 5 a b and table 4 in addition intraparticle diffusion model was also employed for the presented adsorption process it helps in specifying the exact mechanism it is explained by the following equation 10 q t k i d t 1 2 c where kid represents the intraparticle diffusion rate graph for intraparticle model shows the two step adsorption mechanism fig 5 c in the step bulk diffusion across the surface and second step for the surface adsorption however extension of the graph doesn t make it pass thorough the origin indicating this model wasn t the probable model for explaining the current adsorption process 3 5 reusability desorption studies were performed in two different solutions 0 1 m hcl and naoh results presented in fig 6 a have generalized that maximum desorption rate of 77 was perceived in case of 0 1 m hcl in comparison to 58 in case of 0 1 m naoh solution after 10 h high rate in case of hcl solution can probably be due to the h ions that interacted strongly with the surface functional groups of prcac and helped in the desorption of adsorbed dye the reusability of prcac was evaluated for mg adsorption and results have been presented in fig 6 b in typical process mg adsorption experiments were firstly carried out for 6 h and then filtered and washed with double distilled water afterwards the adsorbed mg onto prcac was desorbed using 0 1 m hcl solution desorbed prcac was again filtered and utilized for the adsorption again same procedure was followed and percent adsorption activity was determined after each cycle adsorption followed by desorption experiments were performed for consecutive 5 times results presented have shown that adsorption capacity decreased to 83 from 93 after 5 cycles indicating appreciable reusable ability of prcac for adsorption of mg molecules schematic presentation of adsorption of mg onto prcac followed by desorption for reusability studies has been presented in scheme 3 table 5 presents the comparison of mg adsorption ability of prcac with already reported ac having different precursors 4 conclusion current paper presents the synthesis of pinus roxburghii cone based activated carbon by carbonization and it s use for the adsorptional exclusion of mg from the aqueous medium existence of cooh and oh groups on the prcac surface enhanced the adsorption process the structure of prcac

molecules increased upto 20 mg fig 3 d and then decreased increase in concentration of prcac above 20 mg decreased the adsorption rate which may be due to the agglomeration of the prcac particles decrease may also be due the reduction in the accessibility to active adsorption sites 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism mg is a green colored dye having positively charged surface synthesized prcac s surface was enriched with functional groups such as cooh and oh electrostatic and π π interactions could be considered to be the major ones favoring the mg adsorption onto prcac 64 the ph of the dye solution also influenced the interaction extent since the surface properties of prcac varied extensively under different ph solutions scheme 2 presents the probable interaction mechanism between mg molecules and prcac 3 3 adsorption isotherms in the present study in order to derive the exact mechanism of adsorption followed by mg molecules onto prcac below presented isotherms models were employed according to langmuir isotherm monolayer adsorption of adsorbate molecules onto the adsorbent of homogeneous energy sites takes place linearized form of langmuir isotherm is 65 66 4 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m here the values of qm and kl were calculated from the slope and intercept of the isotherm which was plotted between ce qe versus ce 67 freundlich isotherm denotes the multilayer adsorption on the energetically heterogeneous adsorbent surface 68 its linear equation is given as 5 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e the value of 1 n determines the type of adsorption process which can be evaluated from the linear plot of log qe and log ce temkin isotherm model assumes that heat of adsorption in the layer would reduce linearly instead of logarithmic linear form of this model is plotted between qe and lnce and is given by the following equation 69 6 q e b t ln k t b t l n c e where temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant kt is determined from the intercept and heat of sorption constant bt from the slope redlich peterson isotherm is a three parameter model it is basically a combined version of two models langmuir and freundlich and it s linear form is given as 70 7 l n c e q e β l n c e l n a linear plot of ln ce qe versus ln ce helps in evaluating the redlich peterson constants where β and a are determined from the slope and intercept respectively fig 4 shows the isotherm studies and values of various constants derived from them were presented in table 3 assessment of r2 values of all models have generalized the maximum ability of langmuir isotherm model in better explaining the adsorption process maximum adsorption capacity of prcac for mg as calculated from langmuir model is 250 mg g all isotherm studies have been analyzed at room temperature langmuir isotherm constant kl specifies the extent of interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate molecules which ultimately concludes the extent of adsorption in freundlich isotherm the value of 1 n specifies the ability of an adsorbent for a specific adsorbate and also the favorability of the undertaking adsorption process 53 in our case the value of 1 n is 0 715 less than 1 which indicates that the adsorption process was favorable at low as well as at high adsorbate concentrations 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetic studies helps in determining the rate and physical or chemical nature of adsorption process pseudo first order kinetics is based on the hypothesis that the mechanism following the adsorption is more inclined towards the physisorption nature 71 it can be explained by the following equation 8 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 2 303 t where k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant and its value was calculated from the slope of linear plot between time t versus log qe qt pseudo second order kinetics signifies the inclination of the adsorption process towards chemisorption 72 equation given by ho and mckay for pseudo second order kinetics is given as 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 specifies the rate constant for pseudo second order kinetics g mg min qt is the measure of mg adsorbed at time t mg g and qe is the amount of mg adsorbed at equilibrium mg g applicability of kinetic model has been ascertained by the comparison of correlation coefficient value results indicated the suitability of pseudo second order in describing the absorption process and various obtained has been presented in fig 5 a b and table 4 in addition intraparticle diffusion model was also employed for the presented adsorption process it helps in specifying the exact mechanism it is explained by the following equation 10 q t k i d t 1 2 c where kid represents the intraparticle diffusion rate graph for intraparticle model shows the two step adsorption mechanism fig 5 c in the step bulk diffusion across the surface and second step for the surface adsorption however extension of the graph doesn t make it pass thorough the origin indicating this model wasn t the probable model for explaining the current adsorption process 3 5 reusability desorption studies were performed in two different solutions 0 1 m hcl and naoh results presented in fig 6 a have generalized that maximum desorption rate of 77 was perceived in case of 0 1 m hcl in comparison to 58 in case of 0 1 m naoh solution after 10 h high rate in case of hcl solution can probably be due to the h ions that interacted strongly with the surface functional groups of prcac and helped in the desorption of adsorbed dye the reusability of prcac was evaluated for mg adsorption and results have been presented in fig 6 b in typical process mg adsorption experiments were firstly carried out for 6 h and then filtered and washed with double distilled water afterwards the adsorbed mg onto prcac was desorbed using 0 1 m hcl solution desorbed prcac was again filtered and utilized for the adsorption again same procedure was followed and percent adsorption activity was determined after each cycle adsorption followed by desorption experiments were performed for consecutive 5 times results presented have shown that adsorption capacity decreased to 83 from 93 after 5 cycles indicating appreciable reusable ability of prcac for adsorption of mg molecules schematic presentation of adsorption of mg onto prcac followed by desorption for reusability studies has been presented in scheme 3 table 5 presents the comparison of mg adsorption ability of prcac with already reported ac having different precursors 4 conclusion current paper presents the synthesis of pinus roxburghii cone based activated carbon by carbonization and it s use for the adsorptional exclusion of mg from the aqueous medium existence of cooh and oh groups on the prcac surface enhanced the adsorption process the structure of prcac before and after adsorption was characterized to explore it s structure and bonding bet analysis showed surface area of prcac to be 202 m2 g and pore size 5 2 nm adsorption of mg followed pseudo second order kinetics monolayer adsorption followed by mg was elucidated by the high r2 value of langmuir isotherm presented data aid for the designing of bioadsorbents for the removal of lethal

14246,this paper presents a novel end to end pilot scale photocatalytic treatment of real textile dyeing industry effluent which involved innovative approach in primary treatment followed by heterogenous photocatalysis hp involving nano tio2 uv as secondary treatment and suitable filtration leading to treated water meeting process water quality enhancing water re use efficiency this enables zero liquid discharge zld which is the need of the hour in tackling problems of point source pollution and water conservation in developing countries like india overall treatment led to complete degradation and mineralization of organic pollutants and dye stuff thereby achieving adequate treatment complete decolourization and deodorization of the effluent and almost hundred times less quantities of sludge residues in comparison to those obtained in conventional treatment methods the nature and elemental composition of sludge residues as investigated using energy dispersive x ray edx elemental analysis confirms complex organic dye components mineralized and nature being non toxic the complete treatment took place in 5 h without any kind of bioremediation method which further highlights highly efficient and fast treatment coupled with small footprint overall cost of treatment is estimated to be around 1 55 usd m3 such an innovation in wastewater treatment is expected to bring a revolution in developing countries which are grappled together with problems of rapid industrialization urbanization regulatory compliances and environmental challenges keywords advanced oxidation nanotechnology process water photocatalysis zld aop 1 introduction textile industry is one of the key industries playing vital role in economies of developing countries like china bangladesh india pakistan vietnam indonesia etc at the same time this industry faces major challenges of waste management and associated environmental compliances among key challenges inadequate treatment of wastewater lack of fresh water availability and management of highly toxic sludge residues obtained as the result of conventional chemical and biological treatment needs immediate attention and innovation the current wastewater treatment practices rely on excessive use of chemicals chemical treatment using conventional coagulants and flocculants and uncontrolled dosing of lime alum ferrous salts etc these conventional protocols have been in use at micro small and medium scale enterprises msmes for a long time owing to its lower capital and operational costs however these chemical treatments are prone to shock loads and application of different coagulants maybe required for treatment of different effluent streams they also have low decolourization efficiency for the wastewater having reactive and vat dyes and leads to large generation of resultant sludge 1 lab scale studies have shown that newer pre hydrolysed coagulants such as poly aluminium chloride pacl poly aluminium ferric chloride pafcl poly ferrous sulphate pfs and poly ferric chloride pfcl may prove to be among better choices owing to their superior colour removal even at smaller dosage and their efficiency at wider ph range 2 3 however these primary treatment systems may still be unsuitable for overall sustainability of treatment as these processes result in mere phase transfer of dyes and chemicals into toxic sludge whose disposal and management is another crucial matter biological treatment has been used at commercial scale for a long time due to its simplistic design low cost and easy operation common biological treatment systems involve approaches like activated sludge process asp extended aeration ea submerged aerated fixed film saff moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr or fluidised bed reactor fbr sequential batch reactor sbr and membrane bioreactors mbr several reports on application of bioremediation for treatment of real textile effluent at pilot scale have shown sbr 4 anaerobic fbr 5 and asp 6 to be successful in removal of colour cod and bod however field scale installations face challenges of low biodegradability of wastewater due to presence of complex dyes and toxic compounds which hinders microbial growth thereby reducing the efficiency of these processes this leads to inadequate treatment where treated water is not free from dissolved organics and can not be used as process water 7 9 moreover these biological systems involve at least 12 24 h treatment incur large area footprint and produce large amounts of toxic sludge 10 in view of above shortcomings innovation in wastewater treatment especially in developing countries is the need of the hour hence use of advanced and promising technologies like heterogenous photocatalysis hp among advanced oxidation processes aops where it utilises n tio2 uv is widely accepted as a promising and efficient technology to meet these challenges 11 hp is among the class of aops that made significant advancement in terms of upscaling in recent years owing to improved membrane based systems which can recover used nanomaterials which could be further regenerated and reused 12 13 it has been shown previously that coupling of biological treatment and photocatalysis for treatment of real dye wastewater resulted in the treated water meeting discharge norms with operational and economic feasibility 14 15 in general there has been success of integration of biological treatment chemical treatment and aops for successful treatment of real textile wastewater 15 19 gilpavas et al made use of another class of aop system at lab scale to treat real dye house effluent without bioremediation making use of electrocoagulation in combination with fenton photo fenton followed by activated charcoal adsorption 20 however to the best of our knowledge there are no reports on treatment of real textile and dyeing effluent at pilot scale completely bypassing the biological treatment of any kind and employing heterogeneous photocatalysis uv tio2 as an aop in combination with suitable filtration proprietary process and system such an innovation is expected to reduce the use of large amount and use of conventional chemicals reduce sludge reduce time of treatment and simultaneously producing process water quality enabling zero liquid discharge zld in true sense 2 materials and methods real wastewater sample from equalization tank of a cotton dyeing unit in andhra pradesh india was delivered by air and treated as soon as received in the installed pilot plant of 100 l per day treatment capacity representation of the overall system installed has been shown in fig 1 for primary treatment or stage 1 to 10 l wastewater sample previously optimised dose of an alkali earth metal oxide and saturated solution of polyelectrolyte was added proprietary formulation under fast stirring for 5 min and later slow stirring for 15 min thereafter the formed flocs could settle for about one hour or until clear supernatant is obtained thereafter stage 2 of the treatment was started with aeration of the supernatant to maintain dissolved oxygen do between 12 13 mg l 1 and improve oxidative action of n tio2 powdered nanomaterial to be added subsequently this n tio2 was synthesised using sol gel method as per our earlier reported protocol 21 obtained powdered nanomaterial had particle size between 9 14 nm as calculated from transmission electron micrographs tem obtained suspension was vigorously stirred and fine bubble aeration continued for 30 min thereafter suspension was left undisturbed for 30 min to attain adsorption desorption equilibrium the suspension was re aerated and well mixed for 10 min before being pumped to a photocatalytic reactor pcr patented design having optimised geometry and suitable uv light radiation source and treated under recirculation mode for 120 min thereafter the treated water was passed through an in house designed and developed assembly utilising suitable membrane filtration to separate used nanomaterial finally treated water was obtained and spent nano catalyst was recovered in order to mirror the current treatment being practised at commercial scale textile installations in india the treated water was passed through reverse osmosis ro membrane material type polyamide material spirally bound type thin film composite make csm korea and model of re4012 800 during final third stage of treatment ph electrical conductivity salinity temperature and total dissolved solids tds were analysed by pocket pro plus multi tester by hach

calibration laboratories india nabl accredited laboratory as per iso iec 17 025 2005 3 results and discussion fig 2 a c depicts uv vis spectra of three samples involved in two stage treatment of textile wastewater these samples include raw untreated wastewater post stage i involving physico chemical treatment post stage ii involving photocatalytic advanced oxidation process aop nanomaterial separation and ro filtration at final stage the respective pictures in the inset clearly establish the observation the ph of pre treated sample was 7 62 stage 1 treatment resulted in substantial removal in colour and reduction in tss which could clear the matrix of the sample thereby improving transparency hence light penetration required in subsequent photocatalytic treatment the ph changed to 9 5 after stage 1 treatment which prove to be highly beneficial in the downstream tio2 photocatalysis which require alkaline ph and did not involve use of any additional chemicals for ph adjustments 22 further stage 2 treatment resulted in complete decolourisation of effluent and reduction of dissolved organic content represented by characteristic peak around 280 nm 23 24 hence it could be clearly seen that complete treatment took place in two stages table 1 depicts in tabulated form the wastewater characteristics of pre and post treated samples along with compliance of standards of treated effluent from integrated textile units prescribed by national regulatory body the central pollution control board cpcb government of india 25 it is clear that quality of treated water was able to meet the standards prescribed by the industry for reuse back in their process and exceeded the prescribed standards of wastewater discharge notified by central pollution control board india 26 overall scheme led to 91 removal of cod and 95 removal of bod these values are significantly higher than those obtained in a reported study where real textile and dye house effluent was treated using coagulation alone having poly aluminium chloride as standalone coagulant where removal of cod and bod were 64 04 and 83 4 respectively 27 higher values of the presented work s cod and bod reductions are attributed to stage 2 treatment involving tio2 photocatalysis which results to in situ generation of highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals which resulted in oxidation degradation and mineralization of complex dye molecules and organics it may be seen that the raw sample had significant total nitrogen content mainly composed of organic nitrogen and ammonical nitrogen and post treatment the total nitrogen content was reduced by 61 6 it is evident that there is substantial reduction in tkn nitrite nitrogen whereas nitrate nitrogen concentration increased four times this indicates that the nitrogen in organic form i e nitrogen present in the azo dye structure is degraded into mineralised product nitrate nitrogen and loss of overall nitrogen maybe indicative of evolution of ammonical nitrogen this work is corollary to the previous study reported by co author on aniline removal using photocatalysis 22 28 in fig 3 a dried powdered sludge residue obtained after primary treatment stage 1 is shown it weighed about 4 g obtained while treating 10 l effluent i e dried sludge generation ratio of 0 4 kg m 3 which is 100 times lesser than earlier reported sludge generation ratio 42 6 kg m 3 on evaluation of running common effluent treatment plant cetp achieving zld in textile hub of tirupur in tamil nadu india 10 to further study nature of the sludge sem analysis was carried out and is shown in fig 3b edx analysis was carried out to understand the nature and elemental composition of the powder as depicted in fig 3c the interpretation of the edx is tabulated in fig 3d wherein results clearly indicate the breakdown of suspended solids and hardness present in wastewater it is also evident that no toxic elements are present in the residue making management of such sludge residues easier thus proposed treatment led to almost sludge free process and the minimal residue can be easily managed due to its low toxicity therefore the proposed treatment does not cause secondary pollution by transferring pollutants from water into sludge which is generally the case with conventional primary treatment processes other inorganic parameters like total hardness alkalinity chlorides etc have also been monitored and found to be significantly reduced which may be attributed to the use of membrane filtration systems for nanomaterial recovery and downstream ro the operational cost of the treatment at including chemical electrical energy consumption and sludge disposal has been estimated to be stage i 0 6 usd m3 stage ii 0 7 usd m3 stage iii 0 25 usd m3 i e total of 1 55 usd m3 which is comparable to the current cost of wastewater treatment in the industry which provided the sample and support this is estimated cost of end to end treatment at current pilot scale for textile and dyeing industrial wastewater it is noteworthy that this entire end to end treatment did not involve any kind of bioremediation at any stage or in other words we could completely bypass any kind of bioremediation in treatment of textile and dyeing effluent in comparison of the proposed treatment scheme with any of the reports of treatment of textile wastewater involving biological treatments for example sbr based biological treatment which took 24 h of hydraulic retention time leading to removal efficiencies of 93 and 99 cod and colour respectively 4 which means reported innovation is yet on high value in terms of tremendous reduction of time of overall treatment moreover hydroxyl radicals generated through photocatalytic treatment being non selective resulted in an approach which is less prone to failure during changes in effluent characteristics whereas biological systems are very much prone to such changes as load variation may cause microbial inactivation therefore the efficiency of the proposed three stage treatment of real dye effluent is much higher than the prevalent treatment protocols leading to much lesser time of treatment as compared to twenty four hour operation in the conventional biological systems alone smaller footprint with robust flexible and reliable system to handle varied characteristics of effluent recently published work by gilpavas et al which made use of another class of aop system to treat real dye house effluent at lab scale and also did not involve any form of bioremediation showed tremendous reduction in wastewater parameters like 97 in colour 77 in cod 81 in toc 48 in bod5 and 100 in acute toxicity 20 on comparing previously published results with findings of this study on wastewater quality parameters it is noteworthy that both reports are able to meet their respective national standards although findings of this study show higher degradation of cod and bod5 than the published work furthermore considering sludge generation aspects even without considering the spent activated charcoal from treatment earlier reported work is double in comparison to findings of this work comparison of overall operational costs show that the proposed scheme estimated the treatment rate to be 1 55 usd m3 which is lesser that 2 3 usd m3 reported by gilpavas et al 20 furthermore presented treatment scheme does not involve use of h2o2 or any other chemical whose storage and handling could be a potential hazard for overall environment and workers operating the plant the high efficiency of the system is established by the process water quality parameters obtained for the treated water which were also validated by the industry which provided the wastewater sample the quality of water entering ro feed was improved as the water entering ro was completely decolourized free from pathogens and dissolved organics which is expected to further improve ro membrane performance and lifespan ultimately leading to reduced overall operational expenditure the obtained water could be used for process requirements such as boiler feed cooling tower make up etc because the conductivity tds cod bod and chlorides were greatly reduced whereas presently the treated water quality characteristics limit its application in horticulture development or surface water discharge therefore novel end to end treatment proposed in this study emphasises on improved water re use efficiency and truly enabling zld 4 conclusion a novel patented end to end pilot scale treatment involving two stages has been presented to adequately treat real textile and dyeing industry wastewater to obtain process water quality overall bod and cod reduction achieved was 95 and 91 respectively with formation of negligible non toxic sludge 0 4 kg m 3 with estimated overall operational costs around 1 55 usd m3 and complete removal of total hardness total nitrogen and mineralisation of organic nitrogen into inorganic nitrogen along with significant reduction in chloride tss and tds content major benefits of the overall scheme involves clean green approach toxic sludge free scalable and robust technology with simultaneous disinfection bypassing bioremediation and involving around 5 h in complete treatment ensures lower footprint and high efficiency additional advantages include tremendous reduction in use of chemicals resources and operational costs proposed treatment is easily scalable for suitable field scale implementations due to the simplistic approach and design reuse of treated water as process water further ensures water re use efficiency and implementation of zero liquid discharge which is expected to reduce freshwater requirement and ensure sustainable management of water resources in

treatment scheme does not involve use of h2o2 or any other chemical whose storage and handling could be a potential hazard for overall environment and workers operating the plant the high efficiency of the system is established by the process water quality parameters obtained for the treated water which were also validated by the industry which provided the wastewater sample the quality of water entering ro feed was improved as the water entering ro was completely decolourized free from pathogens and dissolved organics which is expected to further improve ro membrane performance and lifespan ultimately leading to reduced overall operational expenditure the obtained water could be used for process requirements such as boiler feed cooling tower make up etc because the conductivity tds cod bod and chlorides were greatly reduced whereas presently the treated water quality characteristics limit its application in horticulture development or surface water discharge therefore novel end to end treatment proposed in this study emphasises on improved water re use efficiency and truly enabling zld 4 conclusion a novel patented end to end pilot scale treatment involving two stages has been presented to adequately treat real textile and dyeing industry wastewater to obtain process water quality overall bod and cod reduction achieved was 95 and 91 respectively with formation of negligible non toxic sludge 0 4 kg m 3 with estimated overall operational costs around 1 55 usd m3 and complete removal of total hardness total nitrogen and mineralisation of organic nitrogen into inorganic nitrogen along with significant reduction in chloride tss and tds content major benefits of the overall scheme involves clean green approach toxic sludge free scalable and robust technology with simultaneous disinfection bypassing bioremediation and involving around 5 h in complete treatment ensures lower footprint and high efficiency additional advantages include tremendous reduction in use of chemicals resources and operational costs proposed treatment is easily scalable for suitable field scale implementations due to the simplistic approach and design reuse of treated water as process water further ensures water re use efficiency and implementation of zero liquid discharge which is expected to reduce freshwater requirement and ensure sustainable management of water resources in

in adelaide they demonstrated that ann models have the capacity to predict chlorine concentrations in a distribution system to a great precision one of the drawbacks of wastewater disinfection is the formation of disinfection by products dbps and their removal from the wastewater it has been reported that regulated disinfection by products dbps are carcinogenic and teratogenic 13 moreover many

done in controlling and optimizing various wastewater treatments processes of which many were done through flc control 18 22 24 however there are not yet many researches on optimizing the chlorination disinfection process with an automatic control strategy that can be applied within wastewater treatment facilities in this work fuzzy control logic is integrated with ann system aiming to address this issue and provide a platform for automatic control of the chlorine disinfection process based on the ammonia and nitrite content of the water first ann is developed to model the disinfection process based on the ammonia and nitrite concentration in the feed which varies over time the on line output of the ann would then be utilized by the designed flc to characterize the current disinfection

human element 2 methodology was 103 2 1 ann development in this work ann is utilized as the tool for system characterization facilitating the establishment of a control system for the chlorination

throughout the chlorination breakpoint curve a typical chlorination breakpoint curve is shown in fig 1 given the ammonia and nitrite concentration of the feed to the disinfection unit the developed ann model is expected to depict the chlorination breakpoint curve and characterize the chlorine dose at which the maximum and minimum trc occur respectively data used as the feed for the training and validation of the ann was produced from a mechanistic model that is based on developed reactions kinetics model the developed model and its validation which was accomplished using real industrial data collected from a wastewater treatment facility in the region are published elsewhere by the same authors 25 the mechanistic model was used to generate large number of data points covering the minimum and the maximum possible values of ammonia and nitrite in a typical effluent of wastewater treatment plants table 1 shows the ranges of ammonia and nitrite concentrations considered for the data generation used in this work these are typical ranges for wastewater effluents the feed forward ann structure was selected with twenty hidden layers as illustrated in fig 2 the training step was performed using 70 of the experimental data through the function trainlm trainlm is among the most widely used training function as it follows levenberg marquardt training algorithm 10 2 2 development of the control scheme the essence of the control framework developed in this study is to optimize operation by maximizing chlorine quality and minimizing cost while operating at expenses within the plant s expected budget in which part of it is chlorine consumption the chlorination quality is maximized through promoting monochloramine or free chlorine disinfection action dichloramine which offers a weak disinfection capability and gives rise to bad taste and odor is formed in the middle region of the breakpoint curve 26 29 nitrogen trichloride on the other hand is formed past the breakpoint chlorination 27 as depicted in fig 1 given the feed composition of ammonia and nitrite an online system characterization can be achieved through the developed ann and a fuzzy control action is produced considering the plant s maximum chlorination capacity the simulink model of the control framework is displayed in fig 3 the control scheme has been used to simulate and control three possible scenarios to occur in the chlorination process the first is chlorine lying from zero to maximum trc the second where chlorine dose falls between maximum and minimum trc and the third is where it passes the minimum trc the controller should avoid chlorine dose operating in the middle region and alternate between maximum trc and minimum trc depending upon the maximum capacity of the plant matlab is utilized to develop the flc the fuzzy inference system applied in this study is mamdani this type of inference system is widely used in industrial applications 23 while the defuzzification used is the centre of gravity method cog as it represents the most intuitively acceptable defuzzification method that is widely utilized in actual applications 19 3 results and discussion in order to validate the strength of the generated network the sum of the squared differences between the experimental and the predicted values of trc is obtained and considered to be the performance function where smaller values predict strong correlation the generated regression plot is shown in fig 4 the ann was able to provide excellent prediction a sewage treatment plant in the region was selected as the study area of the current work the temperature variations that the plant may experience throughout the year affect the nitrification denitrification process causing a variation in ammonia and nitrite concentration at the effluent of the plant disinfection is achieved through gas chlorination normally with a fixed chlorine dosage throughout the year maintaining fixed chlorine dosage throughout the year against fluctuating ammonia and nitrite levels puts the plant at a risk of dichloramine formation or thm development if the disinfection system operates in the middle region or past the breakpoint respectively thus the use of control scheme for this disinfection process would improve the quality of the process at the wastewater treatment plant and may lead to decrease the cost of the chlorination practice and maximize ammonia reduction for the purpose of this study data from january to april 2016 is collected for parameters related to the disinfection process i e ammonia nitrite waste water treatment plant s effluent and chlorine dose data for ammonia levels is displayed in fig 5 as can be seen there is a sound variation of ammonia levels through the months while the plant achieves a discharge with zero ammonia levels intermittently it may in some days release effluents with intense ammonia levels as high as 20 ppm nitrite levels were not devoid of variations as well through the study period fig 6 shows that nitrite levels fluctuated soundly within a range of 0 to 4 ppm fig 7 shows that chlorine dosage ppm cl2 remains relatively constant throughout the study period despite the fluctuation in nitrite and ammonia content in the feed water the results fig 6 demonstrate that relatively high chlorine dosages appeared on 11 march 40 ppm with another peak appeared on 16 march a fixed amount of chlorine is normally added to the secondary effluent of the wastewater treatment plant and thus the fluctuation in chlorine concentration could be due to less feed flow to the wastewater of the plant during this screening the regions of the breakpoint curve at which the chlorination is operating over the study period fig 8 demonstrated that the plant periodically operates at the middle region or past the breakpoint this indicates according to fig 1 a possible formation of the harmful dichloramine and nitrogen trichloride recalling that zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 represent the three regions of the breakthrough curve zone 1 is the region up to the first peak fig 1 where monochloroamine is usually dominate and does most of the disinfection action zone 2 starts from the first peak until the minimum fig 1 it has mainly dichloromine and has very diinfection effect and gives bad smell zone 3 is the region after the minimum fig 1 where free chlorine starts to dominate it is the region for best disinfection but needs more chlorine amount than the first zone thus the aim is to stay away from the second zone where dochloamine is dominate with weak disinfection optimally it is needed to stay around the first peak in the first zone and around the minimum near the third zone fig 8 the simulink simulation was run for the plant s data over the study period to assess the performance of the control scheme ammonia nitrite outage flow initial chlorine dose rate and the maximum chlorine dosage rate as given by the plant s engineer are fed to the simulation model where the improved chlorine dose rate is its output the controlled chlorine dosage for the period of four months is displayed in fig 9 it can be said that the use of flc served the system to avoid operating in the middle region of the breakpoint chlorination system i e zone 2 in addition to improving the quality of the disinfection the flc was able to save the chlorine consumption during a short study period of three months the controller reduced the chlorine consumption from 264 000 kg to 216 000 kg causing a reduction of 18 18 of chlorine expenses 4 conclusions the devised research work was successfully able to develop an ann model for the prediction of the chlorination behaviour it also facilitated the establishment of a novel control scheme

14248,with the increasing awareness of environmental protection and establishment of strict policy measures requiring more than 85 recovery rate of wastewater in the science park water recycling has become an important issue in several electronic industries such as semiconductor photovoltaic and solar energy industries among the different types of wastewater the dicing and grinding wastewater generated in the ic packaging and testing industry is a colloid containing insoluble sio2 particles such wastewater exhibits high turbidity and low electrical conductivity and can be recovered by simple physical methods however the recovery efficiency of the equipment used for recycling wastewater is often degraded by clogging due to the high turbidity of wastewater in addition the high chemical stability of the suspended sio2 particles makes it difficult for them to sediment from the suspension state and presents a greater challenge to remove these even by conventional methods such as the addition of chemicals which facilitate coagulation and sedimentation therefore the sio2 particles produce a considerable amount of sludge which causes secondary pollution in view of the above recycling tests of cutting and grinding wastewater were performed in this study using a suitable ultrafiltration uf membrane without the addition of any extra chemicals the results of the study show that the most important factors associated with the application of a uf membrane in addition to basic material strength selection of pore size low water turbidity and good water quality are the performance recovery of the membrane after it is blocked and methods for improving the recycling rate of the device to avoid the formation of a permanent blockage the uf membrane must be backwashed within 2 h of its use for collecting wastewater in addition the effect of cleaning on the uf membrane after it is blocked is related linearly to the concentration of the chemical used for cleaning and the temperature of the cleaning agent when the concentration and temperature are lower than 0 15 and 45 respectively to increase the recovery rate the wastewater is collected and recycled in the dead end mode whereas the collection time and backwashing frequency are reduced or increased according to the increase in turbidity of the wastewater in this study it was observed that the uf membrane was very effective in reducing the turbidity and suspended solids of wastewater due to the presence of pore structures in the membrane however the appropriate filtration mode of the uf membrane should be selected based on the actual quality of the wastewater and results of pilot tests the use of a uf membrane was established to be the most environmentally benign method for recycling wastewater without the addition of chemicals keywords dead end cross flow wafer dicing wastewater uf membrane 1 introduction recent years have witnessed an increase in water consumption in industrial sectors particularly in the semiconductor industry where water is essential for production therefore recycling and reuse of wastewater has become an important issue this study focussed on the treatment of wafer dicing and grinding wastewater generated in the ic packaging factory 1 2 where the wastewater is recycled by suitable means to pure water and reused during the wafer packaging and testing process the protection layer is flattened by grinding and the large circular wafer is diced into small dies these processes require a large amount of ultrapure water for cleaning and cooling the sample as well as removing the silicon particles generated during the dicing and grinding process 3 wastewater produced from these two sources is of high quality having an electrical conductivity lower than 10 μs cm as it is generated from ultrapure water in both the cases however it contains a large amount of suspended silicon particles which result in high water turbidity ranging between 2000 and 15000 ntu and a deep water colour darker than espresso this may become a great source of pollution if not recycled and reused properly if it is discharged into a wastewater treatment plant a considerable amount of coagulant would be required to allow the suspended silicon particles to precipitate which would not only produce immense chemical waste but also cause severe sludge pollution to the local environment if the suspended particles are separated from the liquid the wastewater can then be directly recycled to the pure water system considering an annual wastewater generation rate this method would yield an annual saving money therefore the separation approach can bring about huge economic benefits in wastewater treatment and achieve multiple targets at the same time however the low solubility and small diameter of the silicon particles suspended in the wastewater make it difficult for them to settle and easy to block the uf membrane in view of the characteristics of this wastewater the study without dosing any chemical operation we choose uf ultrafiltration membrane for the pilot in particular the filtration operation of the membrane is affected by multiple factors such as the characteristics of the membrane quality of the water source operating conditions and the chemical characteristics of the solution among these the operating flux and tmp are the two most important factors which determine the successful functioning of the membrane nagaoka et al 1998 4 the critical flux of the uf membrane is defined as the maximum allowable filtration flux of the membrane system that can be maintained in a continuous efficient operation the concept of critical flux was first proposed by field et al 1995 5 who performed filtration experiments with yeast cells in both flat sheet and tubular membrane systems and observed that the tmp does not increase with time when the filtration flux is below a critical value in later studies different researchers have proposed different ideas on the critical flux chan et al 2002 6 and husiman et al 1999 7 plotted a correlation diagram between the tmp and average filtration flux they defined the critical flux as the point where the slope of the correlation curve starts to increase significantly chio et al 2005 8 found that the operating conditions provided by the manufacturer of the uf membrane can only be used as a reference as the actual operating conditions vary with different types of water bodies therefore the most suitable membrane and the associated operating method for achieving the desired performance must be determined by pilot tests lin 2005 9 therefore in this study we investigated the separation performance of silicon particles in the wafer dicing and grinding wastewater by using a uf membrane the effect of particle size on the blockage in the uf membrane optimisation of the operating parameters in the separation process and the overall recycling benefits 2 material and methods in this research study uf membranes are used to filter and recycle the wafer dicing and grinding wastewater generated in ic packaging and test factories based on the amount of water collected by the membrane change in the trans membrane pressure tmp change in the backwashing frequency and change in the water collection duration we obtained the optimal processing parameters such as the amount of wastewater collected duration of sample collection backwashing frequency concentration of chemicals used in clean in place cip time and temperature with these optimum parameters we further derived the operation cost of the wastewater treatment system and the capital payback period finally the overall benefit of the study was assessed by combining all the aforementioned features fig 1 shows the detailed flow chart of the research method 2 1 testing device and materials the most important factor to be considered in the selection of the uf membrane is the size of the particles suspended in the wastewater the particle size is measured by first shooting a laser into the wastewater and then analysing the intensity of the light reflected from the particle the light intensity enables the calculation of the size of the particles in the wastewater where d nm is the particle size g d is the gaussian distribution and c d is the cumulative distribution the location where the cumulative number reaches 50 represents the midpoint the membrane developed by d company 10 shown in table 1 was used for performing the test in our experiments it is an outside in ultrafiltration uf membrane with an average pore size of 0 036 μm made of polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf the membrane itself is a hollow fibre with an inner diameter of 0 9 mm and an outer diameter of 1 9 mm the total surface area weight length and diameter of the membrane are 52 m2 25 kg 1860 mm and 2000 mm respectively the diameter of the water inlet and outlet pore is 50 mm the diameter of the concentrated water port is 32 mm and the diameter of the air inlet is 9 5 mm as shown in fig 2 table 2 shows the constraints on the operating conditions of the uf membrane provided by the manufacturer the maximum water inlet pressure is 3 0 kg cm2 and the recommended inlet pressure is less than 2 5 kg cm2 the operating tmp should not exceed 2 1 kg cm2 and the recommended operating condition is 1 0 kg cm2 the smaller the tmp the easier it is to perform the backwashing the water collection flux can range as 40 120 l m2 hr however the actual flux depends on the quality of the wastewater a clearer water source can allow for a greater water collecting flux and vice versa the collection flux is an important parameter affecting the capital cost operating cost and the backwashing frequency of the wastewater recycling process the maximum operating temperature of the membrane is less than 50 c as exposing the membrane to a temperature higher than 50 for more than 2 h will destroy the structure of the membrane the operating ph range and maximum chemical oxidant concentration that the membrane can withstand is 2 11 and 2000 mg l of naocl respectively operating the membrane beyond these ranges will cause it to corrode or get oxidised resulting in destruction of its internal structure 2 2 testing process fig 3 shows the testing process of the experiment the first step is to collect relevant information such as the integration of processing technologies methods for analysing the experimental results and the associated research methods and steps the second step is to analyse the characteristics of the wastewater the desired uf membrane is selected according to the quality of the wastewater based on the principle that the pore size of the uf membrane must be smaller than the minimum size of the particles the third step is to perform the actual tests under different operating conditions 2 3 testing device and physical units the testing device and the schematic of the physical units are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the following components are included in the testing device 1 m3 of raw testing water a water feeding pump a 150 μm filter used for pre treating the water a uf membrane with a pore size of 0 036 μm a 250 l cip tank a backwash pump control valves pipelines and an electrical control system 2 4 testing conditions and steps the optimum parameters for smooth operation of the uf membrane are based on the results of the following tests 1 the test of change in the water collection quantity vs tmp which is expected to yield the suitable amount of water collected in low tmp conditions the tests are performed with different water collecting fluxes at 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 0 m3 hr over 70 days the change in tmp is recorded during the testing period for each of the flux conditions 2 the test of water collection quantity vs water collection period which is expected to yield the most suitable and economic water collection cycle the curves of change in the water collection quantity vs water collection period are obtained by testing with different water collecting fluxes at 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 0 m3 hr over 70 days 3 the test of water collection quantity vs backwashing frequency the tests are performed with three water collecting fluxes at 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 0 m3 hr the membrane is backwashed when the water quantity is reduced by 10 15 the cycle and amount of water collected are recorded during the tests and plotted as curves for determining the suitable backwashing frequency and water collection quantity which yield the best economic value during a stable and continuous operation the second factor is important for ensuring a stable long term operation for industrial mass production 4 during the operation with optimum water collecting quantity and optimum backwashing frequency determined from the experiment a cip chemical cleaning must be performed if the amount of water collected is insufficient or the pressure loss is too high the chemical cleaning is specifically performed with different operating parameters such as the concentration temperature and time an optimised combination of the parameters is determined and used for yielding better economic value a high pressure loss can easily induce the formation of deep blockage in the uf membrane if the designed water filtration quantity cannot be recovered by backwashing then a cip chemical cleaning must be performed for 4 h however keeping the filtrating system offline for too long will cause a new issue of insufficient recovery rate 3 results and discussion in this study a uf membrane based filtration system is used to perform the experimental tests which were carried out for more than two months in order to ensure a stable result the recovery effect of backwashing on the membrane was analysed and the operating parameters were optimised according to the changes in the recorded data finally we evaluated the economic value of a physical factory based on the experimental results and derived the capital payback period of the wastewater treatment system in our pilot simulation of a real factory the wastewater was routed by different pipeline systems and characterised in terms of its electrical conductivity toc turbidity and other water quality the wastewater samples with high economic value were recycled separately using the uf membrane filtration system without the addition of any chemicals the performance of the uf membrane system was evaluated by sampling the filtered water and testing its quality at fixed time intervals the water collecting flux recorded during the tests and its impact on the blockage in the membrane and the backwashing frequency are summarised as described below 3 1 analysis of raw wastewater in this study the wastewater generated from five identical process lines in a company with suitable for water quality was used for the tests the quality of the wastewater was analysed and summarised in table 3 as shown from line 1 to line 5 the toc value of the wastewater samples ranges as 0 58 0 79 all the toc values are lesser than 1 ppm in comparison the toc requirement for tap water is 3 ppm the change in toc of the mixture with time is shown in fig 6 after operating for one month the quality of water samples associated with all the process lines meets the recycling requirement of toc 1 ppm in addition the electrical conductivity of the water samples ranged as 6 4 8 9 μs cm which is lesser than 10 μs cm this indicates that the electrical conductivity of the water samples treated in our tests is even lower than that of water treated by the common reverse osmosis ro process making it more valuable for recycling the solubility of the sio2 particles ranged as 3 4 5 8 ppm which is lesser than 10 ppm indicating a better water quality than tap water which only requires sio2 20 ppm the wastewater samples investigated in this study were characterised by high turbidity in the range of 1980 3260 ntu and high ss in the range of 345 481 ppm the major contributor to high turbidity is the large amount of insoluble silicon particles which are generated during the dicing process of the silicon wafer the ph value of the waste water ranged between 6 4 and 6 8 therefore it is inferred that the wastewater is generated solely from the rinsing activity of ultrapure water without the addition of any chemical agents the study by luo et al 2001 1 indicated that the composition of cmp wastewater can vary substantially with different grinding fluids based on the grinding level of the oxide layer and metal layer the suspended particles can remain stable in the turbid alkali metal solution with a ph ranging between 8 0 and 9 5 the wastewater generated from the grinding process of the metal layer contains aluminium oxide particles and many other oxidising agents e g h2o2 fe no3 3 kio3 therefore it is acidic with a ph value ranging between 2 and 4 however the study by luo et al did not characterise the electrical conductivity and toc of the wastewater therefore it cannot be compared with our study directly nevertheless the ph of the wastewater explored by luo et al was either basic or acidic which is very different from the ph of 6 4 6 8 of the wastewater used in our experiment therefore the quality of wastewater in our test is much better than that of the cmp water as the latter contains a large amount of oxidants and acid or alkali substances the study by luo et al was focussed more on the recycling of wastewater at the end section of the pipeline where the source of the wastewater exhibits complex water qualities an increasing number of variables results in a higher cost for treating the wastewater as well as lower recovery rate and economic benefits the major difference between our experiment and the one performed by luo et al is that the wastewater is recycled from the source of the process coordinated with the liquid routing pipelines the quality of the water selected for treatment is controlled precisely by the instrument before filtration to meet the requirement of the inlet water in our experiments in other words only the wastewater that can bring economic value after recycling is selected for performing the tests as the uf membrane is used as the sole treatment unit in our experiment our treatment system contains very few parameters and does not require any additional chemicals these features greatly reduce the secondary pollution and improve the overall recovery rate as well as recovery benefits in this study the uf membrane is used as the main core processing unit in addition to the toc analysis performed in the distributed pipeline for tackling the highly frequent blockage issue in the membrane the size distribution of the particles is also investigated to provide a basis for the selection of pore size of the uf membrane fig 7 shows the characterisation results of the particle size distribution where the x axis shows the particle size in units of nm and the y axis shows the relative quantity percentage pertaining to each particle size with a total percentage of 100 the results show that the relative quantities of particles of size 116 5 nm minimum size 123 5 nm 130 8 nm 138 8 nm 146 6 nm 370 nm 392 nm 415 3 nm 440 nm 466 1 nm and 493 nm are 0 9 1 4 1 8 0 9 0 46 1 4 5 6 14 47 8 24 3 and 2 34 respectively the pore size being the most important factor to determine the type of uf membrane is dependent on the minimum particle size specifically the desirable membrane must have a pore size smaller than the minimum particle size in order to prevent smaller particles from penetrating it and blocking the pores based on the above data the final pore size of the uf membrane must be smaller than 116 5 nm in addition the uf membrane is to be operated within a certain pressure range 0 5 3 kg cm2 under normal operating conditions in this operating pressure range as a pore size of 0 1 μm is only slightly smaller than 0 116 μm the possibility of a particle penetrating the pore under pressure is similar to that between these two pore sizes therefore a uf membrane with a pore size of 0 03 μm is selected in our study a uf membrane with a smaller pore size 0 01 μm is undesirable since the water production per unit area is too low and the unit cost is too high from the material perspective pvdf is selected due to its strong chemical resistance and mechanical properties however the surface of the material must be coated with a hydrophilic film to maintain a certain flux this feature can serve as a reference for selection of the membrane pore 3 2 analysis of test results of different parameters tests were performed with different parameters to determine the optimum operating parameters for the uf membrane fig 8 shows the test for the change in the water collection quantity vs the change in tmp such a test is expected to yield the quantity of water collected that is suitable for a low tmp condition fig 9 shows the test for the water collection quantity vs time such a test is expected to yield the change in water collection quantity per unit time which can be used to derive the most appropriate and economic water collection quantity and period fig 10 shows the curves for different water collection quantities vs the backwashing frequency these are expected to yield the most suitable backwashing frequency and an economic water collection quantity that can provide a stable long term water filtration as the duration of the cip chemical cleaning is approximately 4 h the wastewater recycling system will be offline for a long time which results in an insufficient recovery rate fig 11 provides a confirmation of the chemical cleaning performance which can potentially yield a blockage in future the cip chemical cleaning is performed with different concentrations at different times and temperatures the most suitable and economic chemical cleaning parameters such as concentration time and temperature are recorded and used as a reference for determining the optimum operating parameters 3 2 1 test for water collection quantity vs tmp the tmp tests were performed using three different water collection quantities according to the recommendations provided by the original manufacturer the backwashing frequency was set as 1 h time in our tests to determine the best relationship fig 8 shows the test results obtained using water collection quantities of 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 m3 hr by observing the change in the tmp curve it was ascertained that the tmp associated with a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr drops to 0 72 kg cm2 on the 70th day this result agrees well with the behaviour described by the membrane manufacturer if the operation condition of the tmp is controlled to be lesser than 1 0 kg cm 2 the pressure increases with a small slope of 0 34 however the reason that the curve is non smooth is because different operating temperatures affect the pore size of the membrane in addition the recovery rate varies for each automatic backwashing the uf membrane is not a rigid membrane and consists of large as well as small pores with an average pore size of 0 03 μm when the water body starts to flow the flow becomes turbulent which signifies a chaotic environment for the particles if a particle of size smaller than 0 1 μm blocks a pore in the membrane of size 0 2 μm then the tmp rises faster and vice versa this is why the curve becomes non smoothr in addition the tmp was observed to be 0 80 kg cm2 on the 70th day with a water collection capacity of 1 5 m3 hr such a result is in accordance with the recommendation of an operating tmp smaller than 1 0 kg cm2 by the manufacturer however the slope of the rising curve is 0 39 which is slightly higher than the slope of 1 0 m3 hr this is because the increase in water collection quantity by 0 5 m3 hr also results in an increase in the relative magnitude of the water inlet pressure with respect to the tmp when using the last group of parameters the tmp reaches the alert level of 0 80 kg cm2 after operating with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr for 55 days compared to the case of a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr the tmp alert level of 0 80 kg cm2 is reached 15 days earlier the risk may be even higher in practical applications considering that the filtration system needs to operate efficiently for more than 3 years the safety factor should be designed more precisely when operating with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr for 70 days the tmp reaches as high as 1 02 kg cm2 while the slope reaches 0 69 however according to the data provided by the uf membrane manufacturer a cip chemical cleaning must be performed when the tmp exceeds 1 0 kg cm2 therefore the last group of parameters is not suitable for operation with the given water quality otherwise the recovery of the filtration performance of the membrane after it is blocked may not be able to reach the original design value of the water collection quantity based on personal and the company s experience of working with the uf membrane the safety factor should be adjusted by 20 more accurately in other words a chemical cleaning should be performed when the tmp exceeds 0 8 kg cm2 in order to ensure good recovery of the filtration performance summary as shown by the experimental results in fig 8 the tmp of the third test group reaches the alert level of 0 80 kg cm2 after the system is operated for 55 days with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr after operating for 70 days the tmp of the filtration system already exceeds the recommended chemical cleaning level of 1 02 kg cm2 therefore cleaning the membrane may not yield a satisfactory result at this point which means a permanent blockage may have already formed in the membrane therefore such operating parameters are not recommended in practice the tmp of the first test group remains at around 0 72 kg cm2 after the system is operated for 70 days with a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr while the tmp value is lower than the recommended value of 1 0 kg cm2 provided by the membrane manufacturer this set of operating parameters is still not recommended due to the low economic benefits specifically a low water collection quantity means more membranes will be required to increase the water recycling rate which will inevitably increase the capital cost therefore a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr is selected as the best operating condition the tmp of this test group is 0 80 kg cm2 after the system is operated for 70 days with a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr such a tmp value is still lower than the operating condition of 1 0 kg cm2 recommended by the membrane manufacturer the slope of the curve is only 0 39 hence the curve is much smoother than that with the slope of 0 69 for a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr as shown in fig 8 the tmp already exceeds 0 80 kg cm2 when operating at 2 0 m3 hr therefore considering long term safety of operation a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr is selected as the optimum parameter in addition it is also a more economic selection than a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr as a uf membrane of pore size 0 03 μm is used in these experiments the quality of the treated water does not differ significantly when using a water collecting quantity of 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr or 2 m3 hr in particular the turbidity of water is lesser than 0 05 ntu after filtration in all the three cases given that the owner only requires a turbidity of less than 0 1 ntu the quality of the recycled water is not considered as an evaluation criterion in this test 3 2 2 test for change in water collection quantity vs time the tests were performed by recording the change in three different water collection quantities with time a backwash was performed at a constant frequency of 1 h according to the recommendations of the manufacturer the best correlation was expected to be obtained based on these tests fig 9 shows the curves of the change in the water collection quantities of 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 0 m3 hr vs time we first consider the case where the system is operated for 70 days when the water collection quantity was set as 1 0 m3 hr the water quantity remained relatively stable over the entire 70 days when it was set as 1 5 m3 hr the water quantity started to decrease to 1 44 m3 hr on the 65th day and 1 36 m3 hr on the 70th day when the water collection quantity was set as 2 0 m3 hr it decreased to 1 9 m3 hr on the 27th day and continued decreasing at a faster rate on the 55th day the water collection quantity had already dropped to 1 5 m3 hr a faster reduction was observed on the 60th day where the water collection quantity was reduced from 1 4 m3 hr to 1 13 m3 hr from the 60th to the 70th day the rate at which the water collection quantity decreased was much faster than that when the water collection quantity was set at 1 5 m3 hr on comparing figs 8 and 9 it is observed that the uf membrane with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr experiences the most severe blockage on the 60th day such a blockage can lead to a substantial reduction in the water collection quantity when the tmp becomes higher summary the change in water collection volume with time is the fastest at the same backwash frequency when setting the water collection quantity to 2 0 m3 hr this is because given the same membrane area for the suspended particles in the turbid water a greater water collection quantity can result in a relatively higher loading on the particles therefore when the water collection quantity was set to 2 0 m3 hr the value dropped to 1 99 m3 hr on the 27th day dropped from 1 5 m3 hr to 1 46 m3 hr on the 55th day and to 1 13 m3 hr on the 70th day compared to the tmp shape the water collection quantity was already exceeding 1 0 kg cm2 therefore this set of operating data is not selected for analysis however the curve with a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr started to decrease gradually to 1 49 m3 hr on the 68th day the reduction in magnitude is not very high and the comparison with the tmp curve satisfies the recommended values by testing the backwashing frequency for three different water collection quantities we expect to obtain the most suitable relationship the turbidity of the wastewater source in the range of 1980 3260 ntu is considered to be ultra high in this experiment the filtration is operated in a dead end mode for details refer to 04 the characteristics of the dead end mode are that the selection of the specifications of the pump is consistent with the amount of water produced in other words no further improvement in the pump specification is required which saves considerable energy cost if the cross flow method is selected the pump must be enlarged 3 5 times from the turbidity perspective the cross flow method demands more energy compared to the dead end method however to operate in the dead end mode requires an increase in the backwashing frequency higher turbidity of the water source requires higher backwashing frequency therefore different backwashing frequencies were tested for different water collection quantities to obtain the optimum value fig 10 shows the changes in the curves for the three water collection quantities with time at room temperature 25 28 c after the backwashing process the backwashing is performed when the predicted water reduction due to backwashing ranges as 10 15 this is because according to the recommendations of the membrane manufacturer and from personal experience the water inlet pressure must be higher than 0 3 0 5 kg cm2 to produce the same amount of water when the water volume exceeds 15 however with a fixed frequency of the pump the same water generation rate cannot be replicated furthermore the pores inside the uf membrane will be clogged even more severely and no suitable solutions are found in many cases table 4 presents the backwashing parameters provided by the membrane manufacturer due to the warranty conditions associated with the membrane manufacturer backwash must be performed according to its operating condition this experiment is performed with a fixed water collection quantity therefore the experimental steps involve the following the top to bottom backwashing flux is fixed at 60 l m2 hr as the total surface area of the membrane is 52 m2 multiplying it with the flux yields a flow rate of 3120 m3 hr for backwashing for more than 10 s the total amount of water consumed would be 520 l time each of the top to bottom and bottom to top backwashes are performed once for the first group the volume of water delivered is reduced by 15 when operating with a water collecting quantity of 2 0 m3 hr for 1 h at this point a backwash is required to clean the membrane a similar working condition is maintained with an operating time up to 24 h for the second group a backwash is required when the volume of water delivered is reduced by 15 as the system is operated with a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr for 2 h a similar working condition is maintained with an operating time up to 24 h for the third group a backwash is required when the volume of water delivered is reduced by 15 as the system is operated with a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr for 3 h a similar working condition is maintained with an operating time up to 24 h summary operating the system at a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr for 3 h before backwashing the membrane is a preferable choice however taking the water collection quantity and the economic benefits into consideration operating the system at a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr for 2 h before backwashing the membrane is more suitable operating with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr is undesirable because frequent backwashes can result in frequent expansion of the membrane and the fibres and pores in the membrane become prone to fracture based on personal experience the lift time of the uf membrane is closely related to the frequency of backwash frequency of cleaning operating pressure and in particular the tmp in general it is undesirable to have a tmp exceeding 0 80 kg cm2 in a short time in this study we have again established that using a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr is a better option than using 2 0 m3 hr for filtering the wastewater considered in this study using the uf membrane with a fixed material composition a higher frequency of backwash and cleaning reduces the lifetime of a uf membrane in addition it is also undesirable to have the tmp reaching the alert level too early as corrosion from chemicals and conditions of high pressure will cause it to degrade earlier 3 2 3 confirmation of chemical cleaning performance based on the conclusion of an optimum water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr and a backwashing time of 2 h obtained from the previous analysis the tmp is controlled at 1 kg cm2 to test the optimum chemical concentration time and temperature for cip cleaning table 5 shows the chemical cleaning parameters provided by the membrane manufacturer to abide by the warranty requirement chemical cleaning must be performed when the conditions are satisfied in this test the chemical cleaning experiments are only performed with a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr and backwashing period of 2 h therefore based on the data provided by the membrane manufacturer the first step is to fix the chemical cleaning flux at 120 l m2 hr as the total surface area of the membrane is 52 m2 multiplying it with the flux yields a flow rate of 6240 l hr for chemical cleaning for more than 30 min the total amount of chemical solution used for cleaning the membrane is 3120 l time the chemical cleaning must be carried out when the tmp exceeds 0 8 kg cm2 or when the total amount of water delivered is 15 less than the design value in addition a 2 h backwash has already been performed on the membrane but fails to recover its filtration performance at this point a chemical cleaning must be performed the experiment is conducted from three aspects 1 with respect to the concentration of chemical agents we need to observe the recovery rate of water production and find the most suitable chemical concentration needed for the cleaning 2 identifying the most suitable cleaning time by adding the chemical appropriately 3 adjusting the cleaning temperature to improve the activation energy and solubility identifying the most economically desired operating temperature and then confirming the recovery of the water intake by cross comparison after the uf membrane is cleaned 3 2 3 1 effect of chemical cleaning concentration on membrane cleaning most of the substances in the water body are sio2 particles therefore considering that the material is at room temperature naoh is used as the cleaning agent based on the recommendations by the membrane manufacturer and the literature of charles et al according to the recommendations listed in table 5 given by the membrane manufacturer the cleaning period is fixed at 30 min and the inlet pressure is set as 0 7 kg cm2 the concentration of the naoh cleaning agent is set as 0 05 0 3 according to the recommended chemical concentration range given by the manufacturer therefore we performed tests using four different concentration data 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 the data of membrane cleaning chemical concentration and water collection quantity recovery curves are compiled in fig 11 according to the recommendations of the membrane manufacturer first it is observed that with a chemical concentration of 0 05 and a cleaning period of 30 min the water collection quantity rises slightly back to 1 33 1 38 m3 hr during the second observation with a chemical concentration of 0 1 and a cleaning period of 30 min the water collection quantity rises back to 1 43 1 48 m3 hr which is still lesser than the designed value of 1 5 m3 hr as shown in the fig 11 when using a chemical concentration of 0 15 and 0 2 and a cleaning time of 30 min the water collection quantity can be recovered to even higher values exceeding the original design of 1 5 m3 hr reaching as high as 1 73 m3 hr summary it is apparent that the effect of high chemical concentration is positive on the cleaning performance however when the concentration reaches a certain threshold further increase in the concentration yields a similar cleaning performance therefore using a concentration of 0 15 and 0 2 can yield a very close recovery rate according to the recommendations provided by the uf membrane manufacturer it is better to attain the target performance with the minimum concentration this is because a higher concentration causes greater damage to the membrane further a high chemical concentration also involves a higher operating cost finally 0 15 naoh was selected as the most suitable cleaning chemical with the best concentration 3 2 3 2 effect of duration of chemical cleaning on membrane cleaning the chemical cleaning is performed at room temperature 25 28 for durations of 20 min 25 min 30 min and 35 min to determine the optimum cleaning time using a concentration of 0 15 from fig 11 the recovery data of water collection quantity is obtained during the first 20 min of cleaning the maximum recovery rate reaches only 1 43 m3 hr from table 6 on the contrary with a cleaning of more than 25 min the recovery rate is restored to 1 50 m3 hr in most cases and reaches as high as 1 71 m3 hr for other cleaning durations such as 30 min and 35 min the recovered water collection quantity is greater than 1 5 m3 hr however extension of the cleaning time did not bring about a better cleaning performance than that obtained with 25 min therefore it is apparent that the chemical cleaning time of 25 min is very close to the most suitable value summary the original concentration test is performed using 30 min as the base the best cleaning concentration is found to be 0 15 based on this concentration the samples are cleaned for different time periods among these cleaning the sample for 25 min can achieve the desired result after extending the time by 1 min 26 min is finally chosen as the total cleaning period and input into the plc auto control system for performing the cleaning 3 2 3 3 effect of chemical cleaning temperature on membrane cleaning taking a chemical concentration of 0 15 and a cleaning period of 26 min from the previous experiments new chemical cleaning tests were performed at different temperatures to analyse whether changing the temperature can improve the cleaning performance activation energy and solubility a study by mansoor et al in 2006 11 proposed that the cleaning temperature should be set at around 60 however a maximum temperature of 50 was used in this study according to the recommendations of the membrane manufacturer as overheating would destroy the structure of the membrane the objective of this experiment is to obtain the optimum temperature based on the optimum concentration and duration so that the best cleaning recovery rate can be achieved with the minimum energy consumption as demonstrated in table 7 in general a temperature between 25 c and 30 c is considered as room temperature our experimental system heats the chemical solutions to 35 c 40 c 45 c and 50 c due to electrical heating four experiments are performed immediately afterwards the previous tests of determining the water collection quantity and tmp were all performed at room temperature in this experiment the best operating parameters obtained from the previous experiments were used for performing the tests in addition raising the operating temperature to 35 c 40 c 45 c and 50 c can recover the water collection quantity to 1 73 m3 hr 1 76 m3 hr 2 02 m3 hr and 2 05 m3 hr respectively summary although the cleaning performances at 45 c and 50 c are only different by 0 03 m3 hr the water consumption rate in an actual factory can reach several hundred tons per hour therefore the chemical cleaning temperature is selected to be 45 c considering the greater economic benefits the reason that heating the solution to 45 c produces such a significant improvement according to personal understanding can be rationalised based on a similar example of regeneration of ultrapure water resin whereby using hot alkali naoh can increase the solubility and activation energy by exchanging the resin for sio2 considering that the substances contained in this wastewater are also sio2 particles the same mechanism should be able to explain the improvement in chemical cleaning performance at higher temperatures 3 3 integration of the most suitable operating parameters through the aforementioned experiments the optimum operating parameters for the uf membrane are summarised in table 8 in the semiconductor packaging industry the significance of these parameters for treating the dicing and grinding wastewater is reflected in the economic benefits in practice therefore using a membrane surface area of 52 m2 and a uf membrane flux of 28 8 l m2 hr the hourly wastewater collection rate is 1 5 m3 hr and the collection period is 120 min 2 h the total amount of water collected is 3 0 m3 hr the automatic backwashing process is set based on the recommended parameters provided by the membrane manufacturer as listed in table 4 when the tmp 0 8 kg cm2 the filtration system is stopped and the membrane is cleaned by chemicals to provide a chemical cleaning flux of 120 l m2 hr on the membrane with a surface area of 52 m2 requires 6 24 m3 hr every hour however the experimental results show that the cleaning of the membrane requires 26 min therefore the total chemical consumption is 0 15 of naoh 2 7t time summary after completion of the experiments the relevant data were used in the practical operation of a company for five years thus far the operation condition remains good the quality of the recycled water is stable and the volume of water recycled is maintained at the design value therefore the proposed method to recycle wastewater is proved to be capable of facilitating economic benefits 3 3 1 analysis of water quality after recycling there is no significant change in the electrical conductivity toc solubility of sio2 and ph due to the membrane in the wastewater that is recycled by using the optimum operating parameters listed in table 8 table 9 shows a comparison of the water quality before and after the filtration the toc of water before and after filtration is 0 67 ppm and 0 65 ppm respectively apparently use of the uf membrane is not an ideal method for reducing the toc the electrical conductivity of water before and after filtration is 7 5 μs cm and 7 8 μs cm respectively the increase in the electrical conductivity is attributed to a measurement error or dissolving of co2 in the water body the solubility of sio2 in water before and after filtration is 5 8 ppm and 5 6 ppm respectively the use of the uf membrane does not have a significant effect on the solubility however the turbidity of the water before and after filtration is 2100 ntu and 0 09 ntu respectively more than 99 999 of the turbidity is reduced by the filtration in addition the ss of the water is 350 ppm before filtration but non detectable nd after filtration therefore the uf membrane is excellent in reducing the turbidity and ss of the wastewater as all the qualities of water are already monitored in table 3 we only need to monitor the change in the turbidity and ss of the wastewater after filtration this practice can considerably save on the expense of the inspection fee fig 12 shows the effectiveness chart of turbidity removal by the uf membrane targeting different types of high turbidity water bodies as shown in the chart even for wastewater with an extremely high turbidity of 14500 ntu use of the uf membrane can still reduce the turbidity to 0 05 ntu with a removal efficiency greater than 99 999 however a pre requisite to the high turbidity removal is that the hollow fibre in the membrane must be selected appropriately such that it will not fracture during operation if such a requirement is satisfied then high turbidity removal efficiency can be guaranteed 3 4 assessment of economic benefits the economic benefits are evaluated based on the treatment of the dicing and grinding wastewater from a physical ic packaging and testing factory considering a water treatment volume of 50 m3 hr and a recovery rate of 85 we first evaluated the cost of consumables and electricity labour and interest for supporting 5 years of operation based on these fig 13 we estimated the annual economic benefits generated by the savings brought about by wastewater recycling if the wastewater is directly discharged without a recycling system the owner would need to pay 680 000 us year if the wastewater recycling system is installed then the owner can save 560 000 us year therefore the investment will be paid back in around 1 14 years time as shown in table 10 therefore the economic benefits of the wastewater recycling system are tremendous if it is successful by promoting such a technology in all the packaging and testing factories we can not only bring in new business opportunities to the manufacturers with a considerable amount of saving but also reduce the pollution on the planet with a substantial saving in water resources and other relevant processing energy consequently the development of the wastewater treatment technology can hit multiple targets at the same time and must be promoted to greater application fields the relevant consumables data is shown in table 10 and fig 13 fig 13 shows the annual fee payable by company a before and after the construction of the water recycling system before constructing the water recycling system the company was required to pay a total of 680 360 us year comprising wastewater treatment fee water pollution fee and pure water treatment fee after constructing the water recycling system the company only needs to pay a total of 118 000 us year which comprises the operating expenses and labour cost the annual saving brought about by the water recycling system is 561 000 us year 4 conclusion 1 whether the application of the uf membrane will be successful or not is related not only to the basic material strength selection of pore size low water turbidity and good water quality but more importantly to the performance recovery of the membrane after it is blocked and the methods to improve the recovery rate 2 one method to prevent severe blockage in the uf membrane is to backwash it within 2 h of use in collecting and filtering wastewater this approach can avoid the formation of permanent blockage in the membrane moreover increasing the frequency of chemical cleaning may cause permanent damage to the uf membrane 3 collecting the wastewater in the dead end mode can increase the recovery rate however the water collection period and backwashing frequency must be reduced and increased respectively when recycling wastewater with high turbidity 4 the best uf membrane filtration mode should be determined based on actual water quality and pilot test results 5 the cleaning performance of the uf membrane after it is blocked is related linearly to the concentration of the chemicals when the concentration is less than 0 15 however the improvement in the cleaning performance becomes less significant with increasing chemical concentration when the concentration exceeds 0 15 6 the cleaning performance of the uf membrane after it is blocked is related linearly to the operating temperature at constant chemical concentration condition when the temperature is less than 45 c however the improvement in the cleaning performance becomes less significant with increasing temperature when it exceeds 45 c 7 it was established in this study that use of the uf membrane had no impact on the electrical conductivity toc solubility of sio2 and ph value of the wastewater due to the presence of pores in the membrane however it was very effective in reducing the turbidity and ss of the wastewater 8 the economic benefits generated by wastewater recycling are dependent on proper wastewater routing by the pipeline system and the amount of wastewater recycled at the economic scale 9 use of a uf membrane is the best method to recycle wastewater back into the pure water system in the most environment friendly form without the addition of chemicals 
14248,with the increasing awareness of environmental protection and establishment of strict policy measures requiring more than 85 recovery rate of wastewater in the science park water recycling has become an important issue in several electronic industries such as semiconductor photovoltaic and solar energy industries among the different types of wastewater the dicing and grinding wastewater generated in the ic packaging and testing industry is a colloid containing insoluble sio2 particles such wastewater exhibits high turbidity and low electrical conductivity and can be recovered by simple physical methods however the recovery efficiency of the equipment used for recycling wastewater is often degraded by clogging due to the high turbidity of wastewater in addition the high chemical stability of the suspended sio2 particles makes it difficult for them to sediment from the suspension state and presents a greater challenge to remove these even by conventional methods such as the addition of chemicals which facilitate coagulation and sedimentation therefore the sio2 particles produce a considerable amount of sludge which causes secondary pollution in view of the above recycling tests of cutting and grinding wastewater were performed in this study using a suitable ultrafiltration uf membrane without the addition of any extra chemicals the results of the study show that the most important factors associated with the application of a uf membrane in addition to basic material strength selection of pore size low water turbidity and good water quality are the performance recovery of the membrane after it is blocked and methods for improving the recycling rate of the device to avoid the formation of a permanent blockage the uf membrane must be backwashed within 2 h of its use for collecting wastewater in addition the effect of cleaning on the uf membrane after it is blocked is related linearly to the concentration of the chemical used for cleaning and the temperature of the cleaning agent when the concentration and temperature are lower than 0 15 and 45 respectively to increase the recovery rate the wastewater is collected and recycled in the dead end mode whereas the collection time and backwashing frequency are reduced or increased according to the increase in turbidity of the wastewater in this study it was observed that the uf membrane was very effective in reducing the turbidity and suspended solids of wastewater due to the presence of pore structures in the membrane however the appropriate filtration mode of the uf membrane should be selected based on the actual quality of the wastewater and results of pilot tests the use of a uf membrane was established to be the most environmentally benign method for recycling wastewater without the addition of chemicals keywords dead end cross flow wafer dicing wastewater uf membrane 1 introduction recent years have witnessed an increase in water consumption in industrial sectors particularly in the semiconductor industry where water is essential for production therefore recycling and reuse of wastewater has become an important issue this study focussed on the treatment of wafer dicing and grinding wastewater generated in the ic packaging factory 1 2 where the wastewater is recycled by suitable means to pure water and reused during the wafer packaging and testing process the protection layer is flattened by grinding and the large circular wafer is diced into small dies these processes require a large amount of ultrapure water for cleaning and cooling the sample as well as removing the silicon particles generated during the dicing and grinding process 3 wastewater produced from these two sources is of high quality having an electrical conductivity lower than 10 μs cm as it is generated from ultrapure water in both the cases however it contains a large amount of suspended silicon particles which result in high water turbidity ranging between 2000 and 15000 ntu and a deep water colour darker than espresso this may become a great source of pollution if not recycled and reused properly if it is discharged into a wastewater treatment plant a considerable amount of coagulant would be required to allow the suspended silicon particles to precipitate which would not only produce immense chemical waste but also cause severe sludge pollution to the local environment if the suspended particles are separated from the liquid the wastewater can then be directly recycled to the pure water system considering an annual wastewater generation rate this method would yield an annual saving money therefore the separation approach can bring about huge economic benefits in wastewater treatment and achieve multiple targets at the same time however the low solubility and small diameter of the silicon particles suspended in the wastewater make it difficult for them to settle and easy to block the uf membrane in view of the characteristics of this wastewater the study without dosing any chemical operation we choose uf ultrafiltration membrane for the pilot in particular the filtration operation of the membrane is affected by multiple factors such as the characteristics of the membrane quality of the water source operating conditions and the chemical characteristics of the solution among these the operating flux and tmp are the two most important factors which determine the successful functioning of the membrane nagaoka et al 1998 4 the critical flux of the uf membrane is defined as the maximum allowable filtration flux of the membrane system that can be maintained in a continuous efficient operation the concept of critical flux was first proposed by field et al 1995 5 who performed filtration experiments with yeast cells in both flat sheet and tubular membrane systems and observed that the tmp does not increase with time when the filtration flux is below a critical value in later studies different researchers have proposed different ideas on the critical flux chan et al 2002 6 and husiman et al 1999 7 plotted a correlation diagram between the tmp and average filtration flux they defined the critical flux as the point where the slope of the correlation curve starts to increase significantly chio et al 2005 8 found that the operating conditions provided by the manufacturer of the uf membrane can only be used as a reference as the actual operating conditions vary with different types of water bodies therefore the most suitable membrane and the associated operating method for achieving the desired performance must be determined by pilot tests lin 2005 9 therefore in this study we investigated the separation performance of silicon particles in the wafer dicing and grinding wastewater by using a uf membrane the effect of particle size on the blockage in the uf membrane optimisation of the operating parameters in the separation process and the overall recycling benefits 2 material and methods in this research study uf membranes are used to filter and recycle the wafer dicing and grinding wastewater generated in ic packaging and test factories based on the amount of water collected by the membrane change in the trans membrane pressure tmp change in the backwashing frequency and change in the water collection duration we obtained the optimal processing parameters such as the amount of wastewater collected duration of sample collection backwashing frequency concentration of chemicals used in clean in place cip time and temperature with these optimum parameters we further derived the operation cost of the wastewater treatment system and the capital payback period finally the overall benefit of the study was assessed by combining all the aforementioned features fig 1 shows the detailed flow chart of the research method 2 1 testing device and materials the most important factor to be considered in the selection of the uf membrane is the size of the particles suspended in the wastewater the particle size is measured by first shooting a laser into the wastewater and then analysing the intensity of the light reflected from the particle the light intensity enables the calculation of the size of the particles in the wastewater where d nm is the particle size g d is the gaussian distribution and c d is the cumulative distribution the location where the cumulative number reaches 50 represents the midpoint the membrane developed by d company 10 shown in table 1 was used for performing the test in our experiments it is an outside in ultrafiltration uf membrane with an average pore size of 0 036 μm made of polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf the membrane itself is a hollow fibre with an inner diameter of 0 9 mm and an outer diameter of 1 9 mm the total surface area weight length and diameter of the membrane are 52 m2 25 kg 1860 mm and 2000 mm respectively the diameter of the water inlet and outlet pore is 50 mm the diameter of the concentrated water port is 32 mm and the diameter of the air inlet is 9 5 mm as shown in fig 2 table 2 shows the constraints on the operating conditions of the uf membrane provided by the manufacturer the maximum water inlet pressure is 3 0 kg cm2 and the recommended inlet pressure is less than 2 5 kg cm2 the operating tmp should not exceed 2 1 kg cm2 and the recommended operating condition is 1 0 kg cm2 the smaller the tmp the easier it is to perform the backwashing the water collection flux can range as 40 120 l m2 hr however the actual flux depends on the quality of the wastewater a clearer water source can allow for a greater water collecting flux and vice versa the collection flux is an important parameter affecting the capital cost operating cost and the backwashing frequency of the wastewater recycling process the maximum operating temperature of the membrane is less than 50 c as exposing the membrane to a temperature higher than 50 for more than 2 h will destroy the structure of the membrane the operating ph range and maximum chemical oxidant concentration that the membrane can withstand is 2 11 and 2000 mg l of naocl respectively operating the membrane beyond these ranges will cause it to corrode or get oxidised resulting in destruction of its internal structure 2 2 testing process fig 3 shows the testing process of the experiment the first step is to collect relevant information such as the integration of processing technologies methods for analysing the experimental results and the associated research methods and steps the second step is to analyse the characteristics of the wastewater the desired uf membrane is selected according to the quality of the wastewater based on the principle that the pore size of the uf membrane must be smaller than the minimum size of the particles the third step is to perform the actual tests under different operating conditions 2 3 testing device and physical units the testing device and the schematic of the physical units are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the following components are included in the testing device 1 m3 of raw testing water a water feeding pump a 150 μm filter used for pre treating the water a uf membrane with a pore size of 0 036 μm a 250 l cip tank a backwash pump control valves pipelines and an electrical control system 2 4 testing conditions and steps the optimum parameters for smooth operation of the uf membrane are based on the results of the following tests 1 the test of change in the water collection quantity vs tmp which is expected to yield the suitable amount of water collected in low tmp conditions the tests are performed with different water collecting fluxes at 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 0 m3 hr over 70 days the change in tmp is recorded during the testing period for each of the flux conditions 2 the test of water collection quantity vs water collection period which is expected to yield the most suitable and economic water collection cycle the curves of change in the water collection quantity vs water collection period are obtained by testing with different water collecting fluxes at 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 0 m3 hr over 70 days 3 the test of water collection quantity vs backwashing frequency the tests are performed with three water collecting fluxes at 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 0 m3 hr the membrane is backwashed when the water quantity is reduced by 10 15 the cycle and amount of water collected are recorded during the tests and plotted as curves for determining the suitable backwashing frequency and water collection quantity which yield the best economic value during a stable and continuous operation the second factor is important for ensuring a stable long term operation for industrial mass production 4 during the operation with optimum water collecting quantity and optimum backwashing frequency determined from the experiment a cip chemical cleaning must be performed if the amount of water collected is insufficient or the pressure loss is too high the chemical cleaning is specifically performed with different operating parameters such as the concentration temperature and time an optimised combination of the parameters is determined and used for yielding better economic value a high pressure loss can easily induce the formation of deep blockage in the uf membrane if the designed water filtration quantity cannot be recovered by backwashing then a cip chemical cleaning must be performed for 4 h however keeping the filtrating system offline for too long will cause a new issue of insufficient recovery rate 3 results and discussion in this study a uf membrane based filtration system is used to perform the experimental tests which were carried out for more than two months in order to ensure a stable result the recovery effect of backwashing on the membrane was analysed and the operating parameters were optimised according to the changes in the recorded data finally we evaluated the economic value of a physical factory based on the experimental results and derived the capital payback period of the wastewater treatment system in our pilot simulation of a real factory the wastewater was routed by different pipeline systems and characterised in terms of its electrical conductivity toc turbidity and other water quality the wastewater samples with high economic value were recycled separately using the uf membrane filtration system without the addition of any chemicals the performance of the uf membrane system was evaluated by sampling the filtered water and testing its quality at fixed time intervals the water collecting flux recorded during the tests and its impact on the blockage in the membrane and the backwashing frequency are summarised as described below 3 1 analysis of raw wastewater in this study the wastewater generated from five identical process lines in a company with suitable for water quality was used for the tests the quality of the wastewater was analysed and summarised in table 3 as shown from line 1 to line 5 the toc value of the wastewater samples ranges as 0 58 0 79 all the toc values are lesser than 1 ppm in comparison the toc requirement for tap water is 3 ppm the change in toc of the mixture with time is shown in fig 6 after operating for one month the quality of water samples associated with all the process lines meets the recycling requirement of toc 1 ppm in addition the electrical conductivity of the water samples ranged as 6 4 8 9 μs cm which is lesser than 10 μs cm this indicates that the electrical conductivity of the water samples treated in our tests is even lower than that of water treated by the common reverse osmosis ro process making it more valuable for recycling the solubility of the sio2 particles ranged as 3 4 5 8 ppm which is lesser than 10 ppm indicating a better water quality than tap water which only requires sio2 20 ppm the wastewater samples investigated in this study were characterised by high turbidity in the range of 1980 3260 ntu and high ss in the range of 345 481 ppm the major contributor to high turbidity is the large amount of insoluble silicon particles which are generated during the dicing process of the silicon wafer the ph value of the waste water ranged between 6 4 and 6 8 therefore it is inferred that the wastewater is generated solely from the rinsing activity of ultrapure water without the addition of any chemical agents the study by luo et al 2001 1 indicated that the composition of cmp wastewater can vary substantially with different grinding fluids based on the grinding level of the oxide layer and metal layer the suspended particles can remain stable in the turbid alkali metal solution with a ph ranging between 8 0 and 9 5 the wastewater generated from the grinding process of the metal layer contains aluminium oxide particles and many other oxidising agents e g h2o2 fe no3 3 kio3 therefore it is acidic with a ph value ranging between 2 and 4 however the study by luo et al did not characterise the electrical conductivity and toc of the wastewater therefore it cannot be compared with our study directly nevertheless the ph of the wastewater explored by luo et al was either basic or acidic which is very different from the ph of 6 4 6 8 of the wastewater used in our experiment therefore the quality of wastewater in our test is much better than that of the cmp water as the latter contains a large amount of oxidants and acid or alkali substances the study by luo et al was focussed more on the recycling of wastewater at the end section of the pipeline where the source of the wastewater exhibits complex water qualities an increasing number of variables results in a higher cost for treating the wastewater as well as lower recovery rate and economic benefits the major difference between our experiment and the one performed by luo et al is that the wastewater is recycled from the source of the process coordinated with the liquid routing pipelines the quality of the water selected for treatment is controlled precisely by the instrument before filtration to meet the requirement of the inlet water in our experiments in other words only the wastewater that can bring economic value after recycling is selected for performing the tests as the uf membrane is used as the sole treatment unit in our experiment our treatment system contains very few parameters and does not require any additional chemicals these features greatly reduce the secondary pollution and improve the overall recovery rate as well as recovery benefits in this study the uf membrane is used as the main core processing unit in addition to the toc analysis performed in the distributed pipeline for tackling the highly frequent blockage issue in the membrane the size distribution of the particles is also investigated to provide a basis for the selection of pore size of the uf membrane fig 7 shows the characterisation results of the particle size distribution where the x axis shows the particle size in units of nm and the y axis shows the relative quantity percentage pertaining to each particle size with a total percentage of 100 the results show that the relative quantities of particles of size 116 5 nm minimum size 123 5 nm 130 8 nm 138 8 nm 146 6 nm 370 nm 392 nm 415 3 nm 440 nm 466 1 nm and 493 nm are 0 9 1 4 1 8 0 9 0 46 1 4 5 6 14 47 8 24 3 and 2 34 respectively the pore size being the most important factor to determine the type of uf membrane is dependent on the minimum particle size specifically the desirable membrane must have a pore size smaller than the minimum particle size in order to prevent smaller particles from penetrating it and blocking the pores based on the above data the final pore size of the uf membrane must be smaller than 116 5 nm in addition the uf membrane is to be operated within a certain pressure range 0 5 3 kg cm2 under normal operating conditions in this operating pressure range as a pore size of 0 1 μm is only slightly smaller than 0 116 μm the possibility of a particle penetrating the pore under pressure is similar to that between these two pore sizes therefore a uf membrane with a pore size of 0 03 μm is selected in our study a uf membrane with a smaller pore size 0 01 μm is undesirable since the water production per unit area is too low and the unit cost is too high from the material perspective pvdf is selected due to its strong chemical resistance and mechanical properties however the surface of the material must be coated with a hydrophilic film to maintain a certain flux this feature can serve as a reference for selection of the membrane pore 3 2 analysis of test results of different parameters tests were performed with different parameters to determine the optimum operating parameters for the uf membrane fig 8 shows the test for the change in the water collection quantity vs the change in tmp such a test is expected to yield the quantity of water collected that is suitable for a low tmp condition fig 9 shows the test for the water collection quantity vs time such a test is expected to yield the change in water collection quantity per unit time which can be used to derive the most appropriate and economic water collection quantity and period fig 10 shows the curves for different water collection quantities vs the backwashing frequency these are expected to yield the most suitable backwashing frequency and an economic water collection quantity that can provide a stable long term water filtration as the duration of the cip chemical cleaning is approximately 4 h the wastewater recycling system will be offline for a long time which results in an insufficient recovery rate fig 11 provides a confirmation of the chemical cleaning performance which can potentially yield a blockage in future the cip chemical cleaning is performed with different concentrations at different times and temperatures the most suitable and economic chemical cleaning parameters such as concentration time and temperature are recorded and used as a reference for determining the optimum operating parameters 3 2 1 test for water collection quantity vs tmp the tmp tests were performed using three different water collection quantities according to the recommendations provided by the original manufacturer the backwashing frequency was set as 1 h time in our tests to determine the best relationship fig 8 shows the test results obtained using water collection quantities of 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 m3 hr by observing the change in the tmp curve it was ascertained that the tmp associated with a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr drops to 0 72 kg cm2 on the 70th day this result agrees well with the behaviour described by the membrane manufacturer if the operation condition of the tmp is controlled to be lesser than 1 0 kg cm 2 the pressure increases with a small slope of 0 34 however the reason that the curve is non smooth is because different operating temperatures affect the pore size of the membrane in addition the recovery rate varies for each automatic backwashing the uf membrane is not a rigid membrane and consists of large as well as small pores with an average pore size of 0 03 μm when the water body starts to flow the flow becomes turbulent which signifies a chaotic environment for the particles if a particle of size smaller than 0 1 μm blocks a pore in the membrane of size 0 2 μm then the tmp rises faster and vice versa this is why the curve becomes non smoothr in addition the tmp was observed to be 0 80 kg cm2 on the 70th day with a water collection capacity of 1 5 m3 hr such a result is in accordance with the recommendation of an operating tmp smaller than 1 0 kg cm2 by the manufacturer however the slope of the rising curve is 0 39 which is slightly higher than the slope of 1 0 m3 hr this is because the increase in water collection quantity by 0 5 m3 hr also results in an increase in the relative magnitude of the water inlet pressure with respect to the tmp when using the last group of parameters the tmp reaches the alert level of 0 80 kg cm2 after operating with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr for 55 days compared to the case of a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr the tmp alert level of 0 80 kg cm2 is reached 15 days earlier the risk may be even higher in practical applications considering that the filtration system needs to operate efficiently for more than 3 years the safety factor should be designed more precisely when operating with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr for 70 days the tmp reaches as high as 1 02 kg cm2 while the slope reaches 0 69 however according to the data provided by the uf membrane manufacturer a cip chemical cleaning must be performed when the tmp exceeds 1 0 kg cm2 therefore the last group of parameters is not suitable for operation with the given water quality otherwise the recovery of the filtration performance of the membrane after it is blocked may not be able to reach the original design value of the water collection quantity based on personal and the company s experience of working with the uf membrane the safety factor should be adjusted by 20 more accurately in other words a chemical cleaning should be performed when the tmp exceeds 0 8 kg cm2 in order to ensure good recovery of the filtration performance summary as shown by the experimental results in fig 8 the tmp of the third test group reaches the alert level of 0 80 kg cm2 after the system is operated for 55 days with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr after operating for 70 days the tmp of the filtration system already exceeds the recommended chemical cleaning level of 1 02 kg cm2 therefore cleaning the membrane may not yield a satisfactory result at this point which means a permanent blockage may have already formed in the membrane therefore such operating parameters are not recommended in practice the tmp of the first test group remains at around 0 72 kg cm2 after the system is operated for 70 days with a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr while the tmp value is lower than the recommended value of 1 0 kg cm2 provided by the membrane manufacturer this set of operating parameters is still not recommended due to the low economic benefits specifically a low water collection quantity means more membranes will be required to increase the water recycling rate which will inevitably increase the capital cost therefore a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr is selected as the best operating condition the tmp of this test group is 0 80 kg cm2 after the system is operated for 70 days with a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr such a tmp value is still lower than the operating condition of 1 0 kg cm2 recommended by the membrane manufacturer the slope of the curve is only 0 39 hence the curve is much smoother than that with the slope of 0 69 for a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr as shown in fig 8 the tmp already exceeds 0 80 kg cm2 when operating at 2 0 m3 hr therefore considering long term safety of operation a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr is selected as the optimum parameter in addition it is also a more economic selection than a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr as a uf membrane of pore size 0 03 μm is used in these experiments the quality of the treated water does not differ significantly when using a water collecting quantity of 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr or 2 m3 hr in particular the turbidity of water is lesser than 0 05 ntu after filtration in all the three cases given that the owner only requires a turbidity of less than 0 1 ntu the quality of the recycled water is not considered as an evaluation criterion in this test 3 2 2 test for change in water collection quantity vs time the tests were performed by recording the change in three different water collection quantities with time a backwash was performed at a constant frequency of 1 h according to the recommendations of the manufacturer the best correlation was expected to be obtained based on these tests fig 9 shows the curves of the change in the water collection quantities of 1 0 m3 hr 1 5 m3 hr and 2 0 m3 hr vs time we first consider the case where the system is operated for 70 days when the water collection quantity was set as 1 0 m3 hr the water quantity remained relatively stable over the entire 70 days when it was set as 1 5 m3 hr the water quantity started to decrease to 1 44 m3 hr on the 65th day and 1 36 m3 hr on the 70th day when the water collection quantity was set as 2 0 m3 hr it decreased to 1 9 m3 hr on the 27th day and continued decreasing at a faster rate on the 55th day the water collection quantity had already dropped to 1 5 m3 hr a faster reduction was observed on the 60th day where the water collection quantity was reduced from 1 4 m3 hr to 1 13 m3 hr from the 60th to the 70th day the rate at which the water collection quantity decreased was much faster than that when the water collection quantity was set at 1 5 m3 hr on comparing figs 8 and 9 it is observed that the uf membrane with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr experiences the most severe blockage on the 60th day such a blockage can lead to a substantial reduction in the water collection quantity when the tmp becomes higher summary the change in water collection volume with time is the fastest at the same backwash frequency when setting the water collection quantity to 2 0 m3 hr this is because given the same membrane area for the suspended particles in the turbid water a greater water collection quantity can result in a relatively higher loading on the particles therefore when the water collection quantity was set to 2 0 m3 hr the value dropped to 1 99 m3 hr on the 27th day dropped from 1 5 m3 hr to 1 46 m3 hr on the 55th day and to 1 13 m3 hr on the 70th day compared to the tmp shape the water collection quantity was already exceeding 1 0 kg cm2 therefore this set of operating data is not selected for analysis however the curve with a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr started to decrease gradually to 1 49 m3 hr on the 68th day the reduction in magnitude is not very high and the comparison with the tmp curve satisfies the recommended values by testing the backwashing frequency for three different water collection quantities we expect to obtain the most suitable relationship the turbidity of the wastewater source in the range of 1980 3260 ntu is considered to be ultra high in this experiment the filtration is operated in a dead end mode for details refer to 04 the characteristics of the dead end mode are that the selection of the specifications of the pump is consistent with the amount of water produced in other words no further improvement in the pump specification is required which saves considerable energy cost if the cross flow method is selected the pump must be enlarged 3 5 times from the turbidity perspective the cross flow method demands more energy compared to the dead end method however to operate in the dead end mode requires an increase in the backwashing frequency higher turbidity of the water source requires higher backwashing frequency therefore different backwashing frequencies were tested for different water collection quantities to obtain the optimum value fig 10 shows the changes in the curves for the three water collection quantities with time at room temperature 25 28 c after the backwashing process the backwashing is performed when the predicted water reduction due to backwashing ranges as 10 15 this is because according to the recommendations of the membrane manufacturer and from personal experience the water inlet pressure must be higher than 0 3 0 5 kg cm2 to produce the same amount of water when the water volume exceeds 15 however with a fixed frequency of the pump the same water generation rate cannot be replicated furthermore the pores inside the uf membrane will be clogged even more severely and no suitable solutions are found in many cases table 4 presents the backwashing parameters provided by the membrane manufacturer due to the warranty conditions associated with the membrane manufacturer backwash must be performed according to its operating condition this experiment is performed with a fixed water collection quantity therefore the experimental steps involve the following the top to bottom backwashing flux is fixed at 60 l m2 hr as the total surface area of the membrane is 52 m2 multiplying it with the flux yields a flow rate of 3120 m3 hr for backwashing for more than 10 s the total amount of water consumed would be 520 l time each of the top to bottom and bottom to top backwashes are performed once for the first group the volume of water delivered is reduced by 15 when operating with a water collecting quantity of 2 0 m3 hr for 1 h at this point a backwash is required to clean the membrane a similar working condition is maintained with an operating time up to 24 h for the second group a backwash is required when the volume of water delivered is reduced by 15 as the system is operated with a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr for 2 h a similar working condition is maintained with an operating time up to 24 h for the third group a backwash is required when the volume of water delivered is reduced by 15 as the system is operated with a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr for 3 h a similar working condition is maintained with an operating time up to 24 h summary operating the system at a water collection quantity of 1 0 m3 hr for 3 h before backwashing the membrane is a preferable choice however taking the water collection quantity and the economic benefits into consideration operating the system at a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr for 2 h before backwashing the membrane is more suitable operating with a water collection quantity of 2 0 m3 hr is undesirable because frequent backwashes can result in frequent expansion of the membrane and the fibres and pores in the membrane become prone to fracture based on personal experience the lift time of the uf membrane is closely related to the frequency of backwash frequency of cleaning operating pressure and in particular the tmp in general it is undesirable to have a tmp exceeding 0 80 kg cm2 in a short time in this study we have again established that using a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr is a better option than using 2 0 m3 hr for filtering the wastewater considered in this study using the uf membrane with a fixed material composition a higher frequency of backwash and cleaning reduces the lifetime of a uf membrane in addition it is also undesirable to have the tmp reaching the alert level too early as corrosion from chemicals and conditions of high pressure will cause it to degrade earlier 3 2 3 confirmation of chemical cleaning performance based on the conclusion of an optimum water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr and a backwashing time of 2 h obtained from the previous analysis the tmp is controlled at 1 kg cm2 to test the optimum chemical concentration time and temperature for cip cleaning table 5 shows the chemical cleaning parameters provided by the membrane manufacturer to abide by the warranty requirement chemical cleaning must be performed when the conditions are satisfied in this test the chemical cleaning experiments are only performed with a water collection quantity of 1 5 m3 hr and backwashing period of 2 h therefore based on the data provided by the membrane manufacturer the first step is to fix the chemical cleaning flux at 120 l m2 hr as the total surface area of the membrane is 52 m2 multiplying it with the flux yields a flow rate of 6240 l hr for chemical cleaning for more than 30 min the total amount of chemical solution used for cleaning the membrane is 3120 l time the chemical cleaning must be carried out when the tmp exceeds 0 8 kg cm2 or when the total amount of water delivered is 15 less than the design value in addition a 2 h backwash has already been performed on the membrane but fails to recover its filtration performance at this point a chemical cleaning must be performed the experiment is conducted from three aspects 1 with respect to the concentration of chemical agents we need to observe the recovery rate of water production and find the most suitable chemical concentration needed for the cleaning 2 identifying the most suitable cleaning time by adding the chemical appropriately 3 adjusting the cleaning temperature to improve the activation energy and solubility identifying the most economically desired operating temperature and then confirming the recovery of the water intake by cross comparison after the uf membrane is cleaned 3 2 3 1 effect of chemical cleaning concentration on membrane cleaning most of the substances in the water body are sio2 particles therefore considering that the material is at room temperature naoh is used as the cleaning agent based on the recommendations by the membrane manufacturer and the literature of charles et al according to the recommendations listed in table 5 given by the membrane manufacturer the cleaning period is fixed at 30 min and the inlet pressure is set as 0 7 kg cm2 the concentration of the naoh cleaning agent is set as 0 05 0 3 according to the recommended chemical concentration range given by the manufacturer therefore we performed tests using four different concentration data 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 the data of membrane cleaning chemical concentration and water collection quantity recovery curves are compiled in fig 11 according to the recommendations of the membrane manufacturer first it is observed that with a chemical concentration of 0 05 and a cleaning period of 30 min the water collection quantity rises slightly back to 1 33 1 38 m3 hr during the second observation with a chemical concentration of 0 1 and a cleaning period of 30 min the water collection quantity rises back to 1 43 1 48 m3 hr which is still lesser than the designed value of 1 5 m3 hr as shown in the fig 11 when using a chemical concentration of 0 15 and 0 2 and a cleaning time of 30 min the water collection quantity can be recovered to even higher values exceeding the original design of 1 5 m3 hr reaching as high as 1 73 m3 hr summary it is apparent that the effect of high chemical concentration is positive on the cleaning performance however when the concentration reaches a certain threshold further increase in the concentration yields a similar cleaning performance therefore using a concentration of 0 15 and 0 2 can yield a very close recovery rate according to the recommendations provided by the uf membrane manufacturer it is better to attain the target performance with the minimum concentration this is because a higher concentration causes greater damage to the membrane further a high chemical concentration also involves a higher operating cost finally 0 15 naoh was selected as the most suitable cleaning chemical with the best concentration 3 2 3 2 effect of duration of chemical cleaning on membrane cleaning the chemical cleaning is performed at room temperature 25 28 for durations of 20 min 25 min 30 min and 35 min to determine the optimum cleaning time using a concentration of 0 15 from fig 11 the recovery data of water collection quantity is obtained during the first 20 min of cleaning the maximum recovery rate reaches only 1 43 m3 hr from table 6 on the contrary with a cleaning of more than 25 min the recovery rate is restored to 1 50 m3 hr in most cases and reaches as high as 1 71 m3 hr for other cleaning durations such as 30 min and 35 min the recovered water collection quantity is greater than 1 5 m3 hr however extension of the cleaning time did not bring about a better cleaning performance than that obtained with 25 min therefore it is apparent that the chemical cleaning time of 25 min is very close to the most suitable value summary the original concentration test is performed using 30 min as the base the best cleaning concentration is found to be 0 15 based on this concentration the samples are cleaned for different time periods among these cleaning the sample for 25 min can achieve the desired result after extending the time by 1 min 26 min is finally chosen as the total cleaning period and input into the plc auto control system for performing the cleaning 3 2 3 3 effect of chemical cleaning temperature on membrane cleaning taking a chemical concentration of 0 15 and a cleaning period of 26 min from the previous experiments new chemical cleaning tests were performed at different temperatures to analyse whether changing the temperature can improve the cleaning performance activation energy and solubility a study by mansoor et al in 2006 11 proposed that the cleaning temperature should be set at around 60 however a maximum temperature of 50 was used in this study according to the recommendations of the membrane manufacturer as overheating would destroy the structure of the membrane the objective of this experiment is to obtain the optimum temperature based on the optimum concentration and duration so that the best cleaning recovery rate can be achieved with the minimum energy consumption as demonstrated in table 7 in general a temperature between 25 c and 30 c is considered as room temperature our experimental system heats the chemical solutions to 35 c 40 c 45 c and 50 c due to electrical heating four experiments are performed immediately afterwards the previous tests of determining the water collection quantity and tmp were all performed at room temperature in this experiment the best operating parameters obtained from the previous experiments were used for performing the tests in addition raising the operating temperature to 35 c 40 c 45 c and 50 c can recover the water collection quantity to 1 73 m3 hr 1 76 m3 hr 2 02 m3 hr and 2 05 m3 hr respectively summary although the cleaning performances at 45 c and 50 c are only different by 0 03 m3 hr the water consumption rate in an actual factory can reach several hundred tons per hour therefore the chemical cleaning temperature is selected to be 45 c considering the greater economic benefits the reason that heating the solution to 45 c produces such a significant improvement according to personal understanding can be rationalised based on a similar example of regeneration of ultrapure water resin whereby using hot alkali naoh can increase the solubility and activation energy by exchanging the resin for sio2 considering that the substances contained in this wastewater are also sio2 particles the same mechanism should be able to explain the improvement in chemical cleaning performance at higher temperatures 3 3 integration of the most suitable operating parameters through the aforementioned experiments the optimum operating parameters for the uf membrane are summarised in table 8 in the semiconductor packaging industry the significance of these parameters for treating the dicing and grinding wastewater is reflected in the economic benefits in practice therefore using a membrane surface area of 52 m2 and a uf membrane flux of 28 8 l m2 hr the hourly wastewater collection rate is 1 5 m3 hr and the collection period is 120 min 2 h the total amount of water collected is 3 0 m3 hr the automatic backwashing process is set based on the recommended parameters provided by the membrane manufacturer as listed in table 4 when the tmp 0 8 kg cm2 the filtration system is stopped and the membrane is cleaned by chemicals to provide a chemical cleaning flux of 120 l m2 hr on the membrane with a surface area of 52 m2 requires 6 24 m3 hr every hour however the experimental results show that the cleaning of the membrane requires 26 min therefore the total chemical consumption is 0 15 of naoh 2 7t time summary after completion of the experiments the relevant data were used in the practical operation of a company for five years thus far the operation condition remains good the quality of the recycled water is stable and the volume of water recycled is maintained at the design value therefore the proposed method to recycle wastewater is proved to be capable of facilitating economic benefits 3 3 1 analysis of water quality after recycling there is no significant change in the electrical conductivity toc solubility of sio2 and ph due to the membrane in the wastewater that is recycled by using the optimum operating parameters listed in table 8 table 9 shows a comparison of the water quality before and after the filtration the toc of water before and after filtration is 0 67 ppm and 0 65 ppm respectively apparently use of the uf membrane is not an ideal method for reducing the toc the electrical conductivity of water before and after filtration is 7 5 μs cm and 7 8 μs cm respectively the increase in the electrical conductivity is attributed to a measurement error or dissolving of co2 in the water body the solubility of sio2 in water before and after filtration is 5 8 ppm and 5 6 ppm respectively the use of the uf membrane does not have a significant effect on the solubility however the turbidity of the water before and after filtration is 2100 ntu and 0 09 ntu respectively more than 99 999 of the turbidity is reduced by the filtration in addition the ss of the water is 350 ppm before filtration but non detectable nd after filtration therefore the uf membrane is excellent in reducing the turbidity and ss of the wastewater as all the qualities of water are already monitored in table 3 we only need to monitor the change in the turbidity and ss of the wastewater after filtration this practice can considerably save on the expense of the inspection fee fig 12 shows the effectiveness chart of turbidity removal by the uf membrane targeting different types of high turbidity water bodies as shown in the chart even for wastewater with an extremely high turbidity of 14500 ntu use of the uf membrane can still reduce the turbidity to 0 05 ntu with a removal efficiency greater than 99 999 however a pre requisite to the high turbidity removal is that the hollow fibre in the membrane must be selected appropriately such that it will not fracture during operation if such a requirement is satisfied then high turbidity removal efficiency can be guaranteed 3 4 assessment of economic benefits the economic benefits are evaluated based on the treatment of the dicing and grinding wastewater from a physical ic packaging and testing factory considering a water treatment volume of 50 m3 hr and a recovery rate of 85 we first evaluated the cost of consumables and electricity labour and interest for supporting 5 years of operation based on these fig 13 we estimated the annual economic benefits generated by the savings brought about by wastewater recycling if the wastewater is directly discharged without a recycling system the owner would need to pay 680 000 us year if the wastewater recycling system is installed then the owner can save 560 000 us year therefore the investment will be paid back in around 1 14 years time as shown in table 10 therefore the economic benefits of the wastewater recycling system are tremendous if it is successful by promoting such a technology in all the packaging and testing factories we can not only bring in new business opportunities to the manufacturers with a considerable amount of saving but also reduce the pollution on the planet with a substantial saving in water resources and other relevant processing energy consequently the development of the wastewater treatment technology can hit multiple targets at the same time and must be promoted to greater application fields the relevant consumables data is shown in table 10 and fig 13 fig 13 shows the annual fee payable by company a before and after the construction of the water recycling system before constructing the water recycling system the company was required to pay a total of 680 360 us year comprising wastewater treatment fee water pollution fee and pure water treatment fee after constructing the water recycling system the company only needs to pay a total of 118 000 us year which comprises the operating expenses and labour cost the annual saving brought about by the water recycling system is 561 000 us year 4 conclusion 1 whether the application of the uf membrane will be successful or not is related not only to the basic material strength selection of pore size low water turbidity and good water quality but more importantly to the performance recovery of the membrane after it is blocked and the methods to improve the recovery rate 2 one method to prevent severe blockage in the uf membrane is to backwash it within 2 h of use in collecting and filtering wastewater this approach can avoid the formation of permanent blockage in the membrane moreover increasing the frequency of chemical cleaning may cause permanent damage to the uf membrane 3 collecting the wastewater in the dead end mode can increase the recovery rate however the water collection period and backwashing frequency must be reduced and increased respectively when recycling wastewater with high turbidity 4 the best uf membrane filtration mode should be determined based on actual water quality and pilot test results 5 the cleaning performance of the uf membrane after it is blocked is related linearly to the concentration of the chemicals when the concentration is less than 0 15 however the improvement in the cleaning performance becomes less significant with increasing chemical concentration when the concentration exceeds 0 15 6 the cleaning performance of the uf membrane after it is blocked is related linearly to the operating temperature at constant chemical concentration condition when the temperature is less than 45 c however the improvement in the cleaning performance becomes less significant with increasing temperature when it exceeds 45 c 7 it was established in this study that use of the uf membrane had no impact on the electrical conductivity toc solubility of sio2 and ph value of the wastewater due to the presence of pores in the membrane however it was very effective in reducing the turbidity and ss of the wastewater 8 the economic benefits generated by wastewater recycling are dependent on proper wastewater routing by the pipeline system and the amount of wastewater recycled at the economic scale 9 use of a uf membrane is the best method to recycle wastewater back into the pure water system in the most environment friendly form without the addition of chemicals 
14249,advantages of hollow fiber membranes include high specific area possibility of back flushing and lower pretreatment and maintenance requirements aggressive back flushing or airflow however can damage hollow fibers reinforced braided hollow fibers offer a solution for increasing mechanical strength and extending useful lifetime of hollow fiber membranes the present review discusses the effects of support layer spinneret design polymer type and production speed on properties of reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes the review concludes with a summary of applications enabled by such mechanical reinforcement keywords reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes applications spinning parameters 1 introduction membrane processes have many applications in separation science because of their advantages including relatively small footprint easy operation and lower energy consumption membrane technologies have been extensively used for water and wastewater treatment an ideal membrane should have high permeability sufficient mechanical strength and excellent chemical stability the membrane s chemical stability is mainly determined by the chemical composition of membrane materials membrane permeability and mechanical strength strongly depend on the membrane s structure which is primarily determined by the process utilized to make the membrane 1 for all membranes mechanical strength and robustness stand out as an important factor alongside the selectivity and water permeability compared with flat sheet membranes a hollow fiber membrane has higher specific surface area furthermore hollow fiber membranes are mechanically self supporting and are easy to assemble in modules for different applications 2 normally hollow fiber membranes which are prepared through the immersion precipitation method have high permeability but low mechanical strength owing to the dense layer and loose support layer 3 as a result hollow fibers are liable to be damaged or broken by high pressures or by airflow significant research has been directed at improving the mechanical properties of hollow fiber membranes coating a separation layer on the high strength hollow tubular braid has proven to be a relative effective approach 4 the production of reinforced fiber membranes has not been sufficiently studied in the literature therefore the information about the first studies was taken from the patents reinforced braided membrane fabrication concept was first described by cooper et al 1972 who reported on the use of an embedded braided material and made the reinforced fibers using a casting bob 5 the method however was found impractical for making capillary membranes hayano et al 1976 describes a semipermeable composite membrane consisting of a porous substance and a reinforcing material made of fibrous material embedded in the wall of the porous substance the polymer is not coated on support layer instead the support is completely embedded in the polymer 6 mahedran et al 1995 describes a hollow fiber membrane consisting of tubular macro porous support i e a braid coated by a thin tubular asymmetric semipermeable film of polymer on the outside of the membrane the braid is so flexible that it does not have a circular cross section and collapses under pressure the voids of the braided material are much larger than the pores in the film but are small enough to inhibit substantial penetration of the dope to the inner side of the braided material 7 generally reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes are used in microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes processes for water wastewater and industrial wastewater treatment reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes provides high mechanical strength such that they can be used in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes in drinking water treatment water softening and wastewater recovery nowadays reinforced nanofiltration hollow fiber membranes are commercially available in the market a reinforced hollow fiber hf nanofiltration module is an applicable alternative to both spiral wound and tubular membranes for treatment of low quality water sources it has been estimated that an optimized hf nf module would give a 100 increase in performance compared to an optimized spiral wound module 8 one disadvantage of hf membranes non reinforced is their poor mechanical strength which limits hf applications in high pressure separations 9 reinforced membranes solve this mechanical problem the purpose of this review to summarize reinforced braided hollow fiber rbhf membrane fabrication and the applications of such reinforced membranes in this respect the importance of braid polymer and spinneret types are discussed the literature on the subject is overview with a special attention paid to commercial applications of braided reinforced hollow fiber membranes 2 fabrication of reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes hollow fiber membranes are produced by the phase inversion method fig 1 a illustrates a typical hollow fiber production line the spinneret has openings for the polymer dope solution and the bore liquid to ensure the cast shape is a hollow fiber such a hollow fiber membrane has been broadly used in the field of precise filtration for production of sterile water drinking water dis tilled water and the like and has recently expanded in application range to sewage wastewater treatment solid liquid separation in septic tanks suspended solid removal from industrial wastewater and filtration of stream water and industrial water 7 hollow fiber membranes can be classified into a reinforced membrane type in which a polymer resin film is coated on a tubular fabric or braid and a single membrane type in which a hollow fiber membrane is composed only of polymer resin films without using a reinforcing material such as tubular fabrics or braids as a braid support layer polyethylene terephthalate pet support layer is used the reinforced hollow fiber membranes employ the tubular fabric or braid as a reinforcing material and thus exhibits excellent mechanical properties fig 1 b illustrates reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane production line to make reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes the braid material is passed through from center hole of spinneret instead of bore liquid 2 1 effect of support layer on reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes membrane fouling is a major problem in membrane processes membrane cleaning by back flush can cause delamination that is peeling of the membrane off the braid surface of the many materials used to make tubular hollow braid e g polyester fiberglass polyamide 6 6 polyamide 12 polypropylene polyethylene aramid and nylon fiberglass braid is more susceptible to membrane delamination due to poor membrane adhesion to the braid surface 1 there are many parameters that determine the quality of braided support layer braided textile material which is made with conventional braiding equipment from commercially available yarn has numerous breaks in the fiber moreover accumulation of broken filaments also known as fuzz can lead to defects in the polymer film coated onto the surface of such braid whiskers broken filaments protrude from the surface of the tubular support layer and can lead to either a polymer layer of increased thickness or polymer lean layers with pin holes homogeneous heterogeneous and hybrids braids have been evaluated in terms of the interfacial bonding between separation layer and tubular braid when cellulose acetate ca braids are used ca fibers in the braid are likely to be swollen and adhered together which result in decreased membrane permeability better properties can be achieved by combining carbon and glass fibers 9 in another study of homogeneous and heterogeneous interfaced braids fan et al 2015 showed that ca fibers are easily swollen by the dope solution leading to lower pore connectivity from outer surface to the inner surface and a decrease in permeation using pan fibers are led to a gap between separation layer and the braid fig 2 10 chen et al 2017 used pet poly mphenylene isophthalamide pmia and pmia pet 1 1 braids in their study to fabricate reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes by using pmia polymer fig 3 11 in pmia fibers the separation layer of pmia braid was tightly bonded with the homogeneous reinforced braid and ensured good compatibility on the other hand pet reinforced braid had a poor interfacial bonding as braid and separation layer were heterogeneous i e pet and pmia has a poor compatibility when pmia pet hybrid braid was used separation layer formed on pmia fibers was tightly bonded whereas separation layer formed on pet fiber was loosely bonded fig 4 shows braid types that can be used for reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes fig 4 a illustrates a diamond braid having an alteration of one yarn passing above and then below the other yarns fig 4 b illustrates a regular braid which passes above two and below two in a repeat fig 4 c illustrates a hercules braid which has a structure of 3 up 3 down diamond braid is the preferred braid type because it provides more porosity homogeneity and elasticity 12 in regular type braid porosity is low so dope solution between braid occurs peeling problem in hercules type surface roughness of braid is extremely high thus to make membrane having smooth surface membrane casting must be thicker water permeability decreases because of the thick membrane matrix if the open weave of the support layer has porosity that is too high the polymer infiltrates into the bore of the braid leading to a dramatic decrease in permeability at the same time too tight a weaving results in a poor anchoring of the polymer and an increased likelihood of polymer layer peeling from the braid weaving of fibers is an important parameter for membranes tightly weaved fibers tend to foul due to space restriction which resulted in moving insufficiently to stay clean or rubbing against each other on the other hand looser packing can be helpful for fibers to better repetitive twisting circularity of fiber which called as cylindricity is also important a cylindricity smaller than 0 8 brought about uneven membrane thicknesses which resulted in non uniform flux and defective areas resulted in a polymer film with inacceptable variations in thickness causing flux variations and defective areas which were too quickly fouled the braid cylindricity should be as close to 1 0 as possible 12 another important braid parameter is the young s modulus the goal is to achieve higher strength by choosing a stronger yarn e g of glass aramid or other high modulus material to benefit from material s high strength and stability for example a braid woven from glass multi filaments will have elongation less than 5 at break and glass multi filaments can be thought as non shrinkable also high modulus yarns are not desirable in practice since they provide inadequate adherence of film to the surface of the braid and when braid wet the braid will be too fragile for prolonged service 12 2 2 effect of polymer on reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes types and concentrations of polymer and additives determine the structure of the coated thin film layer for fabricating reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane which has a thin film layer coated on the surface of a reinforcing material or supporting material of a tubular braid thermodynamic stability differs according to the composition of dope solution to be used for coating in case of a thermodynamically stable dope solution the expected cross sectional structure is finger like on the contrary when thermodynamically unstable dope is used expected structure is sponge like without defected regions dope solution comprises polymer resin organic solvent for the polymer being used and a porogen typically a hydrophilic additive common polymer resins include polysulfone ps polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf polyacrylonitrile pan polyvinylchloride pvc cellulose acetate ca 10 pmia 11 polyimide polyamideimide and polyesterimide as the organic solvents n methyl pyrrolidone nmp 13 dimethyl formamide dmf 14 dimethyl acetamide dmac 15 or their mixtures are common choices as the porogen polyethylene glycol peg 16 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 17 and glycerol are often used in water treatment a bleach containing sodium hypochlorite as a free chlorine source is often used for membrane cleaning and water disinfections polyacrylonitrile based membranes disclosed in 6 are not stable to chlorine however this problem can be overcame by using a pvdf based membrane which is relatively stable to free chlorine mahedran et al 1995 discloses a method of coating a tubular braid with a pvdf solution to form a braid reinforced hollow fiber membrane 7 the pvdf solution only coats the outside surface of the braid without penetrating into the braid wall the membranes obtained are stable to 2000 ppm of free chlorine at ambient temperature unfortunately the membranes have very low water permeability mahedran et al 1999 granted to the same group of inventors discloses a method in which partially hydrolyzed poly vinyl acetate and calcined alumina particles are added to a braid supported pvdf membrane which shows a higher pure water permeability than the corresponding membrane without calcined alumina particles however this membrane showed poor resistance to fouling when applied to wastewater treatment this was attributed to the high sorptive capacity of the calcined alumina particles 18 lee et al 2008 4 have used polysulfone polymer to manufacture reinforced hollow fiber membrane in the study dope solution was composed of 13 17 by weight of polysulfone 10 19 by weight of pvp as porogen 10 11 by weight of peg as porogen and dmf as organic solvent hao et al 2016 19 have added graphene oxide go between 0 0 to 0 7 into pvdf material and fabricated reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes to increase interfacial bonding the braid was pretreated with naoh and later with distilled water increasing go amount to 0 5 wt in polymer matrix narrowed pore size distribution of the membrane with increased pore diameter 0 09 nm to 0 16 nm and an increased porosity 38 5 to 47 26 further increase in go amount decreased both pore size and porosity of the membranes durability and stability of the membranes were found to be outstanding since membrane performance 0 5 wt go did not deteriorate after get fouled by oil water mixture and after cleaning fan et al 2015 9 have studied the effect of the ca concentration in dope solution for fabricating reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes study revealed that high ca concentration 10 wt resulted in dense and smooth outer surface high tensile and bursting strengths increased interfacial bonding between separation layer and tubular braid chen et al 2017 11 have fabricated reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes with pmia polymer by changing polymer concentration in the 5 15 wt range and showed that pmia membranes have good mechanical stability and sponge like structure formation was increased as pmia concentration is increased 2 3 the effect of spinneret design on reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes in reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane production process polymer coating is accomplished using a unique spinneret design normally membrane thicknesses between 0 01 and 0 1 mm can be achieved outside of the braid 20 mahendran et al 2002 12 used a unique nozzle to produce reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane fig 5 the nozzle comprises an inner barrel having an internal bore through which the braid advances into an axial bore of a nipple secured at the end of the inner barrel the bore provides a rounding orifice to help the braid acquire a circular cross section before it is coated with dope the rounding orifice has a diameter in the range from 1 10 of the nominal diameter of the braid nozzle design limits the amount of dope passing through the nozzle meters the correct amount of dope over the surface and distributes the metered amount uniformly over the surface of the braid coated layer thickness depends on the rate of braid pulling the viscosity of the dope and the thickness of the film of dope to be coated on the braid before it is immersed in the coagulant fig 6 shows another type of nozzle design which is used to produce capillary membranes in this design before the braid fed through the nozzle meets with the dope solution a solution non coagulation liquid is fed through an opening by pressure difference for keeping fiber wet at the tip of nozzle dope solution non coagulation liquid and braid met with each other and the braid is coated with the dope solution nozzle exit scrapes the excess of non coagulation liquid leaving the liquid only in the braid s pores and in the inner channel the braid with the dope solution at the outside and the non coagulation liquid in the inside enters the water bath this design prevents penetration of the dope solution into braid s pores and prevents anchoring effect of the dope coagulating when it comes in contact with the pore liquid fig 7 shows an alternative nozzle design for fabricating reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes the nozzle has multiple inlets that allow coating of tubular support with multiple layers simultaneously to give a defect free composite membrane 1 this design ensures strong physical adhesion and chemical binding between the membrane and the support strong binding is due to two mechanisms 1 adding a permeable adhesive layer between the membrane and the support to bond them during membrane formation and 2 applying an adhesive from the support side of a composite membrane after it is formed to bond the membrane and the support together therefore produced membranes can resist high back pressure 2 4 the effect of spinning speed on reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes spinning speed of reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane is important in order to obtain predetermined separation layer thicknesses on the surface of the reinforcing material of the tubular braid the speed with which the tubular braid is advanced and the quantity of the spinning dope introduced into the spinneret must be balanced lee et al 2008 has expressed the relation between the feed rate of a spinning dope and the speed of a tubular braid in eq 1 4 1 q π ρ ϑ d 0 t where q is the feed rate of dope solution ml min ρ is the density of dope solution ϑ is the advancing speed of the braid d0 is the outer diameter of the braid and t is the thickness of the dope solution when the advancing speed of the braid is high formation of a thin coating layer is expected when the advancing speed of the braid is much higher than the feed rate of the spinning dope some parts of the braid may not be coated uniformly with the dope solution when the advancing speed of the brad is low a non uniform membrane with a partially thick coating layer is produced thus advancing speed feed rate of dope solution and density of dope solution should be optimized to obtain membranes with a uniform membrane thickness lee et al 2008 speculated that optimum coating is achieved when k ratio is between 200 3000 g m2 larger k values correspond to thicker coating layers eq 2 represents k value calculation 4 2 k g m 2 q g m i n v m m i n d o m table 1 shows parameters that can be used in reinforced hollow fiber membrane fabrication and what can be done by adjusting them 3 reinforced braided hollow fiber studies hollow fiber membranes made without a braid have high permeability however their mechanical endurance is low due to the loose support layer many studies have been carried out on the possible means of increasing the mechanical properties of hollow fiber membranes using high strength hollow tubular braids coated with a separation layer proved to be effective 3 after hyano et al 1976 6 invented braided reinforced hollow fiber membranes many patents have been granted but relatively little information is available in the open research literature as of august 2019 only eighteen studies can be found in literature on using braided reinforced hollow fiber membranes table 2 the earliest study was that by liu et al 2009 3 wherein effect of filament numbers on membrane mechanical strength was investigated for this purpose pet filaments interlaced within polymer matrix after 2014 more research groups focused on using reinforced braided hf membranes the rest of published studies relied on the use of a spinning system allowing the use of braids in general studies dealt with determining the effects of braid polymer types on the interconnection between support layer and separation layer reinforced braided hf membranes are generally used in uf mf and mbr processes the also show promise for in nf and ro because they can improve mechanical strength of hf membranes in high pressure requiring applications sengur tasdemir et al 2018 21 used reinforced hf uf membranes to fabricate nf membranes by incorporating aquaporin z protein on interfacial polymerization layer performance of the membranes were characterized using braid free thin film composite tfc membranes as the comparative basis both reinforced tfc and reinforced aquaporin z incorporated tfc membranes had higher water permeability and same rejection performances compared to braid free tfc membranes 4 application areas wastewater treatment was one of the important parts in membrane separation field the membrane bioreactor mbr had emerged as an attractive technology for advanced municipal and industrial wastewater treatment as it combined the activated sludge processes with a membrane separation processes ultrafiltration membrane modules based on reinforced hollow fiber membranes are suitable for numerous applications including drinking water treatment tertiary filtration wastewater treatment and ro pre treatment for brackish water compared to granular media filtration uf membranes produce water of higher water quality which is virtually unaffected by variability in the feed water quality the modules can be arranged in a pressurized or submerged configuration because of the pet support layer the mechanical strength of the reinforced braided membranes is high in cross flow filtration reinforced membranes can be operated without deformed under pressures due to high mechanical resistance the most common application of reinforced membranes is the mbr process some large mbr applications with reinforced braided hollow fiber from worldwide is given in table 3 in fig 8 flow diagram of different usage alternatives is given for reinforced braided membranes system that were given in fig 8 a is used for drinking water treatment in this case reinforced membranes are potted as pressurized vessels raw water is fed to module by pump filtration mode is dead end for drinking water treatment if raw water has low quality and more suspended solid cross flow system can be used for treatment in fig 8 b membrane bioreactor can be applicable to domestic and industrial wastewater treatment system is a combination of a suspended growth biological treatment which is usually activated sludge with membrane filtration equipment typically low pressure microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes are the best option for mbrs because of their high mechanical stabilities

14249,advantages of hollow fiber membranes include high specific area possibility of back flushing and lower pretreatment and maintenance requirements aggressive back flushing or airflow however can damage hollow fibers reinforced braided hollow fibers offer a solution for increasing mechanical strength and extending useful lifetime of hollow fiber membranes the present review discusses the effects of support layer spinneret design polymer type and production speed on properties of reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes the review concludes with a summary of applications enabled by such mechanical reinforcement keywords reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes applications spinning parameters 1 introduction membrane processes have many applications in separation science because of their advantages including relatively small footprint easy operation and lower energy consumption membrane technologies have been extensively used for water and wastewater treatment an ideal membrane should have high permeability sufficient mechanical strength and excellent chemical stability the membrane s chemical stability is mainly determined by the chemical composition of membrane materials membrane permeability and mechanical strength strongly depend on the membrane s structure which is primarily determined by the process utilized to make the membrane 1 for all membranes mechanical strength and robustness stand out as an important factor alongside the selectivity and water permeability compared with flat sheet membranes a hollow fiber membrane has higher specific surface area furthermore hollow fiber membranes are mechanically self supporting and are easy to assemble in modules for different applications 2 normally hollow fiber membranes which are prepared through the immersion precipitation method have high permeability but low mechanical strength owing to the dense layer and loose support layer 3 as a result hollow fibers are liable to be damaged or broken by high pressures or by airflow significant research has been directed at improving the mechanical properties of hollow fiber membranes coating a separation layer on the high strength hollow tubular braid has proven to be a relative effective approach 4 the production of reinforced fiber membranes has not been sufficiently studied in the literature therefore the information about the first studies was taken from the patents reinforced braided membrane fabrication concept was first described by cooper et al 1972 who reported on the use of an embedded braided material and made the reinforced fibers using a casting bob 5 the method however was found impractical for making capillary membranes hayano et al 1976 describes a semipermeable composite membrane consisting of a porous substance and a reinforcing material made of fibrous material embedded in the wall of the porous substance the polymer is not coated on support layer instead the support is completely embedded in the polymer 6 mahedran et al 1995 describes a hollow fiber membrane consisting of tubular macro porous support i e a braid coated by a thin tubular asymmetric semipermeable film of polymer on the outside of the membrane the braid is so flexible that it does not have a circular cross section and collapses under pressure the voids of the braided material are much larger than the pores in the film but are small enough to inhibit substantial penetration of the dope to the inner side of the braided material 7 generally reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes are used in microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes processes for water wastewater and industrial wastewater treatment reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes provides high mechanical strength such that they can be used in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes in drinking water treatment water softening and wastewater recovery nowadays reinforced nanofiltration hollow fiber membranes are commercially available in the market a reinforced hollow fiber hf nanofiltration module is an applicable alternative to both spiral wound and tubular membranes for treatment of low quality water sources it has been estimated that an optimized hf nf module would give a 100 increase in performance compared to an optimized spiral wound module 8 one disadvantage of hf membranes non reinforced is their poor mechanical strength which limits hf applications in high pressure separations 9 reinforced membranes solve this mechanical problem the purpose of this review to summarize reinforced braided hollow fiber rbhf membrane fabrication and the applications of such reinforced membranes in this respect the importance of braid polymer and spinneret types are discussed the literature on the subject is overview with a special attention paid to commercial applications of braided reinforced hollow fiber membranes 2 fabrication of reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes hollow fiber membranes are produced by the phase inversion method fig 1 a illustrates a typical hollow fiber production line the spinneret has openings for the polymer dope solution and the bore liquid to ensure the cast shape is a hollow fiber such a hollow fiber membrane has been broadly used in the field of precise filtration for production of sterile water drinking water dis tilled water and the like and has recently expanded in application range to sewage wastewater treatment solid liquid separation in septic tanks suspended solid removal from industrial wastewater and filtration of stream water and industrial water 7 hollow fiber membranes can be classified into a reinforced membrane type in which a polymer resin film is coated on a tubular fabric or braid and a single membrane type in which a hollow fiber membrane is composed only of polymer resin films without using a reinforcing material such as tubular fabrics or braids as a braid support layer polyethylene terephthalate pet support layer is used the reinforced hollow fiber membranes employ the tubular fabric or braid as a reinforcing material and thus exhibits excellent mechanical properties fig 1 b illustrates reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane production line to make reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes the braid material is passed through from center hole of spinneret instead of bore liquid 2 1 effect of support layer on reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes membrane fouling is a major problem in membrane processes membrane cleaning by back flush can cause delamination that is peeling of the membrane off the braid surface of the many materials used to make tubular hollow braid e g polyester fiberglass polyamide 6 6 polyamide 12 polypropylene polyethylene aramid and nylon fiberglass braid is more susceptible to membrane delamination due to poor membrane adhesion to the braid surface 1 there are many parameters that determine the quality of braided support layer braided textile material which is made with conventional braiding equipment from commercially available yarn has numerous breaks in the fiber moreover accumulation of broken filaments also known as fuzz can lead to defects in the polymer film coated onto the surface of such braid whiskers broken filaments protrude from the surface of the tubular support layer and can lead to either a polymer layer of increased thickness or polymer lean layers with pin holes homogeneous heterogeneous and hybrids braids have been evaluated in terms of the interfacial bonding between separation layer and tubular braid when cellulose acetate ca braids are used ca fibers in the braid are likely to be swollen and adhered together which result in decreased membrane permeability better properties can be achieved by combining carbon and glass fibers 9 in another study of homogeneous and heterogeneous interfaced braids fan et al 2015 showed that ca fibers are easily swollen by the dope solution leading to lower pore connectivity from outer surface to the inner surface and a decrease in permeation using pan fibers are led to a gap between separation layer and the braid fig 2 10 chen et al 2017 used pet poly mphenylene isophthalamide pmia and pmia pet 1 1 braids in their study to fabricate reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes by using pmia polymer fig 3 11 in pmia fibers the separation layer of pmia braid was tightly bonded with the homogeneous reinforced braid and ensured good compatibility on the other hand pet reinforced braid had a poor interfacial bonding as braid and separation layer were heterogeneous i e pet and pmia has a poor compatibility when pmia pet hybrid braid was used separation layer formed on pmia fibers was tightly bonded whereas separation layer formed on pet fiber was loosely bonded fig 4 shows braid types that can be used for reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes fig 4 a illustrates a diamond braid having an alteration of one yarn passing above and then below the other yarns fig 4 b illustrates a regular braid which passes above two and below two in a repeat fig 4 c illustrates a hercules braid which has a structure of 3 up 3 down diamond braid is the preferred braid type because it provides more porosity homogeneity and elasticity 12 in regular type braid porosity is low so dope solution between braid occurs peeling problem in hercules type surface roughness of braid is extremely high thus to make membrane having smooth surface membrane casting must be thicker water permeability decreases because of the thick membrane matrix if the open weave of the support layer has porosity that is too high the polymer infiltrates into the bore of the braid leading to a dramatic decrease in permeability at the same time too tight a weaving results in a poor anchoring of the polymer and an increased likelihood of polymer layer peeling from the braid weaving of fibers is an important parameter for membranes tightly weaved fibers tend to foul due to space restriction which resulted in moving insufficiently to stay clean or rubbing against each other on the other hand looser packing can be helpful for fibers to better repetitive twisting circularity of fiber which called as cylindricity is also important a cylindricity smaller than 0 8 brought about uneven membrane thicknesses which resulted in non uniform flux and defective areas resulted in a polymer film with inacceptable variations in thickness causing flux variations and defective areas which were too quickly fouled the braid cylindricity should be as close to 1 0 as possible 12 another important braid parameter is the young s modulus the goal is to achieve higher strength by choosing a stronger yarn e g of glass aramid or other high modulus material to benefit from material s high strength and stability for example a braid woven from glass multi filaments will have elongation less than 5 at break and glass multi filaments can be thought as non shrinkable also high modulus yarns are not desirable in practice since they provide inadequate adherence of film to the surface of the braid and when braid wet the braid will be too fragile for prolonged service 12 2 2 effect of polymer on reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes types and concentrations of polymer and additives determine the structure of the coated thin film layer for fabricating reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane which has a thin film layer coated on the surface of a reinforcing material or supporting material of a tubular braid thermodynamic stability differs according to the composition of dope solution to be used for coating in case of a thermodynamically stable dope solution the expected cross sectional structure is finger like on the contrary when thermodynamically unstable dope is used expected structure is sponge like without defected regions dope solution comprises polymer resin organic solvent for the polymer being used and a porogen typically a hydrophilic additive common polymer resins include polysulfone ps polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf polyacrylonitrile pan polyvinylchloride pvc cellulose acetate ca 10 pmia 11 polyimide polyamideimide and polyesterimide as the organic solvents n methyl pyrrolidone nmp 13 dimethyl formamide dmf 14 dimethyl acetamide dmac 15 or their mixtures are common choices as the porogen polyethylene glycol peg 16 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 17 and glycerol are often used in water treatment a bleach containing sodium hypochlorite as a free chlorine source is often used for membrane cleaning and water disinfections polyacrylonitrile based membranes disclosed in 6 are not stable to chlorine however this problem can be overcame by using a pvdf based membrane which is relatively stable to free chlorine mahedran et al 1995 discloses a method of coating a tubular braid with a pvdf solution to form a braid reinforced hollow fiber membrane 7 the pvdf solution only coats the outside surface of the braid without penetrating into the braid wall the membranes obtained are stable to 2000 ppm of free chlorine at ambient temperature unfortunately the membranes have very low water permeability mahedran et al 1999 granted to the same group of inventors discloses a method in which partially hydrolyzed poly vinyl acetate and calcined alumina particles are added to a braid supported pvdf membrane which shows a higher pure water permeability than the corresponding membrane without calcined alumina particles however this membrane showed poor resistance to fouling when applied to wastewater treatment this was attributed to the high sorptive capacity of the calcined alumina particles 18 lee et al 2008 4 have used polysulfone polymer to manufacture reinforced hollow fiber membrane in the study dope solution was composed of 13 17 by weight of polysulfone 10 19 by weight of pvp as porogen 10 11 by weight of peg as porogen and dmf as organic solvent hao et al 2016 19 have added graphene oxide go between 0 0 to 0 7 into pvdf material and fabricated reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes to increase interfacial bonding the braid was pretreated with naoh and later with distilled water increasing go amount to 0 5 wt in polymer matrix narrowed pore size distribution of the membrane with increased pore diameter 0 09 nm to 0 16 nm and an increased porosity 38 5 to 47 26 further increase in go amount decreased both pore size and porosity of the membranes durability and stability of the membranes were found to be outstanding since membrane performance 0 5 wt go did not deteriorate after get fouled by oil water mixture and after cleaning fan et al 2015 9 have studied the effect of the ca concentration in dope solution for fabricating reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes study revealed that high ca concentration 10 wt resulted in dense and smooth outer surface high tensile and bursting strengths increased interfacial bonding between separation layer and tubular braid chen et al 2017 11 have fabricated reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes with pmia polymer by changing polymer concentration in the 5 15 wt range and showed that pmia membranes have good mechanical stability and sponge like structure formation was increased as pmia concentration is increased 2 3 the effect of spinneret design on reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes in reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane production process polymer coating is accomplished using a unique spinneret design normally membrane thicknesses between 0 01 and 0 1 mm can be achieved outside of the braid 20 mahendran et al 2002 12 used a unique nozzle to produce reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane fig 5 the nozzle comprises an inner barrel having an internal bore through which the braid advances into an axial bore of a nipple secured at the end of the inner barrel the bore provides a rounding orifice to help the braid acquire a circular cross section before it is coated with dope the rounding orifice has a diameter in the range from 1 10 of the nominal diameter of the braid nozzle design limits the amount of dope passing through the nozzle meters the correct amount of dope over the surface and distributes the metered amount uniformly over the surface of the braid coated layer thickness depends on the rate of braid pulling the viscosity of the dope and the thickness of the film of dope to be coated on the braid before it is immersed in the coagulant fig 6 shows another type of nozzle design which is used to produce capillary membranes in this design before the braid fed through the nozzle meets with the dope solution a solution non coagulation liquid is fed through an opening by pressure difference for keeping fiber wet at the tip of nozzle dope solution non coagulation liquid and braid met with each other and the braid is coated with the dope solution nozzle exit scrapes the excess of non coagulation liquid leaving the liquid only in the braid s pores and in the inner channel the braid with the dope solution at the outside and the non coagulation liquid in the inside enters the water bath this design prevents penetration of the dope solution into braid s pores and prevents anchoring effect of the dope coagulating when it comes in contact with the pore liquid fig 7 shows an alternative nozzle design for fabricating reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes the nozzle has multiple inlets that allow coating of tubular support with multiple layers simultaneously to give a defect free composite membrane 1 this design ensures strong physical adhesion and chemical binding between the membrane and the support strong binding is due to two mechanisms 1 adding a permeable adhesive layer between the membrane and the support to bond them during membrane formation and 2 applying an adhesive from the support side of a composite membrane after it is formed to bond the membrane and the support together therefore produced membranes can resist high back pressure 2 4 the effect of spinning speed on reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes spinning speed of reinforced braided hollow fiber membrane is important in order to obtain predetermined separation layer thicknesses on the surface of the reinforcing material of the tubular braid the speed with which the tubular braid is advanced and the quantity of the spinning dope introduced into the spinneret must be balanced lee et al 2008 has expressed the relation between the feed rate of a spinning dope and the speed of a tubular braid in eq 1 4 1 q π ρ ϑ d 0 t where q is the feed rate of dope solution ml min ρ is the density of dope solution ϑ is the advancing speed of the braid d0 is the outer diameter of the braid and t is the thickness of the dope solution when the advancing speed of the braid is high formation of a thin coating layer is expected when the advancing speed of the braid is much higher than the feed rate of the spinning dope some parts of the braid may not be coated uniformly with the dope solution when the advancing speed of the brad is low a non uniform membrane with a partially thick coating layer is produced thus advancing speed feed rate of dope solution and density of dope solution should be optimized to obtain membranes with a uniform membrane thickness lee et al 2008 speculated that optimum coating is achieved when k ratio is between 200 3000 g m2 larger k values correspond to thicker coating layers eq 2 represents k value calculation 4 2 k g m 2 q g m i n v m m i n d o m table 1 shows parameters that can be used in reinforced hollow fiber membrane fabrication and what can be done by adjusting them 3 reinforced braided hollow fiber studies hollow fiber membranes made without a braid have high permeability however their mechanical endurance is low due to the loose support layer many studies have been carried out on the possible means of increasing the mechanical properties of hollow fiber membranes using high strength hollow tubular braids coated with a separation layer proved to be effective 3 after hyano et al 1976 6 invented braided reinforced hollow fiber membranes many patents have been granted but relatively little information is available in the open research literature as of august 2019 only eighteen studies can be found in literature on using braided reinforced hollow fiber membranes table 2 the earliest study was that by liu et al 2009 3 wherein effect of filament numbers on membrane mechanical strength was investigated for this purpose pet filaments interlaced within polymer matrix after 2014 more research groups focused on using reinforced braided hf membranes the rest of published studies relied on the use of a spinning system allowing the use of braids in general studies dealt with determining the effects of braid polymer types on the interconnection between support layer and separation layer reinforced braided hf membranes are generally used in uf mf and mbr processes the also show promise for in nf and ro because they can improve mechanical strength of hf membranes in high pressure requiring applications sengur tasdemir et al 2018 21 used reinforced hf uf membranes to fabricate nf membranes by incorporating aquaporin z protein on interfacial polymerization layer performance of the membranes were characterized using braid free thin film composite tfc membranes as the comparative basis both reinforced tfc and reinforced aquaporin z incorporated tfc membranes had higher water permeability and same rejection performances compared to braid free tfc membranes 4 application areas wastewater treatment was one of the important parts in membrane separation field the membrane bioreactor mbr had emerged as an attractive technology for advanced municipal and industrial wastewater treatment as it combined the activated sludge processes with a membrane separation processes ultrafiltration membrane modules based on reinforced hollow fiber membranes are suitable for numerous applications including drinking water treatment tertiary filtration wastewater treatment and ro pre treatment for brackish water compared to granular media filtration uf membranes produce water of higher water quality which is virtually unaffected by variability in the feed water quality the modules can be arranged in a pressurized or submerged configuration because of the pet support layer the mechanical strength of the reinforced braided membranes is high in cross flow filtration reinforced membranes can be operated without deformed under pressures due to high mechanical resistance the most common application of reinforced membranes is the mbr process some large mbr applications with reinforced braided hollow fiber from worldwide is given in table 3 in fig 8 flow diagram of different usage alternatives is given for reinforced braided membranes system that were given in fig 8 a is used for drinking water treatment in this case reinforced membranes are potted as pressurized vessels raw water is fed to module by pump filtration mode is dead end for drinking water treatment if raw water has low quality and more suspended solid cross flow system can be used for treatment in fig 8 b membrane bioreactor can be applicable to domestic and industrial wastewater treatment system is a combination of a suspended growth biological treatment which is usually activated sludge with membrane filtration equipment typically low pressure microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes are the best option for mbrs because of their high mechanical stabilities

subsequent membrane tank side stream permeate water is collected via vacuum pump or by gravity driven systems then permeate water can be used for backwash the blower is necessary for both the scouring of membranes and aeration of biological system nowadays reinforced braided hollow fiber membranes are used as pre treatment before desalination systems flow diagram that is used in both drinking water production and in the desalination systems is given in fig 8 d membranes are immersed into tank vacuum pump is required to collect permeate water 5 future prospects reinforced braided hollow fiber
