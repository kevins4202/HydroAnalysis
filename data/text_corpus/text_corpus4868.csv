canterbury kent uk national centre for statistical ecology school of mathematics statistics and actuarial science university of kent canterbury kent u k corresponding author integrated population modelling is widely used in ecology when data at the individual level are combined with independent time series measuring population abundance however there is no formal assessment of how to select the best integrated model here we focus on the important case of determining the age structure for annual survival probabilities of wild animals involving comparing state space models with different numbers of states the work is motivated by real data sets and evaluated by simulation we reject the naïve use of aic and advocate the use of likelihood ratio tests based on combined data we demonstrate using simulation that typical asymptotic chi square distributions of likelihood ratio test statistics to compare integrated models apply when the corresponding state space models have the same state variables in addition for linear state space models with matching initial conditions the correct chi square distributions may also hold when models apparently have different state spaces the results for comparing integrated models also have relevance for state space modelling alone a senescence case study is provided which incorporates a step up approach and illustrates the use of the recommendations of the paper in practice keywords aic capture recapture kalman filter model selection ring recovery senescence state space models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction state space models ssms are increasingly used in ecology for example for modelling animal movement and population dynamics ssms are desirable because they account for both process noise and observation error which are common in ecological time series data see dennis et al 2006 and auger méthé et al 2021 ssms also provide a convenient framework for combining independent information from population surveys and demographic studies of individuals of the same species a single analysis is performed by constructing a joint likelihood function for the data from the various surveys which is the product of component likelihoods the approach known as integrated population modelling ipm unites different methodologies such as capture recapture and time series models and has the advantages of providing a simultaneous description of all the data increased precision of parameter estimates and the potential of coherent estimation of parameters otherwise not estimable from individual component analyses alone applied to data on mammals and birds the approach originates from besbeas et al 2002 and illustrations are provided in besbeas et al 2003 tavecchia et al 2009 and abadi et al 2010 amongst others schaub and abadi 2011 compile a useful listing of papers using integrated population modelling in ecology up to 2010 while more recent work is found in chandler and clark 2014 besbeas and morgan 2014 2017 2019 zipkin and saunders 2018 and schaub and kéry 2021 there is a parallel development in fisheries see maunder and punt 2013 the type of data sets that might be analysed using ipm is illustrated in the example of the next section which motivates the paper we shall use mrr mark recovery recapture to denote all types of data resulting from marked individuals 1 1 case study survival age structure of a population of alpine ibex in section 6 we shall analyse data collected at the gran paradiso national park italy from a large monitoring study of alpine ibex capra ibex detailed multivariate time series data consisting of annual counts of adult males and adult females yearlings and kids have been collected since 1956 see jacobsen et al 2004 kids are animals in the first year of life yearlings are in their second year of life and adults are all older animals in addition to the count data there are data sets on productivity and kid survival as well as adult mrr data the kid survival and adult female data come from a small sub population of closely monitored female ibex between 2000 and 2013 it is known whether each of the monitored females produces offspring and a binomial likelihood function is used to model these data if a kid is born monthly mrr data are collected if a mother is seen without the kid within its first year of life it can be assumed that the kid has died therefore a mrr likelihood with perfect detection probability can be used to estimate monthly kid survival probability adult mrr data date from 1985 and kid survival and productivity data from 2000 marked individuals make up a small proportion of the total censused population for approximately a third of the time and it is reasonable to assume independence of count and demographic data in an ipm in outline the model parameter set includes kid survival probability for describing kid survival data and count data yearling survival probability for describing count data adult survival probability for describing adult mrr data and count data recovery and capture probabilities for describing adult mrr data and fecundity productivity for describing count and productivity data in addition parameters account for the error in obtaining count data in the wild alpine ibex can live for up to 19 years toigo et al 2007 and consequently a vital modelling consideration is how to select age dependence in model parameters we are interested in determining the appropriate age structure of parameters using an ipm and we use the ibex data for illustrative purposes within this paper we focus on the determination of age structure in survival which is a key parameter see gaillard et al 2004 kid survival yearling survival capture and recovery probabilities will all be assumed to be constant as will be fecundity and observation variance however a full analysis of these data would subsequently require additional model selection to determine the appropriate parameter structure in terms of temporal and or environmental covariate dependence 1 2 determining age structure in survival in general typically the ssm structure adopted for ipm results from a combination of biological considerations for example age at breeding what is observed for example numbers breeding and a study of the component demographic likelihoods in isolation for instance in the common case of combining demographic data with a time series of population counts the structure of the ssm may be based on a separate analysis of mrr data alone see for example besbeas et al 2002 however it is natural to consider whether it would be advantageous instead to determine model structure using a combined likelihood as has been done by mccrea et al 2010 where preliminary model selection was conducted on the mrr data to inform integrated model selection besbeas and morgan 2012 consider in detail the estimation of survival and productivity parameters using integrated modelling concentrating on time variation of model parameters for a ssm of fixed order determined from a given age structure for survival in this paper we focus on the primary problem of selecting age structure in survival using integrated modelling which may then be followed by study of time variation as in besbeas and morgan 2012 see also catchpole et al 2000 an important consideration is that selected models describe data without over fitting through adopting excessive age dependence in annual survival probabilities 1 3 paper outline section 2 provides details of a gaussian ssm for count data section 3 provides the background on ipm and the difficulties of model selection in ipm are described in section 4 simulation is used in section 5 to show the importance of making comparisons for models that share the same state space order this is readily done for testing for age dependence in survival by suitably expanding model order and a way to compare models of different order is also suggested a range of alternative model selection strategies are compared also using simulation section 6 presents a study of age variation in survival and of senescence in the alpine ibex the paper ends with discussion and recommendations and conclusions 2 gaussian state space model for count data ssms are based on a transition equation describing the evolution of the underlying process and an observation equation relating what is observed to the underlying process the transition equation of a common ssm adopted for ipm includes an a a leslie matrix involving annual survival probabilities ϕ i i 1 2 a 1 a which vary with age up to a 1 and then remain constant at the value ϕ a for older ages a productivity measure p and measurement error variance σ 2 we denote such a model structure as ϕ 1 2 a we assume that breeding takes place after the first year of life which is the case for birds such as lapwings and grey herons so that the transition equation is given by eq 1 1 here n r t 1 r a 1 and n a t denote respectively the numbers of female animals birds aged r years and greater than or equal to a years at time 1 t t for appropriate t and the ϵ r t 1 r a denote appropriate process errors see besbeas et al 2002 this is a common type of model in population ecology see for example newman et al 2014 p 19 and newman et al 2022 typically the process errors are assumed to be poisson ϵ 1 t corresponding to reproduction and binomial ϵ j t for j 2 a 1 a corresponding to survival and we shall take them all as approximately normal thus we set ϵ 1 t n 0 p ϕ 1 n 2 t 1 n a t 1 ϵ j t n 0 ϕ j 1 ϕ j n j 1 t 1 j 2 a 1 ϵ a t n 0 ϕ a 1 ϕ a n a 1 t 1 n a t 1 and we shall also make the approximation of using expectations in the above expressions for variances introduced by besbeas et al 2002 we denote the leslie matrix in eq 1 by the partitioned matrix t the 2 1 element of matrix t denoted by t 2 1 is diagonal having a 1 distinct survival probabilities on its diagonal corresponding to ages 2 a the dimension a of the state vector denotes the total number of age classes for survival and is the order of the ssm a specific model may be expressed using different orders as shown below if we assume the number of breeding pairs at time t y t is observed for example from counting nests or territories then the observation equation is 2 y t 0 1 1 n 1 t n 2 t n a t η t n 2 t η t for t 1 2 t where we further assume that the observation error η t n 0 σ 2 it is the assumption of normal distributions for the errors in eqs 1 and 2 coupled with a normality assumption for the distribution of the initial state vector which we denote by n 0 that results in a gaussian state space model which is efficiently fitted using the kalman filter kf see besbeas et al 2002 3 integrated population modelling for illustration for the case of combining count and recovery data under the assumption that the data sets are independent maximum likelihood parameter estimates describing both data sets result from maximising the joint likelihood l j ϕ λ p σ m y l r ϕ λ m l c ϕ p σ y here l r is the likelihood for the mrr data defined as a product of multinomial distributions for each cohort of animals see mccrea and morgan 2015 p 60 and l c is the likelihood for the count data along with p and σ which have already been defined ϕ is the vector of survival probabilities λ is the vector of recovery probabilities for the mrr data and m and y denote the recovery and count data respectively l c is derived from the joint distribution of states and observations given in general form by 3 g 0 n 0 θ t 1 t g t n t n t 1 θ f t y t n t ψ where g 0 is the probability function for the initial state g t is the probability function for the state vector at time t and f t is the probability function for the observation vector see newman et al 2014 p 55 the extension of ipm to integrate additional independent data sources as in section 6 is obvious see for example besbeas and morgan 2019 besbeas et al 2002 approximate the count likelihood using the kf which we also adopt here on account of the normal distributions assumed and the expectation in the expressions for the variances the validity of these assumptions is examined in examples by brooks et al 2004 and besbeas and morgan 2019 using mcmc and hidden markov models respectively we use an approximate diffuse start for the kf in the numerical examples in section 5 which is simple and reduces the effect of the starting value see durbin and koopman 2001 p 101 and besbeas and morgan 2012 for details specifically the form adopted for g 0 n 0 θ of eq 3 is n 0 mv n 0 k i n where k is a large number mvn denotes the multivariate normal distribution and i n is the n n identity matrix for the state vector of order n 4 difficulties of model selection for ipms auger méthé et al 2021 identify several issues related to using information criteria such as aic and dic with ssms in general various complications arise in model selection for ipms i there is no simple information criterion that is optimal for model selection in particular various corrections to aic have been proposed for product multinomial models for data from marked individuals see burnham and anderson 2002 while different simulation based corrections have been proposed for ssms for time series see bengtsson and cavanaugh 2006 and auger méthé et al 2021 ii model selection involves the determination of both the order of the ssm and the corresponding ipm parameterisation this in turn may involve comparing ssms with different state spaces as arises when selecting age structure in survival and that comparison is not unique we shall denote the leslie matrices of eq 1 as l i j where i denotes the number of survival probabilities and j denotes the state space order for instance adopting a natural notation for age dependence in survival suppose we are interested in comparing the models ϕ 1 2 vs ϕ 1 2 3 using ipm and suppose that breeding starts at age 2 as in eq 1 the obvious parameterisation of the corresponding ssms is based on orders a 2 and a 3 respectively however there are alternative ways to parameterise the corresponding ssms for example for model ϕ 1 2 we have the alternatives corresponding to the leslie matrices l 2 2 l 2 3 l 2 4 of expressions 4 increasing in order from left to right similarly for model ϕ 1 2 3 we have the alternative leslie matrices l 3 3 l 3 4 l 3 5 of expressions 5 increasing in order from left to right 4 5 in ipm we refer to the comparison of ssms involving different orders as variable dimension otherwise we refer to the comparison as fixed dimension two illustrations of variable dimension comparisons are shown by the vertical arrows above for example l 2 2 and l 3 3 whereas corresponding fixed dimension comparisons are indicated by the sloping arrows for example l 2 3 and l 3 3 given a parameterisation corresponding to a particular survival age structure the likelihood is in general different between variable dimension ssms with that parameterisation and furthermore models may not be nested such a complication does not arise when mrr data are modelled in isolation so that model selection with respect to age structure in survival is then straightforward using likelihood based methods in addition variable dimension ssms require different initial distributions which further complicates the likelihood comparison of ssms iii an alternative approach to modelling age variation in ipm is to form a maximal ssm with specific age structures obtained as special cases of this model with the diagonal elements of the partition t 2 1 as well as ϕ a appropriately redefined the advantage of this approach is that the state space dimension is fixed throughout the model selection so that all models considered have the same maximal order and the initial state distribution is fixed for all models considered 5 simulation comparisons in this section we use simulation to investigate the comparison of ipms when the corresponding ssms differ in their order we compare a range of model selection procedures including standard approaches using aic and a step up approach using lrts we base simulation studies on the results of models fitted to data on two bird species which are often considered following their analysis in besbeas et al 2002 typically birds have a far simpler age structure than that of ibex gaillard et al 2004 and many mammals but these more complex scenarios are addressed using the ibex case study in section 6 5 1 two bird examples the models in this section have been used in several studies of ipm describing national data resulting from population surveys and demographic studies conducted by the british trust for ornithology on lapwings vanellus vanellus and grey herons ardea cinerea corresponding to birds breeding in the uk the population surveys estimate the numbers of breeding pairs in england and wales between 1965 1997 for lapwings and 1928 1998 for herons and are obtained from counting occupied territories and nests respectively the corresponding demographic data are dead recoveries from birds ringed as nestlings during the years 1963 1997 and 1955 1997 respectively population and demographic data from national surveys may frequently be taken as independent for instance the two types of data may be collected at different locations and or time periods previous integrated analyses for both species have assumed a fixed age structure for survival determined from a separate analysis of the mrr data alone see besbeas et al 2002 besbeas and morgan 2012 and king et al 2008 5 2 sampling distributions of lrts for integrated models data collected on wild animals necessarily become more sparse with increasing animal age in order to model survival as a function of age it is natural therefore to consider a step up sequence of tests of the form ϕ 1 vs ϕ 1 2 and ϕ 1 a 1 a vs ϕ 1 a a 1 for a 2 the starting model is usually ϕ 1 2 when model ϕ 1 is too simple for the data the lrt statistics of ϕ 1 2 vs ϕ 1 2 3 for the heron data when the null hypothesis is ϕ 1 2 are 38 5 and 35 4 for variable and fixed dimension comparisons respectively the parameter values used to generate the simulated data were obtained from corresponding joint analyses of the observed data on herons and lapwings see for example besbeas et al 2002 and besbeas and morgan 2012 and are given in table 1 as well as age dependence in survival there is time dependence of reporting probability and also in survival in the latter case through logistic regressions on the covariate w t which denotes the number of days when the temperature fell below freezing at a central england location on year t however models are fitted with age dependence only fig 1 provides the distribution of the test statistics estimated using the parametric bootstrap and 5000 simulations in each case for the simulated lapwing data the hypothesis being tested is whether that is one or two survival age classes whereas for the simulated heron data the hypothesis being tested is whether there are two or three age classes for survival a potential asymptotic distribution for the test statistics is therefore χ 1 2 this is seen to be appropriate when the model comparisons are made using fixed dimensions each being 3 but this is not true in the variable dimension case when the state space orders differ we note also that in the lapwing case there are negative values for the test statistic the difference between the simulations is that as they match real data there is more information for the heron case compared to the lapwings case it is clear that it can be inappropriate to use standard asymptotic likelihood ratio test statistic distributions to compare ssms unfortunately it is natural to want to compare ssms with different orders 5 3 validity of asymptotic distributions for ssm comparisons the key issue is that in order to adopt the standard asymptotic distribution for a lrt model comparison the simpler model must be nested within the more complex model if a fixed dimension comparison is made as when leslie matrices are l 2 3 and l 3 3 for example and the initial state distribution is the same in each case then the required nesting will apply however the corresponding variable dimension comparison compares l 2 2 with l 3 3 and the comparison distribution will not in general be approximately χ 1 2 as we have seen in fig 1 in the comparisons of the variable dimension case resulting in fig 1 a for example the initial states were n 0 mv n 0 k i 2 and n 0 mv n 0 k i 3 whereas in the fixed dimension case the initial state distribution was n 0 mv n 0 k i 3 for both hypotheses tested thus the ratios of the variances of n 1 t and n 2 t are not the same for the two models in the variable dimension comparison as well as expanding leslie matrices in some cases we can also contract them that is possible for the case of eq 1 and provides a simple way to test for age dependence using asymptotic likelihood theory in such a case for example if we sum the equations corresponding to the last two rows of the leslie matrix l 3 3 of expression 4 then we obtain n 1 t pois n 2 t 1 p ϕ 1 6 n 2 t bin n 1 t 1 ϕ 2 corresponding to the equations for l 2 2 as expected similarly if we sum the equations corresponding to the last two rows of the leslie matrix l 3 3 of expression 5 then we obtain n 1 t pois n 2 t 1 p ϕ 1 7 n 2 t bin n 1 t 1 ϕ 2 bin n 2 t 1 ϕ 3 the distributions of eqs 6 and 7 provide the conditional probability functions for the state vector at time t the g t of eq 3 hence we obtain the same likelihood using a l 2 2 leslie matrix corresponding to eqs 7 as using the l 3 3 leslie matrix of expression 4 as the state vectors contain just the two components n 1 t and n 2 t and n 2 t is a derived variable which does not enter likelihoods given by n 2 t bin n 1 t 1 ϕ 2 therefore we can test the null hypothesis h 0 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 by comparing models with two leslie matrices of the same order 2 the generalisation of the contraction of the model of eq 1 for a 3 is that the state vector is given by n 1 t n 2 t n a 2 t n a t and the additional derived state variable is n a 1 t bin n a 2 t ϕ a 1 it is straightforward to form the process errors in order for example to apply the kalman filter the results of eqs 6 and 7 and their generalisation to a 3 depend upon linearity and the particular structure of the leslie matrices of eq 1 we need equality of the two non zero probabilities in the last row of the leslie matrix thus for example it is not possible to follow one contraction by another however increasing the order of a leslie matrix in order for lrt theory to apply is always possible 5 4 comparisons of performance we now compare the relative performance of a range of alternative procedures for model selection a wide variety of information criterion methods might be considered see for example fletcher 2018 chapter 3 for a review we have already noted in section 4 a range of aic corrections described by auger méthé et al 2021 in fact auger méthé et al 2021 is positive about the use of standard aic and its correction for small samples in discriminating between state space models information criteria that penalise the likelihood using sample size are problematic for integrated population modelling of multiple data sets here for illustration we compare the use of lrt and aic for selecting survival age structure within both mrr and integrated modelling the parameter values used to generate the simulated data with 3 4 and 5 age classes were those of table 1 for the heron but with varied values of σ we do not report the full set of results here but comparisons were made for different values of the observation variance and also for various thinnings of the recovery data for the simulation study recovery data with 43 21 and 11 years of ringing were generated based upon the observed ringing numbers for herons these were combined for joint analysis with independent sets of simulated count data from 71 years to match the real data the survival models ϕ 1 a 1 a a 2 8 were then fitted to each set of simulated recovery and recovery and count data and the best model was selected using different model selection approaches we only present a small illustrative subset of the results in table 2 minimising aic typically results in complex models with appreciable age dependence in survival a simple ad hoc alternative used here is also to provide parsimony aic results in which we select the model with least parameters when there are competing best models with δ aic 1 lrt indicates model choice using a step up likelihood ratio test approach based on a chi square test statistic distribution we observe as expected from bengtsson and cavanaugh 2006 that aic tends to select an integrated model with a higher number of survival age classes than is necessary and aic for mrr data alone performs well at selecting the correct number of age classes see burnham and anderson 2002 and mccrea and morgan 2015 p 63 the lrt approach for the mrr data alone however usually selects a number of age classes of survival that is very close to the true number thus avoiding selecting spuriously large numbers of age classes which is undesirable as a general observation the relative performance of using mrr data alone compared with ipm for model selection will depend on the amounts of mrr and count data analysed when there are fewer mrr data it is the case that a smaller number of survival age classes are selected reflecting the reduced power to detect the differences in survival probability given the relatively small amount of information available generally we have seen that aic performs reasonably well for mrr data alone however the lrt approach out performs either information criterion approach using mrr alone can be fine as long as the mrr data are not too sparse this is not surprising as discussed in burnham and anderson 2002 the power to detect complex parameter structures using information criteria will depend on sample size when data are sparse it may also not be possible to estimate all parameters due to extrinsic parameter redundancy cole 2020 when using integrated data the best approach is the lrt approach and this is observed to perform at least as well as for mrr alone therefore in this simulation it is beneficial to use both data types when selecting the number of age classes naturally the benefit of including the count data is most pronounced when mrr data are sparse there are various conclusions that can be drawn aic typically results in more age classes than lrt parsimony is better in this regard as expected due to its construction in terms of selection of the best model joint is better than mrr except when there are appreciable mrr data and or the model is not too complex lrt mrr can underestimate the number of age classes especially compared with aic and joint mrr is better than mrr lrt in this respect 6 case study modelling senescence in ibex we have shown from simulation that using lrt to explore the model space using state vectors of fixed dimensions offers a practical approach for selecting an appropriate age structure in this application we demonstrate how the approach can be adapted to account for additional complexities in the type of age structure encountered an important aspect of determining age dependence in survival relates to senescence and how to model it this is typically difficult when data on wild birds are involved due to relatively little information on old individuals in that case it can however be easier for long lived mammals see gaillard et al 2004 for the data on alpine ibex we have multivariate census data consisting of annual counts of yearlings kids and adult males and females hence the state vector is generalised to include the categories of male and female the format of the state space model is equivalent to the model for soay sheep proposed in tavecchia et al 2009 for illustration we constrain all of the model parameters to be constant over time and sex and we then investigate the effect of varying survival probabilities with age building on the earlier work we shall use a step up procedure based on lrts see mccrea and morgan 2011 with fixed dimension and show how it needs to be modified to deal with the additional complexity of a model with senescence for the step wise approach to select the age structure in adult survival probability the simplest model ϕ 2 which denotes the model with all individuals aged greater than or equal to 2 having the same survival probability is defined as the model under the null hypothesis and then compared to model ϕ 2 3 which denotes the model with individuals aged 2 having a survival probability that differs to the survival probability for individuals aged greater than or equal to 3 the model under the alternative hypothesis if the test is significant at an appropriate level of significance then the model under the alternative hypothesis in this case model ϕ 2 3 becomes the model under the null hypothesis and comparison proceeds in this way until a non significant result is obtained the significance level needs to be appropriately conservative e g 1 or 0 01 as opposed to the standard 5 due to the issue of multiple testing discussion of alternative stopping rules is provided by mccrea and morgan 2011 for this application all significant p values were less than 0 01 if this step up approach is adopted on the integrated data then the selected model has 11 age classes with separate annual survival probabilities for all ages up to age 10 and a combined age class for all individuals of larger ages using the mrr data alone in such a step up procedure results in 15 age classes and in these cases aic results are consistent with using lrt however the models contain too many age classes for practical use to deal with this in table 3 we modify the step up approach so that once an extra age class is added there is a check of whether the previously added age class can be amalgamated with the one below it for ibex the integrated analysis now results in just 5 age classes with adult age classes amalgamated for individuals aged 2 to 6 7 to 10 and for those individuals aged greater than or equal to 11 using mrr data alone results in a similar model but with one additional age class we note that if this adapted step up and step down approach is applied to the heron and lapwing data sets the models previously selected are obtained with 4 and 2 age classes respectively a standard approach to modelling senescence is to use a gompertz curve to describe the mortality of the oldest animals the issue of how to choose the starting point for a gompertz curve has not been looked at previously and here we present a step wise approach using the ideas explored earlier we show in table 4 the results of doing this using aic to select the starting point for the gompertz curve using integrated data in this case lrts are not appropriate because the models being compared are not nested both mrr data alone and integrated data result in the same model and the gompertz curve starts at age 7 in line with the findings above it is interesting to note that the paper by gaillard et al 2004 also contained models for bighorn sheep ovis canadensis and roe deer capreolus capreolus with a gompertz curve starting at age 7 the resulting estimates are plotted in fig 2 model ϕ 2 11 denotes a model with different parameters for survival probability for individuals aged 2 to 10 and then a single parameter for the survival probability of individuals aged greater than or equal to 11 model ϕ 2 6 7 10 11 has 3 parameters for adult survival probability one for individuals aged 2 to 6 one for individuals aged 7 to 10 and one for individuals aged greater than or equal to 11 models ϕ 2 6 g 7 and ϕ 2 6 7 10 g 7 represent the models with constrained survival probabilities for individuals aged 2 to 6 and senescence described by a gompertz curve for individuals aged greater than 6 and greater than 10 respectively in the latter of these two models the relatively large estimates of standard error shown are due to fact that the gompertz fit estimates the slope as close to zero due to the presence of long term survivors at the oldest ages 7 discussion and recommendation model selection in ipm has not previously been formally addressed despite the fact that research was needed here was already clear to dennis et al 2006 we have demonstrated that a step wise approach using lrt can be a useful tool to determine the age structure within an ipm the approach performs at least as well as naive information criteria model selection and we have demonstrated that comparisons have to be made between state space models with the same dimension in order for the asymptotic distribution of the lrt statistic to hold 7 1 relative context to previous research the early work of besbeas et al 2002 and subsequent papers simply adopted the model selected by demographic data alone such as mrr followed by study of time variation of model parameters using aic thus the ssms compared have the same number of states and state variables auger méthé et al 2021 identify issues related to using aic with ssms especially when models differ in their number of states as in the case considered in this paper contrary to intuition adding information through ipm can result in a deterioration in model selection performance when aic is used the reason for this is that the standard aic used for ssm selection may favour overly complex models as has been pointed out by bengtsson and cavanaugh 2006 their solution was to propose a new criterion aici for use with ssm selection however this is complex requiring an appropriate monte carlo simulation it is in any case unclear how to proceed with ipm when data sets of different structures are analysed in combination the possibility of dimension reduction of leslie matrices was observed in besbeas and morgan 2019 and its wider potential is the subject of current research being able to reduce the dimension of a leslie matrix has the added attraction of facilitating the use of hidden markov models for model fitting see besbeas and morgan 2019 and mcclintock et al 2020 regarding the formation of derived variables there is an analogous result in the probability model for dynamic occupancy resulting in the occupancy parameter itself being formed as a derived parameter see royle and dorazio 2008 p 301 identifying dimension reduction might be possible using methods of computational symbolic algebra see for example cole and mccrea 2016 there is no doubt that naïve use of aic in ipm as done by mccrea et al 2010 for example runs the danger of over fitting and models that are too complex for the data this contradicts the comment in auger méthé et al 2021 that overall aic and its small sample alternatives can be used with ssms in many instances especially when the number of states are the same aic has been used for decades with ssms and simple simulation studies have shown that aic can be used to reliably select between ssms however critical use of aic may be useful in certain circumstances as in the gompertz modelling of the last section as a general rule we recommend model selection by integrated analysis using a step up procedure based on lrts when possible combined with step down checks as appropriate however it is essential that lrts are performed between nested models including consideration of initial distributions 7 2 implications for state space modelling and further research auger méthé et al 2021 indicate the need for further research on model comparison in ssms the investigation in section 5 2 highlights the need for the ssms within the ipm to have the same order and this finding applies more generally to cases when ssms are being compared in isolation we have only considered a particular type of ssm and so this is likely to be a fruitful avenue for further research in addition different types of observation equation might be appropriate in other applications the possibility of using score tests for exploration of model space see for example mccrea and morgan 2011 is attractive as these would only require the simpler model under the null hypothesis to be fitted and thus would avoid the need to fit models not supported by the data however the evaluation of the expected information matrix of an integrated model is non trivial and the use instead of a numerical approximation to the information matrix requires careful investigation see for example karavarsamis et al 2020 and morgan et al 2007 7 3 conclusion model selection for ipms has remained at the forefront of open statistical problems in ecological modelling even though the models themselves were first proposed 20 years ago in this paper we have demonstrated that simple step wise approaches using lrts perform well and offer a practical approach to address the issue of selecting the number of age classes within a model however naïve use of lrts across variable dimensions of ssms can result in test statistics with incorrect asymptotic distributions and we have identified the cause of this it is natural to want to compare ssms with different orders with incorrect results and we have shown how this problem can be rectified in addition we have found that determining age structure using mrr data alone will often perform competitively and will therefore stream line the implementation of data analysis making use of count census data will improve the performance of the model selection for determining age structure when the relative information of the mrr is weak due to small or sparse samples developing statistical solutions for model selection for ipms will become more difficult as the types of data which are considered within an ipm evolve zipkin and saunders 2018 however an approach which performs well for mrr and count data may well offer a solution for more

modelling is widely used in ecology when data at the individual level are combined with independent time series measuring population abundance however there is no formal assessment of how to select the best integrated model here we focus on the important case of determining the age structure for annual survival probabilities of wild animals involving comparing state space models with different numbers of states the work is motivated by real data sets and evaluated by simulation we reject the naïve use of aic and advocate the use of likelihood ratio tests based on combined data we demonstrate using simulation that typical asymptotic chi square distributions of likelihood ratio test statistics to compare integrated models apply when the corresponding state space models have the same state variables in addition for linear state space models with matching initial conditions the correct chi square distributions may also hold when models apparently have different state spaces the results for comparing integrated models also have relevance for state space modelling alone a senescence case study is provided which incorporates a step up approach and illustrates the use of the recommendations of the paper in practice keywords aic capture recapture kalman filter model selection ring recovery senescence state space models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction state space models ssms are increasingly used in ecology for example for modelling animal movement and population dynamics ssms are desirable because they account for both process noise and observation error which are common in ecological time series data see dennis et al 2006 and auger méthé et al 2021 ssms also provide a convenient framework for combining independent information from population surveys and demographic studies of individuals of the same species a single analysis is performed by constructing a joint likelihood function for the data from the various surveys which is the product of component likelihoods the approach known as integrated population modelling ipm unites different methodologies such as capture recapture and time series models and has the advantages of providing a simultaneous description of all the data increased precision of parameter estimates and the potential of coherent estimation of parameters otherwise not estimable from individual component analyses alone applied to data on mammals and birds the approach originates from besbeas et al 2002 and illustrations are provided in besbeas et al 2003 tavecchia et al 2009 and abadi et al 2010 amongst others schaub and abadi 2011 compile a useful listing of papers using integrated population modelling in ecology up to 2010 while more recent work is found in chandler and clark 2014 besbeas and morgan 2014 2017 2019 zipkin and saunders 2018 and schaub and kéry 2021 there is a parallel development in fisheries see maunder and punt 2013 the type of data sets that might be analysed using ipm is illustrated in the example of the next section which motivates the paper we shall use mrr mark recovery recapture to denote all types of data resulting from marked individuals 1 1 case study survival age structure of a population of alpine ibex in section 6 we shall analyse data collected at the gran paradiso national park italy from a large monitoring study of alpine ibex capra ibex detailed multivariate time series data consisting of annual counts of adult males and adult females yearlings and kids have been collected since 1956 see jacobsen et al 2004 kids are animals in the first year of life yearlings are in their second year of life and adults are all older animals in addition to the count data there are data sets on productivity and kid survival as well as adult mrr data the kid survival and adult female data come from a small sub population of closely monitored female ibex between 2000 and 2013 it is known whether each of the monitored females produces offspring and a binomial likelihood function is used to model these data if a kid is born monthly mrr data are collected if a mother is seen without the kid within its first year of life it can be assumed that the kid has died therefore a mrr likelihood with perfect detection probability can be used to estimate monthly kid survival probability adult mrr data date from 1985 and kid survival and productivity data from 2000 marked individuals make up a small proportion of the total censused population for approximately a third of the time and it is reasonable to assume independence of count and demographic data in an ipm in outline the model parameter set includes kid survival probability for describing kid survival data and count data yearling survival probability for describing count data adult survival probability for describing adult mrr data and count data recovery and capture probabilities for describing adult mrr data and fecundity productivity for describing count and productivity data in addition parameters account for the error in obtaining count data in the wild alpine ibex can live for up to 19 years toigo et al 2007 and consequently a vital modelling consideration is how to select age dependence in model parameters we are interested in determining the appropriate age structure of parameters using an ipm and we use the ibex data for illustrative purposes within this paper we focus on the determination of age structure in survival which is a key parameter see gaillard et al 2004 kid survival yearling survival capture and recovery probabilities will all be assumed to be constant as will be fecundity and observation variance however a full analysis of these data would subsequently require additional model selection to determine the appropriate parameter structure in terms of temporal and or environmental covariate dependence 1 2 determining age structure in survival in general typically the ssm structure adopted for ipm results from a combination of biological considerations for example age at breeding what is observed for example numbers breeding and a study of the component demographic likelihoods in isolation for instance in the common case of combining demographic data with a time series of population counts the structure of the ssm may be based on a separate analysis of mrr data alone see for example besbeas et al 2002 however it is natural to consider whether it would be advantageous instead to determine model structure using a combined likelihood as has been done by mccrea et al 2010 where preliminary model selection was conducted on the mrr data to inform integrated model selection besbeas and morgan 2012 consider in detail the estimation of survival and productivity parameters using integrated modelling concentrating on time variation of model parameters for a ssm of fixed order determined from a given age structure for survival in this paper we focus on the primary problem of selecting age structure in survival using integrated modelling which may then be followed by study of time variation as in besbeas and morgan 2012 see also catchpole et al 2000 an important consideration is that selected models describe data without over fitting through adopting excessive age dependence in annual survival probabilities 1 3 paper outline section 2 provides details of a gaussian ssm for count data section 3 provides the background on ipm and the difficulties of model selection in ipm are described in section 4 simulation is used in section 5 to show the importance of making comparisons for models that share the same state space order this is readily done for testing for age dependence in survival by suitably expanding model order and a way to compare models of different order is also suggested a range of alternative model selection strategies are compared also using simulation section 6 presents a study of age variation in survival and of senescence in the alpine ibex the paper ends with discussion and recommendations and conclusions 2 gaussian state space model for count data ssms are based on a transition equation describing the evolution of the underlying process and an observation equation relating what is observed to the underlying process the transition equation of a common ssm adopted for ipm includes an a a leslie matrix involving annual survival probabilities ϕ i i 1 2 a 1 a which vary with age up to a 1 and then remain constant at the value ϕ a for older ages a productivity measure p and measurement error variance σ 2 we denote such a model structure as ϕ 1 2 a we assume that breeding takes place after the first year of life which is the case for birds such as lapwings and grey herons so that the transition equation is given by eq 1 1 here n r t 1 r a 1 and n a t denote respectively the numbers of female animals birds aged r years and greater than or equal to a years at time 1 t t for appropriate t and the ϵ r t 1 r a denote appropriate process errors see besbeas et al 2002 this is a common type of model in population ecology see for example newman et al 2014 p 19 and newman et al 2022 typically the process errors are assumed to be poisson ϵ 1 t corresponding to reproduction and binomial ϵ j t for j 2 a 1 a corresponding to survival and we shall take them all as approximately normal thus we set ϵ 1 t n 0 p ϕ 1 n 2 t 1 n a t 1 ϵ j t n 0 ϕ j 1 ϕ j n j 1 t 1 j 2 a 1 ϵ a t n 0 ϕ a 1 ϕ a n a 1 t 1 n a t 1 and we shall also make the approximation of using expectations in the above expressions for variances introduced by besbeas et al 2002 we denote the leslie matrix in eq 1 by the partitioned matrix t the 2 1 element of matrix t denoted by t 2 1 is diagonal having a 1 distinct survival probabilities on its diagonal corresponding to ages 2 a the dimension a of the state vector denotes the total number of age classes for survival and is the order of the ssm a specific model may be expressed using different orders as shown below if we assume the number of breeding pairs at time t y t is observed for example from counting nests or territories then the observation equation is 2 y t 0 1 1 n 1 t n 2 t n a t η t n 2 t η t for t 1 2 t where we further assume that the observation error η t n 0 σ 2 it is the assumption of normal distributions for the errors in eqs 1 and 2 coupled with a normality assumption for the distribution of the initial state vector which we denote by n 0 that results in a gaussian state space model which is efficiently fitted using the kalman filter kf see besbeas et al 2002 3 integrated population modelling for illustration for the case of combining count and recovery data under the assumption that the data sets are independent maximum likelihood parameter estimates describing both data sets result from maximising the joint likelihood l j ϕ λ p σ m y l r ϕ λ m l c ϕ p σ y here l r is the likelihood for the mrr data defined as a product of multinomial distributions for each cohort of animals see mccrea and morgan 2015 p 60 and l c is the likelihood for the count data along with p and σ which have already been defined ϕ is the vector of survival probabilities λ is the vector of recovery probabilities for the mrr data and m and y denote the recovery and count data respectively l c is derived from the joint distribution of states and observations given in general form by 3 g 0 n 0 θ t 1 t g t n t n t 1 θ f t y t n t ψ where g 0 is the probability function for the initial state g t is the probability function for the state vector at time t and f t is the probability function for the observation vector see newman et al 2014 p 55 the extension of ipm to integrate additional independent data sources as in section 6 is obvious see for example besbeas and morgan 2019 besbeas et al 2002 approximate the count likelihood using the kf which we also adopt here on account of the normal distributions assumed and the expectation in the expressions for the variances the validity of these assumptions is examined in examples by brooks et al 2004 and besbeas and morgan 2019 using mcmc and hidden markov models respectively we use an approximate diffuse start for the kf in the numerical examples in section 5 which is simple and reduces the effect of the starting value see durbin and koopman 2001 p 101 and besbeas and morgan 2012 for details specifically the form adopted for g 0 n 0 θ of eq 3 is n 0 mv n 0 k i n where k is a large number mvn denotes the multivariate normal distribution and i n is the n n identity matrix for the state vector of order n 4 difficulties of model selection for ipms auger méthé et al 2021 identify several issues related to using information criteria such as aic and dic with ssms in general various complications arise in model selection for ipms i there is no simple information criterion that is optimal for model selection in particular various corrections to aic have been proposed for product multinomial models for data from marked individuals see burnham and anderson 2002 while different simulation based corrections have been proposed for ssms for time series see bengtsson and cavanaugh 2006 and auger méthé et al 2021 ii model selection involves the determination of both the order of the ssm and the corresponding ipm parameterisation this in turn may involve comparing ssms with different state spaces as arises when selecting age structure in survival and that comparison is not unique we shall denote the leslie matrices of eq 1 as l i j where i denotes the number of survival probabilities and j denotes the state space order for instance adopting a natural notation for age dependence in survival suppose we are interested in comparing the models ϕ 1 2 vs ϕ 1 2 3 using ipm and suppose that breeding starts at age 2 as in eq 1 the obvious parameterisation of the corresponding ssms is based on orders a 2 and a 3 respectively however there are alternative ways to parameterise the corresponding ssms for example for model ϕ 1 2 we have the alternatives corresponding to the leslie matrices l 2 2 l 2 3 l 2 4 of expressions 4 increasing in order from left to right similarly for model ϕ 1 2 3 we have the alternative leslie matrices l 3 3 l 3 4 l 3 5 of expressions 5 increasing in order from left to right 4 5 in ipm we refer to the comparison of ssms involving different orders as variable dimension otherwise we refer to the comparison as fixed dimension two illustrations of variable dimension comparisons are shown by the vertical arrows above for example l 2 2 and l 3 3 whereas corresponding fixed dimension comparisons are indicated by the sloping arrows for example l 2 3 and l 3 3 given a parameterisation corresponding to a particular survival age structure the likelihood is in general different between variable dimension ssms with that parameterisation and furthermore models may not be nested such a complication does not arise when mrr data are modelled in isolation so that model selection with respect to age structure in survival is then straightforward using likelihood based methods in addition variable dimension ssms require different initial distributions which further complicates the likelihood comparison of ssms iii an alternative approach to modelling age variation in ipm is to form a maximal ssm with specific age structures obtained as special cases of this model with the diagonal elements of the partition t 2 1 as well as ϕ a appropriately redefined the advantage of this approach is that the state space dimension is fixed throughout the model selection so that all models considered have the same maximal order and the initial state distribution is fixed for all models considered 5 simulation comparisons in this section we use simulation to investigate the comparison of ipms when the corresponding ssms differ in their order we compare a range of model selection procedures including standard approaches using aic and a step up approach using lrts we base simulation studies on the results of models fitted to data on two bird species which are often considered following their analysis in besbeas et al 2002 typically birds have a far simpler age structure than that of ibex gaillard et al 2004 and many mammals but these more complex scenarios are addressed using the ibex case study in section 6 5 1 two bird examples the models in this section have been used in several studies of ipm describing national data resulting from population surveys and demographic studies conducted by the british trust for ornithology on lapwings vanellus vanellus and grey herons ardea cinerea corresponding to birds breeding in the uk the population surveys estimate the numbers of breeding pairs in england and wales between 1965 1997 for lapwings and 1928 1998 for herons and are obtained from counting occupied territories and nests respectively the corresponding demographic data are dead recoveries from birds ringed as nestlings during the years 1963 1997 and 1955 1997 respectively population and demographic data from national surveys may frequently be taken as independent for instance the two types of data may be collected at different locations and or time periods previous integrated analyses for both species have assumed a fixed age structure for survival determined from a separate analysis of the mrr data alone see besbeas et al 2002 besbeas and morgan 2012 and king et al 2008 5 2 sampling distributions of lrts for integrated models data collected on wild animals necessarily become more sparse with increasing animal age in order to model survival as a function of age it is natural therefore to consider a step up sequence of tests of the form ϕ 1 vs ϕ 1 2 and ϕ 1 a 1 a vs ϕ 1 a a 1 for a 2 the starting model is usually ϕ 1 2 when model ϕ 1 is too simple for the data the lrt statistics of ϕ 1 2 vs ϕ 1 2 3 for the heron data when the null hypothesis is ϕ 1 2 are 38 5 and 35 4 for variable and fixed dimension comparisons respectively the parameter values used to generate the simulated data were obtained from corresponding joint analyses of the observed data on herons and lapwings see for example besbeas et al 2002 and besbeas and morgan 2012 and are given in table 1 as well as age dependence in survival there is time dependence of reporting probability and also in survival in the latter case through logistic regressions on the covariate w t which denotes the number of days when the temperature fell below freezing at a central england location on year t however models are fitted with age dependence only fig 1 provides the distribution of the test statistics estimated using the parametric bootstrap and 5000 simulations in each case for the simulated lapwing data the hypothesis being tested is whether that is one or two survival age classes whereas for the simulated heron data the hypothesis being tested is whether there are two or three age classes for survival a potential asymptotic distribution for the test statistics is therefore χ 1 2 this is seen to be appropriate when the model comparisons are made using fixed dimensions each being 3 but this is not true in the variable dimension case when the state space orders differ we note also that in the lapwing case there are negative values for the test statistic the difference between the simulations is that as they match real data there is more information for the heron case compared to the lapwings case it is clear that it can be inappropriate to use standard asymptotic likelihood ratio test statistic distributions to compare ssms unfortunately it is natural to want to compare ssms with different orders 5 3 validity of asymptotic distributions for ssm comparisons the key issue is that in order to adopt the standard asymptotic distribution for a lrt model comparison the simpler model must be nested within the more complex model if a fixed dimension comparison is made as when leslie matrices are l 2 3 and l 3 3 for example and the initial state distribution is the same in each case then the required nesting will apply however the corresponding variable dimension comparison compares l 2 2 with l 3 3 and the comparison distribution will not in general be approximately χ 1 2 as we have seen in fig 1 in the comparisons of the variable dimension case resulting in fig 1 a for example the initial states were n 0 mv n 0 k i 2 and n 0 mv n 0 k i 3 whereas in the fixed dimension case the initial state distribution was n 0 mv n 0 k i 3 for both hypotheses tested thus the ratios of the variances of n 1 t and n 2 t are not the same for the two models in the variable dimension comparison as well as expanding leslie matrices in some cases we can also contract them that is possible for the case of eq 1 and provides a simple way to test for age dependence using asymptotic likelihood theory in such a case for example if we sum the equations corresponding to the last two rows of the leslie matrix l 3 3 of expression 4 then we obtain n 1 t pois n 2 t 1 p ϕ 1 6 n 2 t bin n 1 t 1 ϕ 2 corresponding to the equations for l 2 2 as expected similarly if we sum the equations corresponding to the last two rows of the leslie matrix l 3 3 of expression 5 then we obtain n 1 t pois n 2 t 1 p ϕ 1 7 n 2 t bin n 1 t 1 ϕ 2 bin n 2 t 1 ϕ 3 the distributions of eqs 6 and 7 provide the conditional probability functions for the state vector at time t the g t of eq 3 hence we obtain the same likelihood using a l 2 2 leslie matrix corresponding to eqs 7 as using the l 3 3 leslie matrix of expression 4 as the state vectors contain just the two components n 1 t and n 2 t and n 2 t is a derived variable which does not enter likelihoods given by n 2 t bin n 1 t 1 ϕ 2 therefore we can test the null hypothesis h 0 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 by comparing models with two leslie matrices of the same order 2 the generalisation of the contraction of the model of eq 1 for a 3 is that the state vector is given by n 1 t n 2 t n a 2 t n a t and the additional derived state variable is n a 1 t bin n a 2 t ϕ a 1 it is straightforward to form the process errors in order for example to apply the kalman filter the results of eqs 6 and 7 and their generalisation to a 3 depend upon linearity and the particular structure of the leslie matrices of eq 1 we need equality of the two non zero probabilities in the last row of the leslie matrix thus for example it is not possible to follow one contraction by another however increasing the order of a leslie matrix in order for lrt theory to apply is always possible 5 4 comparisons of performance we now compare the relative performance of a range of alternative procedures for model selection a wide variety of information criterion methods might be considered see for example fletcher 2018 chapter 3 for a review we have already noted in section 4 a range of aic corrections described by auger méthé et al 2021 in fact auger méthé et al 2021 is positive about the use of standard aic and its correction for small samples in discriminating between state space models information criteria that penalise the likelihood using sample size are problematic for integrated population modelling of multiple data sets here for illustration we compare the use of lrt and aic for selecting survival age structure within both mrr and integrated modelling the parameter values used to generate the simulated data with 3 4 and 5 age classes were those of table 1 for the heron but with varied values of σ we do not report the full set of results here but comparisons were made for different values of the observation variance and also for various thinnings of the recovery data for the simulation study recovery data with 43 21 and 11 years of ringing were generated based upon the observed ringing numbers for herons these were combined for joint analysis with independent sets of simulated count data from 71 years to match the real data the survival models ϕ 1 a 1 a a 2 8 were then fitted to each set of simulated recovery and recovery and count data and the best model was selected using different model selection approaches we only present a small illustrative subset of the results in table 2 minimising aic typically results in complex models with appreciable age dependence in survival a simple ad hoc alternative used here is also to provide parsimony aic results in which we select the model with least parameters when there are competing best models with δ aic 1 lrt indicates model choice using a step up likelihood ratio test approach based on a chi square test statistic distribution we observe as expected from bengtsson and cavanaugh 2006 that aic tends to select an integrated model with a higher number of survival age classes than is necessary and aic for mrr data alone performs well at selecting the correct number of age classes see burnham and anderson 2002 and mccrea and morgan 2015 p 63 the lrt approach for the mrr data alone however usually selects a number of age classes of survival that is very close to the true number thus avoiding selecting spuriously large numbers of age classes which is undesirable as a general observation the relative performance of using mrr data alone compared with ipm for model selection will depend on the amounts of mrr and count data analysed when there are fewer mrr data it is the case that a smaller number of survival age classes are selected reflecting the reduced power to detect the differences in survival probability given the relatively small amount of information available generally we have seen that aic performs reasonably well for mrr data alone however the lrt approach out performs either information criterion approach using mrr alone can be fine as long as the mrr data are not too sparse this is not surprising as discussed in burnham and anderson 2002 the power to detect complex parameter structures using information criteria will depend on sample size when data are sparse it may also not be possible to estimate all parameters due to extrinsic parameter redundancy cole 2020 when using integrated data the best approach is the lrt approach and this is observed to perform at least as well as for mrr alone therefore in this simulation it is beneficial to use both data types when selecting the number of age classes naturally the benefit of including the count data is most pronounced when mrr data are sparse there are various conclusions that can be drawn aic typically results in more age classes than lrt parsimony is better in this regard as expected due to its construction in terms of selection of the best model joint is better than mrr except when there are appreciable mrr data and or the model is not too complex lrt mrr can underestimate the number of age classes especially compared with aic and joint mrr is better than mrr lrt in this respect 6 case study modelling senescence in ibex we have shown from simulation that using lrt to explore the model space using state vectors of fixed dimensions offers a practical approach for selecting an appropriate age structure in this application we demonstrate how the approach can be adapted to account for additional complexities in the type of age structure encountered an important aspect of determining age dependence in survival relates to senescence and how to model it this is typically difficult when data on wild birds are involved due to relatively little information on old individuals in that case it can however be easier for long lived mammals see gaillard et al 2004 for the data on alpine ibex we have multivariate census data consisting of annual counts of yearlings kids and adult males and females hence the state vector is generalised to include the categories of male and female the format of the state space model is equivalent to the model for soay sheep proposed in tavecchia et al 2009 for illustration we constrain all of the model parameters to be constant over time and sex and we then investigate the effect of varying survival probabilities with age building on the earlier work we shall use a step up procedure based on lrts see mccrea and morgan 2011 with fixed dimension and show how it needs to be modified to deal with the additional complexity of a model with senescence for the step wise approach to select the age structure in adult survival probability the simplest model ϕ 2 which denotes the model with all individuals aged greater than or equal to 2 having the same survival probability is defined as the model under the null hypothesis and then compared to model ϕ 2 3 which denotes the model with individuals aged 2 having a survival probability that differs to the survival probability for individuals aged greater than or equal to 3 the model under the alternative hypothesis if the test is significant at an appropriate level of significance then the model under the alternative hypothesis in this case model ϕ 2 3 becomes the model under the null hypothesis and comparison proceeds in this way until a non significant result is obtained the significance level needs to be appropriately conservative e g 1 or 0 01 as opposed to the standard 5 due to the issue of multiple testing discussion of alternative stopping rules is provided by mccrea and morgan 2011 for this application all significant p values were less than 0 01 if this step up approach is adopted on the integrated data then the selected model has 11 age classes with separate annual survival probabilities for all ages up to age 10 and a combined age class for all individuals of larger ages using the mrr data alone in such a step up procedure results in 15 age classes and in these cases aic results are consistent with using lrt however the models contain too many age classes for practical use to deal with this in table 3 we modify the step up approach so that once an extra age class is added there is a check of whether the previously added age class can be amalgamated with the one below it for ibex the integrated analysis now results in just 5 age classes with adult age classes amalgamated for individuals aged 2 to 6 7 to 10 and for those individuals aged greater than or equal to 11 using mrr data alone results in a similar model but with one additional age class we note that if this adapted step up and step down approach is applied to the heron and lapwing data sets the models previously selected are obtained with 4 and 2 age classes respectively a standard approach to modelling senescence is to use a gompertz curve to describe the mortality of the oldest animals the issue of how to choose the starting point for a gompertz curve has not been looked at previously and here we present a step wise approach using the ideas explored earlier we show in table 4 the results of doing this using aic to select the starting point for the gompertz curve using integrated data in this case lrts are not appropriate because the models being compared are not nested both mrr data alone and integrated data result in the same model and the gompertz curve starts at age 7 in line with the findings above it is interesting to note that the paper by gaillard et al 2004 also contained models for bighorn sheep ovis canadensis and roe deer capreolus capreolus with a gompertz curve starting at age 7 the resulting estimates are plotted in fig 2 model ϕ 2 11 denotes a model with different parameters for survival probability for individuals aged 2 to 10 and then a single parameter for the survival probability of individuals aged greater than or equal to 11 model ϕ 2 6 7 10 11 has 3 parameters for adult survival probability one for individuals aged 2 to 6 one for individuals aged 7 to 10 and one for individuals aged greater than or equal to 11 models ϕ 2 6 g 7 and ϕ 2 6 7 10 g 7 represent the models with constrained survival probabilities for individuals aged 2 to 6 and senescence described by a gompertz curve for individuals aged greater than 6 and greater than 10 respectively in the latter of these two models the relatively large estimates of standard error shown are due to fact that the gompertz fit estimates the slope as close to zero due to the presence of long term survivors at the oldest ages 7 discussion and recommendation model selection in ipm has not previously been formally addressed despite the fact that research was needed here was already clear to dennis et al 2006 we have demonstrated that a step wise approach using lrt can be a useful tool to determine the age structure within an ipm the approach performs at least as well as naive information criteria model selection and we have demonstrated that comparisons have to be made between state space models with the same dimension in order for the asymptotic distribution of the lrt statistic to hold 7 1 relative context to previous research the early work of besbeas et al 2002 and subsequent papers simply adopted the model selected by demographic data alone such as mrr followed by study of time variation of model parameters using aic thus the ssms compared have the same number of states and state variables auger méthé et al 2021 identify issues related to using aic with ssms especially when models differ in their number of states as in the case considered in this paper contrary to intuition adding information through ipm can result in a deterioration in model selection performance when aic is used the reason for this is that the standard aic used for ssm selection may favour overly complex models as has been pointed out by bengtsson and cavanaugh 2006 their solution was to propose a new criterion aici for use with ssm selection however this is complex requiring an appropriate monte carlo simulation it is in any case unclear how to proceed with ipm when data sets of different structures are analysed in combination the possibility of dimension reduction of leslie matrices was observed in besbeas and morgan 2019 and its wider potential is the subject of current research being able to reduce the dimension of a leslie matrix has the added attraction of facilitating the use of hidden markov models for model fitting see besbeas and morgan 2019 and mcclintock et al 2020 regarding the formation of derived variables there is an analogous result in the probability model for dynamic occupancy resulting in the occupancy parameter itself being formed as a derived parameter see royle and dorazio 2008 p 301 identifying dimension reduction might be possible using methods of computational symbolic algebra see for example cole and mccrea 2016 there is no doubt that naïve use of aic in ipm as done by mccrea et al 2010 for example runs the danger of over fitting and models that are too complex for the data this contradicts the comment in auger méthé et al 2021 that overall aic and its small sample alternatives can be used with ssms in many instances especially when the number of states are the same aic has been used for decades with ssms and simple simulation studies have shown that aic can be used to reliably select between ssms however critical use of aic may be useful in certain circumstances as in the gompertz modelling of the last section as a general rule we recommend model selection by integrated analysis using a step up procedure based on lrts when possible combined with step down checks as appropriate however it is essential that lrts are performed between nested models including consideration of initial distributions 7 2 implications for state space modelling and further research auger méthé et al 2021 indicate the need for further research on model comparison in ssms the investigation in section 5 2 highlights the need for the ssms within the ipm to have the same order and this finding applies more generally to cases when ssms are being compared in isolation we have only considered a particular type of ssm and so this is likely to be a fruitful avenue for further research in addition different types of observation equation might be appropriate in other applications the possibility of using score tests for exploration of model space see for example mccrea and morgan 2011 is attractive as these would only require the simpler model under the null hypothesis to be fitted and thus would avoid the need to fit models not supported by the data however the evaluation of the expected information matrix of an integrated model is non trivial and the use instead of a numerical approximation to the information matrix requires careful investigation see for example karavarsamis et al 2020 and morgan et al 2007 7 3 conclusion model selection for ipms has remained at the forefront of open statistical problems in ecological modelling even though the models themselves were first proposed 20 years ago in this paper we have demonstrated that simple step wise approaches using lrts perform well and offer a practical approach to address the issue of selecting the number of age classes within a model however naïve use of lrts across variable dimensions of ssms can result in test statistics with incorrect asymptotic distributions and we have identified the cause of this it is natural to want to compare ssms with different orders with incorrect results and we have shown how this problem can be rectified in addition we have found that determining age structure using mrr data alone will often perform competitively and will therefore stream line the implementation of data analysis making use of count census data will improve the performance of the model selection for determining age structure when the relative information of the mrr is weak due to small or sparse samples developing statistical solutions for model selection for ipms will become more difficult as the types of data which are considered within an ipm evolve zipkin and saunders 2018 however an approach which performs well for mrr and count data may well offer a solution for more general data types within an ipm this is a rich area for future research for ssms as well as ipm credit authorship contribution statement p t besbeas methodology software validation investigation data

24341,watershed anthropogenic activities including pollutant discharge sand mining and upstream reservoir operation have increased nutrient loads and decreased water levels and sediment concentrations in poyang lake and thus affected the aqueous ecosystem in this study we developed an ecological model from the framework of aquatox to simulate the physical chemical and biological evolution of poyang lake under watershed anthropogenic influences and used model output for a multidimensional ecosystem assessment of ecosystem structure function service material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability the potential impacts of a proposed poyang lake water conservancy project pywcp to build a sluice near the outlet of poyang lake to regulate lake level were explored results show that the watershed anthropogenic activities have worsened the poyang lake ecosystem specifically the phytoplankton biomass increased while benthos and fish decreased the exergy capacity of nutrient change and the total biomass gross primary production ratio decreased as the lake s volume decreased fishes trophic levels and food web robustness decreased the food web shrank single species dependence increased and ecosystem stability decreased the pywcp could mitigate most of these effects however it would not recover poyang lake to historical conditions and close monitoring with attention to sluice operational scheduling are required keywords poyang lake anthropogenic influences poyang lake water conservancy project ecological modeling multidimensional ecosystem assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction poyang lake 116 107596 e 29 457774 n one of the main lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river fig 1 is connected to the yangtze river and fed by seven rivers including the gan xiu fu xin rao boyang and xi rivers with the first five accounting for most of inflow while the yangtze river flows into poyang lake at hukou for short periods of time each year it is the only outflow watershed anthropogenic activities including pollutant discharge sand mining and upstream reservoir operation have increased significantly in the past two decades these watershed anthropogenic activities caused changes in the physical and chemical conditions in the lake including increased nutrient load decreased water levels and decreased sediment concentration for example the three gorges reservoir tgr 111 024502 e 30 836773 n located in the middle reaches of yangtze river is the world s largest hydraulic project after the tgr was built sediment deposition behind the dam led to substantial downstream scour and channel incising fang et al 2012 subsequently the water level of poyang lake declined because riverbed incising decreased the elevation of its river connection dai et al 2015 qi et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 y zhang et al 2016 p zhang et al 2015 d li et al 2016 thus the lake s outflow increased while the inflow from these seven rivers to poyang lake remained roughly the same portions of poyang lake s lakebed elevation and water level decreased as well due to climate change gao et al 2014 and sand mining lai et al 2014 the sediment concentration in poyang lake also decreased due to both the upstream reservoir operation and sand mining activities gao et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 these changes in physical and chemical conditions especially the decreased water volume and water level zhou et al 2019 liu et al 2017 pose threats to the lake s ecosystem he et al 2019 including reduced wetland area mei et al 2015 and alterations in the benthos l qi et al 2018 and other aquatic organisms recently the poyang lake water conservancy project pywcp has been proposed to build a sluice near the lake s outlet to regulate the lake level especially during the dry season it is essential to comprehensively assess the ecosystem status of poyang lake and its potential response to the pywcp poyang lake has been widely studied using various hydrodynamic and water quality models including two dimensional du et al 2018 li et al 2014 and three dimensional ho et al 2021 hydrodynamic models two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality models li et al 2018 wang et al 2019 2014 two dimensional sediment transport models lu et al 2019 z zhang et al 2015 efdc model qi et al 2017 2016 and habitat suitability curves chen et al 2020 however there are no comprehensive models that include the entire ecosystem poyang lake s complex dynamics cannot be simulated using only hydrodynamic or simple water quality models for example the substantial deposition of detritus and dying organisms potentially leads to significant decomposition and increased nutrient concentrations that could alter biomass material cycling and species composition so it is important to establish a more detailed ecological model that integrates physical chemical and biological components of the lake moreover there are also limitations to previous ecosystem assessments of poyang lake most ecosystem assessments evaluate only current conditions zhang et al 2021 2019 l qi et al 2018 z zhang et al 2016 yu et al 2010 you et al 2021 huang et al 2016 not potential future conditions also there are no ecosystem assessments from the perspectives of material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability for example there have been discussions of the potential effects of the pywcp on flow and nutrient concentrations using 2d or 3d hydrodynamic models ho et al 2021 lai et al 2016 while no discussions of other ecosystem features our multidimensional ecosystem assessment attempts to evaluate more ecosystem features in this paper we try to assess poyang lake s ecosystem under the scenarios of history representing conditions without heavy watershed anthropogenetic activities current with heavy watershed anthropogenetic activities and future sluice with pywcp to understand and project the historical impacts of watershed anthropogenetic activities and the potential of pywcp to resolve these impacts to do assessment we first use a detailed ecological model that integrates physical chemical and biological components of poyang lake to simulate and analyze the ecosystem elements under three scenarios we then propose a multidimensional ecosystem assessment framework to expand the analysis to ecosystem structure function service material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability from model outputs of these three scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and the ecological model poyang lake is a freshwater lake within the yangtze river basin fig 1 it is about 173 km long and 74 km wide with the mean and maximum water depths of 8 4 m and 25 1 m respectively extensive algal blooms have not been a major problem because its connection to the yangtze river provides substantial water exchange resulting in high water velocity and low water age gao et al 2018 which are not conducive to algal growth and accumulation dai and hu 2019 the surface area of poyang lake declined from 5200 km2 in 1949 to 3287 km2 in 2000s due to the lower water level which has threatened the water supply to nearby residents we developed an ecological model based on aquatox a widely used software package developed for the u s environmental protection agency https www epa gov ceam aquatox aquatox is a zero dimensional model based on fully mixed mass conservation and includes material flows among biotic and abiotic elements park and clough 2009 physical chemical and biological drivers are considered as input in the model including the water inflow and outflow lake volume water level suspended sediment concentration nutrient loads inflow of certain species biomass the model simulates the basic species metabolism and material transfer among all ecosystem elements fig 2 the elements include nutrients organic detritus photosynthetic autotrophs algae peri algae and plants and heterotrophic organism benthos zooplankton and fish taking a typical cycle as an example algae grow through photosynthesis consuming nutrients and releasing oxygen benthos ingests settled algae and organic detritus causing a decrease in the algae biomass and organic detritus concentration while an increase in the benthos biomass the benthos mortality produces organic detritus and decreases the benthos biomass organic detritus is decomposed into nutrients during which oxygen is consumed the model s time step is usually set as one day through the ecological model the specific values of physical chemical and biological elements such as the biomass of different species and nutrient concentrations can be exported for further assessments here the food web components of poyang lake and their feeding selectivity preferences table 1 were based on field observations wang et al 2011 aquatox parameter library and reasonable estimations of fishes feeding selectivity preferences zhang et al 2021 the food web includes four detritus fractions suspended refractory detritus srd suspended labile detritus sld sediment refractory detritus serd and sediment labile detritus seld six planktonic algal groups diatoms greens blue greens blue dinoflagellates dinof euglena eug and cryptophyta cryp six peri algal groups pdiatom pgreen pblue pdinof peug and pcryp corresponding to the six planktonic algal groups three zooplankton groups rotifers copepods and cladocera clad two benthos groups mussels and gastropods and two fish groups represented as carp and catfish the model simulates ammonia nh4 nitrate no3 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp carbon dioxide co2 and oxygen dynamics and all components have sources and sinks from to organisms and detritus as internal cycling these nutrients also have external inputs outputs from to outsides other variables include dissolved refractory detritus drd and dissolved labile detritus dld that make up dissolved organic carbon doc gross primary production gpp and biochemical oxygen demand bod the initial values of model parameters were chosen from the aquatox parameter library and modified during calibration 2 2 model calibration scenario drivers and statistics we simulated the evolution of poyang lake s ecosystem from 2011 to 2014 for model calibration calibration drivers water inflow during this period was based on daily measurements at the hydrological stations of five major rivers i e gan xiu fu xin and rao rivers provided by nanjing institute of geography limnology water inflow for the other two rivers i e boyang and xi rivers was estimated based on their ratio to total inflow water level was based on daily measurements at xingzi and water volume was calculated with the relationship between water volume and water level for poyang lake ji 2017 accordingly daily outflow at hukou was calculated as the difference between inflow and volume change outflow inflow dvolume where dvolume is the volume change nutrient loads were based on monthly nutrient concentrations at outlets of the five major rivers from 1997 to 2007 which were smoothed using the generalized additive model gam to get continuous monthly concentrations from 1997 to 2007 then the holt winters method was used to derive the 2011 2014 concentration time series nutrient loads were calculated by multiplying inflow and nutrient concentrations all nutrient loads were checked by comparing annual nutrient loads with measurements from 2011 to 2014 dai and hu 2019 and adjusted accordingly we estimated drp for the model from tp data using the ratio of drp to tp of poyang lake in 2020 provided by nanjing institute of geography limnology assuming zooplankton and phytoplankton biomass in the 5 rivers were similar between 2011 and 2014 and 2017 2019 the input of zooplankton biomass was based on measurements from the five major rivers during 2017 2018 chen 2020 and the input of phytoplankton biomass was based on that during 2017 2019 as provided by nanjing institute of geography limnology there were not sufficient poyang lake data on suspended sediment concentration ssc so we used data from the station at waizhou that had similar trends and annual average concentrations we extended daily ssc measurements from 1987 to 2007 at waizhou to 2011 2014 with linear regression organic detritus input was adjusted during calibration assuming that more organic detritus load was provided in the flood season than that in the dry season we used lake averaged data of monthly water temperature from 2011 to 2014 solar radiation was calculated from the latitude and altitude of poyang lake and the equations in aquatox evaporation and precipitation were assumed to be balanced wind was held constant at 5 m s calibration data we simulated lake scale average conditions for calibration we performed the simulation from 2011 to 2014 and compared results with observations from the corresponding years table s2 calibration statistics we calculated the error ratio rr eq 1 between simulated and observed data for annual average conditions and relative bias rb eq 2 and variance bias cf eq 3 for monthly observations park and clough 2009 taner et al 2011

corresponding variances 2 3 model assessment scenarios and drivers after calibration we developed three scenarios to assess the ecosystem under historical current and proposed sluice conditions historical scenario for this scenario we used average daily outflow inflow and water level data during 1956 2002 i e the period before the initial impoundment of tgr with low watershed anthropogenic activities average monthly nutrient concentrations from 1997 to 2002 of the five major rivers and average daily ssc data from 1987 to 2002 at waizhou station were used current scenario for this scenario we used average daily flow for 2002 2011 from the five major rivers and average monthly nutrient data from 2002 to 2007 average daily ssc data from 2002 to 2007 at waizhou were used sluice scenario this scenario represents the poyang lake ecosystem after the construction of pywcp particularly the water level was set based on water level of the current condition as modified by a possible pywcp scheduling scheme fig 3 the water level is mostly affected by sluice operation from november to next march water inflow is kept same as the current condition and the outflow was calculated as described above nutrient loads and ssc data were assumed to be the same as those in the current scenario 2 4 multidimensional assessment methods after model calibration and scenario simulations we conducted a multidimensional ecosystem assessment based on the model outputs to assess the poyang lake ecosystem under the different scenarios from the perspectives of ecosystem structure function service material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability different assessments focus on and reflect different aspects of the ecosystem fig 4 the first assessment focuses on the physical chemical structural functional aspects and services of the ecosystem in other words this assessment reflects human physical chemical and biological features and part of these functional assessment indices reflect the connections among biological elements the second assessment focuses on material flow reflecting the connections among elements the third assessment focuses on temporal ecosystem dynamics and collapse probability the three assessments reflect different ecosystem features and when combined provide the overall multidimensional assessment 2 4 1 physical chemical structure function and service assessment the first type of assessment is from the perspective of physical chemical function structure and service xu et al 2001 l qi et al 2018 chen et al 2017 regarding poyang lake features and data accessibility 17 indices were chosen for this assessment table 2 which are important for different aspects for example from the aspect of species protection species biomass such as carp catfish and gastropods are meaningful from the aspect of water quality the trophic level index tli chl and phytoplankton biomass are meaningful from the aspect of the whole ecosystem feature exergy and exst are meaningful from the aspect of human need water level z and water secchi depth are meaningful and from the aspect of these indices information entropy other indices such as bp ratio are meaningful because these indices are each meaningful for different aspects of the ecosystem we gave them equal weights in the following calculation process after determining the indices the value of each index is calculated from the model output and the specific calculation methods are shown in table 2 then the corresponding score is calculated according to index s preferred direction also shown in table 2 and specific value the preferred direction shows the index s trend that leading to good ecosystem status a preferred direction means that higher index value better ecosystem status and higher index score in contrast a preferred direction means that higher index value worse ecosystem status and lower index score moreover a preferred direction 1 means that closer to 1 of index value better ecosystem status and higher index score however not all differences matter small differences can be ignored when considering the ecosystem status so a fuzzy analytical method zimmermann 2001 paragraph s2 is used when calculating indices scores here for each index values within the same range of a given value this index s maximum value or minimum value among three scenarios for index with preferred direction or would be given same score for example for indices with preferred direction firstly the maximum value of the index among three scenarios is found out then the percentage of index value to the maximum value is calculated in each scenario finally the index s score is calculated according to score percentage relationship in table 3 after calculating each index s score the final score would be calculated by combing all indices scores in each scenario eq 4 as previously described we chose average weight for each index due to their meaningful condition which means that all indices are regarded to be of same importance and the final score will be affected by each index s score equally 4 final scor e j i 1 n score i j weight i j where score i j is the fussy score of the i th index under the j th condition and weight i j is the corresponding weight of the i th index the score of each index represents the ecosystem status from the perspective of that index where a higher score means a better ecosystem status relative to other scenarios the final overall score represents the comprehensive status of the ecosystem where a higher score means that the ecosystem s status is better among all scenarios 2 4 2 material flow assessment the second type of assessment is from the perspective of material flow using ecosystem network analysis ulanowicz et al 2004 ecosystem network analysis focuses more on processes flows than on objects stocks it proposes indices to quantify the material flow and links these features to ecosystem features material flow is the quantitative expression of the connection features among ecosystem elements as described above aqautox is a mass balanced model the material flow reflects the mass transfer among all ecosystem elements for example algae s photosynthesis transfers mass from nutrients to algae and conversely algae s respiration transfers mass from algae to nutrients the ingestion in food web shows the mass transfer relationship too according to these material flows we established a material flow matrix based on the output of ecological model table s1 then food web robustness fath and scharler 2019 eqs 5 7 and keystone scores for each species libralato et al 2006 eqs 8 14 were calculated based on the flow between different nodes robustness reflects the balance between efficiency and redundancy of the food web fig 5 where the higher robustness means better balance the keystone score reflects the importance of individual species in the food web where more uniform the keystone scores distribution is less dependent an ecosystem is on a single species the calculation of food web robustness 5 a i j t i j log t i j t t i t j 6 c i j t i j log t i j t 7 robustness a c log a c the calculation of keystone score ksi 8 g i j t i j k 1 n t k j 9 h i j t i j m 1 n t i m 10 q i j g i j h i j 11 m q q 2 q 3 12 e i j i n m i j 2 13 p i b i k b k 14 k s i e i p i where tij is material flow from node i to j bi is the biomass of the i th species and ksi is the keystone score of the i th species qij is element of matrix q mij is element of matrix m besides these indices above we also chose some other indices to show the ecosystem material flow features including annual average material flow seasonal material flow effective trophic level of fishes relative detrital and primary producer food chains here they are represented by the material flow s sankey diagram that shows the material flow through each element and compared using the diagram s y axis effective trophic level of fishes represents the in time trophic level of fishes according to fishes ingestion preference and here it is calculated based on their ingestion of tl1 and tl2 for example if one fish ingests 50 percent of its diet from tl1 and 50 percent from tl2 then its trophic level is calculated as 1 5 1 0 5 2 0 5 relative detrital and primary producer food chains represents the ratio of the detrital food chains to the grazing food chains and it is calculated by comparing ingestion of detritus and ingestion of algae and plants reflecting the relative dependence of different ecosystem food chains 2 4 3 ecosystem dynamics and collapse probability assessment the third type of assessment is from the perspective of ecosystem dynamics and collapse probability ecosystems fluctuate around an equilibrium position and if disturbed move away from it pimm et al 1984 in this theory ecosystem stability is defined as composed of temporal stability resistance persistence and resilience fig 6 table s2 among which temporal stability and resistance are most widely used because they are the easiest to calculate and understand donohue et al 2013 here we used temporal stability to assess the ecosystem dynamics under different scenarios collapse probability fig 7 is the probability of changing from one equilibrium position to another scheffer and carpenter 2003 carpenter et al 2011 this change may be a sudden regime shift which may have some leading indices such as higher variance carpenter and brock 2006 higher skewness guttal et al 2008 or higher first order autocorrelation scheffer et al 2009 of the time series of ecosystem elements here we calculated the variance and skewness to estimate the collapse probability for these three scenarios table s2 fuzzy analysis method is not suitable for these indices as these indices difference may be small and the fuzzy range is hard to divide so the scores for ecosystem status were based on the values of temporal stability skewness and variance eqn 15 for preferred direction and eqn 16 for preferred direction the preferred directions for temporal stability skewness and variance are and respectively a higher ecosystem status score represents a lower probability of collapse and a higher temporal stability 15 scor e 1 log v i min v i 16 scor e 1 log v i min v i where vi is value of the i th index 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the error ratio rr of annual average values between simulation results and observations from model calibration fig 8 indicates that rr for almost all variables are within the range of ln 2 ln 0 5 as represented by red dashed lines i e meansim 0 5 2 meanobs eq 1 in the comparisons of monthly relative bias rb and variance bias cf between the simulation and observations fig 9 the isopleths correspond to the probability that the distributions of predicted and observed values as defined by the combination of rb and cf are similar assuming normal distributions with the weight of the cf difference reduced to be more suitable for ecological model calibrations park and clough 2009 ammonia nh4 oxygen diatoms greens chlorophyll a chla dinoflagellates dinof euglena eug cryptophyta cryp rotifers copepods gastropods and mussels are all within the 80 isopleth which means that their simulation outputs match the observations well park and clough 2009 meanwhile blue greens blue cladocerans clad nitrate no3 and dissolved reactive phosphorus drp are within the 50 isopleth implying a moderate match biochemical oxygen demand bod is outside the 50 isopleth not shown the bod measurement is from laboratory conditions of 20 c over 5 days water quality determination of biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days for dilution and seeding method hj 505 2009 in china as such it is a measure of the ultimate oxygen demand however the simulated bod represents the actual demand under simulated conditions the fact that the simulated values when the lake is roughly 20 degrees celsius fig s1 match the ultimate bod measurements is consistent with these differences 3 2 scenarios analysis the season characters affect the anthropogenetic and sluice effects greatly and the change degree of same ecosystem element in different seasons will cause different results also as the sluice s effects are mainly during november to next march the differences between current and sluice scenarios are mainly in fall and winter so both annual and seasonal results under different scenarios are given here and used in the following multidimensional assessment historical vs current scenarios because of yangtze river channel incision and other impacts the lake volume is lower in the current scenario compared to the historical scenario fig 10 a also because of more land exploitation and utilization in the watershed current nutrient loads are higher thus current nutrient concentrations are substantially higher than those in the historical scenario figs 10b and s2 which increases photosynthesis and causes higher npp and chlorophyll a figs 10c and 10d different from other nutrient concentrations phosphorus fig s2 shows a decrease trend in fall as compared with the historical scenario it is mainly because that the higher algae biomass leads to higher phosphorus assimilation and then decrease the phosphorus concentration in fall ammonia and nitrate concentrations are high so the effect of the higher algae assimilation on their concentrations absolute values is limited phosphorus concentration is low so the effect of the higher algae assimilation on its concentration s absolute value is obvious lower ssc generally leads to higher secchi depths and also increases the photosynthesis resulting in higher npp fig 10d and chlorophyll a concentration fig 10c especially in spring these differences are not obvious in summer and winter because of the relatively small differences in secchi and ssc and the relatively weak photosynthesis in these seasons due to thermal adaptability however the lower volume reduced the bottom area biomass of plants hydrilla zooplankton clad copepod rotifer benthos gastropod mussel and fish carp catfish in the current scenario figs 8e 8h fig s2 which also led to lower dissolved labile detritus dld fig 10i current vs sluice scenarios the operation of sluice will increase water level volume and bottom area in fall and winter compared to the current scenario also because the outflow to the yangtze river would decrease in fall and winter biomass and nutrient discharge would decrease this would lead to increasing biomass nutrient deposition decomposition and assimilation for longer periods in fall and winter increasing nutrient concentrations the effects of higher nutrient concentrations fig 10b on enhancing algae and hydrophyte growth would be limited because of the poyang lake s low temperature in winter so while nutrient concentrations increase threats of algal bloom in the sluice scenario are not high moreover the higher water level in the sluice scenario will provide more benthic habitat leading to increased benthos and fish biomass figs 10g and 10h historical vs sluice scenarios conditions under the sluice scenario led to an increase in biomass of several species compared to the current scenario however except for the benthos the biomass of most species is still lower than or similar with those in the historical scenario figs 10e 10h the higher water levels in fall and winter provide more benthic area for benthos significantly increasing its biomass 3 3 ecosystem assessment 3 3 1 structure function and service of ecosystem the score of each index represents the ecosystem status from the perspective of that index where a higher score represents a better ecosystem status and the overall score for each scenario represents the comprehensive status of the ecosystem the index results were rational and shown to be able to distinguish among cases s1 fig s3 fig s4 the assessments are summarized below fig 11 for both annual and seasonal scores for the three scenarios historical vs current scenarios the annual score for the current scenario is substantially lower than that of the historical scenario primarily because of higher phytoplankton and lower benthos biomass fish biomass exergy capacity total biomass gross primary production ratio and volume these differences are driven mainly by lower water level less habitat area higher nutrient concentrations and secchi depths in the current scenario seasonally the difference between historical and current scenario is largest in fall benthos and fish have high growth rates in fall so habitat limitation is most obvious then leading to the largest difference in scores current vs sluice scenarios the annual score for the sluice scenario is higher than the current scenario primarily because of higher water level volume biomass and exergy seasonally the sluice scenario s score is highest among three scenarios in winter when the water level and volume are significantly higher due to the pywcp sluice fig 3 historical vs sluice scenarios the annual score for the sluice scenario is lower than the historical scenario for reasons similar to that of the current scenario however in spring and winter sluice scenario scores are slightly higher than those of the historical scenario because of higher benthos net primary production and total biomass gross primary production ratio due to higher water levels from the pywcp sluice overall these results indicate that pollutant discharge sand mining and upstream reservoir operation have significantly degraded the poyang lake ecosystem and that the pywcp could partly mitigate these effects 3 3 2 material flow poyang lake food web components table 1 were assigned to one of three trophic levels trophic level one tl1 includes detritus phytoplankton periphyton and macrophytes hydrilla trophic level two tl2 includes zooplankton and benthos trophic level three tl3 includes carp and catfish tl2 preys on tl1 and tl3 preys on both tl1 and tl2 tl0 and tl00 were added before tl1 and after tl3 respectively tl0 represents the material inflow including photosynthesis and biomass loading with inflow denoted as in tl00 represents biomass outflow to the yangtze river respiration and excretion denoted as out and material flow to the detritus including organism mortality and defecation denoted as rec although respiration and excretion recycle into the nutrient pool they do not recycle into the detritus which act as prey in the food web so they are denoted as out rather than rec the material flow of rec material flow to the detritus is included in the food web in the next time step annual average material flow overall annual average material flow fig 12 is determined as the sum of out and rec and approximately reflects material flow because the differences in the respiration mortality excretion washout and gamete loss rate are moderate among all scenarios the numbers in fig 12 represent corresponding elements in the food web table 1 and d indicates direct material flow from the previous trophic level to the next one rather than through the current trophic level for example if the flow comes through the numbers 1 17 and 23 the flow path is 1 17 23 and if the flow comes through d in tl2 the flow path is 1 23 results show that current scenario has the lowest material flow and the historical scenario has the highest value figs 12a and 12b suggesting that the current ecosystem has shrunk relative to the historical condition meanwhile the material flow of the sluice scenario indicates that it would mitigate this shrinking fig 12c seasonal material flow seasonal progression of material flow is similar among these three scenarios as an example the historical scenario fig s5 shows material flow is the highest in fall and lowest in winter also different seasons have different features of the material flow there is more material flow through carp and catfish in summer and fall while in spring and winter most material flows directly from algae zooplankton and benthos to tl00 also in summer and fall the percentage of rec in tl00 are larger than in spring and winter effective trophic level of fishes the effective trophic level of fishes is calculated based on their ingestion of tl1 and tl2 for example if carp ingest 50 percent of its diet from tl1 and 50 percent from tl2 then its trophic level is calculated as 1 5 1 0 5 2 0 5 the fish trophic level is highest in the sluice scenario and lowest in the current scenario fig 13 a seasonally the fish trophic level is highest in fall and lowest in spring relative detrital and primary producer food chains comparing ingestion of detritus vs algae and plants reflects the relative dependence of ecosystem food web fig 13b the historical scenario has higher detrital ingestion suggesting that its food web relies more significantly on detritus in contrast the sluice and current scenarios are more reliant on algae and plants the fall food web has the lowest dependence on detritus and the summer has the highest robustness robustness reflects the balance between food web efficiency and redundancy fig 5 the sluice scenario was most robust fig 14 and the current scenario the least fall and winter robustness is significantly higher than spring and summer the robustness acratio relationship fig 15 shows that the current scenario s robustness is lower because the ac ratio is smaller which means its food web has greater redundancy and is moving toward stagnation compared to the other two scenarios the sluice scenario had a higher efficiency so it is closer to an optimal balance keystone score keystone scores reflect the importance of individual species in the food web according to the annual average keystone scores fig 16 a hydrilla is a key prey and catfish cladocera and copepods are key predators at the whole year average scale the current scenario s coefficient of variation c v of keystone scores is the highest followed slightly by the sluice scenario however they are not significantly different from each other at the seasonal scale the sluice scenario has lower c v of keystone scores in spring fall and winter and higher c v in summer compared with current scenario all scenarios have lower c v in summer and fall and higher c v in spring and winter which means that the important species varies more substantially in spring and winter compared with summer and fall the sluice scenario has a higher c v in summer compared with other two scenarios primarily because carp and catfish have higher keystone scores in the sluice scenario fig 16b thus it is important to focus on fish resources in summer to avoid large changes in the food web under the sluice scenario compared with other two scenarios fig 17 3 3 3 temporal dynamics and collapse probability we calculated the temporal stability variance and skewness to assess temporal dynamics and collapse probability ecosystem status scores are given to each scenario according to index values and preferred directions a higher score means higher temporal stability and lower collapse probability ecosystem status scores show different bias among these three scenarios when calculated from different ecosystem elements meng et al 2021 so a scores density contour is used to show the group s statistical characterization of these biases e g the blue lines in fig 18 the closer the density contour line to the scenario s angle the better the ecosystem status is for that scenario all density contour lines show that the current state is less stable than the historical and sluice states 4 conclusion and further work in this study we used a calibrated ecological model to simulate poyang lake s ecosystem under three scenarios a historical scenario without large human perturbations a current scenario that includes the effects of watershed anthropogenic activities and a sluice scenario that includes the effects of both the watershed anthropogenic activities and the proposed pywcp then model outputs were used in a multidimensional ecosystem assessment from the perspectives of ecosystem structure function service food web material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability to explore the direct and indirect effects of watershed anthropogenic activities and the pywcp the main conclusions are as follows 1 watershed activities have changed poyang lake s ecosystem significantly including increased nutrient concentrations and algal biomass and decreased benthos and fish biomass they also degraded the poyang lake ecosystem from many other perspectives including producing lower exergy capacity total biomass gross primary production ratio and fishes trophic levels as well as reducing the breadth of the food web lowering food web robustness and leading to a heavier dependence on a single species 2 the proposed pywcp could mitigate many of these negative effects through increasing water level volume and bottom area in fall and winter compared to the current scenario the higher water level will provide more benthic habitat leading to increases in benthos and fish biomass and thus higher exergy also the breadth of food web food web robustness and fish trophic levels increase moreover the heavy dependence on a single species is slightly mitigated on an annual average scale and obviously mitigated in spring fall and winter however the pywcp would not likely lead to a full recovery of the poyang lake ecosystem to historical conditions 3 seasonal assessments are important firstly seasonal assessment could show potential problem that hidden at annual average scale for example the pywcp causes additional problems at seasonal scale such as higher nutrient concentrations in winter and higher dependence on fish resources in summer secondly the same change degree in ecosystem element in different season may cause different results for example although pywcp leads to obviously higher nutrient concentrations in winter the effects on enhancing algae and hydrophyte growth would be limited because of the poyang lake s low temperature in winter this also implies the importance of the timing and detailed scheduling of pywcp implementation 4 multidimensional assessments are important to show ecosystem features from different perspectives and are recommended when data is adequate in this manuscript three assessments are used the first assessment focuses on the physical chemical structural functional and services of the ecosystem and in other words it reflects human physical chemical and biological elements features the second assessment focuses on material flow reflecting the connections among elements the third assessment focuses on temporal ecosystem dynamics and collapse probability the first assessment is used most often while the second and third assessments are rarely used due to data limitation however without them the ecosystem features cannot be reflected comprehensively for example pywcp will bring higher ecosystem robustness and temporal stability but will also cause higher dependence on fish resources in summer which could not be explored without the assessment of material flow and ecosystem dynamics so ecological model as well as advanced monitoring tools need more attentions in the future to provide adequate data for multidimensional assessments finally it should be noted that we only assessed changes in the main water body of poyang lake but changes in wetlands connection between poyang lake and yangtze river and other conditions were not considered a more comprehensive assessment requires additional data and further work credit authorship contribution statement jia

24341,watershed anthropogenic activities including pollutant discharge sand mining and upstream reservoir operation have increased nutrient loads and decreased water levels and sediment concentrations in poyang lake and thus affected the aqueous ecosystem in this study we developed an ecological model from the framework of aquatox to simulate the physical chemical and biological evolution of poyang lake under watershed anthropogenic influences and used model output for a multidimensional ecosystem assessment of ecosystem structure function service material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability the potential impacts of a proposed poyang lake water conservancy project pywcp to build a sluice near the outlet of poyang lake to regulate lake level were explored results show that the watershed anthropogenic activities have worsened the poyang lake ecosystem specifically the phytoplankton biomass increased while benthos and fish decreased the exergy capacity of nutrient change and the total biomass gross primary production ratio decreased as the lake s volume decreased fishes trophic levels and food web robustness decreased the food web shrank single species dependence increased and ecosystem stability decreased the pywcp could mitigate most of these effects however it would not recover poyang lake to historical conditions and close monitoring with attention to sluice operational scheduling are required keywords poyang lake anthropogenic influences poyang lake water conservancy project ecological modeling multidimensional ecosystem assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction poyang lake 116 107596 e 29 457774 n one of the main lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river fig 1 is connected to the yangtze river and fed by seven rivers including the gan xiu fu xin rao boyang and xi rivers with the first five accounting for most of inflow while the yangtze river flows into poyang lake at hukou for short periods of time each year it is the only outflow watershed anthropogenic activities including pollutant discharge sand mining and upstream reservoir operation have increased significantly in the past two decades these watershed anthropogenic activities caused changes in the physical and chemical conditions in the lake including increased nutrient load decreased water levels and decreased sediment concentration for example the three gorges reservoir tgr 111 024502 e 30 836773 n located in the middle reaches of yangtze river is the world s largest hydraulic project after the tgr was built sediment deposition behind the dam led to substantial downstream scour and channel incising fang et al 2012 subsequently the water level of poyang lake declined because riverbed incising decreased the elevation of its river connection dai et al 2015 qi et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 y zhang et al 2016 p zhang et al 2015 d li et al 2016 thus the lake s outflow increased while the inflow from these seven rivers to poyang lake remained roughly the same portions of poyang lake s lakebed elevation and water level decreased as well due to climate change gao et al 2014 and sand mining lai et al 2014 the sediment concentration in poyang lake also decreased due to both the upstream reservoir operation and sand mining activities gao et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 these changes in physical and chemical conditions especially the decreased water volume and water level zhou et al 2019 liu et al 2017 pose threats to the lake s ecosystem he et al 2019 including reduced wetland area mei et al 2015 and alterations in the benthos l qi et al 2018 and other aquatic organisms recently the poyang lake water conservancy project pywcp has been proposed to build a sluice near the lake s outlet to regulate the lake level especially during the dry season it is essential to comprehensively assess the ecosystem status of poyang lake and its potential response to the pywcp poyang lake has been widely studied using various hydrodynamic and water quality models including two dimensional du et al 2018 li et al 2014 and three dimensional ho et al 2021 hydrodynamic models two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality models li et al 2018 wang et al 2019 2014 two dimensional sediment transport models lu et al 2019 z zhang et al 2015 efdc model qi et al 2017 2016 and habitat suitability curves chen et al 2020 however there are no comprehensive models that include the entire ecosystem poyang lake s complex dynamics cannot be simulated using only hydrodynamic or simple water quality models for example the substantial deposition of detritus and dying organisms potentially leads to significant decomposition and increased nutrient concentrations that could alter biomass material cycling and species composition so it is important to establish a more detailed ecological model that integrates physical chemical and biological components of the lake moreover there are also limitations to previous ecosystem assessments of poyang lake most ecosystem assessments evaluate only current conditions zhang et al 2021 2019 l qi et al 2018 z zhang et al 2016 yu et al 2010 you et al 2021 huang et al 2016 not potential future conditions also there are no ecosystem assessments from the perspectives of material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability for example there have been discussions of the potential effects of the pywcp on flow and nutrient concentrations using 2d or 3d hydrodynamic models ho et al 2021 lai et al 2016 while no discussions of other ecosystem features our multidimensional ecosystem assessment attempts to evaluate more ecosystem features in this paper we try to assess poyang lake s ecosystem under the scenarios of history representing conditions without heavy watershed anthropogenetic activities current with heavy watershed anthropogenetic activities and future sluice with pywcp to understand and project the historical impacts of watershed anthropogenetic activities and the potential of pywcp to resolve these impacts to do assessment we first use a detailed ecological model that integrates physical chemical and biological components of poyang lake to simulate and analyze the ecosystem elements under three scenarios we then propose a multidimensional ecosystem assessment framework to expand the analysis to ecosystem structure function service material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability from model outputs of these three scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and the ecological model poyang lake is a freshwater lake within the yangtze river basin fig 1 it is about 173 km long and 74 km wide with the mean and maximum water depths of 8 4 m and 25 1 m respectively extensive algal blooms have not been a major problem because its connection to the yangtze river provides substantial water exchange resulting in high water velocity and low water age gao et al 2018 which are not conducive to algal growth and accumulation dai and hu 2019 the surface area of poyang lake declined from 5200 km2 in 1949 to 3287 km2 in 2000s due to the lower water level which has threatened the water supply to nearby residents we developed an ecological model based on aquatox a widely used software package developed for the u s environmental protection agency https www epa gov ceam aquatox aquatox is a zero dimensional model based on fully mixed mass conservation and includes material flows among biotic and abiotic elements park and clough 2009 physical chemical and biological drivers are considered as input in the model including the water inflow and outflow lake volume water level suspended sediment concentration nutrient loads inflow of certain species biomass the model simulates the basic species metabolism and material transfer among all ecosystem elements fig 2 the elements include nutrients organic detritus photosynthetic autotrophs algae peri algae and plants and heterotrophic organism benthos zooplankton and fish taking a typical cycle as an example algae grow through photosynthesis consuming nutrients and releasing oxygen benthos ingests settled algae and organic detritus causing a decrease in the algae biomass and organic detritus concentration while an increase in the benthos biomass the benthos mortality produces organic detritus and decreases the benthos biomass organic detritus is decomposed into nutrients during which oxygen is consumed the model s time step is usually set as one day through the ecological model the specific values of physical chemical and biological elements such as the biomass of different species and nutrient concentrations can be exported for further assessments here the food web components of poyang lake and their feeding selectivity preferences table 1 were based on field observations wang et al 2011 aquatox parameter library and reasonable estimations of fishes feeding selectivity preferences zhang et al 2021 the food web includes four detritus fractions suspended refractory detritus srd suspended labile detritus sld sediment refractory detritus serd and sediment labile detritus seld six planktonic algal groups diatoms greens blue greens blue dinoflagellates dinof euglena eug and cryptophyta cryp six peri algal groups pdiatom pgreen pblue pdinof peug and pcryp corresponding to the six planktonic algal groups three zooplankton groups rotifers copepods and cladocera clad two benthos groups mussels and gastropods and two fish groups represented as carp and catfish the model simulates ammonia nh4 nitrate no3 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp carbon dioxide co2 and oxygen dynamics and all components have sources and sinks from to organisms and detritus as internal cycling these nutrients also have external inputs outputs from to outsides other variables include dissolved refractory detritus drd and dissolved labile detritus dld that make up dissolved organic carbon doc gross primary production gpp and biochemical oxygen demand bod the initial values of model parameters were chosen from the aquatox parameter library and modified during calibration 2 2 model calibration scenario drivers and statistics we simulated the evolution of poyang lake s ecosystem from 2011 to 2014 for model calibration calibration drivers water inflow during this period was based on daily measurements at the hydrological stations of five major rivers i e gan xiu fu xin and rao rivers provided by nanjing institute of geography limnology water inflow for the other two rivers i e boyang and xi rivers was estimated based on their ratio to total inflow water level was based on daily measurements at xingzi and water volume was calculated with the relationship between water volume and water level for poyang lake ji 2017 accordingly daily outflow at hukou was calculated as the difference between inflow and volume change outflow inflow dvolume where dvolume is the volume change nutrient loads were based on monthly nutrient concentrations at outlets of the five major rivers from 1997 to 2007 which were smoothed using the generalized additive model gam to get continuous monthly concentrations from 1997 to 2007 then the holt winters method was used to derive the 2011 2014 concentration time series nutrient loads were calculated by multiplying inflow and nutrient concentrations all nutrient loads were checked by comparing annual nutrient loads with measurements from 2011 to 2014 dai and hu 2019 and adjusted accordingly we estimated drp for the model from tp data using the ratio of drp to tp of poyang lake in 2020 provided by nanjing institute of geography limnology assuming zooplankton and phytoplankton biomass in the 5 rivers were similar between 2011 and 2014 and 2017 2019 the input of zooplankton biomass was based on measurements from the five major rivers during 2017 2018 chen 2020 and the input of phytoplankton biomass was based on that during 2017 2019 as provided by nanjing institute of geography limnology there were not sufficient poyang lake data on suspended sediment concentration ssc so we used data from the station at waizhou that had similar trends and annual average concentrations we extended daily ssc measurements from 1987 to 2007 at waizhou to 2011 2014 with linear regression organic detritus input was adjusted during calibration assuming that more organic detritus load was provided in the flood season than that in the dry season we used lake averaged data of monthly water temperature from 2011 to 2014 solar radiation was calculated from the latitude and altitude of poyang lake and the equations in aquatox evaporation and precipitation were assumed to be balanced wind was held constant at 5 m s calibration data we simulated lake scale average conditions for calibration we performed the simulation from 2011 to 2014 and compared results with observations from the corresponding years table s2 calibration statistics we calculated the error ratio rr eq 1 between simulated and observed data for annual average conditions and relative bias rb eq 2 and variance bias cf eq 3 for monthly observations park and clough 2009 taner et al 2011

corresponding variances 2 3 model assessment scenarios and drivers after calibration we developed three scenarios to assess the ecosystem under historical current and proposed sluice conditions historical scenario for this scenario we used average daily outflow inflow and water level data during 1956 2002 i e the period before the initial impoundment of tgr with low watershed anthropogenic activities average monthly nutrient concentrations from 1997 to 2002 of the five major rivers and average daily ssc data from 1987 to 2002 at waizhou station were used current scenario for this scenario we used average daily flow for 2002 2011 from the five major rivers and average monthly nutrient data from 2002 to 2007 average daily ssc data from 2002 to 2007 at waizhou were used sluice scenario this scenario represents the poyang lake ecosystem after the construction of pywcp particularly the water level was set based on water level of the current condition as modified by a possible pywcp scheduling scheme fig 3 the water level is mostly affected by sluice operation from november to next march water inflow is kept same as the current condition and the outflow was calculated as described above nutrient loads and ssc data were assumed to be the same as those in the current scenario 2 4 multidimensional assessment methods after model calibration and scenario simulations we conducted a multidimensional ecosystem assessment based on the model outputs to assess the poyang lake ecosystem under the different scenarios from the perspectives of ecosystem structure function service material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability different assessments focus on and reflect different aspects of the ecosystem fig 4 the first assessment focuses on the physical chemical structural functional aspects and services of the ecosystem in other words this assessment reflects human physical chemical and biological features and part of these functional assessment indices reflect the connections among biological elements the second assessment focuses on material flow reflecting the connections among elements the third assessment focuses on temporal ecosystem dynamics and collapse probability the three assessments reflect different ecosystem features and when combined provide the overall multidimensional assessment 2 4 1 physical chemical structure function and service assessment the first type of assessment is from the perspective of physical chemical function structure and service xu et al 2001 l qi et al 2018 chen et al 2017 regarding poyang lake features and data accessibility 17 indices were chosen for this assessment table 2 which are important for different aspects for example from the aspect of species protection species biomass such as carp catfish and gastropods are meaningful from the aspect of water quality the trophic level index tli chl and phytoplankton biomass are meaningful from the aspect of the whole ecosystem feature exergy and exst are meaningful from the aspect of human need water level z and water secchi depth are meaningful and from the aspect of these indices information entropy other indices such as bp ratio are meaningful because these indices are each meaningful for different aspects of the ecosystem we gave them equal weights in the following calculation process after determining the indices the value of each index is calculated from the model output and the specific calculation methods are shown in table 2 then the corresponding score is calculated according to index s preferred direction also shown in table 2 and specific value the preferred direction shows the index s trend that leading to good ecosystem status a preferred direction means that higher index value better ecosystem status and higher index score in contrast a preferred direction means that higher index value worse ecosystem status and lower index score moreover a preferred direction 1 means that closer to 1 of index value better ecosystem status and higher index score however not all differences matter small differences can be ignored when considering the ecosystem status so a fuzzy analytical method zimmermann 2001 paragraph s2 is used when calculating indices scores here for each index values within the same range of a given value this index s maximum value or minimum value among three scenarios for index with preferred direction or would be given same score for example for indices with preferred direction firstly the maximum value of the index among three scenarios is found out then the percentage of index value to the maximum value is calculated in each scenario finally the index s score is calculated according to score percentage relationship in table 3 after calculating each index s score the final score would be calculated by combing all indices scores in each scenario eq 4 as previously described we chose average weight for each index due to their meaningful condition which means that all indices are regarded to be of same importance and the final score will be affected by each index s score equally 4 final scor e j i 1 n score i j weight i j where score i j is the fussy score of the i th index under the j th condition and weight i j is the corresponding weight of the i th index the score of each index represents the ecosystem status from the perspective of that index where a higher score means a better ecosystem status relative to other scenarios the final overall score represents the comprehensive status of the ecosystem where a higher score means that the ecosystem s status is better among all scenarios 2 4 2 material flow assessment the second type of assessment is from the perspective of material flow using ecosystem network analysis ulanowicz et al 2004 ecosystem network analysis focuses more on processes flows than on objects stocks it proposes indices to quantify the material flow and links these features to ecosystem features material flow is the quantitative expression of the connection features among ecosystem elements as described above aqautox is a mass balanced model the material flow reflects the mass transfer among all ecosystem elements for example algae s photosynthesis transfers mass from nutrients to algae and conversely algae s respiration transfers mass from algae to nutrients the ingestion in food web shows the mass transfer relationship too according to these material flows we established a material flow matrix based on the output of ecological model table s1 then food web robustness fath and scharler 2019 eqs 5 7 and keystone scores for each species libralato et al 2006 eqs 8 14 were calculated based on the flow between different nodes robustness reflects the balance between efficiency and redundancy of the food web fig 5 where the higher robustness means better balance the keystone score reflects the importance of individual species in the food web where more uniform the keystone scores distribution is less dependent an ecosystem is on a single species the calculation of food web robustness 5 a i j t i j log t i j t t i t j 6 c i j t i j log t i j t 7 robustness a c log a c the calculation of keystone score ksi 8 g i j t i j k 1 n t k j 9 h i j t i j m 1 n t i m 10 q i j g i j h i j 11 m q q 2 q 3 12 e i j i n m i j 2 13 p i b i k b k 14 k s i e i p i where tij is material flow from node i to j bi is the biomass of the i th species and ksi is the keystone score of the i th species qij is element of matrix q mij is element of matrix m besides these indices above we also chose some other indices to show the ecosystem material flow features including annual average material flow seasonal material flow effective trophic level of fishes relative detrital and primary producer food chains here they are represented by the material flow s sankey diagram that shows the material flow through each element and compared using the diagram s y axis effective trophic level of fishes represents the in time trophic level of fishes according to fishes ingestion preference and here it is calculated based on their ingestion of tl1 and tl2 for example if one fish ingests 50 percent of its diet from tl1 and 50 percent from tl2 then its trophic level is calculated as 1 5 1 0 5 2 0 5 relative detrital and primary producer food chains represents the ratio of the detrital food chains to the grazing food chains and it is calculated by comparing ingestion of detritus and ingestion of algae and plants reflecting the relative dependence of different ecosystem food chains 2 4 3 ecosystem dynamics and collapse probability assessment the third type of assessment is from the perspective of ecosystem dynamics and collapse probability ecosystems fluctuate around an equilibrium position and if disturbed move away from it pimm et al 1984 in this theory ecosystem stability is defined as composed of temporal stability resistance persistence and resilience fig 6 table s2 among which temporal stability and resistance are most widely used because they are the easiest to calculate and understand donohue et al 2013 here we used temporal stability to assess the ecosystem dynamics under different scenarios collapse probability fig 7 is the probability of changing from one equilibrium position to another scheffer and carpenter 2003 carpenter et al 2011 this change may be a sudden regime shift which may have some leading indices such as higher variance carpenter and brock 2006 higher skewness guttal et al 2008 or higher first order autocorrelation scheffer et al 2009 of the time series of ecosystem elements here we calculated the variance and skewness to estimate the collapse probability for these three scenarios table s2 fuzzy analysis method is not suitable for these indices as these indices difference may be small and the fuzzy range is hard to divide so the scores for ecosystem status were based on the values of temporal stability skewness and variance eqn 15 for preferred direction and eqn 16 for preferred direction the preferred directions for temporal stability skewness and variance are and respectively a higher ecosystem status score represents a lower probability of collapse and a higher temporal stability 15 scor e 1 log v i min v i 16 scor e 1 log v i min v i where vi is value of the i th index 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the error ratio rr of annual average values between simulation results and observations from model calibration fig 8 indicates that rr for almost all variables are within the range of ln 2 ln 0 5 as represented by red dashed lines i e meansim 0 5 2 meanobs eq 1 in the comparisons of monthly relative bias rb and variance bias cf between the simulation and observations fig 9 the isopleths correspond to the probability that the distributions of predicted and observed values as defined by the combination of rb and cf are similar assuming normal distributions with the weight of the cf difference reduced to be more suitable for ecological model calibrations park and clough 2009 ammonia nh4 oxygen diatoms greens chlorophyll a chla dinoflagellates dinof euglena eug cryptophyta cryp rotifers copepods gastropods and mussels are all within the 80 isopleth which means that their simulation outputs match the observations well park and clough 2009 meanwhile blue greens blue cladocerans clad nitrate no3 and dissolved reactive phosphorus drp are within the 50 isopleth implying a moderate match biochemical oxygen demand bod is outside the 50 isopleth not shown the bod measurement is from laboratory conditions of 20 c over 5 days water quality determination of biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days for dilution and seeding method hj 505 2009 in china as such it is a measure of the ultimate oxygen demand however the simulated bod represents the actual demand under simulated conditions the fact that the simulated values when the lake is roughly 20 degrees celsius fig s1 match the ultimate bod measurements is consistent with these differences 3 2 scenarios analysis the season characters affect the anthropogenetic and sluice effects greatly and the change degree of same ecosystem element in different seasons will cause different results also as the sluice s effects are mainly during november to next march the differences between current and sluice scenarios are mainly in fall and winter so both annual and seasonal results under different scenarios are given here and used in the following multidimensional assessment historical vs current scenarios because of yangtze river channel incision and other impacts the lake volume is lower in the current scenario compared to the historical scenario fig 10 a also because of more land exploitation and utilization in the watershed current nutrient loads are higher thus current nutrient concentrations are substantially higher than those in the historical scenario figs 10b and s2 which increases photosynthesis and causes higher npp and chlorophyll a figs 10c and 10d different from other nutrient concentrations phosphorus fig s2 shows a decrease trend in fall as compared with the historical scenario it is mainly because that the higher algae biomass leads to higher phosphorus assimilation and then decrease the phosphorus concentration in fall ammonia and nitrate concentrations are high so the effect of the higher algae assimilation on their concentrations absolute values is limited phosphorus concentration is low so the effect of the higher algae assimilation on its concentration s absolute value is obvious lower ssc generally leads to higher secchi depths and also increases the photosynthesis resulting in higher npp fig 10d and chlorophyll a concentration fig 10c especially in spring these differences are not obvious in summer and winter because of the relatively small differences in secchi and ssc and the relatively weak photosynthesis in these seasons due to thermal adaptability however the lower volume reduced the bottom area biomass of plants hydrilla zooplankton clad copepod rotifer benthos gastropod mussel and fish carp catfish in the current scenario figs 8e 8h fig s2 which also led to lower dissolved labile detritus dld fig 10i current vs sluice scenarios the operation of sluice will increase water level volume and bottom area in fall and winter compared to the current scenario also because the outflow to the yangtze river would decrease in fall and winter biomass and nutrient discharge would decrease this would lead to increasing biomass nutrient deposition decomposition and assimilation for longer periods in fall and winter increasing nutrient concentrations the effects of higher nutrient concentrations fig 10b on enhancing algae and hydrophyte growth would be limited because of the poyang lake s low temperature in winter so while nutrient concentrations increase threats of algal bloom in the sluice scenario are not high moreover the higher water level in the sluice scenario will provide more benthic habitat leading to increased benthos and fish biomass figs 10g and 10h historical vs sluice scenarios conditions under the sluice scenario led to an increase in biomass of several species compared to the current scenario however except for the benthos the biomass of most species is still lower than or similar with those in the historical scenario figs 10e 10h the higher water levels in fall and winter provide more benthic area for benthos significantly increasing its biomass 3 3 ecosystem assessment 3 3 1 structure function and service of ecosystem the score of each index represents the ecosystem status from the perspective of that index where a higher score represents a better ecosystem status and the overall score for each scenario represents the comprehensive status of the ecosystem the index results were rational and shown to be able to distinguish among cases s1 fig s3 fig s4 the assessments are summarized below fig 11 for both annual and seasonal scores for the three scenarios historical vs current scenarios the annual score for the current scenario is substantially lower than that of the historical scenario primarily because of higher phytoplankton and lower benthos biomass fish biomass exergy capacity total biomass gross primary production ratio and volume these differences are driven mainly by lower water level less habitat area higher nutrient concentrations and secchi depths in the current scenario seasonally the difference between historical and current scenario is largest in fall benthos and fish have high growth rates in fall so habitat limitation is most obvious then leading to the largest difference in scores current vs sluice scenarios the annual score for the sluice scenario is higher than the current scenario primarily because of higher water level volume biomass and exergy seasonally the sluice scenario s score is highest among three scenarios in winter when the water level and volume are significantly higher due to the pywcp sluice fig 3 historical vs sluice scenarios the annual score for the sluice scenario is lower than the historical scenario for reasons similar to that of the current scenario however in spring and winter sluice scenario scores are slightly higher than those of the historical scenario because of higher benthos net primary production and total biomass gross primary production ratio due to higher water levels from the pywcp sluice overall these results indicate that pollutant discharge sand mining and upstream reservoir operation have significantly degraded the poyang lake ecosystem and that the pywcp could partly mitigate these effects 3 3 2 material flow poyang lake food web components table 1 were assigned to one of three trophic levels trophic level one tl1 includes detritus phytoplankton periphyton and macrophytes hydrilla trophic level two tl2 includes zooplankton and benthos trophic level three tl3 includes carp and catfish tl2 preys on tl1 and tl3 preys on both tl1 and tl2 tl0 and tl00 were added before tl1 and after tl3 respectively tl0 represents the material inflow including photosynthesis and biomass loading with inflow denoted as in tl00 represents biomass outflow to the yangtze river respiration and excretion denoted as out and material flow to the detritus including organism mortality and defecation denoted as rec although respiration and excretion recycle into the nutrient pool they do not recycle into the detritus which act as prey in the food web so they are denoted as out rather than rec the material flow of rec material flow to the detritus is included in the food web in the next time step annual average material flow overall annual average material flow fig 12 is determined as the sum of out and rec and approximately reflects material flow because the differences in the respiration mortality excretion washout and gamete loss rate are moderate among all scenarios the numbers in fig 12 represent corresponding elements in the food web table 1 and d indicates direct material flow from the previous trophic level to the next one rather than through the current trophic level for example if the flow comes through the numbers 1 17 and 23 the flow path is 1 17 23 and if the flow comes through d in tl2 the flow path is 1 23 results show that current scenario has the lowest material flow and the historical scenario has the highest value figs 12a and 12b suggesting that the current ecosystem has shrunk relative to the historical condition meanwhile the material flow of the sluice scenario indicates that it would mitigate this shrinking fig 12c seasonal material flow seasonal progression of material flow is similar among these three scenarios as an example the historical scenario fig s5 shows material flow is the highest in fall and lowest in winter also different seasons have different features of the material flow there is more material flow through carp and catfish in summer and fall while in spring and winter most material flows directly from algae zooplankton and benthos to tl00 also in summer and fall the percentage of rec in tl00 are larger than in spring and winter effective trophic level of fishes the effective trophic level of fishes is calculated based on their ingestion of tl1 and tl2 for example if carp ingest 50 percent of its diet from tl1 and 50 percent from tl2 then its trophic level is calculated as 1 5 1 0 5 2 0 5 the fish trophic level is highest in the sluice scenario and lowest in the current scenario fig 13 a seasonally the fish trophic level is highest in fall and lowest in spring relative detrital and primary producer food chains comparing ingestion of detritus vs algae and plants reflects the relative dependence of ecosystem food web fig 13b the historical scenario has higher detrital ingestion suggesting that its food web relies more significantly on detritus in contrast the sluice and current scenarios are more reliant on algae and plants the fall food web has the lowest dependence on detritus and the summer has the highest robustness robustness reflects the balance between food web efficiency and redundancy fig 5 the sluice scenario was most robust fig 14 and the current scenario the least fall and winter robustness is significantly higher than spring and summer the robustness acratio relationship fig 15 shows that the current scenario s robustness is lower because the ac ratio is smaller which means its food web has greater redundancy and is moving toward stagnation compared to the other two scenarios the sluice scenario had a higher efficiency so it is closer to an optimal balance keystone score keystone scores reflect the importance of individual species in the food web according to the annual average keystone scores fig 16 a hydrilla is a key prey and catfish cladocera and copepods are key predators at the whole year average scale the current scenario s coefficient of variation c v of keystone scores is the highest followed slightly by the sluice scenario however they are not significantly different from each other at the seasonal scale the sluice scenario has lower c v of keystone scores in spring fall and winter and higher c v in summer compared with current scenario all scenarios have lower c v in summer and fall and higher c v in spring and winter which means that the important species varies more substantially in spring and winter compared with summer and fall the sluice scenario has a higher c v in summer compared with other two scenarios primarily because carp and catfish have higher keystone scores in the sluice scenario fig 16b thus it is important to focus on fish resources in summer to avoid large changes in the food web under the sluice scenario compared with other two scenarios fig 17 3 3 3 temporal dynamics and collapse probability we calculated the temporal stability variance and skewness to assess temporal dynamics and collapse probability ecosystem status scores are given to each scenario according to index values and preferred directions a higher score means higher temporal stability and lower collapse probability ecosystem status scores show different bias among these three scenarios when calculated from different ecosystem elements meng et al 2021 so a scores density contour is used to show the group s statistical characterization of these biases e g the blue lines in fig 18 the closer the density contour line to the scenario s angle the better the ecosystem status is for that scenario all density contour lines show that the current state is less stable than the historical and sluice states 4 conclusion and further work in this study we used a calibrated ecological model to simulate poyang lake s ecosystem under three scenarios a historical scenario without large human perturbations a current scenario that includes the effects of watershed anthropogenic activities and a sluice scenario that includes the effects of both the watershed anthropogenic activities and the proposed pywcp then model outputs were used in a multidimensional ecosystem assessment from the perspectives of ecosystem structure function service food web material flow temporal dynamics and collapse probability to explore the direct and indirect effects of watershed anthropogenic activities and the pywcp the main conclusions are as follows 1 watershed activities have changed poyang lake s ecosystem significantly including increased nutrient concentrations and algal biomass and decreased benthos and fish biomass they also degraded the poyang lake ecosystem from many other perspectives including producing lower exergy capacity total biomass gross primary production ratio and fishes trophic levels as well as reducing the breadth of the food web lowering food web robustness and leading to a heavier dependence on a single species 2 the proposed pywcp could mitigate many of these negative effects through increasing water level volume and bottom area in fall and winter compared to the current scenario the higher water level will provide more benthic habitat leading to increases in benthos and fish biomass and thus higher exergy also the breadth of food web food web robustness and fish trophic levels increase moreover the heavy dependence on a single species is slightly mitigated on an annual average scale and obviously mitigated in spring fall and winter however the pywcp would not likely lead to a full recovery of the poyang lake ecosystem to historical conditions 3 seasonal assessments are important firstly seasonal assessment could show potential problem that hidden at annual average scale for example the pywcp causes additional problems at seasonal scale such as higher nutrient concentrations in winter and higher dependence on fish resources in summer secondly the same change degree in ecosystem element in different season may cause different results for example although pywcp leads to obviously higher nutrient concentrations in winter the effects on enhancing algae and hydrophyte growth would be limited because of the poyang lake s low temperature in winter this also implies the importance of the timing and detailed scheduling of pywcp implementation 4 multidimensional assessments are important to show ecosystem features from different perspectives and are recommended when data is adequate in this manuscript three assessments are used the first assessment focuses on the physical chemical structural functional and services of the ecosystem and in other words it reflects human physical chemical and biological elements features the second assessment focuses on material flow reflecting the connections among elements the third assessment focuses on temporal ecosystem dynamics and collapse probability the first assessment is used most often while the second and third assessments are rarely used due to data limitation however without them the ecosystem features cannot be reflected comprehensively for example pywcp will bring higher ecosystem robustness and temporal stability but will also cause higher dependence on fish resources in summer which could not be explored without the assessment of material flow and ecosystem dynamics so ecological model as well as advanced monitoring tools need more attentions in the future to provide adequate data for multidimensional assessments finally it should be noted that we only assessed changes in the main water body of poyang lake but changes in wetlands connection between poyang lake and yangtze river and other conditions were not considered a more comprehensive assessment requires additional data and further work credit authorship contribution statement jia

24342,aim species distribution models have become important tools for studying changes in biodiversity most studies use these models to evaluate the impact of global changes on biodiversity for that purpose scenarios are used that are based on changes in land use and or land cover or on climatic changes however the temporal transferability of such models depends heavily on modeling methods environmental predictors and the ecological traits of species here we evaluate the power of modeling tools to predict changes in bird species abundances based on observed changes in land cover location wallonia belgium methods to assess this temporal transferability this research makes use of two biological and two environmental datasets both sampled with a 10 year interval this allows us to compare the predictions of models for another period than the period used to fit the models with actual values for species abundance we also analyzed the impact of ecological traits on the temporal transferability generalized additive models were fitted for 75 breeding birds while a lot of studies use occurrence data we used abundance data for fitting models abundance data contains more information and should allow us to better capture abundance changes in bird populations results for the majority of species studied the results show a low temporal transferability with a few exceptions e g species with softwood habitats predicted changes do not correspond to observed changes for certain bird species e g those on arable lands we observed an increase in predicted abundances in the future while these species actually decreased few ecological traits seem to significantly impact the models transferability main conclusions our findings show that it is difficult to predict abundance changes of bird species based only on land cover changes it is necessary to add other predictors into the models e g predictors of habitat quality or spatial configuration keywords abundance birds ecological traits gam species abundance modeling temporal transferability data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction species distribution models sdm are a useful and powerful tool to study biodiversity patterns sdm can help us understand how species occurrence or abundance data relate to environmental characteristics elith and leathwick 2009 modeling tools are now widely used in many ecological fields and domains conservation biology muñoz et al 2015 population trends invasive species dynamics bradley 2016 and for predicting species distribution oppel et al 2012 milanesi et al 2017 johnston et al 2020 according to several studies models that are based on species habitat relationships and built on a given period could be used to predict the responses of species populations to changes over time in their habitats guisan and zimmermann 2000 strauss and biedermann 2007 regos et al 2018 the hypothesis is that current species habitat relationships are likely to be quite stable because they are the result of evolutionary adaptation to historical variations in habitat conditions drapeau et al 2016 for a long time many studies predicting the impacts of global change on biodiversity have used the temporal transferability of models i e the capacity of models to predict species distributions at another period than the period used to fit the models this transferability was tested on several taxonomic groups mainly based on models of species occurrence whether in presence absence or presence only e g peterson et al 2002 thomas et al 2004 matern et al 2007 dobrowski et al 2011 morán ordóñez et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 santini et al 2021 however abundance data contains more information than presence absence or presence only data abundance data should therefore allow us to better capture changes in biodiversity based on changes in environmental conditions howard et al 2014 yates et al 2018 results of such studies can inform us about drivers of biodiversity change identifying and understanding these drivers can inform conservation measures to preserve biodiversity from a methodological point of view several studies have shown that the transferability of models depends on modeling methods explicative variables and species traits beaumont et al 2016 duque lazo et al 2016 petitpierre et al 2017 yates et al 2018 regos et al 2019 in several studies models are also used to predict changes in species populations over time based on scenarios of change in land use or land cover fonderflick et al 2010 marshall et al 2018 newbold 2018 powers and jetz 2019 barras et al 2021 many other studies neglect changes in land use or land cover and instead focus on climate change because they argue climate change has become the main threat to biodiversity titeux et al 2016 nevertheless it has been demonstrated that land use and land cover changes are in fact the main threat to biodiversity and will continue to induce biodiversity decline through habitat destruction and degradation newbold et al 2015 newbold 2018 ipbes 2019 over the previous decades biodiversity has gone through serious changes butchart et al 2010 biodiversity loss strongly threatens the provision of ecosystem functions and services mace et al 2012 bennett et al 2015 ceballos et al 2015 suggest that human activities have induced a sixth mass extinction event all taxonomic groups whether birds mammals reptiles amphibians or insects are affected ceballos et al 2015 hallmann et al 2017 sánchez bayo and wyckhuys 2019 according to inger et al 2015 birds have greatly decreased in europe and the study estimated a loss of 421 million birds between 1980 and 2009 or an estimated decrease in abundance of 20 this decline is mainly due to a decline in the most common species which have lost large numbers of individuals significantly impacting the provision of ecosystem functions and services similar results were observed in north america with an estimated abundance loss of 29 since 1970 rosenberg et al 2019 the most serious declines are mainly observed in farmland bird species the main cause of decline being the intensification of agricultural practices such as hedgerow loss land drainage increased use of pesticide and fertilizer and the simplification of crop rotations donald et al 2001 robinson and sutherland 2002 mineau and whiteside 2013 other threats identified include urbanization climate change and the introduction or arrival of invasive species gregory et al 2009 maxwell et al 2016 it is therefore essential to develop relevant tools models and environmental data based on future scenarios of changes in land use and land cover in order to understand changes in species populations the aim of this paper is to evaluate the power of modeling tools to predict changes in bird species abundances based on observed changes in land cover these land cover changes are used in many studies to predict species changes based on future scenarios we therefore make use of two datasets of breeding bird samplings repeated after 10 years and of two detailed spatial descriptions of land cover for the same 10 year interval which were obtained through aerial photo interpretation these repeated schemes allow us to test if model fitting for a given period can accurately predict bird population changes for another period in this way we will compare the predicted values given by models with the actual abundance values of the bird datasets as we have two bird datasets repeated after 10 years we can analyze from forecasting and hindcasting perspectives to our knowledge very few studies use abundance data to test the temporal transferability of models many studies are instead based only on presence absence or presence only data santini et al 2021 as discussed above abundance data contain more information and should therefore better capture the impacts of environmental changes on biodiversity howard et al 2014 yates et al 2018 in addition we will verify if the quality and transferability of models is affected by species ecological traits 2 methods 2 1 study area the study focused on the region of wallonia 17 000 km² in southern belgium fig 1 a fig 1c presents the gradient of land cover variables in wallonia the north of wallonia a silt region consists mainly of large arable areas and large urban centers while the south of wallonia is mainly grassland and large forested areas hardwood softwood or mixed forests 2 2 bird dataset bird data came from samplings collected in square areas of 1 km² over two sampling periods the first in 2001 2007 and the second in 2015 2018 in each period each square was sampled twice during one hour all birds were recorded except for non breeding migratory birds a first passage was done between 25 march and 30 april and a second passage between 15 may and 30 june a passage consisted to visit the square by an observer during one hour the observer noted all individuals seen or heard it was important to note the behavior of birds to distinguish simple presences and signs of nesting the observer had to cover the square as completely as possible during the passage in the first period 2553 squares were sampled and in the second period 1007 squares were sampled however only 911 squares in each sampling period were conserved for further analysis fig 1b these squares were identical across the two sampling periods they were sampled correctly in both periods i e two passages were done between the fixed dates using the sampling methodology jacob et al 2010 for a given period if a species was not observed after the two passages it was considered absent in that square lastly the 75 most observed species out of a total of 155 were retained for analysis in the main the other 80 species were not taken into account in our analysis because they were not sufficiently present in the dataset this decision was made for statistical reasons for example to avoid a risk of overfitting the models indeed we observed that below a threshold of 50 presence sites sites with non zero abundance the modeling of most species was not consistent or correct several of the most observed species were discounted since they were exotic species e g canada goose branta canadensis egyptian goose alopochen aegyptiacus or species for which the abundance variation could be largely explained by climatic variables on the period between the two samplings since the main aim of this study was to analyze the impact of land cover changes we also decided to remove those species that were mostly impacted by climatic conditions e g crossbill loxia curvirostra meadow pipit anthus pratensis at a european scale distribution areas were checked for each species based on maps in the ebcc atlas of european breeding birds hagemeijer and blair 1997 and on maps available at the birdlife international website birdlife data zone 2020 having two abundance values in each period made it possible to refine the abundance estimate that served as reference in the species abundance models different criteria were applied to avoid an overestimation of population sizes these criteria depended on the life history traits of the species for the majority of the species it was the maximum abundance between the two passages which was taken into account for some species it was the first or the second passage which was taken into account e g to avoid late wintering species or the potential presence of juveniles during the second passage table a 1 in supporting information appendix a to limit the role of extreme values a logarithmic transformation was applied to the bird abundances the abundances were increased by 1 to keep zeroes 2 3 environmental dataset environmental data at high resolution were derived from the ecotope database radoux et al 2019 the advantages of this database are numerous it compiles a lot of environmental data from several different sources all variables are available for the whole of wallonia and some environmental variables are available for two periods which correspond to our sampling periods this database contains 104 variables these variables are of different types including climatic topographic soil attributes land cover height of vegetation and distance from linear features land cover variables are obtained from a pixel classification at a 2 m resolution of orthophotoplans lidar and sentinel 2 time series environmental data are available for two walloon orthophotoplan dates 2006 2007 and 2015 all variables were resampled at the same resolution as the bird data i e a resolution of 1 km² 33 variables of the ecotope database were retained for the analysis because they were the most relevant to the objectives of this study table 1 these variables described the local environment with descriptive indicators of soil humidity levels topography and land cover soil predictors were used because in wallonia these variables are important to inform about the ecological context however the 17 soil predictors were summarized in a principal component analysis pca we used five pca axes that explain about 60 of variance as environmental predictors in models the use of longitude latitude and altitude as variables allowed us to account for geographic and topographic heterogeneity improving the predictive precision of the models estrada et al 2016 only land cover variables varied between the two periods we decided to use land cover variables similar to those used in many of these studies there were nine land cover variables artificialized soils hardwood softwood arable lands grassland open wetlands bare soils water and clear cuts the proportion of each land cover variables in each square was used for modeling we used a pearson correlation threshold of 0 8 to determine the collinearity between the predictors this environmental dataset showed no correlation above this threshold the distribution of each variable was analyzed if the distribution was not normal a logarithmic or square root transformation was applied the logarithmic transformation was applied for the most staggered distributions in order to make normal the distribution of the variables if the variable distribution was normal no transformation was applied this made it possible to limit the role of extreme values 2 4 modeling all statistical analyses were realized with r v 3 5 1 models were constructed using mgcv package 2 4 1 model construction the statistical models used were generalized additive models gam this modeling method was selected following tests comparing the results of gam and random forest rf models these tests consisted of the prediction of the global abundance of each species in wallonia for both of the sampling periods the results were then compared to species abundances in the walloon breeding bird atlas jacob et al 2010 a dataset that was completely independent of our dataset and our analyses for a species subgroup arbitrarily chosen the results showed that for about two thirds of the species the abundances predicted with gam models were usually closer to the population sizes in the walloon atlas than the predicted abundances of rf models moreover during these preliminary tests the gam models took less computation time different models were fitted to estimate bird populations fig 2 and table 2 the aim was to determine if a particular modeling scenarios was more suitable to identify changes in bird populations this was tested by transferring fitted models onto another sampling period and by comparing predicted values with actual data the complete modeling procedure is described in fig 2 and in table 2 the first model was fitted on bird data from the first period 2001 2007 and on environmental data from the period 2006 2007 model m1p1 and was used to predict bird abundances for the period 2001 2007 fig 2 and table 2 the second model was fitted on bird data from the second period 2015 2018 and on environmental data from 2015 model m2p2 and was used to predict bird abundances for the period 2015 2018 the third model used the first model i e it was fitted on the bird data of the first period 2001 2007 and on the 2006 2007 environmental data and this time was used to predict bird abundances for the second period 2015 2018 using 2015 environmental data m1p2 the fourth model used the second model i e it was fitted on bird data from the second period 2015 2018 and on 2015 environmental data and this time was used to predict bird abundances for the first period using the 2006 2007 environmental data m2p1 the fifth model was fitted by compiling bird and environmental data from the two periods model mp for this last model all data were used to fit models i e that each sampled square was present twice in the dataset the squares appeared once with bird data from the first period 2001 2007 and environmental data from the period 2006 2007 and a second time with bird data from the second period 2015 2018 and environmental data from 2015 after fitting the model a prediction was produced for each of the two periods based on environmental data from each specific period as this fifth model took into account data from two periods we expected it to better account for variation in species habitat relationships and thus to better predict species abundances over time for each species and each modeling scenarios the modeling procedure was repeated 10 times and the final average model is used 75 species x 3 models x 10 repetitions 2250 single species models for each repetition the dataset was spatially separated into training and testing datasets using the r package blockcv valavi et al 2019 the study area was divided into spatial blocks the size of blocks was defined using the function available in the package spatialautorange function with 5000 sample points per raster this size was 17 km the blocks were randomly allocated to five folds the first four folds were used to fit the model and the last fold to test the quality of the model a procedure was applied to reduce the number of environmental predictors select option of gam function available in mgcv package this procedure selection could impose a penalty to each term and could remove terms from the model models produced mean abundance predictions per sampling square 75 species x 5 model predictions x 10 repetitions 3750 predictions for each square the exponential transformation was applied to the abundances produced by models the decimals of predicted values were kept the negative values predicted by models were transformed into zeroes these predictions were summed to obtain an abundance sum for the whole of wallonia 2 4 2 model quality the quality of different models was based on pearson correlation and spearman s rank correlation coefficients calculated between the testing dataset and the predictions obtained for these squares for the m1p2 models model quality was measured between the predicted abundance and the test dataset containing bird data from the second period 2015 2018 while for the m2p1 models model quality was measured between the predicted abundance and the test dataset containing bird data from the first period 2001 2007 fig 2 the correlation used was the mean of the correlations obtained by 10 repetitions of the models the slope and intercept of the major axis regression between observed and predicted values was used to evaluate the bias and consistency of predictions made by different modeling methods potts and elith 2006 piñeiro et al 2008 the deviances explained by models have not been discussed in this paper but they are presented in the supporting information table a 4 in supporting information appendix a 2 5 species selection pearson correlation coefficients of the m1p1 and m2p2 models were used to calculate the r² of each species means of the five highest pearson correlation coefficients for each species and each modeling scenario were used this selection allowed us to conserve only the five best models of each species among the 10 repetitions these means were then squared to obtain the r² if both r² of m1p1 and m2p2 models are superior to 20 thus the species was used in result analyses this criterion allowed us to exclusively conserve the best fitted models of species to environmental predictors 2 6 analyses of bird abundance changes the changes in bird population abundances were calculated between the different modeling scenarios using eq 1 four change rates were obtained in function of model combinations m1p1 m2p2 m1p1 m1p2 m2p1 m2p2 and mp this way of expressing the change meant that the rate of increase or decrease in a population was symmetrical and comprised between 2 extinction and 2 apparition all predicted changes were compared with observed changes based on the bird dataset paired student t test or wilcoxon t test were used to analyze if the predicted changes were significantly different from the actual changes the equation defining the change was 1 c h a n g e a 2015 a 2007 a 2007 a 2015 2 where a 2007 is the abundance of the first period and a 2015 is the abundance of the second period the observed changes in bird abundances between the two sampling periods were calculated using the bootstrap method this nonparametric method allowed us to measure the accuracy of observed changes the principle was to select several sampled squares randomly with replacement this meant that a sampled square could be selected several times while another square might not be selected at all the change was calculated on the selection of squares this step was repeated 10 000 times the mean of all abundance changes and the 90 confidence intervals were then measured keller et al 2020 the 90 confidence intervals were used to determine if abundance changes were significant i e if both minimum and maximum values were positive the species abundance increased significantly and if these values were negative the species abundance has decreased significantly if minimum and maximum values were of different signs the change in species abundance was not statistically significant the predicted changes with models were based on the mean of abundance sum of 10 repetitions from each species and each modeling type on the whole of wallonia for each abundance mean the variance was calculated using eq 2 as well as the 90 confidence intervals then we calculated the changes using the abundance mean values and their confidence intervals as for the observed changes in the bird dataset a change was significant if minimum and maximum values had the same sign the correlation between the predicted change based on the modeling and the change observed in the actual bird dataset was calculated for each modeling scenario to check the efficiency of each model to predict change the mean values of change were used for correlations ρ σ 2 2 v a r i a n c e i 0 n ρ σ i 2 1 ρ σ i 2 m where ρ is the mean correlation between all pairs of 10 repetitions of models σ2 is the variance of 10 predictions of abundance in each square n is the number of squares on the whole of wallonia and m is the number of repetitions i e m 10 2 7 traits of species bird species were grouped in different guilds based on their ecological traits related to phenology migrant or sedentary habitat specialization generalist or specialist habitat preference arable land grassland open habitat softwood hardwood forest water urban and gregariousness colonial semi colonial and solitary table a 2 in supporting information appendix a the habitat specialization was based on the species specialization index ssi le viol et al 2012 a threshold was set at an ssi value of 3 this choice resulted from an analysis of the ssi value of each studied species the threshold was fixed to best adapt to the particularities of the ecology of walloon species if a species had an ssi value inferior to 3 it was classified as generalist species with an ssi value superior to 3 it was a specialist species other information were extracted from different sources jacob et al 2010 species selection and classification 2020 the gregariousness was based on the database produced by storchová and hořák 2018 we used the walloon atlas to take into account the specificities of the species ecology in wallonia certain species showed some differences between their preference in a large part of their distribution area and their preference in wallonia for instance the northern lapwing vanellus vanellus is a specialist of grasslands in a large part of its distribution area while in wallonia this species mainly nests in arable lands for each type of ecological trait we tested if there were some significant differences between species groups based on the quality of the model pearson correlation coefficient we used student t test checking the application conditions normality of data and equality of variances the impact of ecological traits on predicted abundance changes was also analyzed to do so the difference between changes in the bird dataset and predicted changes of models was measured for each species anova tests were used to analyze the impacts of traits on the change differences and in the case of non respect of application conditions of these tests kruskal wallis tests were applied the normality of data and the equality of variances were checked with the shapiro wilk test and the levene s test respectively 3 results 3 1 changes in land cover variables table 3 summarizes the changes in coverage for different land cover classes two classes softwood and grasslands show a significant decrease between the two periods 2006 2007 and 2015 these two classes show decreases of more than 35 000 ha over a period of 10 years other classes on the other hand show increases including artificialized soils arable land and clear cuts the largest increase of more than 30 000 ha concerns arable lands 3 2 model quality on average pearson s correlations are slightly higher for the models m1p1 cormean 0 48 0 17 m2p2 cormean 0 47 0 17 and mp cormean 0 49 0 17 than for models m1p2 cormean 0 45 0 17 and m2p1 cormean 0 46 0 18 table 4 table a 3 in supporting information appendix a similar results are obtained with spearman s rank correlation coefficient and slope and intercept of regressions between observed and predicted values the very small differences in global quality observed between the different modeling scenarios suggest that models fitted on a certain period and projected on another period i e m1p2 and m2p1 don t seem to significantly lost prediction ability when transferred to another period 3 3 selection of species forty five species have an r² superior to 20 for both m1p1 and m2p2 models table a 5 in supporting information appendix a several species show very different r² between m1p1 and m2p2 models for certain species r² is under the 20 threshold for one of the models these differences in r² seem to show a positive correlation with changes in bird species populations species with more important changes also show more important differences in correlations between m1p1 and m2p2 models table a 5 in supporting information appendix a this is particularly the case for the european stonechat saxicola torquatus the western jackdaw corvus monedula the stock dove columba oenas the eurasian tree sparrow passer montanus and the corn bunting emberiza calandra a positive relation is observed between the number of presence sites sites with non zero abundance and the quality of the model species with more presence sites generally show higher pearson correlation coefficients 3 4 changes in bird populations table 5 summarizes the abundance changes observed with the different modeling scenarios and the abundance changes observed with the bird dataset we can see that the changes calculated between m1p1 and m2p2 mainly correspond to the observed changes in the bird dataset on the other hand in the case of the m1p2 and m2p1 models observed changes are very rarely predicted by the models both in terms of direction and values of changes the changes calculated between m1p1 and m2p2 show that the predicted abundances of 13 species increase significantly and the predicted abundances of 32 species significantly decrease when looking at the observed changes in the bird dataset the abundances of six species significantly increase the abundances of 24 species decrease and 15 species do not change in abundance between the two sampling periods the changes calculated between m1p1 and m2p2 models are not significantly different from the observed changes in the bird dataset table 6 other comparisons between the changes predicted by the models and the observed changes in the bird dataset show significant differences differences between the change calculated by the m1p1 and m2p2 models and the observed changes in the bird dataset are significantly different from other differences calculated between the predicted changes and the observed changes of other modeling scenarios these changes calculated between m1p1 and m2p2 models are the closest to the observed changes in the bird dataset mean difference 0 017 0 063 sd for several species as the eurasian skylark alauda arvensis or the western yellow wagtail motacilla flava the predicted changes by m1p2 and m2p1 models are strongly opposed to what is actually observed indeed these models predict increases for these species where actually decreases are observed however for other species of softwood forests such as the european crested tit lophophanes cristatus the goldcrest regulus regulus or the coal tit periparus ater these models correctly predict directions of change i e a decrease in population sizes even if they are underestimated 3 5 correlations between predicted and observed changes the changes calculated between the m1p1 and m2p2 models correctly follow the real changes of the dataset cor 0 94 the correlations of global models mp are also higher than transferred models m1p2 and m2p1 namely 0 28 these two modeling procedures thus show a better adequacy between changes predicted by models and changes of the bird dataset the other comparisons of changes namely changes between m1p1 and m1p2 and between m2p1 and m2p2 show very low values of correlation respectively cor 0 02 and cor 0 13 3 6 species traits phenology habitat specialization habitat preference and gregariousness do not show significant differences of pearson correlation coefficients for each modeling scenarios habitat preference has no significant impact on predicted changes by different model scenarios table a 9 in supporting information appendix a habitat specialization has a significant impact on the calculated differences between the changes predicted by mp models and the changes in the bird dataset table a 6 in supporting information appendix a changes for generalist species are closer to actual changes compared to specialist species p value 0 016 comparisons between changes predicted by the models and changes in the bird dataset show only significant differences between migrant and sedentary species for changes calculated between the m1p1 and m2p2 models table a 7 in supporting information appendix a changes for migratory species are closer to real change compared to sedentary species gregariousness has a significant impact on the calculated differences between the changes calculated between m1p1 and m2p2 models and the changes in the bird dataset table a 8 in supporting information appendix a colonial and semi colonial species significantly are different changes for colonial species are closer to real change compared to semi colonial species 4 discussion our study shows that for an important number of species models fitted at a given point in time do not successfully predict bird abundances for another point in time based on changes of land cover whether this concerns a previous or future point changes predicted by models transferred onto another period very rarely correspond to what is actually observed or to what is calculated by independent models fitted on independent periods instead of using presence absence data to predict biodiversity changes we used abundance data which is supposed to better capture the ecological impact of environmental changes wenger and olden 2012 howard et al 2014 regos et al 2018 2019 moreover generalized additive models gam seem adequate for the extrapolation of fitted models in time or space wenger and olden 2012 duque lazo et al 2016 model transferability is based on the important hypothesis that current species habitat relationships are likely to be rather stable because they are the result of evolutionary adaptations to historical variation in habitat conditions drapeau et al 2016 changes in these species habitat relationships cannot explain the low observed temporal transferability of models for the majority of the species studied indeed while the ecological niche may have changed slightly for some species here we study a large number of bird species another explanation could be that species do not respond quickly to changes in land cover the observed changes in bird populations could be the result of changes prior to the study period by analyzing the pattern of prediction errors in relation to the ecological traits of the species studied we can conclude that the environmental predictors used i e land cover variables are not adequately capturing major environmental changes petitpierre et al 2017 indeed for arable land species such as the eurasian skylark western yellow wagtail and corn bunting models fitted on a period and projected onto another period of time predict an increase in abundances while these species actually show decreasing trends which are sometimes very important this error of predicted changes probably comes from the increase in arable lands between the two periods studied as arable lands increase but specialized species decrease one explanation could be that the cause is a decrease in habitat quality which is not taken into account in the land cover predictors used several studies have shown that the intensification of agricultural practices has a negative impact on skylark populations for example eurasian skylarks prefer spring cereals and these studies have shown that intensive use of pesticides strongly decreases the available quantity of those invertebrates necessary for the foraging of farmland birds chamberlain and siriwardena 2000 boatman et al 2004 holland et al 2012 in contrast with the species on arable land in the case of species in softwood forests such as coal tit european crested tit and goldcrest models predicting a future situation allow us to obtain changes that are similar to the observed changes even if the predicted amplitude of change is weaker that what is actually observed for this species group environmental predictors are partly correct but other variables describing habitat quality are missing and these latter are necessary to completely understand changes in these species over time for instance meteorological conditions rejuvenation and the withering of softwood in wallonia could all explain the unexplained part of changes by models ecological traits did not appear to have a significant impact on the predictive power of the models based on pearson correlation coefficients this result based on abundance models of species goes against what has been observed in several studies using presence absence models wogan 2016 regos et al 2019 regos et al 2019 showed that species traits significantly affected both model performance and model transferability the model discrimination capacity was analyzed using mean area under the curve auc that is relatively different from this study in particular they showed that the model performance was higher for habitat specialist species than generalist species however in our study ecological traits significantly impact some abundance changes of bird species migration status impacts changes calculated between models fitted independently on each period m1p1 and m2p2 in comparison with changes for sedentary species changes for migratory species are on average closer to the observed changes in the bird dataset our result corresponds to what has been observed by others studies which also obtained better accuracy of predictions for migratory bird species regos et al 2019 this could be explained by a quicker adaptation of migratory species to land cover changes as they are more mobile for migratory species changes are in general slightly overestimated while the opposite holds true for sedentary species on the other hand migration status does not impact either transferred models in time m1p2 and m2p1 or the global model mp concerning gregariousness we observe a significant difference between colonial and semi colonial species for m1p1 and m2p2 models this probably is due to the larger gap between predicted changes and observed changes for semi colonial species habitat preferences do not significantly impact species abundance changes the low impact of ecological traits likely stems from the important variation in predicted changes in each species group indeed the standard deviation of differences between predicted and actual changes are often important in species groups for phenology and habitat specialization this is especially observed for the transferred models m1p2 and m2p1 and the global model mp this phenomenon is also observed for the habitat preference groups however certain groups such as farmland and softwood bird species show very low average standard deviations our results show that models fitted independently on different periods m1p1 and m2p2 can be used to study changes in bird populations these models correctly capture abundance variations in each period thus there is probably some overfitting with explicative predictors in each period and this could explain the low transferability of models in time the low temporal transferability could be explained by the imperfect match between bird and environmental data indeed bird data were obtained in 2001 2007 and in 2015 2018 while environmental data are from 2006 to 2007 and 2015 however changes in 1km² squares are likely to be relatively low during each sampling period moreover for instance more than 70 of squares were sampled during the first 3 years of the sampling in the second period i e less than two years after the environmental data were measured another explanation for the low transferability of the models could be the relatively small sample size for the spatial resolution indeed some regions could be under sampled and therefore cause gaps in the environmental conditions used to fit the models studies are generally based on the quality of the model to measure model transferability wogan 2016 regos et al 2018 2019 our study shows that in the case of models based on bird species abundance data using indexes of model quality does not allow us to analyze the prediction accuracy of projected models indeed indexes used to check the quality of models such as pearson s correlation coefficient spearman s rank correlation coefficient or the slope of major axis regression between observed and predicted values do not indicate significant differences between modeling procedures potts and elith 2006 piñeiro et al 2008 however change calculations based on the predicted abundance sum show that transferred models do not give satisfying results using these indexes to measure the quality of abundance models projected onto another period does not allow us to identify the poor results of these models santini et al 2021 observed a similar result for studies using auc and tss these indexes tend to overestimate the model performance by transforming our dataset into presence absence we observe that the average auc of the transferred models m1p2 and m2p1 is very close to the other models m1p1 and m2p2 aucm1p1 0 79 aucm2p2 0 79 aucm1p2 0 79 aucm2p1 0 78 all parameters are identical than abundance models except family distribution which was binomial auc was calculated with roc function of proc package comparing correlation differences between models fitted independently on each data period with predicted abundance changes of bird populations shows a positive relationship i e that if a species decreases significantly between the two periods a relatively large decrease of the correlation is observed and vice versa this result confirms that models are impacted by the quality of the data used to fit models decreases in model quality come with a lower number of presence sites with non zero abundance for one of the periods compared to the other while many studies use future scenarios of land cover changes to predict species population changes we show that temporal transfer of models should be used with caution indeed our results show that these models do not allow us to identify changes in bird populations based on land cover changes we developed a different method to analyze the temporal transferability with the use of predicted changes of bird population by models in general studies analyzed the model evaluation metrics e g auc we compared the predicted changes with the observed changes in two bird datasets it would be necessary to develop other environmental predictors these should also reflect the quality of the habitats however they will need to be fine resolution to reflect the needs of the species for example in the case of farmland species it would be interesting to divide the land cover class of arable lands into different crop types e g spring cereals winter cereals weeded crops and so on the low transferability could also come from bird species population displacement indeed if the species abundance does not change a species population displacement cannot be shown by this modeling procedure using the abundance sum moreover in this case with abundance models using the usual indexes of model quality to evaluate transferability is not efficient these indexes as pearson s correlation or spearman s rank correlation do not reflect what we actually observe in abundance changes calculated with different modeling scenarios they tend to overestimate the performance of transferred models it could also be interesting to test other modeling methods that work on the scale of communities of bird species to take into account the biotic interactions indeed sdm are improved by inclusion of biotic interactions fern et al 2019 then some ecological traits as phenology may impact the prediction accuracy of the projected models to our knowledge very few studies have analyzed the temporal transferability of species abundance models yet these abundance data contain more information than presence absence or presence only data moreover for abundant and widespread species they should allow us to better capture the impacts of environmental changes on biodiversity our study shows that this holds true for some species groups but less so for many others it could also be interesting to test other modeling methods that work on the scale of

24342,aim species distribution models have become important tools for studying changes in biodiversity most studies use these models to evaluate the impact of global changes on biodiversity for that purpose scenarios are used that are based on changes in land use and or land cover or on climatic changes however the temporal transferability of such models depends heavily on modeling methods environmental predictors and the ecological traits of species here we evaluate the power of modeling tools to predict changes in bird species abundances based on observed changes in land cover location wallonia belgium methods to assess this temporal transferability this research makes use of two biological and two environmental datasets both sampled with a 10 year interval this allows us to compare the predictions of models for another period than the period used to fit the models with actual values for species abundance we also analyzed the impact of ecological traits on the temporal transferability generalized additive models were fitted for 75 breeding birds while a lot of studies use occurrence data we used abundance data for fitting models abundance data contains more information and should allow us to better capture abundance changes in bird populations results for the majority of species studied the results show a low temporal transferability with a few exceptions e g species with softwood habitats predicted changes do not correspond to observed changes for certain bird species e g those on arable lands we observed an increase in predicted abundances in the future while these species actually decreased few ecological traits seem to significantly impact the models transferability main conclusions our findings show that it is difficult to predict abundance changes of bird species based only on land cover changes it is necessary to add other predictors into the models e g predictors of habitat quality or spatial configuration keywords abundance birds ecological traits gam species abundance modeling temporal transferability data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction species distribution models sdm are a useful and powerful tool to study biodiversity patterns sdm can help us understand how species occurrence or abundance data relate to environmental characteristics elith and leathwick 2009 modeling tools are now widely used in many ecological fields and domains conservation biology muñoz et al 2015 population trends invasive species dynamics bradley 2016 and for predicting species distribution oppel et al 2012 milanesi et al 2017 johnston et al 2020 according to several studies models that are based on species habitat relationships and built on a given period could be used to predict the responses of species populations to changes over time in their habitats guisan and zimmermann 2000 strauss and biedermann 2007 regos et al 2018 the hypothesis is that current species habitat relationships are likely to be quite stable because they are the result of evolutionary adaptation to historical variations in habitat conditions drapeau et al 2016 for a long time many studies predicting the impacts of global change on biodiversity have used the temporal transferability of models i e the capacity of models to predict species distributions at another period than the period used to fit the models this transferability was tested on several taxonomic groups mainly based on models of species occurrence whether in presence absence or presence only e g peterson et al 2002 thomas et al 2004 matern et al 2007 dobrowski et al 2011 morán ordóñez et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 santini et al 2021 however abundance data contains more information than presence absence or presence only data abundance data should therefore allow us to better capture changes in biodiversity based on changes in environmental conditions howard et al 2014 yates et al 2018 results of such studies can inform us about drivers of biodiversity change identifying and understanding these drivers can inform conservation measures to preserve biodiversity from a methodological point of view several studies have shown that the transferability of models depends on modeling methods explicative variables and species traits beaumont et al 2016 duque lazo et al 2016 petitpierre et al 2017 yates et al 2018 regos et al 2019 in several studies models are also used to predict changes in species populations over time based on scenarios of change in land use or land cover fonderflick et al 2010 marshall et al 2018 newbold 2018 powers and jetz 2019 barras et al 2021 many other studies neglect changes in land use or land cover and instead focus on climate change because they argue climate change has become the main threat to biodiversity titeux et al 2016 nevertheless it has been demonstrated that land use and land cover changes are in fact the main threat to biodiversity and will continue to induce biodiversity decline through habitat destruction and degradation newbold et al 2015 newbold 2018 ipbes 2019 over the previous decades biodiversity has gone through serious changes butchart et al 2010 biodiversity loss strongly threatens the provision of ecosystem functions and services mace et al 2012 bennett et al 2015 ceballos et al 2015 suggest that human activities have induced a sixth mass extinction event all taxonomic groups whether birds mammals reptiles amphibians or insects are affected ceballos et al 2015 hallmann et al 2017 sánchez bayo and wyckhuys 2019 according to inger et al 2015 birds have greatly decreased in europe and the study estimated a loss of 421 million birds between 1980 and 2009 or an estimated decrease in abundance of 20 this decline is mainly due to a decline in the most common species which have lost large numbers of individuals significantly impacting the provision of ecosystem functions and services similar results were observed in north america with an estimated abundance loss of 29 since 1970 rosenberg et al 2019 the most serious declines are mainly observed in farmland bird species the main cause of decline being the intensification of agricultural practices such as hedgerow loss land drainage increased use of pesticide and fertilizer and the simplification of crop rotations donald et al 2001 robinson and sutherland 2002 mineau and whiteside 2013 other threats identified include urbanization climate change and the introduction or arrival of invasive species gregory et al 2009 maxwell et al 2016 it is therefore essential to develop relevant tools models and environmental data based on future scenarios of changes in land use and land cover in order to understand changes in species populations the aim of this paper is to evaluate the power of modeling tools to predict changes in bird species abundances based on observed changes in land cover these land cover changes are used in many studies to predict species changes based on future scenarios we therefore make use of two datasets of breeding bird samplings repeated after 10 years and of two detailed spatial descriptions of land cover for the same 10 year interval which were obtained through aerial photo interpretation these repeated schemes allow us to test if model fitting for a given period can accurately predict bird population changes for another period in this way we will compare the predicted values given by models with the actual abundance values of the bird datasets as we have two bird datasets repeated after 10 years we can analyze from forecasting and hindcasting perspectives to our knowledge very few studies use abundance data to test the temporal transferability of models many studies are instead based only on presence absence or presence only data santini et al 2021 as discussed above abundance data contain more information and should therefore better capture the impacts of environmental changes on biodiversity howard et al 2014 yates et al 2018 in addition we will verify if the quality and transferability of models is affected by species ecological traits 2 methods 2 1 study area the study focused on the region of wallonia 17 000 km² in southern belgium fig 1 a fig 1c presents the gradient of land cover variables in wallonia the north of wallonia a silt region consists mainly of large arable areas and large urban centers while the south of wallonia is mainly grassland and large forested areas hardwood softwood or mixed forests 2 2 bird dataset bird data came from samplings collected in square areas of 1 km² over two sampling periods the first in 2001 2007 and the second in 2015 2018 in each period each square was sampled twice during one hour all birds were recorded except for non breeding migratory birds a first passage was done between 25 march and 30 april and a second passage between 15 may and 30 june a passage consisted to visit the square by an observer during one hour the observer noted all individuals seen or heard it was important to note the behavior of birds to distinguish simple presences and signs of nesting the observer had to cover the square as completely as possible during the passage in the first period 2553 squares were sampled and in the second period 1007 squares were sampled however only 911 squares in each sampling period were conserved for further analysis fig 1b these squares were identical across the two sampling periods they were sampled correctly in both periods i e two passages were done between the fixed dates using the sampling methodology jacob et al 2010 for a given period if a species was not observed after the two passages it was considered absent in that square lastly the 75 most observed species out of a total of 155 were retained for analysis in the main the other 80 species were not taken into account in our analysis because they were not sufficiently present in the dataset this decision was made for statistical reasons for example to avoid a risk of overfitting the models indeed we observed that below a threshold of 50 presence sites sites with non zero abundance the modeling of most species was not consistent or correct several of the most observed species were discounted since they were exotic species e g canada goose branta canadensis egyptian goose alopochen aegyptiacus or species for which the abundance variation could be largely explained by climatic variables on the period between the two samplings since the main aim of this study was to analyze the impact of land cover changes we also decided to remove those species that were mostly impacted by climatic conditions e g crossbill loxia curvirostra meadow pipit anthus pratensis at a european scale distribution areas were checked for each species based on maps in the ebcc atlas of european breeding birds hagemeijer and blair 1997 and on maps available at the birdlife international website birdlife data zone 2020 having two abundance values in each period made it possible to refine the abundance estimate that served as reference in the species abundance models different criteria were applied to avoid an overestimation of population sizes these criteria depended on the life history traits of the species for the majority of the species it was the maximum abundance between the two passages which was taken into account for some species it was the first or the second passage which was taken into account e g to avoid late wintering species or the potential presence of juveniles during the second passage table a 1 in supporting information appendix a to limit the role of extreme values a logarithmic transformation was applied to the bird abundances the abundances were increased by 1 to keep zeroes 2 3 environmental dataset environmental data at high resolution were derived from the ecotope database radoux et al 2019 the advantages of this database are numerous it compiles a lot of environmental data from several different sources all variables are available for the whole of wallonia and some environmental variables are available for two periods which correspond to our sampling periods this database contains 104 variables these variables are of different types including climatic topographic soil attributes land cover height of vegetation and distance from linear features land cover variables are obtained from a pixel classification at a 2 m resolution of orthophotoplans lidar and sentinel 2 time series environmental data are available for two walloon orthophotoplan dates 2006 2007 and 2015 all variables were resampled at the same resolution as the bird data i e a resolution of 1 km² 33 variables of the ecotope database were retained for the analysis because they were the most relevant to the objectives of this study table 1 these variables described the local environment with descriptive indicators of soil humidity levels topography and land cover soil predictors were used because in wallonia these variables are important to inform about the ecological context however the 17 soil predictors were summarized in a principal component analysis pca we used five pca axes that explain about 60 of variance as environmental predictors in models the use of longitude latitude and altitude as variables allowed us to account for geographic and topographic heterogeneity improving the predictive precision of the models estrada et al 2016 only land cover variables varied between the two periods we decided to use land cover variables similar to those used in many of these studies there were nine land cover variables artificialized soils hardwood softwood arable lands grassland open wetlands bare soils water and clear cuts the proportion of each land cover variables in each square was used for modeling we used a pearson correlation threshold of 0 8 to determine the collinearity between the predictors this environmental dataset showed no correlation above this threshold the distribution of each variable was analyzed if the distribution was not normal a logarithmic or square root transformation was applied the logarithmic transformation was applied for the most staggered distributions in order to make normal the distribution of the variables if the variable distribution was normal no transformation was applied this made it possible to limit the role of extreme values 2 4 modeling all statistical analyses were realized with r v 3 5 1 models were constructed using mgcv package 2 4 1 model construction the statistical models used were generalized additive models gam this modeling method was selected following tests comparing the results of gam and random forest rf models these tests consisted of the prediction of the global abundance of each species in wallonia for both of the sampling periods the results were then compared to species abundances in the walloon breeding bird atlas jacob et al 2010 a dataset that was completely independent of our dataset and our analyses for a species subgroup arbitrarily chosen the results showed that for about two thirds of the species the abundances predicted with gam models were usually closer to the population sizes in the walloon atlas than the predicted abundances of rf models moreover during these preliminary tests the gam models took less computation time different models were fitted to estimate bird populations fig 2 and table 2 the aim was to determine if a particular modeling scenarios was more suitable to identify changes in bird populations this was tested by transferring fitted models onto another sampling period and by comparing predicted values with actual data the complete modeling procedure is described in fig 2 and in table 2 the first model was fitted on bird data from the first period 2001 2007 and on environmental data from the period 2006 2007 model m1p1 and was used to predict bird abundances for the period 2001 2007 fig 2 and table 2 the second model was fitted on bird data from the second period 2015 2018 and on environmental data from 2015 model m2p2 and was used to predict bird abundances for the period 2015 2018 the third model used the first model i e it was fitted on the bird data of the first period 2001 2007 and on the 2006 2007 environmental data and this time was used to predict bird abundances for the second period 2015 2018 using 2015 environmental data m1p2 the fourth model used the second model i e it was fitted on bird data from the second period 2015 2018 and on 2015 environmental data and this time was used to predict bird abundances for the first period using the 2006 2007 environmental data m2p1 the fifth model was fitted by compiling bird and environmental data from the two periods model mp for this last model all data were used to fit models i e that each sampled square was present twice in the dataset the squares appeared once with bird data from the first period 2001 2007 and environmental data from the period 2006 2007 and a second time with bird data from the second period 2015 2018 and environmental data from 2015 after fitting the model a prediction was produced for each of the two periods based on environmental data from each specific period as this fifth model took into account data from two periods we expected it to better account for variation in species habitat relationships and thus to better predict species abundances over time for each species and each modeling scenarios the modeling procedure was repeated 10 times and the final average model is used 75 species x 3 models x 10 repetitions 2250 single species models for each repetition the dataset was spatially separated into training and testing datasets using the r package blockcv valavi et al 2019 the study area was divided into spatial blocks the size of blocks was defined using the function available in the package spatialautorange function with 5000 sample points per raster this size was 17 km the blocks were randomly allocated to five folds the first four folds were used to fit the model and the last fold to test the quality of the model a procedure was applied to reduce the number of environmental predictors select option of gam function available in mgcv package this procedure selection could impose a penalty to each term and could remove terms from the model models produced mean abundance predictions per sampling square 75 species x 5 model predictions x 10 repetitions 3750 predictions for each square the exponential transformation was applied to the abundances produced by models the decimals of predicted values were kept the negative values predicted by models were transformed into zeroes these predictions were summed to obtain an abundance sum for the whole of wallonia 2 4 2 model quality the quality of different models was based on pearson correlation and spearman s rank correlation coefficients calculated between the testing dataset and the predictions obtained for these squares for the m1p2 models model quality was measured between the predicted abundance and the test dataset containing bird data from the second period 2015 2018 while for the m2p1 models model quality was measured between the predicted abundance and the test dataset containing bird data from the first period 2001 2007 fig 2 the correlation used was the mean of the correlations obtained by 10 repetitions of the models the slope and intercept of the major axis regression between observed and predicted values was used to evaluate the bias and consistency of predictions made by different modeling methods potts and elith 2006 piñeiro et al 2008 the deviances explained by models have not been discussed in this paper but they are presented in the supporting information table a 4 in supporting information appendix a 2 5 species selection pearson correlation coefficients of the m1p1 and m2p2 models were used to calculate the r² of each species means of the five highest pearson correlation coefficients for each species and each modeling scenario were used this selection allowed us to conserve only the five best models of each species among the 10 repetitions these means were then squared to obtain the r² if both r² of m1p1 and m2p2 models are superior to 20 thus the species was used in result analyses this criterion allowed us to exclusively conserve the best fitted models of species to environmental predictors 2 6 analyses of bird abundance changes the changes in bird population abundances were calculated between the different modeling scenarios using eq 1 four change rates were obtained in function of model combinations m1p1 m2p2 m1p1 m1p2 m2p1 m2p2 and mp this way of expressing the change meant that the rate of increase or decrease in a population was symmetrical and comprised between 2 extinction and 2 apparition all predicted changes were compared with observed changes based on the bird dataset paired student t test or wilcoxon t test were used to analyze if the predicted changes were significantly different from the actual changes the equation defining the change was 1 c h a n g e a 2015 a 2007 a 2007 a 2015 2 where a 2007 is the abundance of the first period and a 2015 is the abundance of the second period the observed changes in bird abundances between the two sampling periods were calculated using the bootstrap method this nonparametric method allowed us to measure the accuracy of observed changes the principle was to select several sampled squares randomly with replacement this meant that a sampled square could be selected several times while another square might not be selected at all the change was calculated on the selection of squares this step was repeated 10 000 times the mean of all abundance changes and the 90 confidence intervals were then measured keller et al 2020 the 90 confidence intervals were used to determine if abundance changes were significant i e if both minimum and maximum values were positive the species abundance increased significantly and if these values were negative the species abundance has decreased significantly if minimum and maximum values were of different signs the change in species abundance was not statistically significant the predicted changes with models were based on the mean of abundance sum of 10 repetitions from each species and each modeling type on the whole of wallonia for each abundance mean the variance was calculated using eq 2 as well as the 90 confidence intervals then we calculated the changes using the abundance mean values and their confidence intervals as for the observed changes in the bird dataset a change was significant if minimum and maximum values had the same sign the correlation between the predicted change based on the modeling and the change observed in the actual bird dataset was calculated for each modeling scenario to check the efficiency of each model to predict change the mean values of change were used for correlations ρ σ 2 2 v a r i a n c e i 0 n ρ σ i 2 1 ρ σ i 2 m where ρ is the mean correlation between all pairs of 10 repetitions of models σ2 is the variance of 10 predictions of abundance in each square n is the number of squares on the whole of wallonia and m is the number of repetitions i e m 10 2 7 traits of species bird species were grouped in different guilds based on their ecological traits related to phenology migrant or sedentary habitat specialization generalist or specialist habitat preference arable land grassland open habitat softwood hardwood forest water urban and gregariousness colonial semi colonial and solitary table a 2 in supporting information appendix a the habitat specialization was based on the species specialization index ssi le viol et al 2012 a threshold was set at an ssi value of 3 this choice resulted from an analysis of the ssi value of each studied species the threshold was fixed to best adapt to the particularities of the ecology of walloon species if a species had an ssi value inferior to 3 it was classified as generalist species with an ssi value superior to 3 it was a specialist species other information were extracted from different sources jacob et al 2010 species selection and classification 2020 the gregariousness was based on the database produced by storchová and hořák 2018 we used the walloon atlas to take into account the specificities of the species ecology in wallonia certain species showed some differences between their preference in a large part of their distribution area and their preference in wallonia for instance the northern lapwing vanellus vanellus is a specialist of grasslands in a large part of its distribution area while in wallonia this species mainly nests in arable lands for each type of ecological trait we tested if there were some significant differences between species groups based on the quality of the model pearson correlation coefficient we used student t test checking the application conditions normality of data and equality of variances the impact of ecological traits on predicted abundance changes was also analyzed to do so the difference between changes in the bird dataset and predicted changes of models was measured for each species anova tests were used to analyze the impacts of traits on the change differences and in the case of non respect of application conditions of these tests kruskal wallis tests were applied the normality of data and the equality of variances were checked with the shapiro wilk test and the levene s test respectively 3 results 3 1 changes in land cover variables table 3 summarizes the changes in coverage for different land cover classes two classes softwood and grasslands show a significant decrease between the two periods 2006 2007 and 2015 these two classes show decreases of more than 35 000 ha over a period of 10 years other classes on the other hand show increases including artificialized soils arable land and clear cuts the largest increase of more than 30 000 ha concerns arable lands 3 2 model quality on average pearson s correlations are slightly higher for the models m1p1 cormean 0 48 0 17 m2p2 cormean 0 47 0 17 and mp cormean 0 49 0 17 than for models m1p2 cormean 0 45 0 17 and m2p1 cormean 0 46 0 18 table 4 table a 3 in supporting information appendix a similar results are obtained with spearman s rank correlation coefficient and slope and intercept of regressions between observed and predicted values the very small differences in global quality observed between the different modeling scenarios suggest that models fitted on a certain period and projected on another period i e m1p2 and m2p1 don t seem to significantly lost prediction ability when transferred to another period 3 3 selection of species forty five species have an r² superior to 20 for both m1p1 and m2p2 models table a 5 in supporting information appendix a several species show very different r² between m1p1 and m2p2 models for certain species r² is under the 20 threshold for one of the models these differences in r² seem to show a positive correlation with changes in bird species populations species with more important changes also show more important differences in correlations between m1p1 and m2p2 models table a 5 in supporting information appendix a this is particularly the case for the european stonechat saxicola torquatus the western jackdaw corvus monedula the stock dove columba oenas the eurasian tree sparrow passer montanus and the corn bunting emberiza calandra a positive relation is observed between the number of presence sites sites with non zero abundance and the quality of the model species with more presence sites generally show higher pearson correlation coefficients 3 4 changes in bird populations table 5 summarizes the abundance changes observed with the different modeling scenarios and the abundance changes observed with the bird dataset we can see that the changes calculated between m1p1 and m2p2 mainly correspond to the observed changes in the bird dataset on the other hand in the case of the m1p2 and m2p1 models observed changes are very rarely predicted by the models both in terms of direction and values of changes the changes calculated between m1p1 and m2p2 show that the predicted abundances of 13 species increase significantly and the predicted abundances of 32 species significantly decrease when looking at the observed changes in the bird dataset the abundances of six species significantly increase the abundances of 24 species decrease and 15 species do not change in abundance between the two sampling periods the changes calculated between m1p1 and m2p2 models are not significantly different from the observed changes in the bird dataset table 6 other comparisons between the changes predicted by the models and the observed changes in the bird dataset show significant differences differences between the change calculated by the m1p1 and m2p2 models and the observed changes in the bird dataset are significantly different from other differences calculated between the predicted changes and the observed changes of other modeling scenarios these changes calculated between m1p1 and m2p2 models are the closest to the observed changes in the bird dataset mean difference 0 017 0 063 sd for several species as the eurasian skylark alauda arvensis or the western yellow wagtail motacilla flava the predicted changes by m1p2 and m2p1 models are strongly opposed to what is actually observed indeed these models predict increases for these species where actually decreases are observed however for other species of softwood forests such as the european crested tit lophophanes cristatus the goldcrest regulus regulus or the coal tit periparus ater these models correctly predict directions of change i e a decrease in population sizes even if they are underestimated 3 5 correlations between predicted and observed changes the changes calculated between the m1p1 and m2p2 models correctly follow the real changes of the dataset cor 0 94 the correlations of global models mp are also higher than transferred models m1p2 and m2p1 namely 0 28 these two modeling procedures thus show a better adequacy between changes predicted by models and changes of the bird dataset the other comparisons of changes namely changes between m1p1 and m1p2 and between m2p1 and m2p2 show very low values of correlation respectively cor 0 02 and cor 0 13 3 6 species traits phenology habitat specialization habitat preference and gregariousness do not show significant differences of

compared to semi colonial species 4 discussion our study shows that for an important number of species models fitted at a given point in time do not successfully predict bird abundances for another point in time based on changes of land cover whether this concerns a previous or future point changes predicted by models transferred onto another period very rarely correspond to what is actually observed or to what is calculated by independent models fitted on independent periods instead of using presence absence data to predict biodiversity changes we used abundance data which is supposed to better capture the ecological impact of environmental changes wenger and olden 2012 howard et al 2014 regos et al 2018 2019 moreover generalized additive models gam seem adequate for the extrapolation of fitted models in time or space wenger and olden 2012 duque lazo et al 2016 model transferability is based on the important hypothesis that current species habitat relationships are likely to be rather stable because they are the result of evolutionary adaptations to historical variation in habitat conditions drapeau et al 2016 changes in these species habitat relationships cannot explain the low observed temporal transferability of models for the majority of the species studied indeed while the ecological niche may have changed slightly for some species here we study a large number of bird species another explanation could be that species do not respond quickly to changes in land cover the observed changes in bird populations could be the result of changes prior to the study period by analyzing the pattern of prediction errors in relation to the ecological traits of the species studied we can conclude that the environmental predictors used i e land cover variables are not adequately capturing major environmental changes petitpierre et al 2017 indeed for arable land species such as the eurasian skylark western yellow wagtail and corn bunting models fitted on a period and projected onto another period of time predict an increase in abundances while these species actually show decreasing trends which are sometimes very important this error of predicted changes probably comes from the increase in arable lands between the two periods studied as arable lands increase but specialized species decrease one explanation could be that the cause is a decrease in habitat quality which is not taken into account in the land cover predictors used several studies have shown that the intensification of agricultural practices has a negative impact on skylark populations for example eurasian skylarks prefer spring cereals and these studies have shown that intensive use of pesticides strongly decreases the available quantity of those invertebrates necessary for the foraging of farmland birds chamberlain and siriwardena 2000 boatman et al 2004 holland et al 2012 in contrast with the species on arable land in the case of species in softwood forests such as coal tit european crested tit and goldcrest models predicting a future situation allow us to obtain changes that are similar to the observed changes even if the predicted amplitude of change is weaker that what is actually observed for this species group environmental predictors are partly correct but other variables describing habitat quality are missing and these latter are necessary to completely understand changes in these species over time for instance meteorological conditions rejuvenation and the withering of softwood in wallonia could all explain the unexplained part of changes by models ecological traits did not appear to have a significant impact on the predictive power of the models based on pearson correlation coefficients this result based on abundance models of species goes against what has been observed in several studies using presence absence models wogan 2016 regos et al 2019 regos et al 2019 showed that species traits significantly affected both model performance and model transferability the model discrimination capacity was analyzed using mean area under the curve auc that is relatively different from this study in particular they showed that the model performance was higher for habitat specialist species than generalist species however in our study ecological traits significantly impact some abundance changes of bird species migration status impacts changes calculated between models fitted independently on each period m1p1 and m2p2 in comparison with changes for sedentary species changes for migratory species are on average closer to the observed changes in the bird dataset our result corresponds to what has been observed by others studies which also obtained better accuracy of predictions for migratory bird species regos et al 2019 this could be explained by a quicker adaptation of migratory species to land cover changes as they are more mobile for migratory species changes are in general slightly overestimated while the opposite holds true for sedentary species on the other hand migration status does not impact either transferred models in time m1p2 and m2p1 or the global model mp concerning gregariousness we observe a significant difference between colonial and semi colonial species for m1p1 and m2p2 models this probably is due to the larger gap between predicted changes and observed changes for semi colonial species habitat preferences do not significantly impact species abundance changes the low impact of ecological traits likely stems from the important variation in predicted changes in each species group indeed the standard deviation of differences between predicted and actual changes are often important in species groups for phenology and habitat specialization this is especially observed for the transferred models m1p2 and m2p1 and the global model mp this phenomenon is also observed for the habitat preference groups however certain groups such as farmland and softwood bird species show very low average standard deviations our results show that models fitted independently on different periods m1p1 and m2p2 can be used to study changes in bird populations these models correctly capture abundance variations in each period thus there is probably some overfitting with explicative predictors in each period and this could explain the low transferability of models in time the low temporal transferability could be explained by the imperfect match between bird and environmental data indeed bird data were obtained in 2001 2007 and in 2015 2018 while environmental data are from 2006 to 2007 and 2015 however changes in 1km² squares are likely to be relatively low during each sampling period moreover for instance more than 70 of squares were sampled during the first 3 years of the sampling in the second period i e less than two years after the environmental data were measured another explanation for the low transferability of the models could be the relatively small sample size for the spatial resolution indeed some regions could be under sampled and therefore cause gaps in the environmental conditions used to fit the models studies are generally based on the quality of the model to measure model transferability wogan 2016 regos et al 2018 2019 our study shows that in the case of models based on bird species abundance data using indexes of model quality does not allow us to analyze the prediction accuracy of projected models indeed indexes used to check the quality of models such as pearson s correlation coefficient spearman s rank correlation coefficient or the slope of major axis regression between observed and predicted values do not indicate significant differences between modeling procedures potts and elith 2006 piñeiro et al 2008 however change calculations based on the predicted abundance sum show that transferred models do not give satisfying results using these indexes to measure the quality of abundance models projected onto another period does not allow us to identify the poor results of these models santini et al 2021 observed a similar result for studies using auc and tss these indexes tend to overestimate the model performance by transforming our dataset into presence absence we observe that the average auc of the transferred models m1p2 and m2p1 is very close to the other models m1p1 and m2p2 aucm1p1 0 79 aucm2p2 0 79 aucm1p2 0 79 aucm2p1 0 78 all parameters are identical than abundance models except family distribution which was binomial auc was calculated with roc function of proc package comparing correlation differences between models fitted independently on each data period with predicted abundance changes of bird populations shows a positive relationship i e that if a species decreases significantly between the two periods a relatively large decrease of the correlation is observed and vice versa this result confirms that models are impacted by the quality of the data used to fit models decreases in model quality come with a lower number of presence sites with non zero abundance for one of the periods compared to the other while many studies use future scenarios of land cover changes to predict species population changes we show that temporal transfer of models should be used with caution indeed our results show that these models do not allow us to identify changes in bird populations based on land cover changes we developed a different method to analyze the temporal transferability with the use of predicted changes of bird population by models in general studies analyzed the model evaluation metrics e g auc we compared the predicted changes with the observed changes in two bird datasets it would be necessary to develop other environmental predictors these should also reflect the quality of the habitats however they will need to be fine resolution to reflect the needs of the species for example in the case of farmland species it would be interesting to divide the land cover class of arable lands into different crop types e g spring cereals winter cereals weeded crops and so on the low transferability could also come from bird species population displacement indeed if the species abundance does not change a species population displacement cannot be shown by this modeling procedure using the abundance sum moreover in this case with abundance models using the usual indexes of model quality to evaluate transferability is not efficient these indexes as pearson s correlation or spearman s rank correlation do not reflect what we actually observe in abundance changes calculated with different modeling scenarios they tend to overestimate the performance of transferred models it could also be interesting to test other modeling methods that work on the scale of communities of bird species to take into account the biotic interactions indeed sdm are improved by inclusion of biotic interactions fern et al 2019 then some ecological traits as phenology may impact the prediction accuracy of the projected models to our knowledge very few studies have analyzed the temporal transferability of species abundance models yet these abundance data contain more information than presence absence or presence only data moreover for abundant and widespread species they should allow us to better capture the impacts of environmental changes on biodiversity our study shows that this holds true for some species groups but less so for many others it could also be interesting to test other modeling methods that work on the scale of

24343,disentangling the relative importance of different biodiversity drivers i e climate edaphic historical factors or human impact to predict plant species richness at the local scale is one of the most important challenges in ecology biodiversity modelling is a key tool for the integration of these drivers and the predictions generated are essential for example for climate change forecast and conservation planning however the reliability of biodiversity models at the local scale remains poorly understood especially in tropical species rich areas where they are required we inventoried all woody plants with stems 2 5 cm in 397 plots across the andes amazon gradient we generated and mapped 19 uncorrelated biodiversity drivers at 90 m resolution grouped into four categories microclimatic microtopographic anthropic and edaphic in order to evaluate the importance of the different categories we grouped biodiversity drivers into four different clusters by categories for each of the four clusters of biodiversity drivers we modelled the observed species richness using two statistical techniques random forest and bayesian inference and two modelling procedures including or excluding a spatial component all the biodiversity models produced were evaluated by cross validation species richness was accurately predicted by random forest spearman correlation up to 0 85 and explained variance up to 67 the results suggest that precipitation and temperature are important driving forces of species richness in the region nonetheless a spatial component should be considered to properly predict biodiversity this could reflect macroevolutionary underlying forces not considered here such as colonization time dispersal capacities or speciation rates however the proposed biodiversity modelling approach can predict accurately species richness at the local scale and detailed resolution 90 m in tropical areas something that previous works had found extremely challenging the innovative methodology presented here could be employed in other areas with conservation needs keywords altitudinal gradient bayesian inference biodiversity patterns madidi region plant species richness random forest data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biological communities are threatened by intensifying human impact on ecosystems sheldon et al 2011 a crucial challenge for the immediate future will be to conserve biodiversity under the current climate change scenario fadrique et al 2018 to shed light on this global issue biodiversity modelling is broadly employed in numerous fields d amen et al 2017 biodiversity models can be used to support conservation planning guisan et al 2013 or assessments of climate change effects on biodiversity randin et al 2009 urban et al 2016 although biodiversity modelling has undergone substantial developments our ability to predict biodiversity at local scales remains limited urban et al 2016 yates et al 2018 this is particularly true in tropical areas due to high species diversity complexity jetz et al 2012 and problems with data quality and availability cayuela et al 2009 loiselle et al 2008 the tropical andes is one of the most species rich areas on the planet as well as one of the most relevant regions for the conservation of biodiversity brooks et al 2006 myers et al 2000 significant climate change effects have been already noticed in the tropical andes reshaping the spatial distribution of tree species among other things fadrique et al 2018 in this context accurate predictions of local biodiversity would allow to build more realistic conservation plans mateo et al 2019b models to predict biodiversity patterns vary d amen et al 2017 guisan et al 2017 from purely correlative e g gotelli et al 2009 guisan and rahbek 2011 to mechanistic e g mokany and ferrier 2011 the different approaches try to predict various aspects of taxonomic diversity such as species composition e g mateo et al 2012 species richness e g di febbraro et al 2018 and beta diversity e g mokany et al 2011 or even other dimensions of biodiversity such as functional or phylogenetic diversities e g d amen et al 2018 regarding the modelling of local species richness sr the two most recurrent options are 1 direct modelling of species numbers a technique named macroecological modelling mem gotelli et al 2009 and 2 stacking of species distribution models for individual species s sdms dubuis et al 2011 mateo et al 2012 these approaches have complementary difficulties guisan and rahbek 2011 mem cannot derive any information about species composition while s sdms can predict species composition but it does not include environmental controls biodiversity drivers on sr that are hypothesized by mems frequently resulting in an overestimation of sr dubuis et al 2011 mateo et al 2012 the importance of different biodiversity drivers such as climate historical factors or human impact is another important challenge for biodiversity modelling mateo et al 2017 thuiller et al 2013 in addition these drivers vary from local scale environmental conditions to historical or biogeographical factors operating at larger regional levels mateo et al 2017 willis and whittaker 2002 in the near past sr was postulated to be largely limited by the available energy wright 1983 and it was commonly hypothesized that sr could be predicted through a measure of the available environmental energy basically precipitation and temperature currie 1991 our current understanding of sr embraces supplementary hypotheses cornell and harrison 2014 harmon and harrison 2015 implying that our understanding of biodiversity patterns at the local scale requires additional information such as evolutionary or historical drivers i e processes that take place at larger regional scales godfray and lawton 2001 at the local scale sr is shaped by the properties of regional species pools which in turn are the result of speciation immigration range extension diversification rates regional area and geological age cornell 2013 cornell and harrison 2014 consequently zones with larger inputs of energy or constant climates tropical areas show greater species numbers not only as a consequence of higher energy availability brown 2014 but also due to higher sustained diversification rates and subsequently larger regional species pools cornell 2013 even for these hypotheses and as a preliminary approximation temperature precipitation and climate seasonality could be worthy sr predictors although other drivers should be considered when possible guisan and rahbek 2011 mateo et al 2017 regional sr drivers such as broad scale environmental gradients i e climate could determine sr at broader scales within that regional sr local sr spatial patterns would be shaped by other environmental and stochastic factors or niche and dispersal assembly rules guisan and rahbek 2011 hubbell 2001 laliberté et al 2009 therefore macroevolutionary dynamics i e colonization time differences in speciation rates or dispersal limitation would generate the difference in community assembly process benício et al 2021 that could be reflected in spatial richness patterns our first objective was to achieve a better understanding of the drivers that influence the spatial organization of plant assemblages in tropical forests at the landscape scale within this objective we studied the well sampled forests of the madidi region along a ca 4000 m altitudinal gradient in the eastern slopes of the bolivian andes friedman rudovsky 2012 climate shifts occur dramatically across this altitudinal gradient therefore our first hypothesis was that temperature and precipitation should be the primary sr predictors even though other factors could contribute to explain additional variation to test this hypothesis we evaluated models with or without spatial patterns the idea was to generate spatial predictors that allow the model to consider the spatial structure of the training data i e woody plant communities see dray et al 2006 peres neto et al 2010 if macroevolutionary dynamics or other biodiversity drivers not considered here are important in species richness assembly process at local scale in these tropical areas benício et al 2021 improved results would be obtained with biodiversity models that consider a spatial pattern our second objective was to generate accurate predictions of sr at the local scale and fine resolution 90 m our second hypothesis was that if the biodiversity drivers were precisely generated in the previous step reasonably accurate biodiversity models could be generated at the local scale in the literature multiple examples for predicting biodiversity at coarse resolution 1 50 km are available at the country level lessmann et al 2014 mateo et al 2012 or regional extents in tropical areas de la estrella et al 2012 but only a few examples attempt predicting biodiversity in tropical areas at the local scale and fine resolution e g pouteau et al 2015 pouteau et al 2019 in these works the variables employed as predictors are mostly derived from remote sensing pouteau et al 2018 as the normalized difference vegetation index gillespie 2005 or canopy structure fricker et al 2015 to our knowledge potential biodiversity drivers i e climate topographic heterogeneity human impact have not been employed as predictors during the modelling process at the local scale our aim was to implement various biodiversity models to better understand the processes that generate plant biodiversity in the andes amazon gradient the reliable model developed could be integrated into a conservation management strategy for the study area guisan et al 2013 mateo et al 2019b and the proposed methodology may possibly be implemented to better understand and predict biodiversity patterns in other tropical megadiverse areas worldwide 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and vegetation plots we studied mature forests of the madidi national park and surrounding areas in north western bolivia using inventories of temporary 0 1 ha plots 20 50 m across the andes amazon gradient latitudes 12 43 to 15 72 longitudes 69 48 to 66 66 a total of 397 plots were established from 250 to c 4000 m elevation including plots in dry tropical forests plots were located in forests with no signs of recent human disturbance avoiding big canopy gaps or evident heterogeneity in soils or tree physiognomy within a plot all woody plant stems 2 5 cm dbh diameter at breast height measured at 130 cm from the ground were inventoried following a standard protocol arellano et al 2016 the floristic database is maintained by the missouri botanical garden and the dataset can be requested from the madidi project https madidiproject weebly com superficial soil samples 0 15 cm below the litter layer were collected air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve to analyse their main physico chemical properties 2 2 biodiversity drivers predictors in order to understand the processes that generate and maintain diversity we considered potential plant biodiversity drivers in four main categories climate topography anthropic and edaphic these drivers are expected to capture important factors for plant biodiversity at the local scale reliable estimation of microclimatic environments i e derived from precise topography layers resolution lower than 100 m is crucial to comprehend how species interact with the environment and it is progressively recognised as essential for predicting species distributions maclean et al 2021 here a set of eight microclimatic variables were generated in the form of accurate 90 m resolution raster layers through a downscaling procedure mateo et al 2019b from variables available at a resolution of 30 arc seconds 1 km2 at the equator in chelsa 1 2 karger et al 2017 first to avoid multicollinearity we implemented a pairwise correlation evaluation on all the accessible variables monthly precipitation and monthly minimum maximum and mean temperatures in each pair with a correlation value greater than 0 7 dormann et al 2013 we removed one climate variable we obtained a final set of six representative climate variables precipitation of the driest month january precipitation of the wettest month july mean temperature of the hottest month october mean temperature of the coldest month july maximum temperature of the hottest month october minimum temperature of the coldest month july second variables were downscaled from 1 km to 30 m resolution for temperature variables this was accomplished in r using local linear regressions mateo et al 2019b through a relationship of temperature with a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem https www usgs gov centers eros for precipitation variables downscaling was accomplished by means of a bilinear approach using the resample function in r package raster third after downscaling was completed we generated three other climate variables precipitation seasonality july precipitation minus january precipitation temperature seasonality october mean temperature minus july mean temperature and temperature spatial heterogeneity standard deviation of mean july temperature in a window of nine 30 30 m pixels finally climate variables were generated at 90 m resolution by averaging values across nine 30 30 m pixels except for temperature heterogeneity which was already estimated at this resolution microtopography predictors heterogeneity and moisture were derived from a 30 m resolution digital elevation model as follows first we calculated linear aspect slope slope tool in arcgis 10 7 and accumulated flow into each down slope cell towards the shortest surface distance to any stream hydrology toolset in arcgis 10 7 second we calculated heterogeneity predictors 90 m resolution by the calculation of the standard deviation in a window of nine 30 30 m pixels for altitude linear aspect and slope the final accumulated flow variable was calculated at 90 m resolution as the mean of nine 30 30 m pixels we obtained information on edaphic variables at each of the 397 plots soil texture percentages of sand silt and clay was determined by bouyoucos hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 soil ph was determined in a 1 2 5 w v soil deionized water suspension organic carbon c content was determined by wet digestion walkley 1947 total nitrogen n was obtained with the semi micro kjeldahl method van reeuwijk 2002 we used two extractive methods for ca mg and k applied to different sets of samples 1 extraction using 1 m ammonium acetate solution and 2 extraction using the mehlich 3 solution mehlich 1984 the results from both methods were standardized since both are linearly correlated according to arellano et al 2016 we also calculated the c n ratio as this variable is considered an important indicator of soil fertility in forest soil quality assessments schoenholtz et al 2000 finally the human impact at each plot was obtained from the human footprint layer 900 m resolution created by sanderson et al 2009 these data represent the relative human influence in every biome as a percentage as this variable was not correlated with altitude a meaningful downscaling was not possible to avoid multicollinearity across all sets of predictors we excluded highly correlated predictors pearson s r 0 70 dormann et al 2013 keeping 19 of them see table 1 in order to evaluate our first hypothesis the predictors table 1 were grouped in four clusters by considering biodiversity driver categories i e climate topography anthropic and edaphic the four clusters were generated by the consecutive inclusion of a category 1 climate c 2 climate and topography ct 3 climate topography and anthropic cta and 4 climate topography anthropic and edaphic ctae after this process we obtained four clusters of predictors each to compare the importance of biodiversity drivers by categories to explain and predict woody plant sr patterns the aim was to improve the understanding of ecological processes houlahan et al 2017 answering questions such as 1 how essential are climate variables to predict sr in tropical areas at local scale because of the extensive elevational gradient considered our hypothesis is that climate will be the main driver of sr and the biodiversity model calibrated with exclusively climatic variables will be accurate and it will have high values of explained variance 2 do biodiversity estimations improve if other drivers are considered if yes what is the magnitude of this improvement our hypothesis was that the accuracy of the predictions would increase furthermore as the drivers were included by steps and categories we could evaluate the influence of the different drivers categories 2 3 biodiversity modelling for each of the four clusters of drivers generated previously we modelled the observed sr n 397 plots using both random forests rf breiman 2001 and bayesian inference using the integrated nested laplace approximation inla rue et al 2009 rf was implemented using a maximum of 500 trees and a poisson distribution d amen et al 2015 the process was repeated considering a spatial pattern for rf longitude and latitude were included as predictors sekulić et al 2020 bayesian spatial models included several covariates see table 1 and continuous spatially correlated random effects defined using a matérn covariance function defined using the spde approach with inla krainski et al 2019 lindgren et al 2011 finally we obtained 16 biodiversity models 4 clusters of predictors 2 modelling techniques x 2 spatial options the predictive performance of the 16 biodiversity models was assessed by cross validation the models were fitted to a portion of the data and these fitted models were used to make predictions on the remaining data a good model is supposed to make good predictions on portions of the data that were not included during the model fitting process in contrast an overfitted model will make very accurate predictions on the data that were used to fit the model but poor predictions based on other observations even if taken from the same population we followed a cross validation procedure where the original dataset 397 plots was randomly divided into two partitions with a repeated 10 times procedure using the 80 partition for training the models and the other 20 for model validation d amen et al 2015 for each split sample repetition a spearman rank correlation between observed and predicted sr value was calculated as a metric of the predictive ability of the model finally the mean and the standard deviation of the correlation values between the 10 predictions were calculated as the overall quality of the model rf was the technique with higher correlation values see table 2 and the fastest see mateo et al 2019a therefore it was selected as the reference technique from now on the analysis explained were executed only for rf to simplify the interpretation of results we ran a final biodiversity model with 100 of the original dataset 397 plots to avoid biases associated with subsampling araújo et al 2005 for rf as model averaging enable model coefficients to fluctuate and improve the spatial transferability mateo et al 2010 yates et al 2018 we ran 100 times replicates with a repeated split sample procedure and the replicates were fitted on the 80 data partition and the other 20 for validation the final biodiversity model was the average of the 100 replicates the accuracy of this model was assessed by the mean of squared residuals the percentage of variance explained and the relative under or over estimation of species observed sr predicted sr observed sr which could be seen as model residuals weighted by the number of observed species the weighted residuals were plotted by forest types and altitude forest types classification was obtained from arellano et al 2015 the most distinct forest formation is the semideciduous dry forest characterized by lack of precipitation during 4 5 months per year the other forest types were characterized by regular altitudinal belts lowland amazonian forest below 1000 m lower montane forest 1000 1700 m intermediate montane forest 1700 2400 m upper montane forest 2400 3100 m and high andean forest 3100 3731 m edaphic data were only available for the plots so extrapolation to the complete study area could not include edaphic predictors therefore spatial projections of the models were only generated for three predictor clusters 1 climate topography and anthropic cta 2 climate and topography ct and 3 climate c to explore if the biodiversity maps generated were different we calculated the spearman rank correlation coefficient between all pairs mateo et al 2010 3 results 3 1 field work our plant database included 2257 species or morphospecies based on standardized taxonomy the observed sr varies from 11 to 134 woody plant species per 0 1 ha plot 3 2 comparison of modelling techniques rf biodiversity predictions outperformed bayesian models when the spatial component was not considered higher correlation values were obtained for the four biodiversity driver models table 2 however when a spatial component was considered the results obtained were very similar for both approaches 3 3 biodiversity drivers and species richness patterns counting rf biodiversity predictions whether the spatial component was considered or not very similar values of correlation table 2 mean of squared residuals table 3 and percentage of variance explained table 3 were obtained for the four biodiversity driver clusters in addition high correlation values 0 86 to 0 99 table 4 were found when biodiversity maps were subject to pairs comparison the biodiversity model did not gain any considerable improvement by including more biodiversity drivers as predictors given that model complexity could have negative effects on ecological models see moreno amat et al 2015 and references therein we selected as the reference model the one calibrated with climatic variables only i e it was considered the closest to the reality given the modelling technique and the available data hernandez et al 2006 otherwise the model improves if a spatial component was included the correlation value increase from 0 80 to 0 85 table 2 and the variance explained percentage raised from 60 18 to 67 74 table 3 we also tested the final model residuals spatial autocorrelation adjusted with climatic variables and the spatial component through a moran s i index i with 99 999 permutations we obtained a non significant result for this test i 0 027 p value 0 7 we concluded that we did not left out any important spatial driver of sr chevalier et al 2021 an analogous trend was observed for the bayesian model similar correlation values table 2 when a spatial component was considered however if the spatial component was not included the correlation values increase from 0 55 only climatic variables to 0 64 climate topography anthropic and edaphic final average rf models of each cluster of drivers produced similar sr projections across the whole study area fig 1 table 4 however at the local scale the spatial patterns differences between them could be important indeed our results suggest that climate drivers determine a general trend which is then refined by spatial factors 3 4 forest types altitudinal gradient and species richness prediction the reference biodiversity models rf modelling technique and climate predictors displayed a general trend to over prediction in the less sr forests high andean and dry forest and a slight under prediction in the higher sr forests lowland amazonian lower montane and intermediate montane forests fig 2 furthermore the maximum sr observed was 134 species per 0 1 ha plot and the maximum sr predicted was 110 species per pixel the under prediction error was reduced when a spatial component was included in the model fig 2b 4 discussion 4 1 biodiversity drivers and species richness patterns our results supported our two main hypotheses accurate biodiversity models can be generated at the local scale and climatic drivers are important biodiversity predictor in tropical areas when an altitudinal gradient is considered however climate drivers alone are not a sufficient explanation for biodiversity patterns indeed a spatial component at least should be considered for a proper sr prediction table 1 although the maximum cross correlation obtained for the best model was 0 85 table 2 and the maximum explained variance was 67 table 3 there is still room for improvement for example the model presented a general trend to over prediction in the forest with lower sr while displaying an under prediction in the forests with higher sr fig 2 the inclusion of biogeographical evolutionary and historical drivers during the modelling process could be needed to improve the results mateo et al 2017 such as the regional species pool colonization time dispersal capacities or speciation rates benício et al 2021 if this were the case they could be included in a step by step process sesam framework guisan and rahbek 2011 or considering a hierarchical scale framework mateo et al 2019a finally the importance of stochastic factors in biodiversity patterns at the local scale chase 2010 which was not possible to include in the modelling process d amen et al 2017 might be responsible for some of the unexplained variance moreover some authors have postulated recently that climatic drivers exert greater control over plant species assemblage in temperate areas laughlin and laughlin 2013 whereas dispersal limitation and historical drivers have a greater influence on tree plant richness patterns in tropical regions kraft and ackerly 2010 pouteau et al 2019 recently precipitation has been associated with changes in tree species turnover in tropical areas e g esquivel muelbert et al 2017 hardy et al 2012 these findings support the hypothesis that climate might drive the regional species pool and subsequently the regional species pools have an important influence on the local tree communities e g lessard et al 2012a lessard et al 2012b our results meet with these past studies suggesting that precipitation is an important driver of woody biodiversity in tropical areas edaphic variables are hypothesized to have an important role in plant richness patterns in tropical areas e g gentry 1988 tuomisto et al 2016 however our results suggest that sr can be accurately predicted without considering edaphic drivers directly indeed when dropping edaphic drivers from the model the correlation value remained high 0 80 and the explained variance decreased only slightly from 67 to 65 table 3 in contrast edaphic variables were found crucial for predicting the distribution of plant species at the local scale by using the s sdms modelling framework cianfrani et al 2019 where each species was modelled independently and the edaphic conditions are relevant in the distribution of individual plant species here we were predicting the observed sr numbers and edaphic factors did not show an important role when soil factors were removed topographic factors became important this might be explained because it is possible to approximate some edaphic conditions through topographic information soil texture and ph are variables strongly associated with topographic factors as elevation and slope dessalegn et al 2014 which would justify the small reduction in explained variance in the richness models when these edaphic variables are removed in the analysis but topographic variables were retained the large elevation gradient studied from 250 to c 4000 m can influence microclimate and thus soil forming processes soil ph values showed a decrease with elevation and coarse sand sized particles increased significantly slope is related to soil erosion morphology and deposition processes therefore soil fertility is lower on ridges and upper slopes than in hollows and valleys scholten et al 2017 the anthropic variable did not seem to provide useful information during the modelling process when we compared the models that included this variable the climate topography and anthropic models with models that did not include it climate and topography models they were practically equivalent correlation value of 0 99 considering a spatial component table 4 this may be due to the coarse resolution of the information available for this variable 900 m in the near future information obtained by drones or other forms of high resolution aerial or satellite imagery might be used to derive more precise and useful anthropic variables the rf model was mapped under three different clusters of biodiversity drivers fig 1 climate climate and topography climate topography and anthropic the three models mapped displayed similar regional trends for biodiversity patterns see fig 1 however at the local scale the differences between models could be important see fig 1 therefore these comparisons among model projections reinforce our conclusion that climate alone is not a sufficient explanation for current biodiversity patterns and other biodiversity drivers should be considered in biodiversity modelling frameworks 4 2 macroecological biodiversity modelling framework our results confirmed that random forests are reasonably resistant to overfitting e g mi et al 2017 and we suggest their use to predict sr here for the first time we showed appropriate results for tropical areas this means that it is possible to predict accurately sr and better understand the role of different biodiversity drivers along an altitudinal gradient a macroecological modelling mem framework was selected to predict sr because the importance of different biodiversity drivers can be evaluated mateo et al 2016 although species composition cannot be predicted guisan and rahbek 2011 which was not the objective of this study we achieved better results with rf than with the bayesian procedure when we did not include space for rf we generated an ensemble model of 100 replicates with split sample procedure this could generate more flexible models mateo et al 2010 than the bayesian lineal models applied however when a spatial component was considered the results obtained were very similar for both approaches this highlights the importance of considering the spatial component during ecological landscape scale modelling at precise spatial resolution the inclusion of spatial components may be even more important than the statistical method employed the accurate modelling performance obtained here was conditioned by the employment of appropriate modelling practices araújo et al 2019 we can emphasize three of them a a proper selection of ecologically meaningful biodiversity drivers in accordance with ecological theory mateo et al 2017 mcgill 2010 b the generation of different variables at fine spatial resolution as for example downscaled climatic variables mateo et al 2019b or environmental heterogeneity c the availability of accurate and taxonomically standardized presence data at the local scale d amen et al 2017 guisan et al 2017 as a first and important step in studies related to biodiversity modelling we suggest a cautious inspection of the data on the distribution of the species the generation of appropriated environmental variables and appropriate selection of the modelling approach and the parameterization 4 3 future lines of research we have presented the first step to accurately predict sr in tropical areas at the local scale and precise resolution considering the importance of different biodiversity drivers future studies could consider and improve some aspects as 1 compare the results with other biodiversity modelling frameworks as s sdms dubuis et al 2011 or hierarchical bayesian approaches considering different aspects of scale mateo et al 2019a 2 consider future climatic projections according to various climate change scenarios 3 model the effect of dispersal limitation and biotic interactions which are important diversity drivers at local scales mateo et al 2017 pouteau et al 2019 the integration and combination with other biodiversity modelling techniques that consider these drivers guisan and rahbek 2011 could be worthy 4 integrate biodiversity models with information obtained from remote sensing pouteau et al 2018 or drones saarinen et al 2018 to derive land use data at fine resolutions meters and include these data as independent variables in the modelling process 5 conclusions we have ratified the importance of microclimate precipitation and temperature controlling plant sr patterns at the local scale our results suggest that climate drivers determine a general trend in plant richness patterns which is then refined by spatial factors since climate change is expected to produce major changes in biological systems in this area beaumont et al 2011 special conservation measures should be considered to prevent it edwards et al 2019 the modelling approach proposed here combined with the generation of precise biodiversity drivers 90 m resolution could generate reliable and precise forecast predictions and upgrade previous methodological approaches as multiple regression models fricker et al 2015 or ordinary least squares ols regression models tripathi et al 2019 which usually have only been applied at regional or continental scales and coarse resolutions the local and precise models obtained could serve as a valuable tool for local conservation planning mateo et al 2019b in the region if accurate sr and spatial variables data are available then the methodology presented here could be employed in other tropical areas to complement their conservation needs

24343,disentangling the relative importance of different biodiversity drivers i e climate edaphic historical factors or human impact to predict plant species richness at the local scale is one of the most important challenges in ecology biodiversity modelling is a key tool for the integration of these drivers and the predictions generated are essential for example for climate change forecast and conservation planning however the reliability of biodiversity models at the local scale remains poorly understood especially in tropical species rich areas where they are required we inventoried all woody plants with stems 2 5 cm in 397 plots across the andes amazon gradient we generated and mapped 19 uncorrelated biodiversity drivers at 90 m resolution grouped into four categories microclimatic microtopographic anthropic and edaphic in order to evaluate the importance of the different categories we grouped biodiversity drivers into four different clusters by categories for each of the four clusters of biodiversity drivers we modelled the observed species richness using two statistical techniques random forest and bayesian inference and two modelling procedures including or excluding a spatial component all the biodiversity models produced were evaluated by cross validation species richness was accurately predicted by random forest spearman correlation up to 0 85 and explained variance up to 67 the results suggest that precipitation and temperature are important driving forces of species richness in the region nonetheless a spatial component should be considered to properly predict biodiversity this could reflect macroevolutionary underlying forces not considered here such as colonization time dispersal capacities or speciation rates however the proposed biodiversity modelling approach can predict accurately species richness at the local scale and detailed resolution 90 m in tropical areas something that previous works had found extremely challenging the innovative methodology presented here could be employed in other areas with conservation needs keywords altitudinal gradient bayesian inference biodiversity patterns madidi region plant species richness random forest data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biological communities are threatened by intensifying human impact on ecosystems sheldon et al 2011 a crucial challenge for the immediate future will be to conserve biodiversity under the current climate change scenario fadrique et al 2018 to shed light on this global issue biodiversity modelling is broadly employed in numerous fields d amen et al 2017 biodiversity models can be used to support conservation planning guisan et al 2013 or assessments of climate change effects on biodiversity randin et al 2009 urban et al 2016 although biodiversity modelling has undergone substantial developments our ability to predict biodiversity at local scales remains limited urban et al 2016 yates et al 2018 this is particularly true in tropical areas due to high species diversity complexity jetz et al 2012 and problems with data quality and availability cayuela et al 2009 loiselle et al 2008 the tropical andes is one of the most species rich areas on the planet as well as one of the most relevant regions for the conservation of biodiversity brooks et al 2006 myers et al 2000 significant climate change effects have been already noticed in the tropical andes reshaping the spatial distribution of tree species among other things fadrique et al 2018 in this context accurate predictions of local biodiversity would allow to build more realistic conservation plans mateo et al 2019b models to predict biodiversity patterns vary d amen et al 2017 guisan et al 2017 from purely correlative e g gotelli et al 2009 guisan and rahbek 2011 to mechanistic e g mokany and ferrier 2011 the different approaches try to predict various aspects of taxonomic diversity such as species composition e g mateo et al 2012 species richness e g di febbraro et al 2018 and beta diversity e g mokany et al 2011 or even other dimensions of biodiversity such as functional or phylogenetic diversities e g d amen et al 2018 regarding the modelling of local species richness sr the two most recurrent options are 1 direct modelling of species numbers a technique named macroecological modelling mem gotelli et al 2009 and 2 stacking of species distribution models for individual species s sdms dubuis et al 2011 mateo et al 2012 these approaches have complementary difficulties guisan and rahbek 2011 mem cannot derive any information about species composition while s sdms can predict species composition but it does not include environmental controls biodiversity drivers on sr that are hypothesized by mems frequently resulting in an overestimation of sr dubuis et al 2011 mateo et al 2012 the importance of different biodiversity drivers such as climate historical factors or human impact is another important challenge for biodiversity modelling mateo et al 2017 thuiller et al 2013 in addition these drivers vary from local scale environmental conditions to historical or biogeographical factors operating at larger regional levels mateo et al 2017 willis and whittaker 2002 in the near past sr was postulated to be largely limited by the available energy wright 1983 and it was commonly hypothesized that sr could be predicted through a measure of the available environmental energy basically precipitation and temperature currie 1991 our current understanding of sr embraces supplementary hypotheses cornell and harrison 2014 harmon and harrison 2015 implying that our understanding of biodiversity patterns at the local scale requires additional information such as evolutionary or historical drivers i e processes that take place at larger regional scales godfray and lawton 2001 at the local scale sr is shaped by the properties of regional species pools which in turn are the result of speciation immigration range extension diversification rates regional area and geological age cornell 2013 cornell and harrison 2014 consequently zones with larger inputs of energy or constant climates tropical areas show greater species numbers not only as a consequence of higher energy availability brown 2014 but also due to higher sustained diversification rates and subsequently larger regional species pools cornell 2013 even for these hypotheses and as a preliminary approximation temperature precipitation and climate seasonality could be worthy sr predictors although other drivers should be considered when possible guisan and rahbek 2011 mateo et al 2017 regional sr drivers such as broad scale environmental gradients i e climate could determine sr at broader scales within that regional sr local sr spatial patterns would be shaped by other environmental and stochastic factors or niche and dispersal assembly rules guisan and rahbek 2011 hubbell 2001 laliberté et al 2009 therefore macroevolutionary dynamics i e colonization time differences in speciation rates or dispersal limitation would generate the difference in community assembly process benício et al 2021 that could be reflected in spatial richness patterns our first objective was to achieve a better understanding of the drivers that influence the spatial organization of plant assemblages in tropical forests at the landscape scale within this objective we studied the well sampled forests of the madidi region along a ca 4000 m altitudinal gradient in the eastern slopes of the bolivian andes friedman rudovsky 2012 climate shifts occur dramatically across this altitudinal gradient therefore our first hypothesis was that temperature and precipitation should be the primary sr predictors even though other factors could contribute to explain additional variation to test this hypothesis we evaluated models with or without spatial patterns the idea was to generate spatial predictors that allow the model to consider the spatial structure of the training data i e woody plant communities see dray et al 2006 peres neto et al 2010 if macroevolutionary dynamics or other biodiversity drivers not considered here are important in species richness assembly process at local scale in these tropical areas benício et al 2021 improved results would be obtained with biodiversity models that consider a spatial pattern our second objective was to generate accurate predictions of sr at the local scale and fine resolution 90 m our second hypothesis was that if the biodiversity drivers were precisely generated in the previous step reasonably accurate biodiversity models could be generated at the local scale in the literature multiple examples for predicting biodiversity at coarse resolution 1 50 km are available at the country level lessmann et al 2014 mateo et al 2012 or regional extents in tropical areas de la estrella et al 2012 but only a few examples attempt predicting biodiversity in tropical areas at the local scale and fine resolution e g pouteau et al 2015 pouteau et al 2019 in these works the variables employed as predictors are mostly derived from remote sensing pouteau et al 2018 as the normalized difference vegetation index gillespie 2005 or canopy structure fricker et al 2015 to our knowledge potential biodiversity drivers i e climate topographic heterogeneity human impact have not been employed as predictors during the modelling process at the local scale our aim was to implement various biodiversity models to better understand the processes that generate plant biodiversity in the andes amazon gradient the reliable model developed could be integrated into a conservation management strategy for the study area guisan et al 2013 mateo et al 2019b and the proposed methodology may possibly be implemented to better understand and predict biodiversity patterns in other tropical megadiverse areas worldwide 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and vegetation plots we studied mature forests of the madidi national park and surrounding areas in north western bolivia using inventories of temporary 0 1 ha plots 20 50 m across the andes amazon gradient latitudes 12 43 to 15 72 longitudes 69 48 to 66 66 a total of 397 plots were established from 250 to c 4000 m elevation including plots in dry tropical forests plots were located in forests with no signs of recent human disturbance avoiding big canopy gaps or evident heterogeneity in soils or tree physiognomy within a plot all woody plant stems 2 5 cm dbh diameter at breast height measured at 130 cm from the ground were inventoried following a standard protocol arellano et al 2016 the floristic database is maintained by the missouri botanical garden and the dataset can be requested from the madidi project https madidiproject weebly com superficial soil samples 0 15 cm below the litter layer were collected air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve to analyse their main physico chemical properties 2 2 biodiversity drivers predictors in order to understand the processes that generate and maintain diversity we considered potential plant biodiversity drivers in four main categories climate topography anthropic and edaphic these drivers are expected to capture important factors for plant biodiversity at the local scale reliable estimation of microclimatic environments i e derived from precise topography layers resolution lower than 100 m is crucial to comprehend how species interact with the environment and it is progressively recognised as essential for predicting species distributions maclean et al 2021 here a set of eight microclimatic variables were generated in the form of accurate 90 m resolution raster layers through a downscaling procedure mateo et al 2019b from variables available at a resolution of 30 arc seconds 1 km2 at the equator in chelsa 1 2 karger et al 2017 first to avoid multicollinearity we implemented a pairwise correlation evaluation on all the accessible variables monthly precipitation and monthly minimum maximum and mean temperatures in each pair with a correlation value greater than 0 7 dormann et al 2013 we removed one climate variable we obtained a final set of six representative climate variables precipitation of the driest month january precipitation of the wettest month july mean temperature of the hottest month october mean temperature of the coldest month july maximum temperature of the hottest month october minimum temperature of the coldest month july second variables were downscaled from 1 km to 30 m resolution for temperature variables this was accomplished in r using local linear regressions mateo et al 2019b through a relationship of temperature with a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem https www usgs gov centers eros for precipitation variables downscaling was accomplished by means of a bilinear approach using the resample function in r package raster third after downscaling was completed we generated three other climate variables precipitation seasonality july precipitation minus january precipitation temperature seasonality october mean temperature minus july mean temperature and temperature spatial heterogeneity standard deviation of mean july temperature in a window of nine 30 30 m pixels finally climate variables were generated at 90 m resolution by averaging values across nine 30 30 m pixels except for temperature heterogeneity which was already estimated at this resolution microtopography predictors heterogeneity and moisture were derived from a 30 m resolution digital elevation model as follows first we calculated linear aspect slope slope tool in arcgis 10 7 and accumulated flow into each down slope cell towards the shortest surface distance to any stream hydrology toolset in arcgis 10 7 second we calculated heterogeneity predictors 90 m resolution by the calculation of the standard deviation in a window of nine 30 30 m pixels for altitude linear aspect and slope the final accumulated flow variable was calculated at 90 m resolution as the mean of nine 30 30 m pixels we obtained information on edaphic variables at each of the 397 plots soil texture percentages of sand silt and clay was determined by bouyoucos hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 soil ph was determined in a 1 2 5 w v soil deionized water suspension organic carbon c content was determined by wet digestion walkley 1947 total nitrogen n was obtained with the semi micro kjeldahl method van reeuwijk 2002 we used two extractive methods for ca mg and k applied to different sets of samples 1 extraction using 1 m ammonium acetate solution and 2 extraction using the mehlich 3 solution mehlich 1984 the results from both methods were standardized since both are linearly correlated according to arellano et al 2016 we also calculated the c n ratio as this variable is considered an important indicator of soil fertility in forest soil quality assessments schoenholtz et al 2000 finally the human impact at each plot was obtained from the human footprint layer 900 m resolution created by sanderson et al 2009 these data represent the relative human influence in every biome as a percentage as this variable was not correlated with altitude a meaningful downscaling was not possible to avoid multicollinearity across all sets of predictors we excluded highly correlated predictors pearson s r 0 70 dormann et al 2013 keeping 19 of them see table 1 in order to evaluate our first hypothesis the predictors table 1 were grouped in four clusters by considering biodiversity driver categories i e climate topography anthropic and edaphic the four clusters were generated by the consecutive inclusion of a category 1 climate c 2 climate and topography ct 3 climate topography and anthropic cta and 4 climate topography anthropic and edaphic ctae after this process we obtained four clusters of predictors each to compare the importance of biodiversity drivers by categories to explain and predict woody plant sr patterns the aim was to improve the understanding of ecological processes houlahan et al 2017 answering questions such as 1 how essential are climate variables to predict sr in tropical areas at local scale because of the extensive elevational gradient considered our hypothesis is that climate will be the main driver of sr and the biodiversity model calibrated with exclusively climatic variables will be accurate and it will have high values of explained variance 2 do biodiversity estimations improve if other drivers are considered if yes what is the magnitude of this improvement our hypothesis was that the accuracy of the predictions would increase furthermore as the drivers were included by steps and categories we could evaluate the influence of the different drivers categories 2 3 biodiversity modelling for each of the four clusters of drivers generated previously we modelled the observed sr n 397 plots using both random forests rf breiman 2001 and bayesian inference using the integrated nested laplace approximation inla rue et al 2009 rf was implemented using a maximum of 500 trees and a poisson distribution d amen et al 2015 the process was repeated considering a spatial pattern for rf longitude and latitude were included as predictors sekulić et al 2020 bayesian spatial models included several covariates see table 1 and continuous spatially correlated random effects defined using a matérn covariance function defined using the spde approach with inla krainski et al 2019 lindgren et al 2011 finally we obtained 16 biodiversity models 4 clusters of predictors 2 modelling techniques x 2 spatial options the predictive performance of the 16 biodiversity models was assessed by cross validation the models were fitted to a portion of the data and these fitted models were used to make predictions on the remaining data a good model is supposed to make good predictions on portions of the data that were not included during the model fitting process in contrast an overfitted model will make very accurate predictions on the data that were used to fit the model but poor predictions based on other observations even if taken from the same population we followed a cross validation procedure where the original dataset 397 plots was randomly divided into two partitions with a repeated 10 times procedure using the 80 partition for training the models and the other 20 for model validation d amen et al 2015 for each split sample repetition a spearman rank correlation between observed and predicted sr value was calculated as a metric of the predictive ability of the model finally the mean and the standard deviation of the correlation values between the 10 predictions were calculated as the overall quality of the model rf was the technique with higher correlation values see table 2 and the fastest see mateo et al 2019a therefore it was selected as the reference technique from now on the analysis explained were executed only for rf to simplify the interpretation of results we ran a final biodiversity model with 100 of the original dataset 397 plots to avoid biases associated with subsampling araújo et al 2005 for rf as model averaging enable model coefficients to fluctuate and improve the spatial transferability mateo et al 2010 yates et al 2018 we ran 100 times replicates with a repeated split sample procedure and the replicates were fitted on the 80 data partition and the other 20 for validation the final biodiversity model was the average of the 100 replicates the accuracy of this model was assessed by the mean of squared residuals the percentage of variance explained and the relative under or over estimation of species observed sr predicted sr observed sr which could be seen as model residuals weighted by the number of observed species the weighted residuals were plotted by forest types and altitude forest types classification was obtained from arellano et al 2015 the most distinct forest formation is the semideciduous dry forest characterized by lack of precipitation during 4 5 months per year the other forest types were characterized by regular altitudinal belts lowland amazonian forest below 1000 m lower montane forest 1000 1700 m intermediate montane forest 1700 2400 m upper montane forest 2400 3100 m and high andean forest 3100 3731 m edaphic data were only available for the plots so extrapolation to the complete study area could not include edaphic predictors therefore spatial projections of the models were only generated for three predictor clusters 1 climate topography and anthropic cta 2 climate and topography ct and 3 climate c to explore if the biodiversity maps generated were different we calculated the spearman rank correlation coefficient between all pairs mateo et al 2010 3 results 3 1 field work our plant database included 2257 species or morphospecies based on standardized taxonomy the observed sr varies from 11 to 134 woody plant species per 0 1 ha plot 3 2 comparison of modelling techniques rf biodiversity predictions outperformed bayesian models when the spatial component was not considered higher correlation values were obtained for the four biodiversity driver models table 2 however when a spatial component was considered the results obtained were very similar for both approaches 3 3 biodiversity drivers and species richness patterns counting rf biodiversity predictions whether the spatial component was considered or not very similar values of correlation table 2 mean of squared residuals table 3 and percentage of variance explained table 3 were obtained for the four biodiversity driver clusters in addition high correlation values 0 86 to 0 99 table 4 were found when biodiversity maps were subject to pairs comparison the biodiversity model did not gain any considerable improvement by including more biodiversity drivers as predictors given that model complexity could have negative effects on ecological models see moreno amat et al 2015 and references therein we selected as the reference model the one calibrated with climatic variables only i e it was considered the closest to the reality given the modelling technique and the available data hernandez et al 2006 otherwise the model improves if a spatial component was included the correlation value increase from 0 80 to 0 85 table 2 and the variance explained percentage raised from 60 18 to 67 74 table 3 we also tested the final model residuals spatial autocorrelation adjusted with climatic variables and the spatial component through a moran s i index i with 99 999 permutations we obtained a non significant result for this test i 0 027 p value 0 7 we concluded that we did not left out any important spatial driver of sr chevalier et al 2021 an analogous trend was observed for the bayesian model similar correlation values table 2 when a spatial component was considered however if the spatial component was not included the correlation values increase from 0 55 only climatic variables to 0 64 climate topography anthropic and edaphic final average rf models of each cluster of drivers produced similar sr projections across the whole study area fig 1 table 4 however at the local scale the spatial patterns differences between them could be important indeed our results suggest that climate drivers determine a general trend which is then refined by spatial factors 3 4 forest types altitudinal gradient and species richness prediction the reference biodiversity models rf modelling technique and climate predictors displayed a general trend to over prediction in the less sr forests high andean and dry forest and a slight under prediction in the higher sr forests lowland amazonian lower montane and intermediate montane forests fig 2 furthermore the maximum sr observed was 134 species per 0 1 ha plot and the maximum sr predicted was 110 species per pixel the under prediction error was reduced when a spatial component was included in the model fig 2b 4 discussion 4 1 biodiversity drivers and species richness patterns our results supported our two main hypotheses accurate biodiversity models can be generated at the local scale and climatic drivers are important biodiversity predictor in tropical areas when an altitudinal gradient is considered however climate drivers alone are not a sufficient explanation for biodiversity patterns indeed a spatial component at least should be considered for a proper sr prediction table 1 although the maximum cross correlation obtained for the best model was 0 85 table 2 and the maximum explained variance was 67 table 3 there is still room for improvement for example the model presented a general trend to over prediction in the forest with lower sr while displaying an under prediction in the forests with higher sr fig 2 the inclusion of biogeographical evolutionary and historical drivers during the modelling process could be needed to improve the results mateo et al 2017 such as the regional species pool colonization time dispersal capacities or speciation rates benício et al 2021 if this were the case they could be included in a step by step process sesam framework guisan and rahbek 2011 or considering a hierarchical scale framework mateo et al 2019a finally the importance of stochastic factors in biodiversity patterns at the local scale chase 2010 which was not possible to include in the modelling process d amen et al 2017 might be responsible for some of the unexplained variance moreover some authors have postulated recently that climatic drivers exert greater control over plant species assemblage in temperate areas laughlin and laughlin 2013 whereas dispersal limitation and historical drivers have a greater influence on tree plant richness patterns in tropical regions kraft and ackerly 2010 pouteau et al 2019 recently precipitation has been associated with changes in tree species turnover in tropical areas e g esquivel muelbert et al 2017 hardy et al 2012 these findings support the hypothesis that climate might drive the regional species pool and subsequently the regional species pools have an important influence on the local tree communities e g lessard et al 2012a lessard et al 2012b our results meet with these past studies suggesting that precipitation is an important driver of woody biodiversity in tropical areas edaphic variables are hypothesized to have an important role in plant richness patterns in tropical areas e g gentry 1988 tuomisto et al 2016 however our results suggest that sr can be accurately predicted without considering edaphic drivers directly indeed when dropping edaphic drivers from the model the correlation value remained high 0 80 and the explained variance decreased only slightly from 67 to 65 table 3 in contrast edaphic variables were found crucial for predicting the distribution of plant species at the local scale by using the s sdms modelling framework cianfrani et al 2019 where each species was modelled independently and the edaphic conditions are relevant in the distribution of individual plant species here we were predicting the observed sr numbers and edaphic factors did not show an important role when soil factors were removed topographic factors became important this might be explained because it is possible to approximate some edaphic conditions through topographic information soil texture and ph are variables strongly associated with topographic factors as elevation and slope dessalegn et al 2014 which would justify the small reduction in explained variance in the richness models when these edaphic variables are removed in the analysis but topographic variables were retained the large elevation gradient studied from 250 to c 4000 m can influence microclimate and thus soil forming processes soil ph values showed a decrease with elevation and coarse sand sized particles increased significantly slope is related to soil erosion morphology and deposition processes therefore soil fertility is lower on ridges and upper slopes than in hollows and valleys scholten et al 2017 the anthropic variable did not seem to provide useful information during the modelling process when we compared the models that included this variable the climate topography and anthropic models with models that did not include it climate and topography models they were practically equivalent correlation value of 0 99 considering a spatial component table 4 this may be due to the coarse resolution of the information available for this variable 900 m in the near future information obtained by drones or other forms of high resolution aerial or satellite imagery might be used to derive more precise and useful anthropic variables the rf model was mapped under three different clusters of biodiversity drivers fig 1 climate climate and topography climate topography and anthropic the three models mapped displayed similar regional trends for biodiversity patterns see fig 1 however at the local scale the differences between models could be important see fig 1 therefore these comparisons among model projections reinforce our conclusion that climate alone is not a sufficient explanation for current biodiversity patterns and other biodiversity drivers should be considered in biodiversity modelling frameworks 4 2 macroecological biodiversity modelling framework our results confirmed that random forests are reasonably resistant to overfitting e g mi et al 2017 and we suggest their use to predict sr here for the first time we showed appropriate results for tropical areas this means that it is possible to predict accurately sr and better understand the role of different biodiversity drivers along an altitudinal gradient a macroecological modelling mem framework was selected to predict sr because the importance of different biodiversity drivers can be evaluated mateo et al 2016 although species composition cannot be predicted guisan and rahbek 2011 which was not the objective of this study we achieved better results with rf than with the bayesian procedure when we did not include space for rf we generated an ensemble model of 100 replicates with split sample procedure this could generate more flexible models mateo et al 2010 than the bayesian lineal models applied however when a spatial component was considered the results obtained were very similar for both approaches this highlights the importance of considering the spatial component during ecological landscape scale modelling at precise spatial resolution the inclusion of spatial components may be even more important than the statistical method employed the accurate modelling performance obtained here was conditioned by the employment of appropriate modelling practices araújo et al 2019 we can emphasize three of them a a proper selection of ecologically meaningful biodiversity drivers in accordance with ecological theory mateo et al 2017 mcgill 2010 b the generation of different variables at fine spatial resolution as for example downscaled climatic variables mateo et al 2019b or environmental heterogeneity c the availability of accurate and taxonomically standardized presence data at the local scale d amen et al 2017 guisan et al 2017 as a first and important step in studies related to biodiversity modelling we suggest a cautious inspection of the data on the distribution of the species the generation of appropriated environmental variables and appropriate selection of the modelling approach and the parameterization 4 3 future lines of research we have presented the first step to accurately predict sr in tropical areas at the local scale and precise resolution considering the importance of different biodiversity drivers future studies could consider and improve some aspects as 1 compare the results with other biodiversity modelling frameworks as s sdms dubuis et al 2011 or hierarchical bayesian approaches considering different aspects of scale mateo et al 2019a 2 consider future climatic projections according to various climate change scenarios 3 model the effect of dispersal limitation and biotic interactions which are important diversity drivers at local scales mateo et al 2017 pouteau et al 2019 the integration and combination with other biodiversity modelling techniques that consider these drivers guisan and rahbek 2011 could be worthy 4 integrate biodiversity models with information obtained from remote sensing pouteau et al 2018 or drones saarinen et al 2018 to derive land use data at fine resolutions meters and include these data as independent variables in the modelling process 5 conclusions we have ratified the importance of microclimate precipitation and temperature controlling plant sr patterns at the local scale our results suggest that climate drivers determine a general trend in plant richness patterns which is then refined by spatial factors since climate change is expected to produce major changes in biological systems in this area beaumont et al 2011 special conservation measures should be considered to prevent it edwards et al 2019 the modelling approach proposed here combined with the generation of precise biodiversity drivers 90 m resolution could generate reliable and precise forecast predictions and upgrade previous methodological approaches as multiple regression models fricker et al 2015 or ordinary least squares ols regression models tripathi et al 2019 which usually have only been applied at regional or continental scales and coarse resolutions the local and precise models obtained could serve as a valuable tool for local conservation planning mateo et al 2019b in the region if accurate sr and spatial variables data are available then the methodology presented here could be employed in other tropical areas to complement their conservation needs

24344,this research developed a green mussel cultivation model to assist sustainable production for farmers under climate change events the model consists of 4 sub models mussel growth phytoplankton population the effect of seawater quality on mussel density and the influence of atmospheric parameters on seawater quality the integrated model was constructed by stella software and was calibrated with field observation data the model was employed to simulate the impact of climate change on mussels based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change the fifth assessment report ipcc ar5 projection results demonstrated that mussel production varied due to differences in the available phytoplankton the initial mussel weight the cultivation period the air temperature and the rainfall pattern the model simulations showed that under the greater radiative forcing scenario representative concentration pathways rcps higher rainfall and air temperatures resulted in salinity reduction and thermal stress on green mussels consequently mussel production was forecasted to decline over time the simulations also revealed that during extreme weather events low mussel density high aeration and being far from freshwater discharge could avoid mass mussel mortality using the results of the developed model an appropriate cultivation period can be forecasted however it depends on the site specific climate pattern in each cultivation area results can be employed as a climate change adaptation tool for mussel farmers finally the information can assist other researchers interested in sustainable mussel cultivation under extreme events graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords air temperature rainfall seawater quality model mariculture rcp perna viridis data availability

perna viridis an important commercial marine bivalve in southeast asian countries rajagopal et al 2006 a disturbance in the climate leads to variation in seawater quality which significantly influences green mussel growth and survival cebu and orale 2017 previous researchers simulated climate change stressors under laboratory conditions to describe the effects of climate change on mussels they found a deformation of gonads and mass mortality due to rising seawater temperatures goh and lai 2014 sreedevi et al 2014 lowered salinity dissolved oxygen and thermal stress cause a decline in immune functions and hemocyte production wang et al 2012 leading to mussel mortality wendling et al 2013 a study on blue mussels mytilus edulis by gu et al 2019 demonstrated that under simulation of ocean acidification lowered ph significantly reduced the mussel s clearance rate absorption efficiency respiration rate and growth the mussel s condition index and calcification rate were also lower when ph and salinity were decreased sanders et al 2018 sun et al 2016 however none of these researchers applied their results in field situations where various environmental factors can influence green mussels how mussels respond to alterations of environmental factors due to climate change is still poorly understood mathematical models can be employed to demonstrate the effects of climate change on green mussels and predict production under climate crisis previous models focused on food assimilation and energy transfer maar et al 2015 srisunont and babel 2016 wang et al 2011 they did not include the fluctuation of environmental factors due to climate change such as air temperature amount of rainfall seawater temperature ph and salinity any variation of these parameters may affect the mussel livestock and the food availability to improve the degree of accuracy the green mussel cultivation model should incorporate these climate change stressors moreover the mussels may have altered growth and physiological responses due to differences in seawater quality at cultivation sites to reduce the model s uncertainty data from field must be incorporated in this study stella software was chosen to describe the influence of climate on seawater quality and mussel production it is a graphical model that combines many sub models and successfully illustrates long term and large scale effects stella is a user friendly software that has been used to simulate the interaction between environmental factors and biological components such as fish kipkemboi et al 2007 mwegoha et al 2010 shrimp bala and hossain 2010 mirzaei et al 2019 and bivalves grant et al 2005 the software is easy to implement and simulates a variety of scenarios using this software a system dynamic model that includes atmosphere hydrosphere and biological aspects in green mussel farming can be described lastly site specific planning for sustainable mussel farming can be implemented our hypothesis is that an unstable climate affects the seawater quality and subsequently green mussel growth to overcome upcoming crisis events mussel cultivation can be planned by using environmental modeling therefore the objectives of the study are 1 to develop a dynamic model on green mussel growth incorporating seawater and atmospheric parameters 2 to simulate the impact of climate change on mussel farming and 3 to investigate the best cultivation method location under climate variation finally results provide informative data which can assist mussel farmers to adapt their operations accordingly for sustainable production leading to economic well being 2 material and methods 2 1 the study area the study area was green mussel farms located in the inner gulf of thailand as shown in fig 1 there were three sampling sites due to different cultivation methods first bangkhuntein bkt bangkok 655 299 m e 1 497 465 m n represented the mussel cultivation in the pond system there are three sampling stations at this location a low density of mussels bkt 1 a high density of mussels bkt 2 and a cultivation inside the water canal bkt 3 second maeklong river mouth mk samut songkharm province 612 675 m e 1 475 015 m n represented the mussel cultivation in estuaries three survey locations were selected across a wide area of the river mouth the farthest mussel farm 8 61 km east from the river mouth mk 1 the closest to the river mouth mk 2 and the southern boundary of the river mouth mk 3 lastly sriracha sri chonburi province 708 208 m e 1 458 524 m n was selected for the mussel cultivation in the coastal line area this cultivation site is 26 35 km south of bang pakong estuary there are three sampling stations along the sriracha coastal line area and each station is located about 1 km from the seashore 2 2 field observation green mussel and seawater quality data at each station were collected monthly from january to december 2019 fresh mussel samples were weighed and divided by the farm area to obtain the mussel production kg m2 in situ seawater temperature ph salinity and dissolved oxygen do measurements were conducted using a handheld multi parameter probe ysi 600qs usa seawater samples were analyzed for nutrients concentration as ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite and nitrate nitrogen no2 no3 n phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p and silicate silicon si oh 4 si using a segmented flow traacs 2000 auto analyzer seal analytical usa sensitivity 0 01 μg l 2 3 model development the model assumption is that green mussel growth depends on available phytoplankton and seawater quality which can be affected by the air temperature and rainfall fig 2 the green mussel cultivation model consists of 4 sub models model 1 green mussel growth model 2 phytoplankton population model 3 effect of seawater quality on green mussel density and model 4 influence of atmospheric parameters on seawater quality as shown in fig 3 all models were integrated using stella software the main model is model 1 which evaluates the changes in green mussel size over time total weight and shell length this model requires the phytoplankton quantity from model 2 and the green mussel density from model 3 to interpret the results then the seawater quality employed in model 3 was estimated from model 4 the input parameters are total rainfall air temperature the initial phytoplankton population and the initial green mussel weight the model can then simulate green mussel growth and evaluate climate change s effect on mussel production the details of each model development are described in the following section 2 3 1 model 1 green mussel growth this model assumes that green mussels gain weight over time by food consumption which depends on the filtration rate and the green mussel density as shown in fig 4 they lose weight by excretion which depends on food consumption all model parameters are presented in table 1 a green mussel is a non selective filter feeder it filters seawater and consumes phytoplankton as its main food source rajagopal et al 2006 hence to estimate food consumption the filtration rate and the amount of phytoplankton need to be included in the model as shown in eqs 1 2 1 f c f r m p 0 0071 s l 2 7454 2 f r 10 37 1 e x p 0 028 g d where f c is the actual food consumption rate g indv d f r is green mussel filtration rate l hr g dw tissue tantanasarit et al 2013a m p is the mass of phytoplankton g l s l is green mussel shell length cm g d is green mussel density l g dw tissue mass of phytoplankton m p was calculated by eq 3 3 m p t p 1000 p w where t p is total phytoplankton cell m3 which was obtained from model 2 p w is phytoplankton weight g dw cell the mussel shell length s l c m was converted from the mussel s total flesh weight w w g using eq 4 tantanasarit 2013a 4 s l 2 2573 w w 0 3724 the mussel density g d in this model results from the model 3 simulation as shown in eq 4 g d was presented as a function of surrounding seawater volume l g dw tissue this value was converted from the unit kg m2 gm obtained from model 3 using eq 5 5 g d f a r m d e p t h 1000 0 0702 g m 1000 0 9945 however the mussel does not absorb all food mass it releases feces equal to 16 45 of the total dry weight of the food it consumed srisunont and babel 2015 then the mussel absorption efficiency a e g indv and the mussel gain weight were estimated using eqs 6 7 6 a e 1 e f c 7 g w w w 0 a e where g w is green mussel weight gain g indv e is feces production w w 0 is initial green mussel flesh weight g indv this model defined mussel excretion as respiration loss feces production soluble excretion and food rejection according to gao et al 2008 respiration rate represents oxygen consumption rate v o 2 mg o2 hr indv which is related to the mussel s shell length s l mm this was calculated using eq 8 8 v o 2 0 12 s l 2 23 oxygen consumption was then converted to carbon excretion e c based on a mean respiratory quotient of 0 85 1 mgo2 0 32 mg c smaal and vonck 1997 feces production e is related to food consumption and the release of ammonium nitrogen e n and phosphate phosphorus e p through soluble excretion by mussels srisunont and babel 2015 table 1 food rejection was determined as pseudofaeces production it represents particles released from the mussel without passing the digestion process the mussels have a pre ingestive food selection they reject some matters which have a low food value as pseudofaeces a study on green mussel feeding behavior by wong and cheung 1999 described food rejection rate r r g indv d as a positive function of food consumption f c g indv d finally the mussel s loss weight g l g indv was calculated by eqs 9 10 9 g l w w 0 e r r e c e n e p 10 r r 0 9605 0 7615 f c 2 3 2 model 2 phytoplankton population phytoplankton population was simulated using the model developed by moline et al 2002 the model assumption is that the phytoplankton growth rate depends on light intensity and available nutrients in the aquatic environment light attenuation through the water column over the year can affect phytoplankton abundance according to marra 1978 light intensity i 0 and the in situ light field i z can be predicted using eqs 11 13 11 i 0 t i m a x s i n p i t i m e 365 3 i m i n 12 i z t i 0 t e x p 1 a t t z 13 z m d 2 1 s i n 2 p i t i m e l t where i m a x is the maximum irradiance moles photons m2 d a t t is the attenuation coefficient z is variation of water depth that light can go through m m d is mixed layer depth l t is length of the rotation period which is relative to julian date t i m e then light intensity was employed to evaluate phytoplankton growth p l day 1 using eq 14 neale and richerson 1987 14 p l g t a n h i z i k where g is the growth rate of each phytoplankton group moles cell month i k is the irradiance level at which photosynthesis is saturated in this study marine diatom chaetoceros calcitrans was chosen as a representative of marine phytoplankton because it was found to be the dominant species in the study areas gorcharoenwat 2007 in addition nitrogen concentration was chosen as the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth therefore the phytoplankton growth g was calculated based on the specific growth rate μ m a x day 1 nitrogen content q 0 pmol and nitrogen uptake rate ρ pmol cell h of c calcitrans as shown in eqs 15 16 tantanasarit et al 2013b table 1 15 g μ m a x 1 q 0 ρ 16 ρ ρ m a x s k s s where ρ m a x is the maximum nitrogen uptake rate pmol cell h which was calculated from michaelis menten equation s is nitrogen concentration μm and k s is the half saturation constant μm which is the nutrient concentration at ρ ρ max 2 finally total phytoplankton concentration t p cell m3 was calculated by multiplying phytoplankton growth p l with initial phytoplankton concentration and time 2 3 3 model 3 effect of seawater quality on green mussel density this model assumed that green mussel density g m kg m2 depends on the seawater salinity ph do and nutrient concentration including nh4 n no2 no3 n po4 3 p and si oh 4 si the mussel density was simulated using the multiple linear regressions model developed by srisunont et al 2022 the results demonstrated that each cultivation site had different influencing environmental parameters therefore only significant parameters were employed in the developed model consequently variation in seawater quality influences the mussel density which can be described by site specific model equations see supplementary data table s1 2 3 4 model 4 influence of atmospheric parameters on seawater quality the model assumption is that the atmospheric parameters affect seawater quality air temperature influences seawater temperature rainfall variation affects seawater salinity ph do and nutrient concentration srisunont et al 2022 found that linear and non linear models can describe the correlations between these parameters moreover they also found that at each green mussel cultivation area there was a site specific model equation hence all equations developed by their study were employed in this model see supplementary data table s2 2 3 5 model calibration and sensitivity analysis in this study the model calibration was carried out using observed data of january june 2019 then the model was validated using six months data from july december 2019 for both calibration and validation input variables were air temperature and rainfall which had maximum effect on green mussels for validation the model parameters were used from model calibration green mussel weight gain through time in each cultivation area was simulated using the total rainfall and air temperature from the thai meteorological department tmd in the same period of field observation the initial phytoplankton population and initial green mussel weight were input into the model according to the mussel cultivation method of each mussel farm finally the results from the model simulation were compared with results from the field observation to indicate the accuracy of the developed model by using the coefficient of determination r2 mean squared error mse and root mean squared error rmse the model sensitivity analysis was done to determine parameters that significantly affected green mussel weight this was carried out by varying the inputs air temperature and total rainfall with a relative change of 10 the effects of changing parameters were evaluated in terms of the mussel weight then the sensitivity value s was calculated using eq 17 jørgensen and fath 2011 17 s x 1 x 0 x 0 p 1 p 0 p 0 where x 0 is the model output from the given variable x 1 is the model output from the changing variable p 0 is the value of the model parameter and p 1 is the changing value of the model parameter 2 4 climate change scenarios to simulate the impact of climate change on green mussel cultivation future climate projections from the intergovernmental panel on climate change the fifth assessment report ipcc ar5 ipcc 2013 was employed there are four climate projection scenarios a very low forcing level rcp 2 6 two stabilization scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 and very high greenhouse gas emissions rcp 8 5 in all scenarios temperature and precipitation changes in the 20 year mean difference for the years 2016 2035 2046 2065 and 2081 2100 were input into the green mussel cultivation models see supplementary data tables s3 and s4 values assumed in each scenario are shown in supplementary data table s5 the mussel growth and production under climate variation were forecasted finally the mussel cultivation method including seeding harvesting period and site selection was planned to minimize economic loss 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration results from the model calibration and validation demonstrated that the green mussel cultivation model developed in this study is reliable and able to apply in real condition as shown in fig 5 the calibration and validation were done using different data set and both methods showed high level of the coefficient of determination r2 with low value of mean squared error mse and root mean squared error rmse a dynamic model on green mussel growth demonstrated that at each sampling station there was different mussel growth due to variation in available phytoplankton initial mussel weight cultivation period air temperature and rainfall patterns by comparing results of simulation and observation at each station the trend of mussel growth was found to reveal the accuracy of the model statistical analysis as r2 mse and rmse of each model simulation were computed as seen in figs 6 8 a high level of correlation r2 0 7 and low value of mse and rmse were observed in all simulations except bkt 1 this may be due to the loss of some observation data at this sampling station at this station all the mussels were harvested in september and the farm has been terminated since then this resulted in a low r2 value however the determination of mse and rmse showed lower values and the result from the actual observations followed the same trend as the predictions fig 6 this indicates that the developed models were accurate enough to simulate the mussel growth and evaluate the impact of climate change on the mussel production as shown in table 2 the sensitivity analysis revealed that variations in air temperature and rainfall do not affect much on green mussel weight sensitivity values close to zero however the simulation results showed that the high air temperature caused a loss of mussel s weight at stations bkt 2 and mk 2 at these stations the temperature was a significant factor in green mussel production table s2 at station bkt 2 the mussels were mass cultured in a pond with only 2 5 m depth this condition causes less water circulation subsequently thermal stress can be found when air temperature increases wang et al 2011 in station mk 2 the cultivation area is close to the river mouth seawater at this location is more turbid than other areas a high amount of suspended solids in seawater can accumulate heat from the solar radiation and result in heating the surrounding water chagas and suzuki 2005 consequently this can stress the mussel s survival wendling et al 2013 3 2 model utilization the green mussel cultivation model developed in this study differs from other marine culture models it can predict the effect of climate on green mussels at the actual site and natural farm conditions by setting up the mussel farm condition as initial green mussel weight cultivation time depth of the farm and initial phytoplankton population the equation from table s1 that matches with the farming method pond estuary or coastal can be selected after inputting the actual climate condition as air temperature and total rainfall into the model the mussel growth and production can be interpreted this allows the user to understand how climate change affects green mussel cultivation previous model emphasized a dynamic energy budget deb the model successfully described morphological changes physiological responses and metabolic costs in mussels maar et al 2015 ren and ross 2005 however it did not include the actual changes in seawater due to climate change although the deb model was modified and tried to link with climate change stressors by varying seawater salinity maar et al 2015 the results were from laboratory experiments and only one parameter was employed it was unable to describe actual farm condition which has various influencing parameters hawkins et al 2002 implemented the growth model from a field experiment on the scallop chlamys farreri they found that environmental changes such as seawater temperature seston availability and seston composition significantly affected the scallop feeding ability however their model did not include other influencing environmental factors such as seawater salinity ph and do in realistic conditions changes in these factors can coexist and influence green mussel survival hence with broader climate change stressors and actual farm conditions the model developed in our study describes the effect of climate change on mussel cultivation better in addition our model can report pollution from green mussel cultivation the mussels can pollute seawater through their excretion process they release soluble excretion as ammonium nitrogen e n and phosphate phosphorus e p and release solid excretion as feces production e these values can be interpreted from the model simulation and nutrients leaching from the mussel feces can be calculated using the model equations developed by srisunont and babel 2015 then by multiplying these excretion values with the total number of green mussels per farm calculated from the model the enrichment of nutrients into the marine environment can be estimated table 3 the model output on mussels excretion can assess the impacts of mussel cultivation on nutrient pollution bala and hossain 2010 grant et al 2005 mirzaei et al 2019 srisunont and babel 2016 even though this study did not predict the different expanding industry scenarios results from the model simulation demonstrate the pollution through mussel excretion table 3 the marine culture industry can use this information to further investigate the carrying capacity during green mussel cultivation which will not release nutrients in the water environment beyond the seawater standard therefore besides the prediction of mussel production during climate change events our model can assist farmers with a better understanding of the aquaculture system with possible management strategies for sustainable mussel cultivation and environmentally friendly mariculture 3 3 climate change scenarios to forecast green mussel production gm kg m2 over time the model was simulated based on climate change projections for the years 2016 2035 2046 2065 and 2081 2100 by ipcc ar5 2013 results from the model simulation revealed that mussel production follows the same trend in all rcps figs 9 11 however different cultivation methods result in different effects as shown in fig 9 the simulations of the highest radiative forcing rcp 8 5 revealed that mussel productions in bkt 1 and bkt 3 were similar between years but it changed little in bkt 2 where density of mussels was high mussel production tends to decrease over time in this station this is because the seawater temperature was found to be a significant parameter affecting mussel production in this area and it is related to the air temperature srisunont et al 2022 an increase in air temperature causes thermal stress which reduces immune functions and metabolism in the mussel donaghy and volety 2011 hence when cultured with high density mussels are more sensitive to climate change than mussels cultured with low density in the estuarine areas mussel production was not much different between years figs 9 11 except at mk 2 located close to the maeklong river mouth fig 1 from the model simulation mussel production at mk 2 significantly decreases over time this can be explained by a disturbance of seawater quality due to climate change intense rainfall causes high loading of suspended sediments and organic matter through river freshwater runoff and subsequently decreases light penetration which affects phytoplankton population reduces salinity alosairi et al 2019 do depletion and excessive nutrients park et al 2011 were found therefore when rainfall increases phytoplankton seawater salinity do and nutrients in mk 2 fluctuate more than other stations in coastal areas the model simulation revealed that mussel production was similar in all periods except in sri 1 which tended to decrease over time figs 9 11 this is because sri 1 is closer to bang pakong river mouth than other stations fig 1 subsequently more fluctuations in seawater salinity were found reduction in salinity causes green mussel mortality due to a decreased respiratory rate wendling et al 2013 and immune function wang et al 2012 in addition results also showed that green mussel production in sri 1 was absent during october and november in all periods figs 9 11 this is because in these months the ph of seawater was higher than 9 and the salinity was less than 24 psu which caused green mussel mortality sivalingam 1977 hence when seawater disturbance caused by climate change occurs sri 1 is a more sensitive area than other stations due to a greater salinity reduction comparisons between rcps in each forecasted period demonstrated that greater radiative forcing causes higher air temperatures rainfall and subsequently lower green mussel production figs 9 11 in some cultivation sites mussel production is similar because seawater temperature and salinity do not much fluctuate and they are in the range thus the mussel can perform a normal growth therefore these parameters are not significant factors influencing mussels in those areas as shown in fig 9 green mussel production cultured in ponds with low density bkt 1 differed between 3 periods in the years 2016 2035 the mussel production in rcp 6 0 and 8 5 is lower than other rcps this is because the climate projections in these rcps forecasted an increase in rainfall during this period in the years 2046 2065 mussel production in rcp 6 0 is higher than other rcps this is because less rainfall is forecasted in this scenario finally in the years 2081 2100 mussel production in all rcps is similar due to the same rainfall projection in station bkt 2 there is a slightly lower mussel production during rcp 8 5 this is because air temperatures were forecasted to be higher than other rcps and it is an important parameter affecting mussel production in this station supplementary data table s1 moreover in the years 2081 2100 mussel production decreases from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 this is because air temperatures were forecasted to increase from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 respectively consequently the thermal stress on green mussels increases at higher rcps in station bkt 3 where the green mussels are cultured in a water canal results showed that mussel production was similar in all three periods and all rcps fig 9 this is because in this cultivation method water can effectively flow through the mussel body there is minimal oxygen competition between living organisms moreover it enhances aeration in seawater which can reduce thermal stress wang et al 2011 and provide positive effects on mussel growth and survival sanjayasari and jeffs 2019 hence during climate change events seawater temperature variation is not a significant factor affecting mussel production in this station in estuarine areas a comparison between rcps in each period showed that green mussel production is similar in stations mk 1 and mk 3 which are far from the river mouth fig 10 this is because all seawater parameters in these stations did not vary in all rcps in agreement with alosairi et al 2019 the further the station is from the river mouth the lower the seawater quality fluctuation only at station mk 2 which is closest to the river mouth does mussel production tend to decrease with greater radiative forcing in the years 2016 2035 mussel production in rcp 6 0 was higher than other rcps this is because there was a higher rainfall projection in this scenario this phenomenon can enhance phytoplankton bloom by adding essential nutrients in water through the river runoff meng et al 2017 the abundance of phytoplankton provides sufficient food for green mussel growth the simulation showed that in the years 2046 2065 and 2081 2100 mussel production decreased from rcp 2 6 to 8 5 in these periods it was forecasted by the ipcc 2013 that the air temperature will increase over time along with more radiation subsequently heat from the atmosphere can increase seawater temperatures srisunont et al 2022 and cause thermal stress in green mussels then extensive mortality of the mussel will be found in fig 11 the simulation showed that in each period green mussel production in coastal areas sri did not fluctuate when there was a higher radiative forcing the ipcc 2013 forecasted that air temperatures and rainfall will increase from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 this causes variation in seawater temperatures and salinity srisunont et al 2022 however a decline in mussel production was found only at station sri 1 which is closer to the bang pakong river mouth than other stations fig 1 the simulation revealed that in this area seawater salinity significantly decreases when there is intense rainfall some researchers reported that the reduction in seawater salinity can decrease immune functions respiratory rates and byssus threads in green mussels wang et al 2012 wendling et al 2013 consequently it affects mussel growth and survival 3 4 green mussel cultivation under climate change scenarios and cultivation location method results from all scenarios indicated that coastal areas are the most suitable location to culture green mussels when a fluctuation of atmospheric parameters and seawater quality occurs during climate change events this is because there was a lower salinity fluctuation than in other areas salinity is the most important parameter affecting green mussel production srisunont et al 2022 in addition our results demonstrated that the cultivation areas where salinity is higher than 24 psu with less salinity fluctuations resulted in higher mussel production significant mussel mortality occurs when salinity is lower than 15 psu none of the coastal area stations had salinity lower than 15 psu during the year only in september and october salinity was slightly lower than 24 psu other seawater parameters are in a range that is suitable for green mussel growth results also indicated that the further the distance from the river mouth or watercourse the less fluctuation there was in green mussel production therefore to decrease the impact on mussel production cultivation in coastal areas should be as far from the watercourse as possible an estuary is the next suitable location for green mussel cultivation results from the model simulation showed that seawater salinity in estuarine areas had a higher fluctuation than coastal areas but less than pond areas there was a large salinity reduction at the locations close to the river mouth especially in september and october salinity was lower than 24 psu decreasing to 15 psu at the locations next to the river mouth mk 2 this caused huge mussel mortality and lower mussel production on the other hand in areas far from the river mouth at least 6 km the seawater salinity was higher than 24 psu during the entire year thus the salinity was in the suitable range for green mussel growth and survival roungjai 1999 sivalingam 1977 therefore to culture green mussels in estuarine areas the further the distance from the river mouth the higher the production results indicated that during climate change events the most sensitive cultivation method is a pond this is because in the pond more salinity fluctuation was observed than in other areas during a year most of the time seawater salinity was lower than 24 psu which causes green mussel mortality sivalingam 1977 by lowering its immune functions wang et al 2012 and respiration rates wendling et al 2013 in september and october salinity was found to be lower than 15 psu which causes 100 mussel die off roungjai 1999 however if it is necessary to culture green mussels in a pond this research suggests the density of the mussels should be low and include a water flow through system low mussel density results in less competition for food and oxygen and thus higher mussel production can be achieved water flow provides more dissolved oxygen and food for the green mussels it also helps to release thermal stress when extreme high air temperatures or drought occur therefore it is better to culture in a water canal where water can continuously flow through the mussel however the mussel can be dragged into sediment during a low tide period the cultivation robe should be hung at least 0 5 m above the seafloor during the low tide period besides the location selection cultivation periods are essential for effective green mussel production as previously mentioned seawater salinity is the most influential parameter on green mussels and it should be higher than 15 psu the model simulation showed that salinity significantly decreased in all cultivation areas in september and october therefore farmers should not culture green mussels during these months because large mortalities can occur the cultivation should start in november when salinity is higher than 24 psu then the mussels should be harvested in august the following year before extreme salinity reduction in september our results are based on climate patterns in thailand to apply the green mussel cultivation model developed in this study to other locations the site specific annual air temperature and rainfall pattern must be incorporated in terms of use this research provides model equations that cover all green mussel cultivation methods farmers can input initial green mussel weights and cultivation times into the model then the mussel growth and production can be simulated over time however real time monitoring data on atmospheric and seawater parameters is required hence to implement reliable tools for the farmer cooperation between government officials and farmers is essential to collect data 3 5 model limitation considering the assumptions of the model developed in this study it can forecast and illustrate changes in green mussel production during climate change events the model also covers different cultivation methods and the farmers can utilize the results to minimize the loss of their income however there are a few model limitations the model did not include the environmental parameters that may influence mussel growth and survival such as seawater pollutants heavy metals and microplastic in green mussel growth model model 1 it was assumed that the mussel lost weight only by excretion other factors a that may influence mussel health were omitted to describe the variation of the mussel production due to other marine pollution crises model parameters that relate to mussel health can be added as a sub model in the future another limitation is that the phytoplankton population does not depend on only light intensity and nutrients but also other marine creatures in this study the phytoplankton model model 2 did not include other marine animals which feed on phytoplankton such as zooplankton fish and marine bivalves the model assumed that in the cultivation area there is only green mussel as the main grazing animal feeding on phytoplankton for more understanding of phytoplankton population in marine ecosystems the variation of phytoplankton by other feeding marine animals should be investigated in the future lastly the model requires site specific equations to interpret the realistic green mussel cultivation status although green mussel density model model 3 and atmospheric model model 4 cover all green mussel cultivation methods seawater and climate data are site specific to apply the model to other areas real time and long term data collection should be carried out before using the model all model equations should be reconsidered to make the model more reliable 4 conclusions the developed model effectively simulated green mussel growth and production under various seawater quality scenarios due to climate change based on the ipcc ar5 climate projection the model simulations indicated that the higher rcp caused the higher rainfall and air temperature this phenomenon resulted in salinity reduction and thermal stress on green mussels with a subsequent decline in mussel production the simulation results demonstrated that in all rcps mussel productions were forecasted to decrease over time however in some scenarios the production does not change much because seawater temperature and salinity are not considered major influencing factors in addition the simulations showed that during climate change events the further the distance from the river mouth the greater the mussel production thermal stress can be reduced by lowering mussel density and enhancing aeration the appropriate seedling and harvest period for thailand is november and august respectively nevertheless it depends on the annual climate pattern in the cultivation area these results can assist farmers in adapting their cultivation plan to avoid extensive mussel mortality caused by climate change finally the developed model can be widely used as a scientific tool for sustainable mariculture credit authorship contribution statement chayarat srisunont investigation writing original draft

24344,this research developed a green mussel cultivation model to assist sustainable production for farmers under climate change events the model consists of 4 sub models mussel growth phytoplankton population the effect of seawater quality on mussel density and the influence of atmospheric parameters on seawater quality the integrated model was constructed by stella software and was calibrated with field observation data the model was employed to simulate the impact of climate change on mussels based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change the fifth assessment report ipcc ar5 projection results demonstrated that mussel production varied due to differences in the available phytoplankton the initial mussel weight the cultivation period the air temperature and the rainfall pattern the model simulations showed that under the greater radiative forcing scenario representative concentration pathways rcps higher rainfall and air temperatures resulted in salinity reduction and thermal stress on green mussels consequently mussel production was forecasted to decline over time the simulations also revealed that during extreme weather events low mussel density high aeration and being far from freshwater discharge could avoid mass mussel mortality using the results of the developed model an appropriate cultivation period can be forecasted however it depends on the site specific climate pattern in each cultivation area results can be employed as a climate change adaptation tool for mussel farmers finally the information can assist other researchers interested in

immune functions and hemocyte production wang et al 2012 leading to mussel mortality wendling et al 2013 a study on blue mussels mytilus edulis by gu et al 2019 demonstrated that under simulation of ocean acidification lowered ph significantly reduced the mussel s clearance rate absorption efficiency respiration rate and growth the mussel s condition index and calcification rate were also lower when ph and salinity were decreased sanders et al 2018 sun et al 2016 however none of these researchers applied their results in field situations where various environmental factors can influence green mussels how mussels respond to alterations of environmental factors due to climate change is still poorly understood mathematical models can be employed to demonstrate the effects of climate change on green mussels and predict production under climate crisis previous models focused on food assimilation and energy transfer maar et al 2015 srisunont and babel 2016 wang et al 2011 they did not include the fluctuation of environmental factors due to climate change such as air temperature amount of rainfall seawater temperature ph and salinity any variation of these parameters may affect the mussel livestock and the food availability to improve the degree of accuracy the green mussel cultivation model should incorporate these climate change stressors moreover the mussels may have altered growth and physiological responses due to differences in seawater quality at cultivation sites to reduce the model s uncertainty data from field must be incorporated in this study stella software was chosen to describe the influence of climate on seawater quality and mussel production it is a graphical model that combines many sub models and successfully illustrates long term and large scale effects stella is a user friendly software that has been used to simulate the interaction between environmental factors and biological components such as fish kipkemboi et al 2007 mwegoha et al 2010 shrimp bala and hossain 2010 mirzaei et al 2019 and bivalves grant et al 2005 the software is easy to implement and simulates a variety of scenarios using this software a system dynamic model that includes atmosphere hydrosphere and biological aspects in green mussel farming can be described lastly site specific planning for sustainable mussel farming can be implemented our hypothesis is that an unstable climate affects the seawater quality and subsequently green mussel growth to overcome upcoming crisis events mussel cultivation can be planned by using environmental modeling therefore the objectives of the study are 1 to develop a dynamic model on green mussel growth incorporating seawater and atmospheric parameters 2 to simulate the impact of climate change on mussel farming and 3 to investigate the best cultivation method location under climate variation finally results provide informative data which can assist mussel farmers to adapt their operations accordingly for sustainable production leading to economic well being 2 material and methods 2 1 the study area the study area was green mussel farms located in the inner gulf of thailand as shown in fig 1 there were three sampling sites due to different cultivation methods first bangkhuntein bkt bangkok 655 299 m e 1 497 465 m n represented the mussel cultivation in the pond system there are three sampling stations at this location a low density of mussels bkt 1 a high density of mussels bkt 2 and a cultivation inside the water canal bkt 3 second maeklong river mouth mk samut songkharm province 612 675 m e 1 475 015 m n represented the mussel cultivation in estuaries three survey locations were selected across a wide area of the river mouth the farthest mussel farm 8 61 km east from the river mouth mk 1 the closest to the river mouth mk 2 and the southern boundary of the river mouth mk 3 lastly sriracha sri chonburi province 708 208 m e 1 458 524 m n was selected for the mussel cultivation in the coastal line area this cultivation site is 26 35 km south of bang pakong estuary there are three sampling stations along the sriracha coastal line area and each station is located about 1 km from the seashore 2 2 field observation green mussel and seawater quality data at each station were collected monthly from january to december 2019 fresh mussel samples were weighed and divided by the farm area to obtain the mussel production kg m2 in situ seawater temperature ph salinity and dissolved oxygen do measurements were conducted using a handheld multi parameter probe ysi 600qs usa seawater samples were analyzed for nutrients concentration as ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite and nitrate nitrogen no2 no3 n phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p and silicate silicon si oh 4 si using a segmented flow traacs 2000 auto analyzer seal analytical usa sensitivity 0 01 μg l 2 3 model development the model assumption is that green mussel growth depends on available phytoplankton and seawater quality which can be affected by the air temperature and rainfall fig 2 the green mussel cultivation model consists of 4 sub models model 1 green mussel growth model 2 phytoplankton population model 3 effect of seawater quality on green mussel density and model 4 influence of atmospheric parameters on seawater quality as shown in fig 3 all models were integrated using stella software the main model is model 1 which evaluates the changes in green mussel size over time total weight and shell length this model requires the phytoplankton quantity from model 2 and the green mussel density from model 3 to interpret the results then the seawater quality employed in model 3 was estimated from model 4 the input parameters are total rainfall air temperature the initial phytoplankton population and the initial green mussel weight the model can then simulate green mussel growth and evaluate climate change s effect on mussel production the details of each model development are described in the following section 2 3 1 model 1 green mussel growth this model assumes that green mussels gain weight over time by food consumption which depends on the filtration rate and the green mussel density as shown in fig 4 they lose weight by excretion which depends on food consumption all model parameters are presented in table 1 a green mussel is a non selective filter feeder it filters seawater and consumes phytoplankton as its main food source rajagopal et al 2006 hence to estimate food consumption the filtration rate and the amount of phytoplankton need to be included in the model as shown in eqs 1 2 1 f c f r m p 0 0071 s l 2 7454 2 f r 10 37 1 e x p 0 028 g d where f c is the actual food consumption rate g indv d f r is green mussel filtration rate l hr g dw tissue tantanasarit et al 2013a m p is the mass of phytoplankton g l s l is green mussel shell length cm g d is green mussel density l g dw tissue mass of phytoplankton m p was calculated by eq 3 3 m p t p 1000 p w where t p is total phytoplankton cell m3 which was obtained from model 2 p w is phytoplankton weight g dw cell the mussel shell length s l c m was converted from the mussel s total flesh weight w w g using eq 4 tantanasarit 2013a 4 s l 2 2573 w w 0 3724 the mussel density g d in this model results from the model 3 simulation as shown in eq 4 g d was presented as a function of surrounding seawater volume l g dw tissue this value was converted from the unit kg m2 gm obtained from model 3 using eq 5 5 g d f a r m d e p t h 1000 0 0702 g m 1000 0 9945 however the mussel does not absorb all food mass it releases feces equal to 16 45 of the total dry weight of the food it consumed srisunont and babel 2015 then the mussel absorption efficiency a e g indv and the mussel gain weight were estimated using eqs 6 7 6 a e 1 e f c 7 g w w w 0 a e where g w is green mussel weight gain g indv e is feces production w w 0 is initial green mussel flesh weight g indv this model defined mussel excretion as respiration loss feces production soluble excretion and food rejection according to gao et al 2008 respiration rate represents oxygen consumption rate v o 2 mg o2 hr indv which is related to the mussel s shell length s l mm this was calculated using eq 8 8 v o 2 0 12 s l 2 23 oxygen consumption was then converted to carbon excretion e c based on a mean respiratory quotient of 0 85 1 mgo2 0 32 mg c smaal and vonck 1997 feces production e is related to food consumption and the release of ammonium nitrogen e n and phosphate phosphorus e p through soluble excretion by mussels srisunont and babel 2015 table 1 food rejection was determined as pseudofaeces production it represents particles released from the mussel without passing the digestion process the mussels have a pre ingestive food selection they reject some matters which have a low food value as pseudofaeces a study on green mussel feeding behavior by wong and cheung 1999 described food rejection rate r r g indv d as a positive function of food consumption f c g indv d finally the mussel s loss weight g l g indv was calculated by eqs 9 10 9 g l w w 0 e r r e c e n e p 10 r r 0 9605 0 7615 f c 2 3 2 model 2 phytoplankton population phytoplankton population was simulated using the model developed by moline et al 2002 the model assumption is that the phytoplankton growth rate depends on light intensity and available nutrients in the aquatic environment light attenuation through the water column over the year can affect phytoplankton abundance according to marra 1978 light intensity i 0 and the in situ light field i z can be predicted using eqs 11 13 11 i 0 t i m a x s i n p i t i m e 365 3 i m i n 12 i z t i 0 t e x p 1 a t t z 13 z m d 2 1 s i n 2 p i t i m e l t where i m a x is the maximum irradiance moles photons m2 d a t t is the attenuation coefficient z is variation of water depth that light can go through m m d is mixed layer depth l t is length of the rotation period which is relative to julian date t i m e then light intensity was employed to evaluate phytoplankton growth p l day 1 using eq 14 neale and richerson 1987 14 p l g t a n h i z i k where g is the growth rate of each phytoplankton group moles cell month i k is the irradiance level at which photosynthesis is saturated in this study marine diatom chaetoceros calcitrans was chosen as a representative of marine phytoplankton because it was found to be the dominant species in the study areas gorcharoenwat 2007 in addition nitrogen concentration was chosen as the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth therefore the phytoplankton growth g was calculated based on the specific growth rate μ m a x day 1 nitrogen content q 0 pmol and nitrogen uptake rate ρ pmol cell h of c calcitrans as shown in eqs 15 16 tantanasarit et al 2013b table 1 15 g μ m a x 1 q 0 ρ 16 ρ ρ m a x s k s s where ρ m a x is the maximum nitrogen uptake rate pmol cell h which was calculated from michaelis menten equation s is nitrogen concentration μm and k s is the half saturation constant μm which is the nutrient concentration at ρ ρ max 2 finally total phytoplankton concentration t p cell m3 was calculated by multiplying phytoplankton growth p l with initial phytoplankton concentration and time 2 3 3 model 3 effect of seawater quality on green mussel density this model assumed that green mussel density g m kg m2 depends on the seawater salinity ph do and nutrient concentration including nh4 n no2 no3 n po4 3 p and si oh 4 si the mussel density was simulated using the multiple linear regressions model developed by srisunont et al 2022 the results demonstrated that each cultivation site had different influencing environmental parameters therefore only significant parameters were employed in the developed model consequently variation in seawater quality influences the mussel density which can be described by site specific model equations see supplementary data table s1 2 3 4 model 4 influence of atmospheric parameters on seawater quality the model assumption is that the atmospheric parameters affect seawater quality air temperature influences seawater temperature rainfall variation affects seawater salinity ph do and nutrient concentration srisunont et al 2022 found that linear and non linear models can describe the correlations between these parameters moreover they also found that at each green mussel cultivation area there was a site specific model equation hence all equations developed by their study were employed in this model see supplementary data table s2 2 3 5 model calibration and sensitivity analysis in this study the model calibration was carried out using observed data of january june 2019 then the model was validated using six months data from july december 2019 for both calibration and validation input variables were air temperature and rainfall which had maximum effect on green mussels for validation the model parameters were used from model calibration green mussel weight gain through time in each cultivation area was simulated using the total rainfall and air temperature from the thai meteorological department tmd in the same period of field observation the initial phytoplankton population and initial green mussel weight were input into the model according to the mussel cultivation method of each mussel farm finally the results from the model simulation were compared with results from the field observation to indicate the accuracy of the developed model by using the coefficient of determination r2 mean squared error mse and root mean squared error rmse the model sensitivity analysis was done to determine parameters that significantly affected green mussel weight this was carried out by varying the inputs air temperature and total rainfall with a relative change of 10 the effects of changing parameters were evaluated in terms of the mussel weight then the sensitivity value s was calculated using eq 17 jørgensen and fath 2011 17 s x 1 x 0 x 0 p 1 p 0 p 0 where x 0 is the model output from the given variable x 1 is the model output from the changing variable p 0 is the value of the model parameter and p 1 is the changing value of the model parameter 2 4 climate change scenarios to simulate the impact of climate change on green mussel cultivation future climate projections from the intergovernmental panel on climate change the fifth assessment report ipcc ar5 ipcc 2013 was employed there are four climate projection scenarios a very low forcing level rcp 2 6 two stabilization scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 and very high greenhouse gas emissions rcp 8 5 in all scenarios temperature and precipitation changes in the 20 year mean difference for the years 2016 2035 2046 2065 and 2081 2100 were input into the green mussel cultivation models see supplementary data tables s3 and s4 values assumed in each scenario are shown in supplementary data table s5 the mussel growth and production under climate variation were forecasted finally the mussel cultivation method including seeding harvesting period and site selection was planned to minimize economic loss 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration results from the model calibration and validation demonstrated that the green mussel cultivation model developed in this study is reliable and able to apply in real condition as shown in fig 5 the calibration and validation were done using different data set and both methods showed high level of the coefficient of determination r2 with low value of mean squared error mse and root mean squared error rmse a dynamic model on green mussel growth demonstrated that at each sampling station there was different mussel growth due to variation in available phytoplankton initial mussel weight cultivation period air temperature and rainfall patterns by comparing results of simulation and observation at each station the trend of mussel growth was found to reveal the accuracy of the model statistical analysis as r2 mse and rmse of each model simulation were computed as seen in figs 6 8 a high level of correlation r2 0 7 and low value of mse and rmse were observed in all simulations except bkt 1 this may be due to the loss of some observation data at this sampling station at this station all the mussels were harvested in september and the farm has been terminated since then this resulted in a low r2 value however the determination of mse and rmse showed lower values and the result from the actual observations followed the same trend as the predictions fig 6 this indicates that the developed models were accurate enough to simulate the mussel growth and evaluate the impact of climate change on the mussel production as shown in table 2 the sensitivity analysis revealed that variations in air temperature and rainfall do not affect much on green mussel weight sensitivity values close to zero however the simulation results showed that the high air temperature caused a loss of mussel s weight at stations bkt 2 and mk 2 at these stations the temperature was a significant factor in green mussel production table s2 at station bkt 2 the mussels were mass cultured in a pond with only 2 5 m depth this condition causes less water circulation subsequently thermal stress can be found when air temperature increases wang et al 2011 in station mk 2 the cultivation area is close to the river mouth seawater at this location is more turbid than other areas a high amount of suspended solids in seawater can accumulate heat from the solar radiation and result in heating the surrounding water chagas and suzuki 2005 consequently this can stress the mussel s survival wendling et al 2013 3 2 model utilization the green mussel cultivation model developed in this study differs from other marine culture models it can predict the effect of climate on green mussels at the actual site and natural farm conditions by setting up the mussel farm condition as initial green mussel weight cultivation time depth of the farm and initial phytoplankton population the equation from table s1 that matches with the farming method pond estuary or coastal can be selected after inputting the actual climate condition as air temperature and total rainfall into the model the mussel growth and production can be interpreted this allows the user to understand how climate change affects green mussel cultivation previous model emphasized a dynamic energy budget deb the model successfully described morphological changes physiological responses and metabolic costs in mussels maar et al 2015 ren and ross 2005 however it did not include the actual changes in seawater due to climate change although the deb model was modified and tried to link with climate change stressors by varying seawater salinity maar et al 2015 the results were from laboratory experiments and only one parameter was employed it was unable to describe actual farm condition which has various influencing parameters hawkins et al 2002 implemented the growth model from a field experiment on the scallop chlamys farreri they found that environmental changes such as seawater temperature seston availability and seston composition significantly affected the scallop feeding ability however their model did not include other influencing environmental factors such as seawater salinity ph and do in realistic conditions changes in these factors can coexist and influence green mussel survival hence with broader climate change stressors and actual farm conditions the model developed in our study describes the effect of climate change on mussel cultivation better in addition our model can report pollution from green mussel cultivation the mussels can pollute seawater through their excretion process they release soluble excretion as ammonium nitrogen e n and phosphate phosphorus e p and release solid excretion as feces production e these values can be interpreted from the model simulation and nutrients leaching from the mussel feces can be calculated using the model equations developed by srisunont and babel 2015 then by multiplying these excretion values with the total number of green mussels per farm calculated from the model the enrichment of nutrients into the marine environment can be estimated table 3 the model output on mussels excretion can assess the impacts of mussel cultivation on nutrient pollution bala and hossain 2010 grant et al 2005 mirzaei et al 2019 srisunont and babel 2016 even though this study did not predict the different expanding industry scenarios results from the model simulation demonstrate the pollution through mussel excretion table 3 the marine culture industry can use this information to further investigate the carrying capacity during green mussel cultivation which will not release nutrients in the water environment beyond the seawater standard therefore besides the prediction of mussel production during climate change events our model can assist farmers with a better understanding of the aquaculture system with possible management strategies for sustainable mussel cultivation and environmentally friendly mariculture 3 3 climate change scenarios to forecast green mussel production gm kg m2 over time the model was simulated based on climate change projections for the years 2016 2035 2046 2065 and 2081 2100 by ipcc ar5 2013 results from the model simulation revealed that mussel production follows the same trend in all rcps figs 9 11 however different cultivation methods result in different effects as shown in fig 9 the simulations of the highest radiative forcing rcp 8 5 revealed that mussel productions in bkt 1 and bkt 3 were similar between years but it changed little in bkt 2 where density of mussels was high mussel production tends to decrease over time in this station this is because the seawater temperature was found to be a significant parameter affecting mussel production in this area and it is related to the air temperature srisunont et al 2022 an increase in air temperature causes thermal stress which reduces immune functions and metabolism in the mussel donaghy and volety 2011 hence when cultured with high density mussels are more sensitive to climate change than mussels cultured with low density in the estuarine areas mussel production was not much different between years figs 9 11 except at mk 2 located close to the maeklong river mouth fig 1 from the model simulation mussel production at mk 2 significantly decreases over time this can be explained by a disturbance of seawater quality due to climate change intense rainfall causes high loading of suspended sediments and organic matter through river freshwater runoff and subsequently decreases light penetration which affects phytoplankton population reduces salinity alosairi et al 2019 do depletion and excessive nutrients park et al 2011 were found therefore when rainfall increases phytoplankton seawater salinity do and nutrients in mk 2 fluctuate more than other stations in coastal areas the model simulation revealed that mussel production was similar in all periods except in sri 1 which tended to decrease over time figs 9 11 this is because sri 1 is closer to bang pakong river mouth than other stations fig 1 subsequently more fluctuations in seawater salinity were found reduction in salinity causes green mussel mortality due to a decreased respiratory rate wendling et al 2013 and immune function wang et al 2012 in addition results also showed that green mussel production in sri 1 was absent during october and november in all periods figs 9 11 this is because in these months the ph of seawater was higher than 9 and the salinity was less than 24 psu which caused green mussel mortality sivalingam 1977 hence when seawater disturbance caused by climate change occurs sri 1 is a more sensitive area than other stations due to a greater salinity reduction comparisons between rcps in each forecasted period demonstrated that greater radiative forcing causes higher air temperatures rainfall and subsequently lower green mussel production figs 9 11 in some cultivation sites mussel production is similar because seawater temperature and salinity do not much fluctuate and they are in the range thus the mussel can perform a normal growth therefore these parameters are not significant factors influencing mussels in those areas as shown in fig 9 green mussel production cultured in ponds with low density bkt 1 differed between 3 periods in the years 2016 2035 the mussel production in rcp 6 0 and 8 5 is lower than other rcps this is because the climate projections in these rcps forecasted an increase in rainfall during this period in the years 2046 2065 mussel production in rcp 6 0 is higher than other rcps this is because less rainfall is forecasted in this scenario finally in the years 2081 2100 mussel production in all rcps is similar due to the same rainfall projection in station bkt 2 there is a slightly lower mussel production during rcp 8 5 this is because air temperatures were forecasted to be higher than other rcps and it is an important parameter affecting mussel production in this station supplementary data table s1 moreover in the years 2081 2100 mussel production decreases from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 this is because air temperatures were forecasted to increase from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 respectively consequently the thermal stress on green mussels increases at higher rcps in station bkt 3 where the green mussels are cultured in a water canal results showed that mussel production was similar in all three periods and all rcps fig 9 this is because in this cultivation method water can effectively flow through the mussel body there is minimal oxygen competition between living organisms moreover it enhances aeration in seawater which can reduce thermal stress wang et al 2011 and provide positive effects on mussel growth and survival sanjayasari and jeffs 2019 hence during climate change events seawater temperature variation is not a significant factor affecting mussel production in this station in estuarine areas a comparison between rcps in each period showed that green mussel production is similar in stations mk 1 and mk 3 which are far from the river mouth fig 10 this is because all seawater parameters in these stations did not vary in all rcps in agreement with alosairi et al 2019 the further the station is from the river mouth the lower the seawater quality fluctuation only at station mk 2 which is closest to the river mouth does mussel production tend to decrease with greater radiative forcing in the years 2016 2035 mussel production in rcp 6 0 was higher than other rcps this is because there was a higher rainfall projection in this scenario this phenomenon can enhance phytoplankton bloom by adding essential nutrients in water through the river runoff meng et al 2017 the abundance of phytoplankton provides sufficient food for green mussel growth the simulation showed that in the years 2046 2065 and 2081 2100 mussel production decreased from rcp 2 6 to 8 5 in these periods it was forecasted by the ipcc 2013 that the air temperature will increase over time along with more radiation subsequently heat from the atmosphere can increase seawater temperatures srisunont et al 2022 and cause thermal stress in green mussels then extensive mortality of the mussel will be found in fig 11 the simulation showed that in each period green mussel production in coastal areas sri did not fluctuate when there was a higher radiative forcing the ipcc 2013 forecasted that air temperatures and rainfall will increase from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 this causes variation in seawater temperatures and salinity srisunont et al 2022 however a decline in mussel production was found only at station sri 1 which is closer to the bang pakong river mouth than other stations fig 1 the simulation revealed that in this area seawater salinity significantly decreases when there is intense rainfall some researchers reported that the reduction in seawater salinity can decrease immune functions respiratory rates and byssus threads in green mussels wang et al 2012 wendling et al 2013 consequently it affects mussel growth and survival 3 4 green mussel cultivation under climate change scenarios and cultivation location method results from all scenarios indicated that coastal areas are the most suitable location to culture green mussels when a fluctuation of atmospheric parameters and seawater quality occurs during climate change events this is because there was a lower salinity fluctuation than in other areas salinity is the most important parameter affecting green mussel production srisunont et al 2022 in addition our results demonstrated that the cultivation areas where salinity is higher than 24 psu with less salinity fluctuations resulted in higher mussel production significant mussel mortality occurs when salinity is lower than 15 psu none of the coastal area stations had salinity lower than 15 psu during the year only in september and october salinity was slightly lower than 24 psu other seawater parameters are in a range that is suitable for green mussel growth results also indicated that the further the distance from the river mouth or watercourse the less fluctuation there was in green mussel production therefore to decrease the impact on mussel production cultivation in coastal areas should be as far from the watercourse as possible an estuary is the next suitable location for green mussel cultivation results from the model simulation showed that seawater salinity in estuarine areas had a higher fluctuation than coastal areas but less than pond areas there was a large salinity reduction at the locations close to the river mouth especially in september and october salinity was lower than 24 psu decreasing to 15 psu at the locations next to the river mouth mk 2 this caused huge mussel mortality and lower mussel production on the other hand in areas far from the river mouth at least 6 km the seawater salinity was higher than 24 psu during the entire year thus the salinity was in the suitable range for green mussel growth and survival roungjai 1999 sivalingam 1977 therefore to culture green mussels in estuarine areas the further the distance from the river mouth the higher the production results indicated that during climate change events the most sensitive cultivation method is a pond this is because in the pond more salinity fluctuation was observed than in other areas during a year most of the time seawater salinity was lower than 24 psu which causes green mussel mortality sivalingam 1977 by lowering its immune functions wang et al 2012 and respiration rates wendling et al 2013 in september and october salinity was found to be lower than 15 psu which causes 100 mussel die off roungjai 1999 however if it is necessary to culture green mussels in a pond this research suggests the density of the mussels should be low and include a water flow through system low mussel density results in less competition for food and oxygen and thus higher mussel production can be achieved water flow provides more dissolved oxygen and food for the green mussels it also helps to release thermal stress when extreme high air temperatures or drought occur therefore it is better to culture in a water canal where water can continuously flow through the mussel however the mussel can be dragged into sediment during a low tide period the cultivation robe should be hung at least 0 5 m above the seafloor during the low tide period besides the location selection cultivation periods are essential for effective green mussel production as previously mentioned seawater salinity is the most influential parameter on green mussels and it should be higher than 15 psu the model simulation showed that salinity significantly decreased in all cultivation areas in september and october therefore farmers should not culture green mussels during these months because large mortalities can occur the cultivation should start in november when salinity is higher than 24 psu then the mussels should be harvested in august the following year before extreme salinity reduction in september our results are based on climate patterns in thailand to apply the green mussel cultivation model developed in this study to other locations the site specific annual air temperature and rainfall pattern must be incorporated in terms of use this research provides model equations that cover all green mussel cultivation methods farmers can input initial green mussel weights and cultivation times into the model then the mussel growth and production can be simulated over time however real time monitoring data on atmospheric and seawater parameters is required hence to implement reliable tools for the farmer cooperation between government officials and farmers is essential to collect data 3 5 model limitation considering the assumptions of the model developed in this study it can forecast and illustrate changes in green mussel production during climate change events the model also covers different cultivation methods and the farmers can utilize the results to minimize the loss of their income however there are a few model limitations the model did not include the environmental parameters that may influence mussel growth and survival such as seawater pollutants heavy metals and microplastic in green mussel growth model model 1 it was assumed that the mussel lost weight only by excretion other factors a that may influence mussel health were omitted to describe the variation of the mussel production due to other marine pollution crises model parameters that relate to mussel health can be added as a sub model in the future another limitation is that the phytoplankton population does not depend on only light intensity and nutrients but also other marine creatures in this study the phytoplankton model model 2 did not include other marine animals which feed on phytoplankton such as zooplankton fish and marine bivalves the model assumed that in the cultivation area there is only green mussel as the main grazing animal feeding on phytoplankton for more understanding of phytoplankton population in marine ecosystems the variation of phytoplankton by other feeding marine animals should be investigated in the future lastly the model requires site specific equations to interpret the realistic green mussel cultivation status although green mussel density model model 3 and atmospheric model model 4 cover all green mussel cultivation methods seawater and climate data are site specific to apply the model to other areas real time and long term data collection should be carried out before using the model all model equations should be reconsidered to make the model more reliable 4 conclusions the developed model effectively simulated green mussel growth and production under various seawater quality scenarios due to climate change based on the ipcc ar5 climate projection the model simulations indicated that the higher rcp caused the higher rainfall and air temperature this phenomenon resulted in salinity reduction and thermal stress on green mussels with a subsequent decline in mussel production the simulation results demonstrated that in all rcps mussel productions were forecasted to decrease over time however in some scenarios the production does not change much because seawater temperature and salinity are not considered major influencing factors in addition the simulations showed that during climate change events the further the distance from the river mouth the greater the mussel production thermal stress can be reduced by lowering mussel density and enhancing aeration the appropriate seedling and harvest period for thailand is november and august respectively nevertheless it depends on the annual climate pattern in the cultivation area these results can assist farmers in adapting their cultivation plan to avoid extensive mussel mortality caused by climate change finally the developed model can be widely used as a scientific tool for sustainable mariculture credit authorship contribution statement chayarat srisunont investigation writing original draft
