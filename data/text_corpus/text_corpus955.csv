4775,this study focuses on the isotopic characterization of cryospheric water and quantification of different components contributing to alaknanda river major tributary of the ganges river system at its place of origin near snout of the satopanth glacier a detailed understanding of various sources flow components contributing to the river is useful for water resource management under changing climate scenario and helpful in risk assessment due to natural hazards in the headwater catchments extensive fieldwork was conducted and water samples were collected from the river snow glacial ice rain lakes and supraglacial channels of satopanth glacier basin during the ablation period of 2017 and analysed for δ18o δ2h and 3h along with electrical conductivity the results helped to establish the spatio temporal and altitudinal variability in isotopic signatures of rain snow and ice in satopanth glacier basin the altitudinal effect in δ18o of pre monsoon and monsoon rainfall is 0 13 and 0 41 per 100 m rise in elevation respectively snow samples show depleting isotopic trend with an altitude effect of 0 43 in δ18o per 100 m rise in altitude however snowpack samples show an enrichment with time indicating post depositional isotopic fractionation the contrasting isotopic gradient in debris covered and non debris covered ice are 0 9 and 3 4 per 100 m rise in elevation respectively these results divulge the spatial as well as temporal variation in cryospheric waters and these variations are used to derive the isotopic signatures of snow melt glacier melt and rain water the results of hydrograph separation show that the snow melt ice melt and rain water contribute about 33 49 and 18 respectively to the discharge of alaknanda river during the ablation period tracer based hydrograph separation indicates that the snow melt contribution dominates in river discharge during the initial ablation period river discharge is a mixture of snow melt glacier melt and rain water during july and august while there is a dominance of glacier melt during end of the ablation period the results of the present study highlight the importance of accounting the spatial and temporal variability in tracer signatures of cryospheric water for quantifying the contributions of snow and ice melt in a river originating from glacerised area keywords environmental isotopes glacier ice

maintaining the hydrological cycle gleick 1996 however the rapid retreat and mass loss of alpine glaciers have been reported by many and projected to continue throughout the twenty first century immerzeel et al 2010 marzeion et al 2012 gardner et al 2013 huss and hock 2015 it would affect multiple societal needs of the population residing in the basin and their livelihood i e agriculture hydropower generation drinking water supplies recreation and industry huss et al 2017 further an increase in population is likely to increase the pressure on water resources across the globe beniston 2003 the himalayas is known as the third pole of the earth since it stores more snow and ice than anywhere else in the world other than the polar regions dyurgerov and meier 2005 the himalayas receives more solid precipitation in comparison to liquid and consequently yields high snow melt contribution to the river discharge peña and nazarala 1987 the major rivers i e indus mekong ganges yangtze brahmaputra and yellow river originating from the himalayan cryospheric system provide a wide range of ecosystem services and it is the basis for the livelihood to 1 5 billion people i e one fifth of the global population rasul and sharma 2016 apart from this the headwater regions of these rivers have an enormous potential for hydropower generation and support social amenities and ecological services among the himalayan rivers the ganga is the most important river supporting 42 of the total indian population mishra 2011 the ganga river forms after the confluence of the bhagirathi and alaknanda rivers at devprayag in the upper ganga basin ugb of the central himalayas bhagirathi river originates from the gangotri glacier and the alaknanda river originates from the satopanth glacier the ganga and its tributaries serve as a lifeline to millions of the people living in the region and are famous for their hindu mythological temples which attract thousands of tourists every year during summer months ugb also comprises of small and large 70 hydro electric projects heps with the capacity of 9033 mw out of which 17 heps 1851 mw have been commissioned 14 heps 2538 mw are under construction and 39 heps 4644 mw are under the planning stage chopra et al 2014 the snow and glacier melt are the important sources that sustain the river during the low flow periods when the demand reaches the peak therefore quantification of the contribution of cryospheric water and its temporal variability in the headwater regions would help the managers to develop sustainable river water management plans for the ganga river basin globally stable isotope of oxygen and hydrogen along with tritium have been used for fingerprinting the source of moisture for precipitation characterization of stream flows and quantification of the various flow components of rivers aizen et al 1996 garzione et al 2000 taylor et al 2001 karim and veizer 2002 pang et al 2006 hren et al 2009 penna et al 2015 zongxing et al 2015 engel et al 2016 penna et al 2017 pu et al 2020 studies reveal that there is a distinct variation in the signature of tracers in cryospheric water across the glacierised basin ohlanders et al 2013 penna et al 2017 zuecco et al 2019 these variations are attributed to various factors such as topography meteorology temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed and precipitation and morphometry size shape depth and tributary of the glacerised basins which do play a crucial role in precipitation and post depositional processes in the cryospheric region jeelani et al 2013 rai et al 2016 2019 the progressive depletion of heavier isotope in rain with altitude as the cloud ascent is often referred as altitude effect clark and fritz 1997 dalai et al 2002 the altitudinal changes in isotopic signatures of contributing agents shed light on the complex hydrology and hydro climatology of the basin which is helpful to accurately quantify the snow and glacier melt contributions to the river originating from glacierized basin or cold mountainous regions in the world penna et al 2017 beria et al 2018 schmieder et al 2018 hence isotopic characterization of various cryospheric water contributing to the river discharge is essential to understand the hydrological behavior of a glacierized basin in the indian himalayas various researchers have used stable δ18o and δ2h and radioisotopes to investigate the source of moisture for precipitation establish the altitude effect isotopically characterize the river and quantify the different components in the river discharge ramesh and sarin 1992 pande et al 2000 dalai et al 2002 kumar et al 2010 kumar et al 2012 2019 jeelani et al 2013 ahluwalia et al 2013 rai et al 2009 2014 2016 2019 jeelani and deshpande 2017 kumar et al 2010 developed a local meteoric water line lmwl for the western himalayan region india and described the altitude effect in δ18o of precipitation ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 per 100 m rise in elevation during the southwest monsoon kumar et al 2012 obtained an altitude effect of 0 14 per 100 m rise in elevation for the δ18o in precipitation occurring over the central kumaun himalayas jeelani et al 2013 estimated the altitude effect in δ18o of precipitation which ranges from 0 23 to 1 2 per 100 m rise in altitude across the kashmir himalayas jeelani and deshpande 2017 studied the isotopic characteristics of precipitation snowpack glacier melt streams and springs in liddar kuthar and bringi basins of jammu and kashmir western himalayas and established an altitude effect of 0 23 to 0 33 and 0 59 to 0 68 per 100 m rise in altitude for the δ18o in snow and ice respectively in areas with altitude ranging from 1400 to 3500 m asl however the isotopic characterization of snow and ice and its altitude effect in the ganga river basin of the central himalayas indian part have not been studied until now various researchers have carried out isotopic studies in the headwater regions of the ganga river basin among these ramesh and sarin 1992 reported the isotopic composition of ganga river for the first time and computed an altitude effect of 0 19 per 100 m rise in altitude for δ18o in the ganga river maurya et al 2011 estimated the contribution of snow and glacier melt to the ganga river at rishikesh as up to 40 rai et al 2009 estimated the contribution of rain derived runoff to the bhagirathi river as about 3 near the snout of the gangotri glacier during the ablation period in another study rai et al 2019 estimated the contributions of snow melt glacier melt and rainfall to the bhagirathi river at the snout of the gangotri glacier as about 59 6 36 8 and 3 6 of the total discharge respectively during the ablation period however in a few other tracer based studies khan et al 2017 computed the glacier melt contribution to the bhagirathi river at devprayag as about 9 10 during the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods kumar et al 2018 described the isotopic signatures of various flow components and interpreted the role of summer and winter precipitation on the melt water of chaurabari glacier in the alaknanda river basin boral et al 2019 estimated the glacier melt fraction to the ganga river at its headwater region and it is found to be in the range of 16 45 most of these studies in the ugb have either considered the snow and glacier components as a single unit to estimate their contribution to the river discharge or have used the isotopic signatures of snow and ice separately based on nijampurkar and bhandari 1984 and rai et al 2009 2019 despite having a number of tracer based studies none of these studies had reported the altitude effect and temporal variation in isotopic characteristics of snow and glacier ice in the ugb niewodnizański et al 1981 and nijampurkar and bhandari 1984 attempted to establish the altitude effect in stable isotopes of snow and ice with limited success therefore there is a need to study the spatio temporal and altitudinal variations in the isotopic signature of cryospheric water and to estimate the contributions of snow ice and rain water in the streams originating from the glacierized catchments of central himalayas the established altitude effect for snow and ice would be useful in various stable isotope based hydrological studies in view of the above concerns an extensive and systematic study was carried out in satopanth glacier basin of ugb in the central himalayas to achieve the following objectives i to define the spatial and temporal variability of isotopes δ18o δ2h and 3h in precipitation ice river lakes and supraglacial channels of satopanth glacier ii to establish the altitude effect in stable isotopic composition of rainfall snow and ice and understand the factors responsible for its variability iii to estimate the contributions of snow melt glacier melt and rain water to the total discharge of alaknanda river near the snout of the satopanth glacier and their temporal variability overall this study will fill the knowledge gap in spatio temporal and altitudinal variability in the isotopic signature of cryospheric water in the central himalayan river basin the outcome of the study would be useful for academicians and managers for the development of sustainable river water management plans for the ganga river basin 2 description of the study area the study is conducted in the satopanth glacier spg basin confined within the topographic coordinates 30 42 30 n to 31 46 15 n latitude and 79 16 15 to 79 28 45 e longitude spanning an area of 73 km2 and altitude range between approximately 3800 m to 7200 m above sea level asl it falls under the headwater region of the upper alaknanda river basin uab in ugb central himalayas india the alaknanda river originates at the snout 3800 m asl of the satopanth glacier it flows through the hindu pilgrimage center badrinath and meets the bhagirathi river at devprayag and after the confluence it is named as ganga river fig 1 a b the alaknanda river system drains through three districts of uttarakhand state namely chamoli tehri and pauri and contributes about 68 to 74 of total discharge of the river ganga at devprayag singh and hasnain 1998 during the summer months the flow of the river is mainly sustained by snow and glacier melt when the demand of water for drinking irrigation and hydropower generation is at its peak three important hydro power projects namely lata tapovan 170 mw capacity tapovan vishnugarh 520 mw capacity and vishnugarh pipalkoti 440 mw capacity are either in operational or constructional phase in the upper alaknanda river basin pant et al 2020 alaknanda catchment is also famous for the hindu mythological temples which attract thousands of tourists every year during the summer months overall the hydrological response of the alaknanda river has a major impact over the ganga river which affects millions of people living in and at the downstream of the basin the satopanth glacier trends towards the northeast direction and is about 13 000 m long and 750 m wide nainwal et al 2015 the satopanth glacier is mainly an avalanche fed glacier with about 0 58 debris cover fraction about 0 18 accumulation area ratio aar and yields a negative mass balance of 2 0 m w e a 1 for the year 2015 laha et al 2017 the glacier in its upper part up to 5380 m is characterized by a steep slope 15 following a general gradient of about 9 only along with the main trunk i e the satopanth glacier there are 5 small glacier tributaries viz luri bamak t1 t2 t3 and t4 in which luri bamak is the most prominent tributary fig 1b the nne to e facing tributary glaciers contributes about 21 whereas the south facing tributary glacier contributes about 25 area of the satopanth glacier nainwal et al 2008 the spg comprised of 19 cirque glaciers mostly at the southern slope and found to be terminating at an altitude of about 5300 m asl the active cirques give origin to cirque streams which cascade near the snout as saudhara waterfall meaning a hundred waterfalls it is also observed that the supraglacial moraines cover the lower half of the glacier and the glacier ice is hardly visible in the ablation zone under surface moraines except on the crevasse faces and near the snout apart from this a large number of mounds supraglacial lakes moraine dammed lake satopanth lake fig 1d e and supraglacial channels sgc are visible over the satopanth glacier in the ablation zone fig 1b the study area is characterized by a temperate climate the mean annual temperature at the snout region varies from 11 08 c maximum and 2 38 c minimum from 2000 to 2008 bhambri et al 2011 two monsoon system i e the southwest monsoon july to september and the western disturbances december to march are responsible for the precipitation in the region the ugb receives about 80 of the precipitation as snowfall during the winter season whereas the indian monsoon precipitation amounts to less than 5 viste and sorteberg 2015 the western disturbances consist of cyclonic storms associated with the mid latitude subtropical westerly jet stream swj the moisture in these storms usually originates over the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean kumar et al 2010 dimri et al 2015 jeelani and deshpande 2017 supplementary fig 1 apart from this recycling of the moisture from local evaporation is also responsible for the precipitation in the region rai et al 2016 jeelani and deshpande 2017 3 material and methods 3 1 data collection and measurement field activities were conducted from march to september 2017 for the physiographic survey and to collect the samples of precipitation ice river supraglacial channels and lakes the samples were collected in pre cleaned high density polyethylene bottles hdpe bottles were filled without air bubbles and tightly capped to prevent evaporation and exchange with the atmospheric moisture alaknanda river water samples were collected manually at the snout of the satopanth glacier n 122 on daily basis 09 00 am for stable isotope analysis and on 10 daily bases for tritium analysis precipitation rain samples n 59 were collected on an event basis and the amount of rain was recorded according to procedures followed by the indian metrological department imd daily mean air and water temperatures were also measured using automatic temperature loggers installed near the snout for establishing the altitude effect of stable isotopes in rain rainwater samples were also collected from four additional stations located at low altitudes namely srinagar 551 m asl n 32 karanprayag 774 m asl n 26 joshimath 1900 m asl n 31 and benakuli 2750 m asl n 28 in the alaknanda river basin fig 1a 25 snow samples elevation ranging between 1900 and 4700 m asl were collected during different field visits from february to august in the first phase 8 fresh snow samples were collected between the elevation range of 1900 to 3500 m asl during the winter months february march the area above 3500 m asl elevation was inaccessible due to adverse climatic and topographic conditions in the month of february to march in the second phase 17 snow samples were collected from the high altitude 3500 to 4700 m asl winter december to april accumulated snowpack during the field visits june to august in the basin when the area was accessible for sampling the area above the elevation of 4700 m asl in the basin is inaccessible throughout the year due to the presence of wide crevasses and steep slopes for obtaining the representative samples of ice n 40 glacial ice was collected from the debris covered ice dci and non debris covered ice ndci areas up to an altitude of 4700 m asl moreover ice samples were also collected from two vertical profiles of the glacier ice near the snout of the satopanth glacier to study the depth wise isotopic variations the samples snow and ice were packed in pre cleaned zip locked plastic bags and allowed them to melt naturally in the field and immediately transferred to hdpe bottles for isotopic measurements apart from this 14 water samples from the supraglacial channels sgc and 17 lake water samples were also collected from different elevations water samples from two types of lake i e supraglacial lake sgl at different elevations and moraine dammed lake satopanth mdl satopanth lake located at an altitude of 4367 m asl fig 1d e were collected during the ablation period the isotopic analyses of water samples were performed at isotope hydrology laboratory national institute of hydrology roorkee india the collected samples were analysed for stable isotopic ratio of hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o using dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer following pt h2 and co2 equilibration methods epstein and mayeda 1953 brenninkmeijer and morrison 1987 the steps and standards involved in the measurements of δ2h and δ18o were systematically described by rai et al 2009 2016 and 2019 the typical instrumental precision based on 10 repeated measurements of each sample was found to be 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively an ultra low level liquid scintillation counter ullsc was used in the measurement of tritium 3h tritium is an excellent dating tool for studying the timescales of physical processes in hydrologic systems in the range of years to decades stewart and morgenstern 2016 first of all 500 ml of pre distilled water sample was electrolytically enriched using a tritium enrichment unit in order to achieve maximum fractionation or enrichment of hto tritium water and the resultant volume was reduced to 25 ml these enriched samples were again distilled and mixed with an organic scintillator optiphase hisafe 3 in a 20 ml scintillation vial the sample vials were measured for 400 min using the ullsc the minimum detectable level of the instrument for the measurement of enriched sample is 0 6 tu which is within the level of 2σ error 95 confidence level rai et al 2019 the ec of the samples were measured insitu using hq40d portable ph and conductivity meter range 0 01 µs cm 200

quantifies the surplus deuterium with respect to the craig s global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and it depends upon the surface temperature wind speed etc gat 1983 clark and fritz 1997 back trajectory analysis was carried out using hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectories hysplit model draxler and hess 1998 bershaw et al 2012 draxler and rolph 2016 to identify the probable moisture source region contributing to the precipitation in spg for understanding the climatic conditions during the formation of ice the age of the glacier snout was estimated the physical characteristics of the glacierized system were used to calculate the approximate age of the ice at the snout using the following equation 1 age o f t h e i c e a t t h e s n o u t l e n g t h o f t h

the tracer genereux and hooper 1998 a three component mixing hydrograph separation model using two tracers δ18o and electrical conductivity ec was used to estimate the relative contributions of glacier melt snow melt and rain water to the river discharge during the ablation period the mass balance model is used in the present day with the following assumptions i the tracer behaves conservatively ii the mixing end members contributing sources have constant tracer concentrations or their variations are known and can be accounted iii the tracer concentrations are significantly distinct for each component iv contributions from other sources eg vadose zone water are negligible the ec was preferred over other tracers in the three component hydrograph separation model due to its lower uncertainty in estimating the event rain water and pre event water fractions penna et al 2015 engel et al 2016 rai et al 2019 attempts were made to collect water samples from the various flow components with high spatial and temporal resolution to reduce the level of uncertainty in the data and results the monthly average of daily isotope δ18o and ec data of the river was used for the hydrograph separation whereas the monthly weighted average values of rainwater were considered as the tracer signatures of rain derived runoff similarly the tracer signatures of snow and ice were determined using the monthly average values of the collected snow and ice samples the three flow components to the river was computed using the water and tracer conservation equations the water balance equation is given by 2 gm sm r t where gm sm r and t represent the glacier melt snow melt rain water and the total river flow in terms of fraction of the total river flow the equation 2 can be written as 3 gm sm r 1 where gm sm and r denotes the fraction of the river flow due to glacier melt snow melt and rain water respectively the tracer balance equations for δ18o and ec are given by 4 gm δgm sm δsm sr δr δt 5 gm egm sm esm sr er et δt δgm δsm and δr is the δ18o values of river glacier melt snow melt and rain water e denotes the ec of various flow components respectively by solving the equation 3 4 and 5 for the three unknowns the contributions of gm sm and sr can be obtained from 6 s r δ t δ g m e s m e g m δ s m δ g m e t e g m δ s r δ g m e s m e g m δ s m δ g m e s r e g m 100 7

in the estimation of tracer signatures of the end members statistical uncertainty and the violations of the underlying assumptions model uncertainty joerin et al 2002 based on numerical modeling studies jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 shown that the hydrodynamic mixing processes can influence the estimates of flow components and introduces uncertainty in tracer based hydrograph separation however liggett et al 2014 opined that the best way to accurately model the surface subsurface solute exchange in the real world is still not clear therefore in the absence of other accurate methods available for the hydrograph separation the tracer mixing concept with the above assumptions are still valid to obtain a first hand estimate of the flow components as evidenced in the recent studies chen et al 2019 he et al 2019 in the present study the model uncertainty in the hydrograph separation is ignored and only the statistical uncertainty is estimated by accounting the errors in the results klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the data was statistically analysed and found to be normally distributed and hence 1 standard deviation sd method was applied for the uncertainty analysis carey and quinton 2005 engel et al 2016 penna et al 2017 therefore the uncertainty in the three component mixing model was determined by varying the tracer signatures by 1 sd and subsequently the minimum and maximum contributions are reported 4 results 4 1 meteorological characteristics of the study area the daily mean air temperature near the snout 3800 m asl of spg ranges from 3 9 c to

of 16 4 for understanding the vertical variation in stable isotopic composition of glacier ice ice samples were collected along two profiles at a depth interval of 10 m located at an altitude of 3900 m asl facing towards the east and north directions fig 5 b c the δ18o values for the east facing vertical ice profile are 10 5 14 9 and 14 4 representing surface middle and bottom ice respectively similarly δ18o values for north facing ice profile for surface middle and bottom ice are 13 0 8 2 and 13 1 respectively these results reveal the vertical heterogeneity in the isotopic composition of ice 4 2 4 isotopic characteristics of supraglacial channels and lakes the δ18o and δ2h of samples from the supraglacial channels sgc range between 16 9 to 9 3 average 13 1 and 116 3 to 56 7 average 86

the monthly data show that δ18o and δ2h values of the river water are relatively enriched in june in comparison to other months tables 1 2 furthermore the trend in the temporal variations of δ18o and

gauging site near the snout of the satopanth glacier varies from 0 7 to 23 with an average 11 during monsoon the variation of d excess is between 7 and 20 5 average 9 8 it is close to the average value of world precipitation 10 craig 1961 and indian precipitation 10 kumar et al 2012 fig 2 the d excess value of rainfall during the pre monsoon period varies from 7 2 to 23 3 with an average of 15 the d excess value of snow varies from 11 6 to 22 average 15 9 and ice varies from 12 2 to 20 8 with a mean value of 17 2 similarly the d excess of samples from sgc varies between 16 3 and 21 9 average 18 7 and the d excess of lake water varies between 10 0 to 23 7 average 16 3 the d excess value of river water varies from 11 6 to 21 2 average 16 45 the temporal variation in d excess of river water is given by the equation d excess 0 038 time in days 1650 r2 0 47 n 121 it shows that the d excess of river water declines as the ablation period advances 4 5 variation of tritium concentration measured tritium values in rain snow ice and lakes show marked spatial and temporal variations across the study area the tritium value of rain varies from 4 3 to 7 0 tu n 4 and snow from 3 8 to 6 5 tu n 5 tritium values of ice n 7 vary from 0 1 to 3 6 tu out of the seven ice samples five show tritium values of 1tu suggesting that the ice is older than 50 years rai et al 2019 joshi et al 2018 the tritium value of river water varies from 2 3 to 6 3 tu n 7 and shows a decreasing trend from june to september fig 7 a three lake samples belonging to different locations show tritium values 2 8 tu 8 4 tu and 13 6 tu fig 7b the higher tritium value 13 6 tu belongs to mdl 4367 m asl and low tritium value 2 8 tu belongs to sgl 4073 m asl 4 6 variation in electrical conductivity ec the electrical conductivity ec of rain and snow are in the range of 2 2 to 58 7µs cm average 21 8 µs cm and 15 0 to 42 5 µs cm average 33 4 µs cm respectively the ec of ice varies from of 11 7 to 127 2 µs cm with a mean value of 67 2 µs cm whereas the sgc and lake samples have ec ranging between 2 8 and 24 9 µs cm average 7 8 µs cm and 5 6 to 49 0 µs cm average 18 8 µs cm respectively the ec of river water ranges from 31 3 to 70 2 µs cm average 48 8 µs cm the average ec of alaknanda river during the months of june july august and september are 48 4 39 8 47 3 and 59 2 µs cm respectively 4 7 altitude effect in rain snow ice and sgc the amount weighted monthly δ18o of precipitation is plotted against the respective elevation of the area fig 8 a and the lapse rate altitude effect in δ18o of precipitation is estimated as 0 13 r2 0 95 and 0 41 r2 0 98 per 100 m rise in elevation for the pre monsoon and monsoon periods respectively table 7 the estimated altitude effect in δ18o of rain during june july august and september months are 0 13 0 36 0 39 and 0 49 per 100 m rise in elevation respectively snow samples collected during may and june between the altitudes 3200 to 4650 m asl were analysed to establish the altitude effect in the basin the lapse rate in δ18o of snow in the study area is 0 43 per 100 m rise in altitude n 16 r2 0 50 the estimated monthly altitude effect in snow for may and june are 0 5 n 9 r2 0 6 and 0 4 n 9 r2 0 6 per 100 m rise respectively fig 8b two contrasting isotopic δ18o lapse rate patterns are observed for dci and ndci area of the glacier a negative δ18o lapse rate of 0 8 per 100 m rise is observed in dci area whereas a positive lapse rate of 3 4 per 100 m rise in elevation is observed for ndci fig 8a table 7 in fig 8a the sgc samples are falling in three different groups viz a b and c the group a belongs to samples collected during the pre monsoon period and they show a trend towards the stable isotopic signature of snow the group b samples collected during july to october are having highly depleted δ18o values and fall close to the dci samples whereas group c samples belong to monsoon period and their isotopic values matches with those of ndci and snow samples these different groups are evolved because of the contrasting altitude effects in snow and ice which vary during the pre monsoon and monsoon periods the sgc water samples have δ18o lapse rates of 1 2 r2 0 65 and 0 6 r2 0 46 per 100 m rise in altitude during the pre monsoon and monsoon periods respectively fig 8c 4 8 quantification of snow melt glacier melt and rain water contributions to the total flow of alaknanda river three component based hydrograph separation model eq 6 7 and 8 was used to quantify the relative contributions of glacier melt snow melt and surface runoff to the total flow of alaknanda river near the snout of the satopanth glacier the monthly average δ18o of the end members such as snow ice and rain water vary between 8 4 to 6 5 13 3 to 17 1 and 23 8 to 5 0 respectively the ec of snow ice and rain water vary between 32 and 34 µs cm 55 to 80 µs cm and 8 to 28 µs cm respectively the estimated contributions of snow melt and glacier melt to the river during the ablation period are found to be varying between 27 and 36 average 32 and 39 to 56 average 49 respectively table 6 fig 9 c moreover the rain water contribution ranges between 12 and 26 average 18 the computed snow and ice melt contributions to the sgc using a two component hydrograph separation model reveals that the snow and ice melt fractions are 64 and 36 in group a 3 and 97 in group b and 24 and 76 in group c samples respectively fig 8a the uncertainty associated with the minimum and maximum contributions of ice melt snow melt and surface runoff are 46 to 54 30 to 33 and 18 to 27 respectively table 6 5 discussion 5 1 spatio temporal variation in isotopic composition of river water and its sources the trend analysis of both event based and monthly rainfall data of the upper alaknanda river basin indicates that the amount of rainfall is declining with increasing elevation except at srinagar where the valley gets more widened with respect to the other locations basistha et al 2008 the declining trend of precipitation with altitude indicates declining moisture content because of the orographic barriers and climatic conditions singh and kumar 1997 basistha et al 2008 significant temporal variation in stable isotopic composition of rainfall is observed at the gauging site near the snout of the satopanth glacier during the study period figs 2 6 the slope and y intercept of the regression line between δ18o and δ2h of monsoon samples eq 11 are very close to the north indian meteoric water line nimwl kumar et al 2010 and the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 1993 which confirms that the indian summer monsoon ism contributes to the precipitation in the study area it also corroborates the findings of the earlier researchers kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2014 the higher slope and y intercept of the regression line between δ18o and δ2h of the pre monsoon samples eq 10 compared to that of the nimwl and the gmwl indicates the recycling of the moisture from local evaporation rai et al 2016 jeelani and deshpande 2017 about 37 of the total rain samples mainly from june and the first week of july shows high d excess 12 value suggesting the vapor source through local recycling jeelani and deshpande 2017 whereas the d excess of rain water around 10 during july to september indicates the moisture source in the study area brought from the ism breitenbach et al 2010 jeelani and deshpande 2017 it indicates that the ism reaches the study area during the first or second week of july the lower slope 7 72 and y intercept 4 64 along with lower d excess 9 in august indicate evaporation of falling raindrops due to scanty rainfall events table 4 kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2014 the correlation analysis between temperature minimum maximum and mean and δ18o show a significant relationship p 0 01 in all the three cases table 5 however there is a good correlation between δ18o and maximum temperature in comparison to the minimum and average temperature a similar trend of good correlation between δ18o and maximum temperature was also observed by siegenthaler and matter 1983 and rozanski et al 1993 the snow samples show a relatively higher y intercept in comparison to that of nimwl and the gmwl the higher y intercept is due to its source vapour from the mediterranean sea or due to recycled moisture and lower condensation temperature jeelani and deshpande 2017 the backward wind trajectory analysis at the satopanth glacier basin also indicates the influence of western disturbance during winter december january february and post monsoon october november periods supplementary fig 1 despite being the same source the higher slope y intercept and d excess of fresh snow samples 3500 m asl in comparison to snowpack 3500 m asl show spatial variability in the isotopic signatures isotope data reveals that the melt water from the snowpack is isotopically more enriched than the pre melt snow due to secondary fractionation or post depositional isotopic fractionation or event based variability in moisture source ohlanders et al 2013 pu et al 2020 it has been observed that initially the snow pack becomes isothermally and isotopically homogeneous due to metamorphism and infiltration of rainfall and snow melt unnikrishna et al 2002 as the ablation period advances there is a significant change in the snow of the snowpack and it becomes isotopically heavier with time stichler 1987 the possible key factors influencing these change in the stable isotopic composition of snow can either be due to the atmospheric influence after deposition or post depositional changes which depend on the topography of the study area sublimation metamorphism of snow crystals evaporation and isotopically enriched precipitation arnason 1970 raben and theakstone 1994 aizen et al 1996 stichler 1987 sokratov and golubev 2009 apart from that the contact time between the snow grains and liquid phases is longer at the lower altitude than at the higher altitude which causes the isotopic enrichment in snowpack pang et al 2006 the slope and y intercept of the regression equation eq 13 for ice is close to that of the snow eq 12 however the depleted stable isotopic composition of ice indicates a cooler climatic condition during the formation of ice compared to the present day climatic scenarios or post depositional metamorphism pang et al 2006 pu et al 2020 the ice samples collected along the two profiles facing towards the east and north directions fig 5 b c show significant vertical variation in the isotopic values it also indicates variability in climatic condition during the precipitation of snow and formation of ice the dynamic nature of ice in the himalayas might be another important factor responsible for the variation in the stable isotopic composition of glacial ice in this process the ice is formed in the accumulation zone at higher altitudes i e above the snowline over the time period ranging from years to decades this ice further slides down slowly to the lower altitudes in the form of avalanches or via glacier movement this process might be responsible for the spatial variability in the isotopic signature of the glacial ice overall it appears that the stable isotopic composition of snow and ice are controlled by climatic conditions altitude effect debris and non debris cover glacier dynamics and post depositional processes therefore it is difficult to accurately estimate the snow melt and ice melt contributions to a glacerised river without considering the spatial and temporal variability in the tracer signatures of snow and ice temporal depletion in the stable isotopic composition of mdl water indicates an increase in the contribution of snow melt from the snow located at higher ridges as the ablation period advances the presence of high tritium content 13 6 tu in mdl also corroborates the stable isotope results that the lake is getting more contribution from the melting of fresh snow this is also confirmed by the changes in the water level of mdl from june to september 2017 fig 1 d e higher 3h content is expected in the higher altitude 6000 8000 m elevation regions due to riming growth in deep convective up draughts which includes entrained moisture compared to near surface 3h content 5 tu aggarwal et al 2016 a similar significant temporal variation in the stable isotopes has been observed in sgc at the beginning of the ablation period june the sgc samples are isotopically enriched in comparison to the later months september it reveals that as the ablation period advances the snow and ice melt fractions from higher altitudes contribute in greater amounts to sgc table 6 fig 7a shows the temporal variations in tritium and δ18o of river water as the ablation season advances the 3h value of river water decreases along with the depletion of δ18o the presence of higher tritium and comparatively enriched δ18o in the river during the initial periods of the ablation season i e in the month of june indicates a higher contribution of snow melt to the river lower tritium and depleted δ18o values during august and september months indicate the dominance of ice contribution to the river which is also confirmed by the results of hydrograph separation table 6 however an ambiguity exists in the observed increase in tritium and enrichment in δ18o on 20th september 2017 that may be due to the rise in the atmospheric temperature and subsequent increase in contribution of the melt water from high altitude snow and ice which is relatively enriched in stable isotopic values further the observed most depleted stable isotopic value of the river on 30 september 2017 could be because of the heavy rainfall of 115 mm between 20th and 30th september which bears a depleted signature due to amount effect fig 6 the relation between 3h and δ18o fig 7b shows that the three rain samples collected during various months are having minor variation in tritium values in the range of 4 3 to 6 9 tu but there is a significant variation in δ18o 4 6 to 22 7 indicating temporal variability in the tracer signatures whereas the lake water samples from three different altitudes show almost similar δ18o values but having significantly different 3h values supporting the spatial variability in tracer signatures 5 2 altitude effect the established altitude effect in rain during different months and seasons indicate a decrease in the condensation temperature with altitude leading to the depletion of heavier isotopes jeelani 2016 in general the altitudinal lapse rate observed in the study area is more or less similar to that of the globally reported altitude effect in rainfall which varies from 0 15 to 0 5 for δ18o for every 100 m increase in elevation in different parts of the world dansgaard 1964 poage and chamberlain 2001 rai et al 2014 rozanski and araguás araguás 1995 siegenthaler and matter 1983 jeelani and deshpande 2017 the relatively high altitude effect observed in the stable isotopic composition of snowpack samples could be because of the increased fractionation between the liquid and the vapour phases at lower temperatures ingraham and criss 1998 the estimated altitude effect in the snowpack samples from the study area are within the range of the altitude effect in snowpack established by other researchers moser and stichler 1970 1974 wushiki 1977 niewodnizański et al 1981 grabczak et al 1983 nijampurkar and bhandari 1984 kang et al 2002 he et al 2006 dietermann and weiler 2013 jeelani and deshpande 2017 table 8 this variability in the isotopic characteristics of the snowpack would certainly affect the stable isotopic composition of the melt water as the ablation period advances therefore the study of spatial variability in the isotopic signature of snow and snow pack plays an important role in estimating the contribution of snow melt in the river water a significant correlation is observed between the δ18o of glacial ice and the corresponding elevation of the area fig 9a table 7 however two contrasting isotopic patterns are observed for dci and ndci areas of the glacier a negative lapse rate of 0 8 in δ18o per 100 m rise in elevation in dci area and a positive lapse rate of 3 4 in δ18o per 100 m rise in elevation for ndci the possible reasons behind the contrasting altitude effect may be due to the i role of debris in the melting of the ice ii time period of formation of the ice 5 2 1 role of debris cover on the melting of glacial ice as discussed above a disparity in lapse rate of δ18o with elevation is observed for the debris and non debris covered areas of the satopanth glacier studies reveal that the debris cover reduces the ice melting and hence show a delayed adjustment to the glacier length scherler et al 2011 mölg et al 2019 the debris cover act as an insulator and retards the ablation of the ice surface when its thickness exceeds the critical thickness for a given glacier and low melting takes place from dci during mid of the ablation period reznichenko et al 2010 the dci layer has a strong insulating effect with a factor of 3 to 10 times higher than that of the ndci layer mihalcea et al 2006 a thicker debris cover efficiently protects the ice surface from melting while a thin debris zone increases the melting of glacial ice due to lower albedo collier et al 2014 patel et al 2016 shah et al 2019 according to shah et al 2019 the average ablation rate of satopanth glacier in the ndci and dci areas are 3 19 cm day and 1 25 cm day respectively the high solar radiation causes more evaporation from the ice surface leading to isotopic enrichment and a reverse altitude effect he et al 2006 it indicates that the debris cover is one of the significant factors controlling the spatial variability in the ablation rate and the stable isotopic signatures of ice in the satopanth glacier 5 2 2 role of climatic conditions on the isotopic variability in glacial ice of the satopanth glacier another important factor that influences the change in the altitude effect in stable isotopes of glacial ice is the climatic conditions prevailed during its formation the stable isotopic composition of ice formed on the high altitude mountains provides information on the fluctuations of climatic conditions in the past niewodnizański et al 1981 hou et al 2019 however percolation processes and melting of ice can sometimes obscure the chemical isotopic signatures in the ice column at the end of snow drifting the evaporation and sublimation processes can also alter the isotopic composition of ice despite such complications the accumulation areas of certain temperate glaciers are very well known to preserve the climatic history of that region in the form of their isotopic signatures arnason 1970 which can be used to trace the time period of the formation of ice nijampurkar and bhandari 1984 had attempted to date the himalayan glaciers and suggested that the ice in the temperate glaciers are relatively young and the maximum age is up to 2000 years nijampurkar and rao 1993 and nijampurkar et al 2002a b dated the age of ice collected from the snout of the himalayan glaciers i e nehnar chota shigri dokriani bamak gara gorgarang and changme khangpu glaciers using 32si isotope dating technique table 9 nijampurkar et al 2002a had also reported the physical characteristics glacier length and ice flow velocity of these glaciers the age of glaciers calculated using eq 1 shows a close resemblance to those estimated using 32si dating by nijampurkar et al 1993 nijampurkar et al 2002a table 9 according to laha et al 2018 the length of the satopanth glacier is 12 43 km and its mean surface velocity value is 27 8 1 6 ma 1 considering these values the estimated age using eq 1 of the ice at the snout of the satopanth glacier is around 447 25 years i e 1572 25 ad which is somewhere in the mid of the little ice age lia nainwal et al 2007 have also reported that conical heaps in the neighborhood of the present day snout at spg are most possibly associated with the lia the lia is widely varying from the period ce 1400 1900 which is also notable for the worldwide glacier expansion grove 2004 weissbach et al 2016 kennedy and lindsey 2015 the maximum depletion in stable isotopic composition of ice is seen at around 4500 m asl elevation hence the age of ice at this elevation is calculated using eg 1 it is found to be nearly around 1800 ce which represents the coolest time period of lia it is further supported by the isotopic composition of ice core samples collected from tibetan glaciers where the most depleted isotopic signature is having an age of around 1810 ce thompson et al 2000 similarly other studies viz north facing dokriani glacier indicates lia maximum during ce 1692 chaujar 2006 whereas the south facing chorabari glacier shows its lia maximum during ce 1748 chaujar 2009 in the central himalayan region of the upper ganga basin the stable isotopic composition of ice at the snout of the glacier is relatively enriched compared to those at the 4500 m asl elevation and its age as estimated above is 1572 25 ad the relatively enriched isotopic composition of the ice at the snout of the glacier implies that it is formed in a relatively warmer period in the post lia the temperature during 1750 1850 ce was the lowest during lia which was cooler in comparison to those of 1572 ce studies reveal that the lia was having comparatively wetter environment conditions in central himalayas and the post lia 1880 ce was drier than lia and hence having isotopically enriched signatures sanwal et al 2013 this may be one of the reasons behind the change in altitude effect in the ice above 4500 m asl 5 3 monthly contributions of snow melt ice melt and rain water to the total discharge of alaknanda river the δ18o versus d excess plot fig 10 shows that the river samples fall well within the range of mixing between the three primary components i e snow ice and rain except a few samples of august and september months however the outliers in the plot fig 10 mostly belong to extreme rainfall events wherein the amount of rainfall was high causing depletion in stable isotopic composition amount effect the outliers also indicate the contributions of snow and ice melt from high altitude regions i e above 4700 m elevation from where the samples could not be collected because of the adverse climatic and topographic conditions this specifies the importance of sampling from high altitude areas in order to precisely quantify the contributions of different components the temporal variation in stable isotopic signatures fig 10 clearly indicate that the δ18o and d excess values of the river are in close proximity to the isotopic signatures of snow during the months of june and july while from august onwards the stable isotopic values of the river resemble close to that of the ice the isotope based hydrograph separation helped to quantify the contributions of the various flow components i e snow ice and rain water to the river discharge the spatio temporal variability in tracer δ18o and ec signatures has been used to characterize the end members contributing to the river flow fig 9 a b as the ablation period advances the δ18o values of ice show a characteristic depleted isotopic trend due to increased contribution from the high altitude areas whereas the snow samples show a trend of isotopic enrichment due to increased contribution from the winter accumulated snowpack areas the ec of ice and snow show a declining trend between june and july and further it increases this decrease in ec is due to the dilution effect during the high melting period similar observations were noted by maurya et al 2011 and penna et al 2017 that when there is an increase in the discharge the ec of the river water decreases the results of hydrograph separation show that the fraction of snow melt contribution is decreasing from june to september whereas in contrast the glacier melt contribution is increasing during this period fig 9c snow melt contribution was relatively lower about 36 during june and july in comparison to august and september whereas ice contributes about 43 to the river discharge during the months of june and july during the initial ablation period i e april and may the glacier body remains covered by snow and hence the melting of glacial ice is minimum results of glaciological mass balance studies also reveal that the maximum loss of glacier mass of satopanth glacier occurred at the end of the ablation period shah et al 2019 snow and ice melt contributions to the alaknanda river near the snout of the satopanth glacier snow melt 33 and glacier melt 49 are more or less similar to that of the bhagirathi river near the snout of the gangotri glacier i e snow melt 36 8 and glacier melt 59 6 as estimated by rai et al 2019 the rain water contribution to the alaknanda river average 19 is higher in comparison to bhagirathi river i e 3 6 due to high amount of rainfall occurring in the satopanth glacier basin the maximum and minimum contributions after 1 sd from all the three components are higher during the initial ablation period june and lower at the end of the ablation period september table 6 the relatively higher uncertainty in the estimates of hydrograph components during the initial period june is due to the large snow cover area in varying altitudes hence inducing large isotopic variability in the meltwater during this period and comparatively less snow and ice samples collected from the high altitudes 4700 m because of inaccessibility to the region secondly the large spatial variation in the tracer signatures of glacial ice throughout the basin also causes uncertainty in the estimates of hydrograph components the high uncertainty in the mass balance estimates of various hydrograph components of a river during the initial flow periods is also reported by penna et al 2017 overall the tracer based results show that the melting of snow and glaciers of the himalayan region play an important role in the sustainability of himalayan rivers the loss in glacial ice and reduction in the snowfall will reduce the availability of water in the himalayan region and hence better water management plans are required to sustain the river water flow during the dry lean flow period 6 conclusion sampling and data collection for isotopic studies at such high elevations and hard topographic terrains are extremely challenging but play a key role in understanding the hydrological processes of a glacierized system therefore attempts have been made to substantiate our observations and provide new insight into the isotopic characterization of cryospheric water in a glacierized basin the main highlights of the results are summarized as follows the stable isotopic composition of rain snow ice lakes and supraglacial channels show temporal and altitudinal variations interpretation of stable isotopic results of precipitation indicates that a the moisture source for precipitation in the study area is mainly from the southwest monsoon b recycled local moisture is the source for pre monsoon rains the estimated altitudinal effect in δ18o of rain is 0 13 and 0 41 per 100 m rise in elevation during the pre monsoon and monsoon periods respectively the altitude effect in the δ18o of snow is of the order of 0 43 per 100 m rise in elevation the snowpack samples show enrichment in stable isotopic signatures due to post depositional isotopic fractionation altitude effect in the δ18o of glacial ice shows contrasting patterns in debris covered ice dci and non debris covered ice ndci areas the observed isotopic δ18o gradient in dci 4500 m asl and ndci 4500 m asl is 0 9 and 3 4 per 100 m rise in elevation respectively the change in the isotopic gradient indicates a complexity involved due to the change in the climatic conditions during the formation of ice in the past the vertical variation in stable isotopic composition of ice from the vertical face of the glacier indicates glacier dynamics and different climatic conditions during the stratification of ice the relatively depleted isotopic composition of ice in the satopanth glacier compared to that of the snow indicates that the ice was formed during the little ice age lia a more detailed isotopic analysis would be required to exactly define the age of the formation of glacial ice the estimated contributions of snow melt glacier melt and rain water using the mass balance approach to the discharge of alaknanda river near the snout of satopanth glacier during the ablation period of 2017 are 33 49 and 18 respectively this indicates that the snow and ice melts 82 are the major source for the alaknanda river near the snout which stresses the strategic importance of glacial melt in rivers overall the results of the study reveal that the melting of snow and glaciers play an important role to sustain the river flow in the headwater region of the himalayas also the study highlights

4775,this study focuses on the isotopic characterization of cryospheric water and quantification of different components contributing to alaknanda river major tributary of the ganges river system at its place of origin near snout of the satopanth glacier a detailed understanding of various sources flow components contributing to the river is useful for water resource management under changing climate scenario and helpful in risk assessment due to natural hazards in the headwater catchments extensive fieldwork was conducted and water samples were collected from the river snow glacial ice rain lakes and supraglacial channels of satopanth glacier basin during the ablation period of 2017 and analysed for δ18o δ2h and 3h along with electrical conductivity the results helped to establish the spatio temporal and altitudinal variability in isotopic signatures of rain snow and ice in satopanth glacier basin the altitudinal effect in δ18o of pre monsoon and monsoon rainfall is 0 13 and 0 41 per 100 m rise in elevation respectively snow samples show depleting isotopic trend with an altitude effect of 0 43 in δ18o per 100 m rise in altitude however snowpack samples show an enrichment with time indicating post depositional isotopic fractionation the contrasting isotopic gradient in debris covered and non debris covered ice are 0 9 and 3 4 per 100 m rise in elevation respectively these results divulge the spatial as well as temporal variation in cryospheric waters and these variations are used to derive the isotopic signatures of snow melt glacier melt and rain water the results of hydrograph separation show that the snow melt ice melt and rain water contribute about 33 49 and 18 respectively to the discharge of alaknanda river during the ablation period tracer based hydrograph separation indicates that the snow melt contribution dominates in river discharge during the initial ablation period river discharge is a mixture of snow melt glacier melt and rain water during july and august while there is a dominance of glacier melt during end of the ablation period the results of the present study highlight the importance of accounting the spatial and temporal variability in tracer signatures of cryospheric water for quantifying the contributions of snow and ice melt in a river originating from glacerised area keywords environmental isotopes glacier ice

receives more solid precipitation in comparison to liquid and consequently yields high snow melt contribution to the river discharge peña and nazarala 1987 the major rivers i e indus mekong ganges yangtze brahmaputra and yellow river originating from the himalayan cryospheric system provide a wide range of ecosystem services and it is the basis for the livelihood to 1 5 billion people i e one fifth of the global population rasul and sharma 2016 apart from this the headwater regions of these rivers have an enormous potential for hydropower generation and support social amenities and ecological services among the himalayan rivers the ganga is the most important river supporting 42 of the total indian population mishra 2011 the ganga river forms after the confluence of the bhagirathi and alaknanda rivers at devprayag in the upper ganga basin ugb of the central himalayas bhagirathi river originates from the gangotri glacier and the alaknanda river originates from the satopanth glacier the ganga and its tributaries serve as a lifeline to millions of the people living in the region and are famous for their hindu mythological temples which attract thousands of tourists every year during summer months ugb also comprises of small and large 70 hydro electric projects heps with the capacity of 9033 mw out of which 17 heps 1851 mw have been commissioned 14 heps 2538 mw are under construction and 39 heps 4644 mw are under the planning stage chopra et al 2014 the snow and glacier melt are the important sources that sustain the river during the low flow periods when the demand reaches the peak therefore quantification of the contribution of cryospheric water and its temporal variability in the headwater regions would help the managers to develop sustainable river water management plans for the ganga river basin globally stable isotope of oxygen and hydrogen along with tritium have been used for fingerprinting the source of moisture for precipitation characterization of stream flows and quantification of the various flow components of rivers aizen et al 1996 garzione et al 2000 taylor et al 2001 karim and veizer 2002 pang et al 2006 hren et al 2009 penna et al 2015 zongxing et al 2015 engel et al 2016 penna et al 2017 pu et al 2020 studies reveal that there is a distinct variation in the signature of tracers in cryospheric water across the glacierised basin ohlanders et al 2013 penna et al 2017 zuecco et al 2019 these variations are attributed to various factors such as topography meteorology temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed and precipitation and morphometry size shape depth and tributary of the glacerised basins which do play a crucial role in precipitation and post depositional processes in the cryospheric region jeelani et al 2013 rai et al 2016 2019 the progressive depletion of heavier isotope in rain with altitude as the cloud ascent is often referred as altitude effect clark and fritz 1997 dalai et al 2002 the altitudinal changes in isotopic signatures of contributing agents shed light on the complex hydrology and hydro climatology of the basin which is helpful to accurately quantify the snow and glacier melt contributions to the river originating from glacierized basin or cold mountainous regions in the world penna et al 2017 beria et al 2018 schmieder et al 2018 hence isotopic characterization of various cryospheric water contributing to the river discharge is essential to understand the hydrological behavior of a glacierized basin in the indian himalayas various researchers have used stable δ18o and δ2h and radioisotopes to investigate the source of moisture for precipitation establish the altitude effect isotopically characterize the river and quantify the different components in the river discharge ramesh and sarin 1992 pande et al 2000 dalai et al 2002 kumar et al 2010 kumar et al 2012 2019 jeelani et al 2013 ahluwalia et al 2013 rai et al 2009 2014 2016 2019 jeelani and deshpande 2017 kumar et al 2010 developed a local meteoric water line lmwl for the western himalayan region india and described the altitude effect in δ18o of precipitation ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 per 100 m rise in elevation during the southwest monsoon kumar et al 2012 obtained an altitude effect of 0 14 per 100 m rise in elevation for the δ18o in precipitation occurring over the central kumaun himalayas jeelani et al 2013 estimated the altitude effect in δ18o of precipitation which ranges from 0 23 to 1 2 per 100 m rise in altitude across the kashmir himalayas jeelani and deshpande 2017 studied the isotopic characteristics of precipitation snowpack glacier melt streams and springs in liddar kuthar and bringi basins of jammu and kashmir western himalayas and established an altitude effect of 0 23 to 0 33 and 0 59 to 0 68 per 100 m rise in altitude for the δ18o in snow and ice respectively in areas with altitude ranging from 1400 to 3500 m asl however the isotopic characterization of snow and ice and its altitude effect in the ganga river basin of the central himalayas indian part have not been studied until now various researchers have carried out isotopic studies in the headwater regions of the ganga river basin among these ramesh and sarin 1992 reported the isotopic composition of ganga river for the first time and computed an altitude effect of 0 19 per 100 m rise in altitude for δ18o in the ganga river maurya et al 2011 estimated the contribution of snow and glacier melt to the ganga river at rishikesh as up to 40 rai et al 2009 estimated the contribution of rain derived runoff to the bhagirathi river as about 3 near the snout of the gangotri glacier during the ablation period in another study rai et al 2019 estimated the contributions of snow melt glacier melt and rainfall to the bhagirathi river at the snout of the gangotri glacier as about 59 6 36 8 and 3 6 of the total discharge respectively during the ablation period however in a few other tracer based studies khan et al 2017 computed the glacier melt contribution to the bhagirathi river at devprayag as about 9 10 during the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods kumar et al 2018 described the isotopic signatures of various flow components and interpreted the role of summer and winter precipitation on the melt water of chaurabari glacier in the alaknanda river basin boral et al 2019 estimated the glacier melt fraction to the ganga river at its headwater region and it is found to be in the range of 16 45 most of these studies in the ugb have either considered the snow and glacier components as a single unit to estimate their contribution to the river discharge or have used the isotopic signatures of snow and ice separately based on nijampurkar and bhandari 1984 and rai et al 2009 2019 despite having a number of tracer based studies none of these studies had reported the altitude effect and temporal variation in isotopic characteristics of snow and glacier ice in the ugb niewodnizański et al 1981 and nijampurkar and bhandari 1984 attempted to establish the altitude effect in stable isotopes of snow and ice with limited success therefore there is a need to study the spatio temporal and altitudinal variations in the isotopic signature of cryospheric water and to estimate the contributions of snow ice and rain water in the streams originating from the glacierized catchments of central himalayas the established altitude effect for snow and ice would be useful in various stable isotope based hydrological studies in view of the above concerns an extensive and systematic study was carried out in satopanth glacier basin of ugb in the central himalayas to achieve the following objectives i to define the spatial and temporal variability of isotopes δ18o δ2h and 3h in precipitation ice river lakes and supraglacial channels of satopanth glacier ii to establish the altitude effect in stable isotopic composition of rainfall snow and ice and understand the factors responsible for its variability iii to estimate the contributions of snow melt glacier melt and rain water to the total discharge of alaknanda river near the snout of the satopanth glacier and their temporal variability overall this study will fill the knowledge gap in spatio temporal and altitudinal variability in the isotopic signature of cryospheric water in the central himalayan river basin the outcome of the study would be useful for academicians and managers for the development of sustainable river water management plans for the ganga river basin 2 description of the study area the study is conducted in the satopanth glacier spg basin confined within the topographic coordinates 30 42 30 n to 31 46 15 n latitude and 79 16 15 to 79 28 45 e longitude spanning an area of 73 km2 and altitude range between approximately 3800 m to 7200 m above sea level asl it falls under the headwater region of the upper alaknanda river basin uab in ugb central himalayas india the alaknanda river originates at the snout 3800 m asl of the satopanth glacier it flows through the hindu pilgrimage center badrinath and meets the bhagirathi river at devprayag and after the confluence it is named as ganga river fig 1 a b the alaknanda river system drains through three districts of uttarakhand state namely chamoli tehri and pauri and contributes about 68 to 74 of total discharge of the river ganga at devprayag singh and hasnain 1998 during the summer months the flow of the river is mainly sustained by snow and glacier melt when the demand of water for drinking irrigation and hydropower generation is at its peak three important hydro power projects namely lata tapovan 170 mw capacity tapovan vishnugarh 520 mw capacity and vishnugarh pipalkoti 440 mw capacity are either in operational or constructional phase in the upper alaknanda river basin pant et al 2020 alaknanda catchment is also famous for the hindu mythological temples which attract thousands of tourists every year during the summer months overall the hydrological response of the alaknanda river has a major impact over the ganga river which affects millions of people living in and at the downstream of the basin the satopanth glacier trends towards the northeast direction and is about 13 000 m long and 750 m wide nainwal et al 2015 the satopanth glacier is mainly an avalanche fed glacier with about 0 58 debris cover fraction about 0 18 accumulation area ratio aar and yields a negative mass balance of 2 0 m w e a 1 for the year 2015 laha et al 2017 the glacier in its upper part up to 5380 m is characterized by a steep slope 15 following a general gradient of about 9 only along with the main trunk i e the satopanth glacier there are 5 small glacier tributaries viz luri bamak t1 t2 t3 and t4 in which luri bamak is the most prominent tributary fig 1b the nne to e facing tributary glaciers contributes about 21 whereas the south facing tributary glacier contributes about 25 area of the satopanth glacier nainwal et al 2008 the spg comprised of 19 cirque glaciers mostly at the southern slope and found to be terminating at an altitude of about 5300 m asl the active cirques give origin to cirque streams which cascade near the snout as saudhara waterfall meaning a hundred waterfalls it is also observed that the supraglacial moraines cover the lower half of the glacier and the glacier ice is hardly visible in the ablation zone under surface moraines except on the crevasse faces and near the snout apart from this a large number of mounds supraglacial lakes moraine dammed lake satopanth lake fig 1d e and supraglacial channels sgc are visible over the satopanth glacier in the ablation zone fig 1b the study area is characterized by a temperate climate the mean annual temperature at the snout region varies from 11 08 c maximum and 2 38 c minimum from 2000 to 2008 bhambri et al 2011 two monsoon system i e the southwest monsoon july to september and the western disturbances december to march are responsible for the precipitation in the region the ugb receives about 80 of the precipitation as snowfall during the winter season whereas the indian monsoon precipitation amounts to less than 5 viste and sorteberg 2015 the western disturbances consist of cyclonic storms associated with the mid latitude subtropical westerly jet stream swj the moisture in these storms usually originates over the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean kumar et al 2010 dimri et al 2015 jeelani and deshpande 2017 supplementary fig 1 apart from this recycling of the moisture from local evaporation is also responsible for the precipitation in the region rai et al 2016 jeelani and deshpande 2017 3 material and methods 3 1 data collection and measurement field activities were conducted from march to september 2017 for the physiographic survey and to collect the samples of precipitation ice river supraglacial channels and lakes the samples were collected in pre cleaned high density polyethylene bottles hdpe bottles were filled without air bubbles and tightly capped to prevent evaporation and exchange with the atmospheric moisture alaknanda river water samples were collected manually at the snout of the satopanth glacier n 122 on daily basis 09 00 am for stable isotope analysis and on 10 daily bases for tritium analysis precipitation rain samples n 59 were collected on an event basis and the amount of rain was recorded according to procedures followed by the indian metrological department imd daily mean air and water temperatures were also measured using automatic temperature loggers installed near the snout for establishing the altitude effect of stable isotopes in rain rainwater samples were also collected from four additional stations located at low altitudes namely srinagar 551 m asl n 32 karanprayag 774 m asl n 26 joshimath 1900 m asl n 31 and benakuli 2750 m asl n 28 in the alaknanda river basin fig 1a 25 snow samples elevation ranging between 1900 and 4700 m asl were collected during different field visits from february to august in the first phase 8 fresh snow samples were collected between the elevation range of 1900 to 3500 m asl during the winter months february march the area above 3500 m asl elevation was inaccessible due to adverse climatic and topographic conditions in the month of february to march in the second phase 17 snow samples were collected from the high altitude 3500 to 4700 m asl winter december to april accumulated snowpack during the field visits june to august in the basin when the area was accessible for sampling the area above the elevation of 4700 m asl in the basin is inaccessible throughout the year due to the presence of wide crevasses and steep slopes for obtaining the representative samples of ice n 40 glacial ice was collected from the debris covered ice dci and non debris covered ice ndci areas up to an altitude of 4700 m asl moreover ice samples were also collected from two vertical profiles of the glacier ice near the snout of the satopanth glacier to study the depth wise isotopic variations the samples snow and ice were packed in pre cleaned zip locked plastic bags and allowed them to melt naturally in the field and immediately transferred to hdpe bottles for isotopic measurements apart from this 14 water samples from the supraglacial channels sgc and 17 lake water samples were also collected from different elevations water samples from two types of lake i e supraglacial lake sgl at different elevations and moraine dammed lake satopanth mdl satopanth lake located at an altitude of 4367 m asl fig 1d e were collected during the ablation period the isotopic analyses of water samples were performed at isotope hydrology laboratory national institute of hydrology roorkee india the collected samples were analysed for stable isotopic ratio of hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o using dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer following pt h2 and co2 equilibration methods epstein and mayeda 1953 brenninkmeijer and morrison 1987 the steps and standards involved in the measurements of δ2h and δ18o were systematically described by rai et al 2009 2016 and 2019 the typical instrumental precision based on 10 repeated measurements of each sample was found to be 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively an ultra low level liquid scintillation counter ullsc was used in the measurement of tritium 3h tritium is an excellent dating tool for studying the timescales of physical processes in hydrologic systems in the range of years to decades stewart and morgenstern 2016 first of all 500 ml of pre distilled water sample was electrolytically enriched using a tritium enrichment unit in order to achieve maximum fractionation or enrichment of hto tritium water and the resultant volume was reduced to 25 ml these enriched samples were again distilled and mixed with an organic scintillator optiphase hisafe 3 in a 20 ml scintillation vial the sample vials were measured for 400 min using the ullsc the minimum detectable level of the instrument for the measurement of enriched sample is 0 6 tu which is within the level of 2σ error 95 confidence level rai et al 2019 the ec of the samples were measured insitu using hq40d portable ph and conductivity meter range 0 01 µs cm 200

trajectory analysis was carried out using hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectories hysplit model draxler and hess 1998 bershaw et al 2012 draxler and rolph 2016 to identify the probable moisture source region contributing to the precipitation in spg for understanding the climatic conditions during the formation of ice the age of the glacier snout was estimated the physical

the tracer genereux and hooper 1998 a three component mixing hydrograph separation model using two tracers δ18o and electrical conductivity ec was used to estimate the relative contributions of glacier melt snow melt and rain water to the river discharge during the ablation period the mass balance model is used in the present day with the following assumptions i the tracer behaves conservatively ii the mixing end members contributing sources have constant tracer concentrations or their variations are known and can be accounted iii the tracer concentrations are significantly distinct for each component iv contributions from other sources eg vadose zone water are negligible the ec was preferred over other tracers in the three component hydrograph separation model due to its lower uncertainty in estimating the event rain water and pre event water fractions penna et al 2015 engel et al 2016 rai et al 2019 attempts were made to collect water samples from the various flow components with high spatial and temporal resolution to reduce the level of uncertainty in the data and results the monthly average of daily isotope δ18o and ec data of the river was used for the hydrograph separation whereas the monthly weighted average values of rainwater were considered as the tracer signatures of rain derived runoff similarly the tracer signatures of snow and ice were determined using the monthly average values of the collected snow and ice samples the three flow components to the river was computed using the water and tracer conservation equations the water balance equation is given by 2 gm sm r t where gm sm r and t represent the glacier melt snow melt rain water and the total river flow in terms of fraction of the total river flow the equation 2 can be written as 3 gm sm r 1 where gm sm and r denotes the fraction of the river flow due to glacier melt snow melt and rain water respectively the tracer balance equations for δ18o and ec are given by 4 gm δgm sm δsm sr δr δt 5 gm egm sm esm sr er et δt δgm δsm and δr is the δ18o values of river glacier melt snow melt and rain water e denotes the ec of various flow components respectively by solving the equation 3 4 and 5 for the three unknowns the contributions of gm sm and sr can be obtained from 6 s r δ t δ g m e s m e g m δ s m δ g m e t e g m δ s r δ g m e s m e g m δ s m δ g m e s r e g m 100 7

in the estimation of tracer signatures of the end members statistical uncertainty and the violations of the underlying assumptions model uncertainty joerin et al 2002 based on numerical modeling studies jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 shown that the hydrodynamic mixing processes can influence the estimates of flow components and introduces uncertainty in tracer based hydrograph separation however liggett et al 2014 opined that the best way to accurately model the surface subsurface solute exchange in the real world is still not clear therefore in the absence of other accurate methods available for the hydrograph separation the tracer mixing concept with the above assumptions are still valid to obtain a first hand estimate of the flow components as evidenced in the recent studies chen et al 2019 he et al 2019 in the present study the model uncertainty in the hydrograph separation is ignored and only the statistical uncertainty is estimated by accounting the errors in the results klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the data was statistically analysed and found to be normally distributed and hence 1 standard deviation sd method was applied for the uncertainty analysis carey and quinton 2005 engel et al 2016 penna et al 2017 therefore the uncertainty in the three component mixing model was determined by varying the tracer signatures by 1 sd and subsequently the minimum and maximum contributions are reported 4 results 4 1 meteorological characteristics of the study area the daily mean air temperature near the snout 3800 m asl of spg ranges from 3 9 c to

similarly δ18o values for north facing ice profile for surface middle and bottom ice are 13 0 8 2 and 13 1 respectively these results reveal the vertical heterogeneity in the isotopic composition of

2 µs cm with a mean value of 67 2 µs cm whereas the sgc and lake samples have ec ranging between 2 8 and 24 9 µs cm average 7 8 µs cm and 5 6 to 49 0 µs cm average 18 8 µs cm respectively the ec of river water ranges from 31 3 to 70 2 µs cm average 48 8 µs cm the average ec of alaknanda river during the months of june july august and september are 48 4 39 8 47 3 and 59 2 µs cm respectively 4 7 altitude effect in rain snow ice and sgc the amount weighted monthly δ18o of precipitation is plotted against the respective elevation of the area fig 8 a and the lapse rate altitude effect in δ18o of precipitation is estimated as 0 13 r2 0 95 and 0 41 r2 0 98 per 100 m rise in elevation for the pre monsoon and monsoon periods respectively table 7 the estimated altitude effect in δ18o of rain during june july august and september months are 0 13 0 36 0 39 and 0 49 per 100 m rise in elevation respectively snow samples collected during may and june between the altitudes 3200 to 4650 m asl were analysed to establish the altitude effect in the basin the lapse rate in δ18o of snow in the study area is 0 43 per 100 m rise in altitude n 16 r2 0 50 the estimated monthly altitude effect in snow for may and june are 0 5 n 9 r2 0 6 and 0 4 n 9 r2 0 6 per 100 m rise respectively fig 8b two contrasting isotopic δ18o lapse rate patterns are observed for dci and ndci area of the glacier a negative δ18o lapse rate of 0 8 per 100 m rise is observed in dci area whereas a positive lapse rate of 3 4 per 100 m rise in elevation is observed for ndci fig 8a table 7 in fig 8a the sgc samples are falling in three different groups viz a b and c the group a belongs to samples collected during the pre monsoon period and they show a trend towards the stable isotopic signature of snow the group b samples collected during july to october are having highly depleted δ18o values and fall close to the dci samples whereas group c samples belong to monsoon period and their isotopic values matches with those of ndci and snow samples these different groups are evolved because of the contrasting altitude effects in snow and ice which vary during the pre monsoon and monsoon periods the sgc water samples have δ18o lapse rates of 1 2 r2 0 65 and 0 6 r2 0 46 per 100 m rise in altitude during the pre monsoon and monsoon periods respectively fig 8c 4 8 quantification of snow melt glacier melt and rain water contributions to the total flow of alaknanda river three component based hydrograph separation model eq 6 7 and 8 was used to quantify the relative contributions of glacier melt snow melt and surface runoff to the total flow of alaknanda river near the snout of the satopanth glacier the monthly average δ18o of the end members such as snow ice and rain water vary between 8 4 to 6 5 13 3 to 17 1 and 23 8 to 5 0 respectively the ec of snow ice and rain water vary between 32 and 34 µs cm 55 to 80 µs cm and 8 to 28 µs cm respectively the estimated contributions of snow melt and glacier melt to the river during the ablation period are found to be varying between 27 and 36 average 32 and 39 to 56 average 49 respectively table 6 fig 9 c moreover the rain water contribution ranges between 12 and 26 average 18 the computed snow and ice melt contributions to the sgc using a two component hydrograph separation model reveals that the snow and ice melt fractions are 64 and 36 in group a 3 and 97 in group b and 24 and 76 in group c samples respectively fig 8a the uncertainty associated with the minimum and maximum contributions of ice melt snow melt and surface runoff are 46 to 54 30 to 33 and 18 to 27 respectively table 6 5 discussion 5 1 spatio temporal variation in isotopic composition of river water and its sources the trend analysis of both event based and monthly rainfall data of the upper alaknanda river basin indicates that the amount of rainfall is declining with increasing elevation except at srinagar where the valley gets more widened with respect to the other locations basistha et al 2008 the declining trend of precipitation with altitude indicates declining moisture content because of the orographic barriers and climatic conditions singh and kumar 1997 basistha et al 2008 significant temporal variation in stable isotopic composition of rainfall is observed at the gauging site near the snout of the satopanth glacier during the study period figs 2 6 the slope and y intercept of the regression line between δ18o and δ2h of monsoon samples eq 11 are very close to the north indian meteoric water line nimwl kumar et al 2010 and the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 1993 which confirms that the indian summer monsoon ism contributes to the precipitation in the study area it also corroborates the findings of the earlier researchers kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2014 the higher slope and y intercept of the regression line between δ18o and δ2h of the pre monsoon samples eq 10 compared to that of the nimwl and the gmwl indicates the recycling of the moisture from local evaporation rai et al 2016 jeelani and deshpande 2017 about 37 of the total rain samples mainly from june and the first week of july shows high d excess 12 value suggesting the vapor source through local recycling jeelani and deshpande 2017 whereas the d excess of rain water around 10 during july to september indicates the moisture source in the study area brought from the ism breitenbach et al 2010 jeelani and deshpande 2017 it indicates that the ism reaches the study area during the first or second week of july the lower slope 7 72 and y intercept 4 64 along with lower d excess 9 in august indicate evaporation of falling raindrops due to scanty rainfall events table 4 kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2014 the correlation analysis between temperature minimum maximum and mean and δ18o show a significant relationship p 0 01 in all the three cases table 5 however there is a good correlation between δ18o and maximum temperature in comparison to the minimum and average temperature a similar trend of good correlation between δ18o and maximum temperature was also observed by siegenthaler and matter 1983 and rozanski et al 1993 the snow samples show a relatively higher y intercept in comparison to that of nimwl and the gmwl the higher y intercept is due to its source vapour from the mediterranean sea or due to recycled moisture and lower condensation temperature jeelani and deshpande 2017 the backward wind trajectory analysis at the satopanth glacier basin also indicates the influence of western disturbance during winter december january february and post monsoon october november periods supplementary fig 1 despite being the same source the higher slope y intercept and d excess of fresh snow samples 3500 m asl in comparison to snowpack 3500 m asl show spatial variability in the isotopic signatures isotope data reveals that the melt water from the snowpack is isotopically more enriched than the pre melt snow due to secondary fractionation or post depositional isotopic fractionation or event based variability in moisture source ohlanders et al 2013 pu et al 2020 it has been observed that initially the snow pack becomes isothermally and isotopically homogeneous due to metamorphism and infiltration of rainfall and snow melt unnikrishna et al 2002 as the ablation period advances there is a significant change in the snow of the snowpack and it becomes isotopically heavier with time stichler 1987 the possible key factors influencing these change in the stable isotopic composition of snow can either be due to the atmospheric influence after deposition or post depositional changes which depend on the topography of the study area sublimation metamorphism of snow crystals evaporation and isotopically enriched precipitation arnason 1970 raben and theakstone 1994 aizen et al 1996 stichler 1987 sokratov and golubev 2009 apart from that the contact time between the snow grains and liquid phases is longer at the lower altitude than at the higher altitude which causes the isotopic enrichment in snowpack pang et al 2006 the slope and y intercept of the regression equation eq 13 for ice is close to that of the snow eq 12 however the depleted stable isotopic composition of ice indicates a cooler climatic condition during the formation of ice compared to the present day climatic scenarios or post depositional metamorphism pang et al 2006 pu et al 2020 the ice samples collected along the two profiles facing towards the east and north directions fig 5 b c show significant vertical variation in the isotopic values it also indicates variability in climatic condition during the precipitation of snow and formation of ice the dynamic nature of ice in the himalayas might be another important factor responsible for the variation in the stable isotopic composition of glacial ice in this process the ice is formed in the accumulation zone at higher altitudes i e above the snowline over the time period ranging from years to decades this ice further slides down slowly to the lower altitudes in the form of avalanches or via glacier movement this process might be responsible for the spatial variability in the isotopic signature of the glacial ice overall it appears that the stable isotopic composition of snow and ice are controlled by climatic conditions altitude effect debris and non debris cover glacier dynamics and post depositional processes therefore it is difficult to accurately estimate the snow melt and ice melt contributions to a glacerised river without considering the spatial and temporal variability in the tracer signatures of snow and ice temporal depletion in the stable isotopic composition of mdl water indicates an increase in the contribution of snow melt from the snow located at higher ridges as the ablation period advances the presence of high tritium content 13 6 tu in mdl also corroborates the stable isotope results that the lake is getting more contribution from the melting of fresh snow this is also confirmed by the changes in the water level of mdl from june to september 2017 fig 1 d e higher 3h content is expected in the higher altitude 6000 8000 m elevation regions due to riming growth in deep convective up draughts which includes entrained moisture compared to near surface 3h content 5 tu aggarwal et al 2016 a similar significant temporal variation in the stable isotopes has been observed in sgc at the beginning of the ablation period june the sgc samples are isotopically enriched in comparison to the later months september it reveals that as the ablation period advances the snow and ice melt fractions from higher altitudes contribute in greater amounts to sgc table 6 fig 7a shows the temporal variations in tritium and δ18o of river water as the ablation season advances the 3h value of river water decreases along with the depletion of δ18o the presence of higher tritium and comparatively enriched δ18o in the river during the initial periods of the ablation season i e in the month of june indicates a higher contribution of snow melt to the river lower tritium and depleted δ18o values during august and september months indicate the dominance of ice contribution to the river which is also confirmed by the results of hydrograph separation table 6 however an ambiguity exists in the observed increase in tritium and enrichment in δ18o on 20th september 2017 that may be due to the rise in the atmospheric temperature and subsequent increase in contribution of the melt water from high altitude snow and ice which is relatively enriched in stable isotopic values further the observed most depleted stable isotopic value of the river on 30 september 2017 could be because of the heavy rainfall of 115 mm between 20th and 30th september which bears a depleted signature due to amount effect fig 6 the relation between 3h and δ18o fig 7b shows that the three rain samples collected during various months are having minor variation in tritium values in the range of 4 3 to 6 9 tu but there is a significant variation in δ18o 4 6 to 22 7 indicating temporal variability in the tracer signatures whereas the lake water samples from three different altitudes show almost similar δ18o values but having significantly different 3h values supporting the spatial variability in tracer signatures 5 2 altitude effect the established altitude effect in rain during different months and seasons indicate a decrease in the condensation temperature with altitude leading to the depletion of heavier isotopes jeelani 2016 in general the altitudinal lapse rate observed in the study area is more or less similar to that of the globally reported altitude effect in rainfall which varies from 0 15 to 0 5 for δ18o for every 100 m increase in elevation in different parts of the world dansgaard 1964 poage and chamberlain 2001 rai et al 2014 rozanski and araguás araguás 1995 siegenthaler and matter 1983 jeelani and deshpande 2017 the relatively high altitude effect observed in the stable isotopic composition of snowpack samples could be because of the increased fractionation between the liquid and the vapour phases at lower temperatures ingraham and criss 1998 the estimated altitude effect in the snowpack samples from the study area are within the range of the altitude effect in snowpack established by other researchers moser and stichler 1970 1974 wushiki 1977 niewodnizański et al 1981 grabczak et al 1983 nijampurkar and bhandari 1984 kang et al 2002 he et al 2006 dietermann and weiler 2013 jeelani and deshpande 2017 table 8 this variability in the isotopic characteristics of the snowpack would certainly affect the stable isotopic composition of the melt water as the ablation period advances therefore the study of spatial variability in the isotopic signature of snow and snow pack plays an important role in estimating the contribution of snow melt in the river water a significant correlation is observed between the δ18o of glacial ice and the corresponding elevation of the area fig 9a table 7 however two contrasting isotopic patterns are observed for dci and ndci areas of the glacier a negative lapse rate of 0 8 in δ18o per 100 m rise in elevation in dci area and a positive lapse rate of 3 4 in δ18o per 100 m rise in elevation for ndci the possible reasons behind the contrasting altitude effect may be due to the i role of debris in the melting of the ice ii time period of formation of the ice 5 2 1 role of debris cover on the melting of glacial ice as discussed above a disparity in lapse rate of δ18o with elevation is observed for the debris and non debris covered areas of the satopanth glacier studies reveal that the debris cover reduces the ice melting and hence show a delayed adjustment to the glacier length scherler et al 2011 mölg et al 2019 the debris cover act as an insulator and retards the ablation of the ice surface when its thickness exceeds the critical thickness for a given glacier and low melting takes place from dci during mid of the ablation period reznichenko et al 2010 the dci layer has a strong insulating effect with a factor of 3 to 10 times higher than that of the ndci layer mihalcea et al 2006 a thicker debris cover efficiently protects the ice surface from melting while a thin debris zone increases the melting of glacial ice due to lower albedo collier et al 2014 patel et al 2016 shah et al 2019 according to shah et al 2019 the average ablation rate of satopanth glacier in the ndci and dci areas are 3 19 cm day and 1 25 cm day respectively the high solar radiation causes more evaporation from the ice surface leading to isotopic enrichment and a reverse altitude effect he et al 2006 it indicates that the debris cover is one of the significant factors controlling the spatial variability in the ablation rate and the stable isotopic signatures of ice in the satopanth glacier 5 2 2 role of climatic conditions on the isotopic variability in glacial ice of the satopanth glacier another important factor that influences the change in the altitude effect in stable isotopes of glacial ice is the climatic conditions prevailed during its formation the stable isotopic composition of ice formed on the high altitude mountains provides information on the fluctuations of climatic conditions in the past niewodnizański et al 1981 hou et al 2019 however percolation processes and melting of ice can sometimes obscure the chemical isotopic signatures in the ice column at the end of snow drifting the evaporation and sublimation processes can also alter the isotopic composition of ice despite such complications the accumulation areas of certain temperate glaciers are very well known to preserve the climatic history of that region in the form of their isotopic signatures arnason 1970 which can be used to trace the time period of the formation of ice nijampurkar and bhandari 1984 had attempted to date the himalayan glaciers and suggested that the ice in the temperate glaciers are relatively young and the maximum age is up to 2000 years nijampurkar and rao 1993 and nijampurkar et al 2002a b dated the age of ice collected from the snout of the himalayan glaciers i e nehnar chota shigri dokriani bamak gara gorgarang and changme khangpu glaciers using 32si isotope dating technique table 9 nijampurkar et al 2002a had also reported the physical characteristics glacier length and ice flow velocity of these glaciers the age of glaciers calculated using eq 1 shows a close resemblance to those estimated using 32si dating by nijampurkar et al 1993 nijampurkar et al 2002a table 9 according to laha et al 2018 the length of the satopanth glacier is 12 43 km and its mean surface velocity value is 27 8 1 6 ma 1 considering these values the estimated age using eq 1 of the ice at the snout of the satopanth glacier is around 447 25 years i e 1572 25 ad which is somewhere in the mid of the little ice age lia nainwal et al 2007 have also reported that conical heaps in the neighborhood of the present day snout at spg are most possibly associated with the lia the lia is widely varying from the period ce 1400 1900 which is also notable for the worldwide glacier expansion grove 2004 weissbach et al 2016 kennedy and lindsey 2015 the maximum depletion in stable isotopic composition of ice is seen at around 4500 m asl elevation hence the age of ice at this elevation is calculated using eg 1 it is found to be nearly around 1800 ce which represents the coolest time period of lia it is further supported by the isotopic composition of ice core samples collected from tibetan glaciers where the most depleted isotopic signature is having an age of around 1810 ce thompson et al 2000 similarly other studies viz north facing dokriani glacier indicates lia maximum during ce 1692 chaujar 2006 whereas the south facing chorabari glacier shows its lia maximum during ce 1748 chaujar 2009 in the central himalayan region of the upper ganga basin the stable isotopic composition of ice at the snout of the glacier is relatively enriched compared to those at the 4500 m asl elevation and its age as estimated above is 1572 25 ad the relatively enriched isotopic composition of the ice at the snout of the glacier implies that it is formed in a relatively warmer period in the post lia the temperature during 1750 1850 ce was the lowest during lia which was cooler in comparison to those of 1572 ce studies reveal that the lia was having comparatively wetter environment conditions in central himalayas and the post lia 1880 ce was drier than lia and hence having isotopically enriched signatures sanwal et al 2013 this may be one of the reasons behind the change in altitude effect in the ice above 4500 m asl 5 3 monthly contributions of snow melt ice melt and rain water to the total discharge of alaknanda river the δ18o versus d excess plot fig 10 shows that the river samples fall well within the range of mixing between the three primary components i e snow ice and rain except a few samples of august and september months however the outliers in the plot fig 10 mostly belong to extreme rainfall events wherein the amount of rainfall was high causing depletion in stable isotopic composition amount effect the outliers also indicate the contributions of snow and ice melt from high altitude regions i e above 4700 m elevation from where the samples could not be collected because of the adverse climatic and topographic conditions this specifies the importance of sampling from high altitude areas in order to precisely quantify the contributions of different components the temporal variation in stable isotopic signatures fig 10 clearly indicate that the δ18o and d excess values of the river are in close proximity to the isotopic signatures of snow during the months of june and july while from august onwards the stable isotopic values of the river resemble close to that of the ice the isotope based hydrograph separation helped to quantify the contributions of the various flow components i e snow ice and rain water to the river discharge the spatio temporal variability in tracer δ18o and ec signatures has been used to characterize the end members contributing to the river flow fig 9 a b as the ablation period advances the δ18o values of ice show a characteristic depleted isotopic trend due to increased contribution from the high altitude areas whereas the snow samples show a trend of isotopic enrichment due to increased contribution from the winter accumulated snowpack areas the ec of ice and snow show a declining trend between june and july and further it increases this decrease in ec is due to the dilution effect during the high melting period similar observations were noted by maurya et al 2011 and penna et al 2017 that when there is an increase in the discharge the ec of the river water decreases the results of hydrograph separation show that the fraction of snow melt contribution is decreasing from june to september whereas in contrast the glacier melt contribution is increasing during this period fig 9c snow melt contribution was relatively lower about 36 during june and july in comparison to august and september whereas ice contributes about 43 to the river discharge during the months of june and july during the initial ablation period i e april and may the glacier body remains covered by snow and hence the melting of glacial ice is minimum results of glaciological mass balance studies also reveal that the maximum loss of glacier mass of satopanth glacier occurred at the end of the ablation period shah et al 2019 snow and ice melt contributions to the alaknanda river near the snout of the satopanth glacier snow melt 33 and glacier melt 49 are more or less similar to that of the bhagirathi river near the snout of the gangotri glacier i e snow melt 36 8 and glacier melt 59 6 as estimated by rai et al 2019 the rain water contribution to the alaknanda river average 19 is higher in comparison to bhagirathi river i e 3 6 due to high amount of rainfall occurring in the satopanth glacier basin the maximum and minimum contributions after 1 sd from all the three components are higher during the initial ablation period june and lower at the end of the ablation period september table 6 the relatively higher uncertainty in the estimates of hydrograph components during the initial period june is due to the large snow cover area in varying altitudes hence inducing large isotopic variability in the meltwater during this period and comparatively less snow and ice samples collected from the high altitudes 4700 m because of inaccessibility to the region secondly the large spatial variation in the tracer signatures of glacial ice throughout the basin also causes uncertainty in the estimates of hydrograph components the high uncertainty in the mass balance estimates of various hydrograph components of a river during the initial flow periods is also reported by penna et al 2017 overall the tracer based results show that the melting of snow and glaciers of the himalayan region play an important role in the sustainability of himalayan rivers the loss in glacial ice and reduction in the snowfall will reduce the availability of water in the himalayan region and hence better water management plans are required to sustain the river water flow during the dry lean flow period 6 conclusion sampling and data collection for isotopic studies at such high elevations and hard topographic terrains are extremely challenging but play a key role in understanding the hydrological processes of a glacierized system therefore attempts have been made to substantiate our observations and provide new insight into the isotopic characterization of cryospheric water in a glacierized basin the main highlights of the results are summarized as follows the stable isotopic composition of rain snow ice lakes and supraglacial channels show temporal and altitudinal variations interpretation of stable isotopic results of precipitation indicates that a the moisture source for precipitation in the study area is mainly from the southwest monsoon b recycled local moisture is the source for pre monsoon rains the estimated altitudinal effect in δ18o of rain is 0 13 and 0 41 per 100 m rise in elevation during the pre monsoon and monsoon periods respectively the altitude effect in the δ18o of snow is of the order of 0 43 per 100 m rise in elevation the snowpack samples show enrichment in stable isotopic signatures due to post depositional isotopic fractionation altitude effect in the δ18o of glacial ice shows contrasting patterns in debris covered ice dci and non debris covered ice ndci areas the observed isotopic δ18o gradient in dci 4500 m asl and ndci 4500 m asl is 0 9 and 3 4 per 100 m rise in elevation respectively the change in the isotopic gradient indicates a complexity involved due to the change in the climatic conditions during the formation of ice in the past the vertical variation in stable isotopic composition of ice from the vertical face of the glacier indicates glacier dynamics and different climatic conditions during the stratification of ice the relatively depleted isotopic composition of ice in the satopanth glacier compared to that of the snow indicates that the ice was formed during the little ice age lia a more detailed isotopic analysis would be required to exactly define the age of the formation of glacial ice the estimated contributions of snow melt glacier melt and rain water using the mass balance approach to the discharge of alaknanda river near the snout of satopanth glacier during the ablation period of 2017 are 33 49 and 18 respectively this indicates that the snow and ice melts 82 are the major source for the alaknanda river near the snout which stresses the strategic importance of glacial melt in rivers overall the results of the study reveal that the melting of snow and glaciers play an important role to sustain the river flow in the headwater region of the himalayas also the study highlights

4776,the dominant source layer dsl is defined as the riparian zone rz depth stratum that contributes the most to water and solute fluxes to streams the concept can be used to explain timing and amount of matter transferred from rzs to streams in forest headwaters here we investigated the potential impact of future climate changes on the long term position of the dsl in a subhumid mediterranean headwater catchment we used the rainfall runoff model persist to simulate reference 1981 2000 and future 2081 2100 stream runoff the latter were simulated using synthetic temperature precipitation and inter event length scenarios in order to simulate possible effects of changes in temperature rainfall amount and rainfall event frequency and intensity simulated stream runoff was then used to estimate rz groundwater tables and the proportion of lateral water flux at every depth in the riparian profile and hence the dsl our simulations indicated that future changes in temperature and precipitation will have a similar impact on the long term dsl position nearly all scenarios projected that together with reductions in stream runoff and water exports the dsl will move down in the future by as much as ca 30 cm shallow organic rich layers in the rz will only be hydrologically activated during sporadic large rainfall episodes predicted for the most extreme inter event length scenarios consequently terrestrial organic matter inputs to streams will decrease likely reducing catchment organic matter exports and stream dissolved organic carbon concentrations this study highlights the importance of identifying vertical hydrologically active layers in the rz for a better understanding of the potential impact of future climate on lateral water transfer and their relationship with surface water quality and carbon cycling keywords terrestrial aquatic interface hydrological connectivity hydrological modelling catchment biogeochemistry mediterranean climate

and exert a major control over water and solute transfer to forest headwaters worldwide mcdowell et al 1992 luke et al 2007 bernal et al 2015 musolff et al 2018 the growing consensus on the importance of rzs for catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry has been translated into an increasing number of studies focusing on the processes that regulate the transfer of water and solutes from rzs to streams schwab et al 2016 laudon and sponseller 2018 weyer et al 2018 however a general mechanistic cross ecoregion understanding of how forest rzs transfer matter to adjacent streams remains elusive the dominant source layer dsl is defined as the rz depth stratum that contributes the most to water and solute fluxes to streams and it has been recently proposed to explain timing and amount of matter transfer from riparian soils to surface waters in forest headwaters across ecoregions ledesma et al 2018a the dsl idea is derived from the control points concept bernhardt et al 2017 which moves beyond classical hot spots and hot moments mcclain et al 2003 by integrating both transport and biogeochemical phenomena the dsl provides a conceptual framework for testable hypotheses on the importance of localized riparian processes on stream hydrology and biogeochemistry ledesma et al 2015 2018b blackburn et al 2017 the identification of the dsl position in the riparian vertical profile can be inferred from the relationship between the rz groundwater table and stream runoff seibert et al 2009 this relationship is characteristic of most forest catchments within mediterranean lupon et al 2016 boreal rodhe 1989 seibert et al 2009 bishop et al 2011 and temperate mcdonnell et al 1998 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 ecoregions laterally flowing water traversing the rz picks up the chemical signal corresponding to the depth of its flow path across the rz and then transfers it to the stream in corresponding proportions bishop et al 2004 this phenomenon is known as the transmissivity feedback mechanism and has been used to explain water and solute mobilization to streams by lateral flow exports that increase during precipitation events as rz groundwater table rises and water enters highly conductive riparian layers lundin 1982 rodhe 1989 bishop et al 2004 thus identifying hydrologically active layers in the rz i e dsls is relevant to assess and understand stream water quality in forest and other semi natural headwater catchments temperature and precipitation ultimately control the vertical position of the dsl at both long i e annual and inter annual and short i e precipitation event temporal scales for instance future wetter conditions in boreal regions will promote a shift of the dsl towards upper riparian layers and consequently predominant lateral flow paths from rzs to streams will connect more organic rich strata to the aquatic environment ledesma et al 2015 in the mediterranean ecoregion warmer and drier projected conditions for the future ipcc 2013 might have the opposite effect the dsl could move down to deeper more mineral rich riparian strata this change together with the expected significant reduction in stream runoff under increased aridity pascual et al 2015 could accentuate the disconnection between groundwater and soil organic layers butturini et al 2003 and potentially reduce dissolved organic matter inputs to streams at the same time expected changes in precipitation patterns including both larger precipitation events and longer dry spells complicate our ability to predict the importance of sporadic hydrological activation of shallow organic rich layers for organic matter transfer as well as the extent to which typical runoff generation processes will be altered during exceptionally large storms lana renault et al 2014 a better mechanistic understanding of climate induced changes in predominant riparian water flow paths and their characteristic dsl is thus essential for assessing future climate impacts on stream water quantity and quality in mediterranean forest catchments the objective of the present study was to investigate the potential impact of future changes in temperature and precipitation patterns on the long term position of the dsl in a subhumid mediterranean catchment we used the rainfall runoff model persist precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff simulator for solute transport futter et al 2014 and a combination of synthetic temperature and precipitation scenarios to explore the influence of warmer and drier conditions on stream runoff and the position of the dsl inter event length scenarios were also applied to explore the potential importance of extreme precipitation events on both stream runoff generation and the hydrological activation of shallow rz layers finally we compared these model results with empirical measurements of organic matter carbon and nitrogen content in the rz vertical profile to identify potential consequences of changes in the dsl for stream water quality and carbon cycling 2 study site font del regàs is a mediterranean catchment with total drainage area of 15 5 km2 located in the montseny natural park ne spain 41 49 n 2 27 e ca 30 km nw from the mediterranean sea fig 1 the climate is subhumid mediterranean with mild winters wet springs and dry summers the catchment is biotitic granite dominated its altitude ranges from 405 to 1603 m above sea level and steep slopes 50 are present deciduous european beech fagus sylvatica forest and a small proportion of heathlands calluna vulgaris and gramineae dominate the upper parts of the catchment and cover respectively 38 and 2 of the total area evergreen oak quercus ilex forest and small proportions of coniferous trees dominate in the lower parts and cover 54 of the catchment riparian forest located in the flat near stream zones slope 10 covers 6 of the catchment and is composed of a mixture of tree species including black alder alnus glutinosa black locust robinia pseudoacacia european ash fraxinus excelsior and black poplar populus nigra lupon et al 2016 there is a negligible proportion of riparian forest in the upper 2 9 km stretch of the stream draining the first 1 8 km2 in the following 3 7 km the width of the rz increases from 5 to 32 m which leads to a 12 fold increase in the total basal area of riparian trees bernal et al 2015 3 material and methods 3 1 stream runoff riparian groundwater tables and riparian soil measurements we measured stream runoff at a location near the valley bottom of the font del regàs catchment draining an area of 13 0 km2 fig 1 stream water levels were recorded at 15 min intervals from september 2010 to august 2012 using a pressure transducer teledyne isco model 1612 attached to a small manmade wall built on one side of the stream channel at this location the streambed is made of pebbles stones and rocks stream water levels recorded with the pressure transducer were converted to stream runoff through the specific rating curve for the location r2 0 98 p 0 001 n 65 uncertainty 2 bernal et al 2015 lupon et al 2016 high frequency values were integrated into daily data for the two year period n 719 days stream runoff is denoted by units of mm day 1 or mm year 1 where appropriate throughout the paper we selected a well developed riparian forest area located ca 500 m downstream from the stream runoff measurement point to measure groundwater tables and to characterize the rz soil profile fig 1 the selected area has the typical soil 90 sand bulk density 1 09 g cm 1 and vegetation types present in the rzs at font del regàs bernal et al 2015 poblador et al 2017 there are no permanent tributaries between the stream gauge and the riparian site and drainage area only increases from 13 0 km2 to 14 0 km2 in this stream section in addition forest type proportions are marginally changed and stream morphological characteristics i e width depth and slope are very similar along the stretch that separates the two locations therefore we assume that specific i e area normalized stream runoff was equivalent at these two points further the riparian area is likely a hotspot for water accumulation and export to the stream because it is relatively flat compared to the rest of the catchment indeed water flow direction along this riparian slope is approximately perpendicular to the stream even during summer low flow conditions fig 1 moreover the riparian area is located within a stream reach that is a net receiver of water from the catchment during base flow conditions bernal et al 2015 groundwater levels were recorded at 15 min intervals simultaneously with the stream runoff measurements september 2010 to august 2012 using a perforated pvc tube equipped with a water pressure transducer druck pdcr 1830 located 2 5 m from the stream channel within the selected riparian area sub daily high frequency measurements were averaged into daily values for a total of 664 daily records sporadic device failure precluded a full time series for the full period additionally groundwater levels were manually measured every two weeks during the same period at seven equidistant ca 3 m piezometers installed ca 2 m from the stream channel along the rz fig 1 a total of 45 supplementary groundwater table measurements available at each of the seven piezometers were compared with the continuous measurements groundwater table dynamics were notably similar in all cases supplementary fig a1 which justified the use of the continuous measurements as representative of the entire riparian forest area a soil pit was excavated in june 2018 for physicochemical characterization of the rz soil profile the pit was 1 35 m deep and it was located ca 2 m from the continuous groundwater table measurement location and ca 4 m from the stream fig 1 we divided the rz soil profile in ten different strata based on visual differentiation of texture color and humidity for each stratum three soil samples i e three replicates were taken and transported in cooling boxes to the laboratory within three hours from collection where they were kept frozen until physicochemical analyses were made soil samples were oven dried at 60 c until constant weight was reached sieved and the 2 mm fraction was used for physicochemical measurements relative soil organic matter content was measured by loss on ignition 450 c 4 h total soil carbon and nitrogen content were determined on a gas chromatograph coupled to a thermal conductivity detector after combustion at 1000 c at the scientific technical service of the university of barcelona 3 2 quantification of the dominant source layer to estimate the dsl at the riparian forest area we fitted a logarithmic relationship between measured daily groundwater tables and daily stream runoff fig 2 data were binned to reduce scattering and to weight the relative importance of low versus high stream runoff values given that base flow conditions were predominant hence daily runoff records were binned at 0 5 cm groundwater table intervals along the total rz profile depth set to 2 m by obtaining the median value within each interval following the same approach as grabs et al 2012 after this procedure the final number of observations to fit the logarithmic relationship was 77 subsequently we estimated lateral water fluxes from rz soil layers to the stream at a 1 cm resolution for any given stream runoff by using the logarithmic regression equation and assuming darcy s law applies as described by seibert et al 2009 in other words for any given stream runoff lateral flows at any given rz soil depth were proportional to the groundwater table stream runoff curve fig 2 assuming that they only occurred on saturated layers below the groundwater table i e shallow perched flow paths to the stream were neglected in this way the dsl can be arbitrarily specified by estimating the relative contribution of each rz soil depth at a 1 cm level of resolution to the total lateral water flux from the entire rz profile for any given period of time thus the proportion of lateral water flux contribution at every cm in the riparian profile was obtained this methodology is based on the transmissivity feedback mechanism conceptualized by bishop et al 2004 and mathematically described by seibert et al 2009 following ledesma et al 2015 we quantitatively defined the dsl as the rz depth range contributing 50 of the total lateral water flux this was done for the two year calibration period and for the 20 year reference and future simulation periods see section 3 4 in each corresponding instance analogously we also estimated a dsl responsible for 90 of the total lateral water flux which represents a more extended estimate of the soil layers contributing to stream runoff these depth ranges will be hereafter referred to as dsl50 and dsl90 respectively 3 3 rainfall runoff model persist characterization calibration and validation we used the rainfall runoff model persist to simulate reference 1981 2000 and future 2081 2100 stream runoff which was then used to back calculate rz groundwater tables and to infer dsls persist is a semi distributed bucket type model for simulating catchment water fluxes including stream runoff at daily time steps futter et al 2014 the model simulates evapotranspiration as a function of temperature antecedent soil moisture conditions and catchment vegetation persist conceptualizes the landscape at four spatial levels a catchment level 1 is represented as one or more subcatchments level 2 within each subcatchment there are one or more landscape units level 3 finally each landscape unit is made up of one or more buckets level 4 through which water is routed within this flexible framework the modeller specifies the perceptual representation of the runoff generation process based on a specified number of interconnected buckets within a mosaic of landscape units namely forest types in the present study the model requires daily time series of air temperature and precipitation as input data we calibrated persist for the two year period september 2010 to august 2012 with a prior 8 month warm up period to do so we used daily time series of average air temperature and precipitation measured at a meteorological station located at the valley bottom of font del regàs daily measurements of stream runoff and a model structure that explicitly included the rz forest compartment fig 3 this approach was used to successfully simulate and predict future changes in stream runoff at three nested subcatchments along the font del regàs stream in a previous study lupon et al 2018 in the present study a single 13 0 km2 catchment a single reach application was used we divided the entire catchment in two landscape units i evergreen oak forest occupying 51 of the total catchment area and ii deciduous beech forest occupying 49 of the total catchment area within each landscape unit riparian forest occupied 3 of the area and it was accounted for by combining five buckets upland quick layer upland soil layer riparian quick layer riparian soil layer and groundwater in appropriate proportions along the hillslope fig 3 analogously to lupon et al 2018 the upland quick and riparian quick layers represented the upper soil stratum that transmit water laterally to the stream only during large precipitation events in accordance to the dsl concept quantified in fig 2 we improved the lupon et al 2018 best parameterization in terms of model efficiency to calibrate the single 13 0 km2 drainage area by manually adjusting the model parameters in order to maximize the values of four performance metrics the resultant stream runoff simulation was slightly better than the one presented by lupon et al 2018 i e we obtained a i higher nash sutcliffe ns efficiency index nash and sutcliffe 1970 ii higher log ns iii lower relative volume differences rvd between observed and simulated stream runoff and iv variance of the simulated time series closer to that of the observed data i e the ratio of observed to simulated time series var was closer to 1 a detailed comparison between model parameters used by lupon et al 2018 and model parameters used here can be found in the supplementary material supplementary table a1 further information on model configuration and calibration is available in lupon et al 2018 in order to explore the potential influence of future extreme precipitation events on stream runoff generation and thereby on dsl positions we considered two different parameterizations first we used the aforementioned manual parameterization which produced relatively fast rainfall runoff responses hereafter referred as to fast under future extreme precipitation events we then obtained a second model parameterization derived from the former which simulated a lower capacity of the system to generate fast rainfall runoff responses under such extreme events hereafter referred as to slow for that we changed the persist parameter time constant of the upper soil layer in the two landscape units considered generally this parameter defines the residence time of water of a specified soil layer within the specified model structure at the upper soil layer defined as quick layer in the present application fig 3 it regulates the immediacy of stream runoff generation during large precipitation events as we have observed in previous model applications we increased the value of the quick layer time constant so that i the ns efficiency index during the calibration process was maintained within 5 of the original fast parameterization and ii the rvd was maintained within 5 original rvd was 3 1 these criteria defined our limits of acceptability for behavioural models during calibration sensu e g beven 2000 hence in the slow parameterization water was transmitted more slowly to the stream during large storms we expected that this small change in present day parameterizations i e changing the value of one model parameter within the limits of acceptability for behavioural models might have a disproportionate impact in future rainfall runoff model simulations that included extreme precipitation events not observed during calibration or the reference period we considered previous observations and independent sets of data for validating the model at font del regàs daily fluctuations in stream runoff can be used as a proxy for daily riparian evapotranspiration dynamics because they are strongly correlated with independent sap flow measurements from riparian trees lupon et al 2016 based on these previous empirical evidences we validated the model by assessing the fit of the linear relationship between monthly mean values of simulated daily riparian evapotranspiration and monthly mean values of observed daily stream runoff fluctuations for the two year calibration period i e n 24 we carried out a further model validation by comparing the empirical dsl curve derived from the observed stream runoff measurements with the simulated dsl curves derived from the simulated stream runoff from fast and slow parameterizations for the calibration period as a reminder for any given period the dsl curve displays the proportion of lateral water flux contribution at every cm in the riparian profile which is derived from the characterized rz groundwater table stream runoff relationship 3 4 future climate scenarios and dominant source layer projections because of its longer available time series we used data from turó de l home a meteorological station located ca 6 km southwest from the font del regàs meteorological station to construct daily time series of temperature and precipitation at the study catchment for the reference period 1981 2000 for this we used the linear regression models r2 0 90 p 0 001 n 53 described by lupon et al 2018 that related monthly mean temperature and monthly total precipitation at font del regàs and turó de l home stations for the period 2010 2014 supplementary fig a2 using 1981 2000 as a baseline we generated synthetic temperature and precipitation time series by considering the representative concentration pathway rcp projection changes for 2081 2100 provided by ipcc for mediterranean zones rcp scenarios project an increase in temperature all year round more pronounced in summer than in winter that ranges from 0 75 c in all seasons under the rcp2 5 percentile 0 25 scenario to 6 c in summer and autumn under the rcp8 5 percentile 0 75 scenario precipitation is projected to decrease in april september by as much as 35 under the rcp8 5 percentile 0 25 scenario while small changes are expected in october march including a slight increase of 5 under the rcp2 5 percentile 0 75 scenario we applied five scenarios for seasonal changes in both temperature and precipitation that covered the whole range of plausible rcp projections table 1 which resulted in an overall change in both temperature and precipitation for the whole 20 year data series for each scenario five inter event length scenarios were applied by uniformly increasing the duration of the dry spells in the reference period from 0 no change to 200 without changing the overall precipitation amount supplementary fig a3 hence the inter event length was calculated as the difference in days between the last day of a given rainfall event which defined the start of the dry spell and the first day of the following event which defined the end of the dry spell rainfall events separated by one day without precipitation were considered independent subsequently the length of the inter event duration in the reference period was increased by 0 50 100 150 and 200 by delaying the end of the dry spell accordingly to keep the water volume constant the total amount of precipitation registered during the days that were originally part of a rainfall event and subsequently part of the dry spell was added to the first day of the following rainfall event these scenarios were meant to represent extreme hydrological conditions i e longer dry spells followed by larger precipitation events folwell et al 2016 inter event length scenarios are of interest because the dsl position could vary not only as a consequence of changes in the magnitude of annual precipitation and average temperature but also because of an increase in the occurrence of hydrological extremes we combined each of the five inter event length scenarios considered with each of the five temperature and precipitation scenarios generating a total of 125 climate scenarios table 1 these 125 synthetic future climatic scenarios together with the reference scenario were run in persist using both the fast and slow parameterizations obtained during calibration in order to produce daily time series of stream runoff at font del regàs for the corresponding 20 year periods in a further step stream runoff was used to back calculate groundwater tables at the rz using the estimated rz groundwater table stream runoff relationship fig 2 subsequently the dsl position was characterized for each of the future scenarios and compared with the dsl position of the reference period using the quantification method described in section 3 2 for both fast and slow parameterization outputs relationships between changes in the dsl position and changes in climate variables were established following the scenario neutral method proposed by bussi et al 2016 briefly a response surface is created by comparing a variable of interest here the position of the simulated dsl with defined climatic stressors here changes in temperature precipitation and inter event length thus in order to analyze the impact of future climate variable changes on the long term position of the dsl changes in the median depth of the dsl50 as the movement up or down with respect to the reference 1981 2000 case were plotted against overall 20 year changes in temperature precipitation and inter event length for all future scenarios 4 results 4 1 stream runoff calibration and dominant source layer validation for the two year calibration period average annual precipitation and stream runoff values at font del regàs were respectively 1087 and 256 mm year 1 and therefore the average annual runoff coefficient was 0 24 persist was able to successfully simulate both the temporal pattern and the magnitude of stream runoff fig 4 model simulations were virtually equivalent between the two parameter sets corresponding to fast and slow runoff response parameterizations i e the difference in performance metrics for the calibration period obtained from these two parameterizations was minimal ns efficiencies important to fit high runoffs and log ns important to fit low runoffs equalled 0 91 for the fast parameterization while the values for these two metrics were 0 86 and 0 88 respectively for the slow parameterization the model slightly underestimated the total stream discharge by 3 1 fast parameterization and 4 6 slow parameterization the var important to ensure that observed and simulated series have similar variances was 0 97 for both parameterizations the small discrepancy between observed and the two sets of simulated data was mainly associated with two large precipitation events one in october 2010 four day accumulated rainfall of 144 mm and one in november 2011 147 mm on november 15 fig 4a b simulated riparian evapotranspiration and observed diel stream runoff fluctuations as a proxy for observed riparian evapotranspiration dynamics were strongly related linear regression r2 0 92 p 0 0001 n 24 which provided a satisfactory validation of the model fig 5 a furthermore there was a good agreement between the dsl curves derived from observed and simulated data from both the fast and slow parameterizations fig 5b for the observed data dsl50 was located between 86 and 106 cm below the soil surface b s s whereas the simulated dsl50 was between 84 and 104 cm b s s for the fast parameterization and between 85 and 105 cm b s s for the slow parameterization therefore the dsl thickness equalled 21 cm in all three cases analogously dsl90 was located between 68 and 124 cm b s s and between 65 and 121 cm b s s using the observed data and the simulated fast and slow data respectively i e dsl thickness equalled 57 cm in all three cases 4 2 reference and future projections of climate and stream runoff the reference period 1981 2000 was characterized by an average annual air temperature of 12 9 0 6 c average standard deviation and an average annual precipitation of 764 203 mm year 1 the average duration of consecutive days with no rainfall during this period i e average inter event length was 4 3 4 7 days and the average daily rainfall event amount was 5 9 10 9 mm day 1 future 2081 2100 temperature scenarios showed increased annual average values that ranged from 13 6 c in the less extreme scenario t1 to 18 1 c in the most extreme scenario t5 table 2 the driest future precipitation scenario p1 led to an average annual precipitation of 583 171 mm year 1 whereas the value for the wettest scenario p5 was 786 213 mm year 1 slightly higher than the reference one table 2 future average inter event length increased from scenario l1 same as reference to scenario l2 12 9 9 4 days the combination of precipitation and inter event length scenarios led to a wide range of average daily rainfall event amounts for the future periods ranging from 4 5 8 8 mm day 1 for the combined l1 and p1 scenarios to 25 34 mm day 1 for the combined l5 and p5 scenarios table 2 the reference period 1981 2000 showed an average annual simulated stream runoff of 86 and 84 mm year 1 for fast and slow parameterizations respectively the overall runoff coefficient was 0 11 in both cases although the inter annual variation of this parameter was large ranging from 0 03 to 0 25 fig 6 the distributions of both annual stream runoff and runoff coefficient were very similar between the fast and the slow parameterizations in the reference period the 125 future 2081 2100 scenarios also produced a large range of annual stream runoff conditions and runoff coefficients from 12 to 374 mm year 1 and from 0 03 to 0 30 respectively considering all 125 scenarios both the slow and the fast parameterization produced similar results at the lower end i e the drier scenarios of the distributions of both annual stream runoff and runoff coefficient by contrast the fast parameterization led to larger annual stream runoff and runoff coefficients than the slow parameterization at the upper end of the distributions i e the wetter scenarios fig 6 there was a positive relationship between annual precipitation and both annual stream runoff exponential regression r2 0 60 p 0 0001 and annual runoff coefficient exponential regression r2 0 43 p 0 0001 however as precipitation increased a wide range of possible stream runoff conditions and runoff coefficients were projected supplementary fig a4 4 3 reference and future dominant source layer projections dsl curves derived from future scenarios differed from the dsl curve of the reference period for both the fast and the slow parameterizations table 3 fig 7 a b the depth at which the maximum proportion of lateral water flux occurred shifted from 98 cm b s s in the reference period to 116 13 cm b s s for the combined fast and slow parameterization scenarios in the future the maximum depth for this descriptor was found at 128 cm b s s for six of the future scenarios in both fast and slow parameterizations the upper depth that contributed to lateral flow to the stream was located at 61 cm b s s for the reference period while this depth was deeper for the slow parameterization scenarios 65 4 cm b s s the fast parameterization led to the activation of shallower depths in the riparian profile up to 27 cm b s s table 3 fig 7a specifically for the most extreme inter event length scenarios l3 to l5 in tables 1 and 2 the upper and lower depths delimiting dsl50 for the reference scenario were 87 and 114 cm b s s respectively these upper and lower depths shifted respectively 10 and 15 cm down the riparian profile for the combined fast and slow parameterizations in the future scenarios by contrast the thickness of dsl50 was similar for both the reference and the future cases varying between 26 and 36 cm table 3 in its turn dsl90 for the reference period was constrained between 76 and 139 cm b s s resulting in a dsl thickness of 64 cm for the slow parametrization the future thickness of dsl90 was similar to that simulated for the reference period yet its upper and lower delimiting depths were on average 4 and 5 cm deeper table 3 for the fast parameterization the activation of shallower depths under the most extreme inter event length scenarios led to the vertical expansion of dsl90 along the soil profile fig 7a for example scenario t5 p1 l5 tables 1 2 had a dsl90 divided into a shallow stratum between 35 and 55 cm b s s and a deeper stratum between 82 and 154 cm b s s which together led to a total thickness of 92 cm the dsl position changed in response to changes in climate variables and the patterns were consistent for both the fast and slow parameterizations fig 8 the position of dsl50 rose by only 2 cm only for the wettest scenarios while it shifted down as much as 28 cm for the driest scenarios the dsl50 position responded similarly to changes in precipitation and temperature i e as the system became warmer and drier dsl50 moved down in the riparian profile in similar proportions fig 8a d by contrast the dsl50 position was relatively insensitive to changes in inter event length fig 8b c e f 4 4 characterization of the riparian soil profile the riparian soil profile consisted of a 10 to 15 cm organic horizon underlain by a semi organic layer with large number of roots down to 35 to 45 cm b s s a horizon the highest organic matter content up to ca 6 was measured closer to the surface and then decreased with depth down to ca 1 at 1 35 m b s s fig 7c carbon and nitrogen contents followed a similar pattern to the one observed for the organic matter and varied from 0 3 to 2 2 and from 0 03 to 0 2 respectively fig 7c d 5 discussion 5 1 overall persist model performance persist successfully reproduced stream runoff magnitude and dynamics at font del regàs as indicated by all performance metrics ns log ns rvd and var and by visual inspection of the hydrographs fig 4c the overall calibration period was exceptionally wet which led to an exceptionally high runoff coefficient and high annual stream runoff yet they were within the plausible reference and future conditions according to our simulations fig 6 supplementary fig a4 this could imply that the two parameterizations obtained during the calibration procedure were primarily balanced for wet conditions which could bias future hydrological projections however the calibration period also included typical summer droughts e g only 25 mm of rainfall were recorded in the combined months of june and july of 2012 we argue that the overall exceptionally wet calibration period which included occasional typical dry conditions allowed us to calibrate the model under a wide range of stream runoff circumstances from low base flow to infrequent high stream runoff peaks produced by seldom observed large rainfall events all in all we believe that having a set of overall wet and occasional dry conditions was favourable for calibrating the model simulating future conditions and developing our main objective despite the relatively short time series used in addition the exceptionally wide weather conditions encountered during the calibration period ensured that a wide range of rz groundwater table depths was also captured this is essential to construct reliable relationships between rz groundwater tables and stream runoff which are the basis for subsequent dsl estimations in font del regàs these two variables were more strongly related i e they showed a higher r2 than in similar studies conducted in the boreal ecoregion e g bishop et al 2011 ledesma et al 2016 which further confirms the suitability of our approach finally model validation via comparison of i observed stream runoff fluctuations as a proxy for observed riparian evapotranspiration and simulated riparian evapotranspiration and ii observed and simulated dsls was satisfactory fig 5 overall accurate and validated model simulations were achieved suggesting that the two model parameterizations fast and slow were robust and could be used for stream runoff simulations and dsl estimations under reference and future climate scenarios 5 2 dominant source layer projections and response to climate variable changes in order to explore the potential response of the dsl to changes in climate we considered a wide range of climatic conditions based on an ensemble of 125 synthetic climate scenarios that together went beyond the available climate model projections this approach helped understanding the long term sensitivity of the dsl position to changes in temperature total precipitation and inter event length and widely covered potential uncertainties arising from the estimation of future climate variables and model parameterization changes in temperature and total precipitation led to similar changes in the dsl position fig 8 suggesting that these two factors will be equally important in determining the location of important lateral water fluxes in the future an increase in temperature will likely increase both evaporative demand from the atmosphere and water demand from plants wang et al 2012 lupon et al 2018 this increase in evapotranspiration rates in the long term might lead to a drop in rz groundwater tables and thus dsls and a consequent decrease in lateral water exports from rzs to streams notably a decrease in precipitation will have a direct effect on the water balance by decreasing water availability further lowering dsls and lateral water exports in turn a decrease in water availability can also affect plant phenology and growth vicente serrano et al 2013 and promote changes in vegetation that might further change evapotranspiration patterns in the rz peñuelas and boada 2003 poblador et al 2019 yet and in a desire for simplicity we did not consider possible changes in either vegetation cover or evapotranspiration patterns associated with future changes in climatic conditions further studies exploring this type of questions would be needed which could be especially important because the overall effect of climate change on evapotranspiration patterns is a complex issue still under debate matheny et al 2014 yu et al 2016 teuling et al 2019 on the other hand the dsl position was relatively insensitive to changes in inter event length for both fast and slow parameterizations for the overall 20 year periods fig 8 changes in inter event length modify the intra annual distribution of precipitation which in the most extreme scenarios can lead to i periods of very low and deep lateral water transfer from rzs to streams and ii activation of shallow conductive riparian layers in response to large rainfall events during the overall 20 year period inter annual compensatory effects may be concealing these two phenomena which could partially explain why temperature and total precipitation but not inter event length were the most important climate variables driving long term trends in the dsl position yet extreme precipitation events could cause sporadic hydrological activations of shallow rz layers i e organic and a horizons above 35 cm b s s poblador et al 2017 especially for the fast parameterization simulations fig 7a according to our simulations the frequency of daily events for which rz layers above 35 cm b s s will be hydrologically connected to the stream may increase with increasing inter event length i e from l1 to l5 scenarios supplementary fig a5 inter event length scenarios l2 to l5 included rainfall events larger than 200 mm day 1 and up to 268 mm day 1 which led to a range of associated daily simulated stream runoffs of 37 to 79 mm day 1 for the fast parameterization and of 0 1 to 6 4 mm day 1 for the slow parameterization these numbers highlight the discrepancy between the two parameterizations in simulating peaks in stream runoff under exceptionally large precipitation inputs in the future in light of their different outcomes the question that arises is whether the fast or the slow parameterizations considered in the present study yield realistic future scenario results rainfall events larger than 200 mm day 1 have been recorded on several occasions in the nw mediterranean region gonzález hidalgo et al 2003 llasat et al 2013 and so it is conceivable that they could occur anytime at font del regàs ledesma et al 2021 unfortunately most of these events do not have associated runoff data from neighboring forest headwater streams because catchments are generally ungauged and no systematic stream runoff measurements are available llasat et al 2013 consequently understanding runoff generation during extremely large rainfall events in these systems is challenging and stream runoff peaks appear to be strongly dependent on antecedent soil moisture conditions àvila et al 1992 bernal et al 2002 lana renault et al 2014 this dependency likely led to the wide range of simulated stream runoff conditions and runoff coefficients associated with high overall precipitation at the annual scale observed here supplementary fig a4 as an example in the context of this discussion a stream runoff peak of 52 mm day 1 was recorded in march 2013 at a forest headwater catchment close to font del regàs as a response to a two day rainfall event of 163 mm ledesma et al 2019 by contrast the peak in stream runoff recorded at font del regàs during the calibration period was 7 5 mm day 1 as a response to a two day rainfall event of 154 mm fig 4 thus we cannot be certain whether the fast or the slow parameterization produced more realistic outcomes and the true answer probably lies somewhere in between a way to overcome this limitation caused by epistemic uncertainty is to include a wide range of climatic conditions and contrasting model parameterizations in order to cover the range of plausible outcomes as we have done here epistemic uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge about how to represent a catchment system in terms of both model structure and parameters and may include things that have not yet been perceived as being important but which might result in reduced model performance when surprise events occur beven 2016 here we showed that even a minimalist approach to epistemic uncertainty using only a single model and changing a single parameter gave rise to a broad range of system behaviours when indeed surprise events i e extremely large precipitation events in future scenarios were present in the simulations such events were missing in the calibration period and the reference scenario when by contrast the fast and slow model parameterizations led to virtually equivalent stream runoff simulations future modelling work could improve on the work presented here by considering specific hydrological processes that could have greater relevance under future climate conditions for instance the hydrological activation of shallow rz layers might be constrained by the actual physical capacity of the soils to first infiltrate and subsequently transfer water laterally to the stream during extreme precipitation events these events can be associated with rapid runoff generation overland flow and destructive flash floods in mediterranean catchments llasat et al 2013 in its present form the dsl approach does not directly account for overland flow generation over unsaturated soils as it is based on the static logarithmic relationship between rz groundwater tables and stream runoff moreover the present approach does not consider the occurrence of reverse hydraulic gradients from the stream to the rz which may occur during dry periods in mediterranean catchments butturini et al 2003 lupon et al 2016 and may become more important under drier and warmer conditions nevertheless these dry period related situations entail very low transfer of both water and solutes independently on the direction of movement and are not as critical in the context of matter transfer as hydrological processes associated with extreme rainfall events despite these limitations the approach used here which combines the use of a well established rainfall runoff model and the well grounded dsl conceptual model provides a framework for hypothesis testing and prediction that can be useful to infer potential consequences of future climate for the transfer of water and solutes from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems and thus for surface water quantity and quality in mediterranean headwaters and similar systems located elsewhere 5 3 implications for surface water quality future changes in the dsl position will likely imply changes in the chemical signal transferred from the rz to the stream and thus in surface water quality at font del regàs the predicted range of change was wide from a shift up of 2 cm to a shift down of 28 cm though the general trend shown by most scenarios was towards moving down for instance the depth with the maximum contribution to lateral water flux is projected to move down an average of 18 13 cm from 98 to 116 cm b s s table 3 and many scenarios showed the maximum contributing depth as low as at 125 to 128 cm b s s fig 7 notably the soil chemistry associated with the deeper rz layers providing most of the lateral water flux in the future scenarios is different from the rz layers that contributed the most to the lateral water flux in the reference period in particular deeper rz layers showed lower organic matter carbon and nitrogen content as usually reported for forests soils jobbágy and jackson 2000 2001 this suggests that the future drop in the dsl position at font del regàs will entail a lower transfer of dissolved organic matter from the rz to the stream not only because of the anticipated decrease in water fluxes but also because dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen concentrations in rz water will likely be lower this potential outcome is relevant because dissolved organic matter inputs from terrestrial ecosystems are an important energy source for aquatic organisms and thus future declines could disrupt stream metabolism ecosystem productivity and food web structure elser et al 2000 bernal et al 2018 at the same time carbon budgets and cycling could be disrupted by a decrease in lateral carbon exports to illustrate potential changes in lateral doc exports and concentrations under future climate conditions we annually integrated the daily product of simulated lateral flow and measured carbon content in the riparian profile for the most extreme scenarios and compared the resulting lateral doc export and flow weighted concentration with the reference scenario we based these calculations on the fast parametrization simulations which were more conservative because the sporadic activation of shallow organic rich rz layers during large storm events could partially compensate for future declines in lateral doc exports and concentrations for this rough approximation we assumed that i measured carbon content pattern in the profile was representative of the entire rz and did not substantially change over time jobbágy and jackson 2000 and ii measured carbon content was proportional to riparian soil water doc concentrations hope et al 1997 evans et al 2006 the scenario with no changes in inter event length and the warmest driest future climate t5 p1 l1 table 2 resulted in a 65 lower water transfer a 71 lower doc transfer and a 19 lower annual average doc flow weighted concentration the equivalent scenario with the maximum increase in inter event length t5 p1 l5 only moderately compensated for these climatic changes resulting in a 54 lower water transfer a 60 lower doc transfer and a 12 lower annual average doc flow weighted concentration these heuristic calculations suggest that even in those cases for which the activation of shallow hydrological flow paths could offset declines in carbon export future declines in the dsl will alter carbon cycling and in stream processes in subhumid and semiarid mediterranean forest catchments that experience the proposed climate changes by substantially decreasing lateral carbon fluxes bernal et al 2019 moreover it is unlikely that rapid and intermittent inputs from shallow flow paths could sustain the ecological status of the aquatic environment in the long term such a pattern of inputs would likely have other undesirable consequences for the stability of stream ecosystems including high rates of bank erosion and transport of sediments as well as damage or scouring of stream and riparian biota fisher et al 1982 ledesma et al 2019 6 conclusions and further investigations this study combined the dsl concept and the use of climate scenarios in a rainfall runoff model to estimate future changes in the vertical position of predominant lateral water fluxes from the rz to the stream in a subhumid mediterranean catchment our model exercise illustrates that small changes in present day calibrations represented by rainfall runoff model parameterizations can have a significant impact on future projections of stream runoff two model parameterizations simulated the same stream runoff in the calibration period but produced significant differences in stream runoff responses under future scenarios with extreme precipitation events this is the result of epistemic uncertainty a common limitation in hydrological models and which can only be overcome with more data and information and hence more measurements investigations and understanding and that should be treated subjectively based on expert judgment beven and smith 2015 here we attempted to treat uncertainty in this way by using two contrasting behavioural parameterizations together with an ensemble of 125 synthetic climate scenarios as we consider it to be the most sensible approach for integrating hydrological modelling climate change projections and water resources management in catchments worldwide we showed that the dsl of riparian lateral water fluxes in mediterranean headwaters such as font del regàs will likely drop down in the future as a consequence of both an increase in average temperature and a decrease in total precipitation our simulations suggest that the dsl position is not sensitive to changes in inter event length though longer dry spells and larger rainfall events could lead to the sporadic hydrological activation of shallow organic rich soil layers in the rz overall these changes in predominant lateral flow paths will lead to i declines in lateral water export and in doc and likely other organic nutrients concentrations and exports from rzs to these mediterranean streams for most of the year and ii an increasing importance of extreme rainfall episodes on annual water balances this study highlights that the dsl concept in combination with the use of rainfall runoff models offer a simple and useful framework to assess stream water quantity and quality in forest headwaters worldwide this type of approaches can e g help to constrain lateral carbon exports from terrestrial ecosystems to inland waters which is critical to quantify global carbon balances tank et al 2018 studies of changes in the location of the dsl between wet and dry periods are needed in future applications aiming to investigate finer temporal scale patterns in hydrological processes and runoff generation changes associated with climate variation the inclusion of vegetation change scenarios associated with climate change as well as a dynamic rz groundwater table stream runoff relationship that accounts for potential seasonal variability will also be important to project possible future changes in the water balance more rigorously in conclusion an integrative dsl approach is needed for the management of water resources in forest headwater catchments credit authorship contribution statement josé l j ledesma conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

4776,the dominant source layer dsl is defined as the riparian zone rz depth stratum that contributes the most to water and solute fluxes to streams the concept can be used to explain timing and amount of matter transferred from rzs to streams in forest headwaters here we investigated the potential impact of future climate changes on the long term position of the dsl in a subhumid mediterranean headwater catchment we used the rainfall runoff model persist to simulate reference 1981 2000 and future 2081 2100 stream runoff the latter were simulated using synthetic temperature precipitation and inter event length scenarios in order to simulate possible effects of changes in temperature rainfall amount and rainfall event frequency and intensity simulated stream runoff was then used to estimate rz groundwater tables and the proportion of lateral water flux at every depth in the riparian profile and hence the dsl our simulations indicated that future changes in temperature and precipitation will have a similar impact on the long term dsl position nearly all scenarios projected that together with reductions in stream runoff and water exports the dsl will move down in the future by as much as ca 30 cm shallow organic rich layers in the rz will only be hydrologically activated during sporadic large rainfall episodes predicted for the most extreme inter event length scenarios consequently terrestrial organic matter inputs to streams will decrease likely reducing catchment organic matter exports and stream dissolved organic carbon concentrations this study highlights the importance of identifying vertical hydrologically active layers in the rz for a better understanding of the potential impact of future climate on lateral water transfer and their

and exert a major control over water and solute transfer to forest headwaters worldwide mcdowell et al 1992 luke et al 2007 bernal et al 2015 musolff et al 2018 the growing consensus on the importance of rzs for catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry has been translated into an increasing number of studies focusing on the processes that regulate the transfer of water and solutes from rzs to streams schwab et al 2016 laudon and sponseller 2018 weyer et al 2018 however a general mechanistic cross ecoregion understanding of how forest rzs transfer matter to adjacent streams remains elusive the dominant source layer dsl is defined as the rz depth stratum that contributes the most to water and solute fluxes to streams and it has been recently proposed to explain timing and amount of matter transfer from riparian soils to surface waters in forest headwaters across ecoregions ledesma et al 2018a the dsl idea is derived from the control points concept bernhardt et al 2017 which moves beyond classical hot spots and hot moments mcclain et al 2003 by integrating both transport and biogeochemical phenomena the dsl provides a conceptual framework for testable hypotheses on the importance of localized riparian processes on stream hydrology and biogeochemistry ledesma et al 2015 2018b blackburn et al 2017 the identification of the dsl position in the riparian vertical profile can be inferred from the relationship between the rz groundwater table and stream runoff seibert et al 2009 this relationship is characteristic of most forest catchments within mediterranean lupon et al 2016 boreal rodhe 1989 seibert et al 2009 bishop et al 2011 and temperate mcdonnell et al 1998 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 ecoregions laterally flowing water traversing the rz picks up the chemical signal corresponding to the depth of its flow path across the rz and then transfers it to the stream in corresponding proportions bishop et al 2004 this phenomenon is known as the transmissivity feedback mechanism and has been used to explain water and solute mobilization to streams by lateral flow exports that increase during precipitation events as rz groundwater table rises and water enters highly conductive riparian layers lundin 1982 rodhe 1989 bishop et al 2004 thus identifying hydrologically active layers in the rz i e dsls is relevant to assess and understand stream water quality in forest and other semi natural headwater catchments temperature and precipitation ultimately control the vertical position of the dsl at both long i e annual and inter annual and short i e precipitation event temporal scales for instance future wetter conditions in boreal regions will promote a shift of the dsl towards upper riparian layers and consequently predominant lateral flow paths from rzs to streams will connect more organic rich strata to the aquatic environment ledesma et al 2015 in the mediterranean ecoregion warmer and drier projected conditions for the future ipcc 2013 might have the opposite effect the dsl could move down to deeper more mineral rich riparian strata this change together with the expected significant reduction in stream runoff under increased aridity pascual et al 2015 could accentuate the disconnection between groundwater and soil organic layers butturini et al 2003 and potentially reduce dissolved organic matter inputs to streams at the same time expected changes in precipitation patterns including both larger precipitation events and longer dry spells complicate our ability to predict the importance of sporadic hydrological activation of shallow organic rich layers for organic matter transfer as well as the extent to which typical runoff generation processes will be altered during exceptionally large storms lana renault et al 2014 a better mechanistic understanding of climate induced changes in predominant riparian water flow paths and their characteristic dsl is thus essential for assessing future climate impacts on stream water quantity and quality in mediterranean forest catchments the objective of the present study was to investigate the potential impact of future changes in temperature and precipitation patterns on the long term position of the dsl in a subhumid mediterranean catchment we used the rainfall runoff model persist precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff simulator for solute transport futter et al 2014 and a combination of synthetic temperature and precipitation scenarios to explore the influence of warmer and drier conditions on stream runoff and the position of the dsl inter event length scenarios were also applied to explore the potential importance of extreme precipitation events on both stream runoff generation and the hydrological activation of shallow rz layers finally we compared these model results with empirical measurements of organic matter carbon and nitrogen content in the rz vertical profile to identify potential consequences of changes in the dsl for stream water quality and carbon cycling 2 study site font del regàs is a mediterranean catchment with total drainage area of 15 5 km2 located in the montseny natural park ne spain 41 49 n 2 27 e ca 30 km nw from the mediterranean sea fig 1 the climate is subhumid mediterranean with mild winters wet springs and dry summers the catchment is biotitic granite dominated its altitude ranges from 405 to 1603 m above sea level and steep slopes 50 are present deciduous european beech fagus sylvatica forest and a small proportion of heathlands calluna vulgaris and gramineae dominate the upper parts of the catchment and cover respectively 38 and 2 of the total area evergreen oak quercus ilex forest and small proportions of coniferous trees dominate in the lower parts and cover 54 of the catchment riparian forest located in the flat near stream zones slope 10 covers 6 of the catchment and is composed of a mixture of tree species including black alder alnus glutinosa black locust robinia pseudoacacia european ash fraxinus excelsior and black poplar populus nigra lupon et al 2016 there is a negligible proportion of riparian forest in the upper 2 9 km stretch of the stream draining the first 1 8 km2 in the following 3 7 km the width of the rz increases from 5 to 32 m which leads to a 12 fold increase in the total basal area of riparian trees bernal et al 2015 3 material and methods 3 1 stream runoff riparian groundwater tables and riparian soil measurements we measured stream runoff at a location near the valley bottom of the font del regàs catchment draining an area of 13 0 km2 fig 1 stream water levels were recorded at 15 min intervals from september 2010 to august 2012 using a pressure transducer teledyne isco model 1612 attached to a small manmade wall built on one side of the stream channel at this location the streambed is made of pebbles stones and rocks stream water levels recorded with the pressure transducer were converted to stream runoff through the specific rating curve for the location r2 0 98 p 0 001 n 65 uncertainty 2 bernal et al 2015 lupon et al 2016 high frequency values were integrated into daily data for the two year period n 719 days stream runoff is denoted by units of mm day 1 or mm year 1 where appropriate throughout the paper we selected a well developed riparian forest area located ca 500 m downstream from the stream runoff measurement point to measure groundwater tables and to characterize the rz soil profile fig 1 the selected area has the typical soil 90 sand bulk density 1 09 g cm 1 and vegetation types present in the rzs at font del regàs bernal et al 2015 poblador et al 2017 there are no permanent tributaries between the stream gauge and the riparian site and drainage area only increases from 13 0 km2 to 14 0 km2 in this stream section in addition forest type proportions are marginally changed and stream morphological characteristics i e width depth and slope are very similar along the stretch that separates the two locations therefore we assume that specific i e area normalized stream runoff was equivalent at these two points further the riparian area is likely a hotspot for water accumulation and export to the stream because it is relatively flat compared to the rest of the catchment indeed water flow direction along this riparian slope is approximately perpendicular to the stream even during summer low flow conditions fig 1 moreover the riparian area is located within a stream reach that is a net receiver of water from the catchment during base flow conditions bernal et al 2015 groundwater levels were recorded at 15 min intervals simultaneously with the stream runoff measurements september 2010 to august 2012 using a perforated pvc tube equipped with a water pressure transducer druck pdcr 1830 located 2 5 m from the stream channel within the selected riparian area sub daily high frequency measurements were averaged into daily values for a total of 664 daily records sporadic device failure precluded a full time series for the full period additionally groundwater levels were manually measured every two weeks during the same period at seven equidistant ca 3 m piezometers installed ca 2 m from the stream channel along the rz fig 1 a total of 45 supplementary groundwater table measurements available at each of the seven piezometers were compared with the continuous measurements groundwater table dynamics were notably similar in all cases supplementary fig a1 which justified the use of the continuous measurements as representative of the entire riparian forest area a soil pit was excavated in june 2018 for physicochemical characterization of the rz soil profile the pit was 1 35 m deep and it was located ca 2 m from the continuous groundwater table measurement location and ca 4 m from the stream fig 1 we divided the rz soil profile in ten different strata based on visual differentiation of texture color and humidity for each stratum three soil samples i e three replicates were taken and transported in cooling boxes to the laboratory within three hours from collection where they were kept frozen until physicochemical analyses were made soil samples were oven dried at 60 c until constant weight was reached sieved and the 2 mm fraction was used for physicochemical measurements relative soil organic matter content was measured by loss on ignition 450 c 4 h total soil carbon and nitrogen content were determined on a gas chromatograph coupled to a thermal conductivity detector after combustion at 1000 c at the scientific technical service of the university of barcelona 3 2 quantification of the dominant source layer to estimate the dsl at the riparian forest area we fitted a logarithmic relationship between measured daily groundwater tables and daily stream runoff fig 2 data were binned to reduce scattering and to weight the relative importance of low versus high stream runoff values given that base flow conditions were predominant hence daily runoff records were binned at 0 5 cm groundwater table intervals along the total rz profile depth set to 2 m by obtaining the median value within each interval following the same approach as grabs et al 2012 after this procedure the final number of observations to fit the logarithmic relationship was 77 subsequently we estimated lateral water fluxes from rz soil layers to the stream at a 1 cm resolution for any given stream runoff by using the logarithmic regression equation and assuming darcy s law applies as described by seibert et al 2009 in other words for any given stream runoff lateral flows at any given rz soil depth were proportional to the groundwater table stream runoff curve fig 2 assuming that they only occurred on saturated layers below the groundwater table i e shallow perched flow paths to the stream were neglected in this way the dsl can be arbitrarily specified by estimating the relative contribution of each rz soil depth at a 1 cm level of resolution to the total lateral water flux from the entire rz profile for any given period of time thus the proportion of lateral water flux contribution at every cm in the riparian profile was obtained this methodology is based on the transmissivity feedback mechanism conceptualized by bishop et al 2004 and mathematically described by seibert et al 2009 following ledesma et al 2015 we quantitatively defined the dsl as the rz depth range contributing 50 of the total lateral water flux this was done for the two year calibration period and for the 20 year reference and future simulation periods see section 3 4 in each corresponding instance analogously we also estimated a dsl responsible for 90 of the total lateral water flux which represents a more extended estimate of the soil layers contributing to stream runoff these depth ranges will be hereafter referred to as dsl50 and dsl90 respectively 3 3 rainfall runoff model persist characterization calibration and validation we used the rainfall runoff model persist to simulate reference 1981 2000 and future 2081 2100 stream runoff which was then used to back calculate rz groundwater tables and to infer dsls persist is a semi distributed bucket type model for simulating catchment water fluxes including stream runoff at daily time steps futter et al 2014 the model simulates evapotranspiration as a function of temperature antecedent soil moisture conditions and catchment vegetation persist conceptualizes the landscape at four spatial levels a catchment level 1 is represented as one or more subcatchments level 2 within each subcatchment there are one or more landscape units level 3 finally each landscape unit is made up of one or more buckets level 4 through which water is routed within this flexible framework the modeller specifies the perceptual representation of the runoff generation process based on a specified number of interconnected buckets within a mosaic of landscape units namely forest types in the present study the model requires daily time series of air temperature and precipitation as input data we calibrated persist for the two year period september 2010 to august 2012 with a prior 8 month warm up period to do so we used daily time series of average air temperature and precipitation measured at a meteorological station located at the valley bottom of font del regàs daily measurements of stream runoff and a model structure that explicitly included the rz forest compartment fig 3 this approach was used to successfully simulate and predict future changes in stream runoff at three nested subcatchments along the font del regàs stream in a previous study lupon et al 2018 in the present study a single 13 0 km2 catchment a single reach application was used we divided the entire catchment in two landscape units i evergreen oak forest occupying 51 of the total catchment area and ii deciduous beech forest occupying 49 of the total catchment area within each landscape unit riparian forest occupied 3 of the area and it was accounted for by combining five buckets upland quick layer upland soil layer riparian quick layer riparian soil layer and groundwater in appropriate proportions along the hillslope fig 3 analogously to lupon et al 2018 the upland quick and riparian quick layers represented the upper soil stratum that transmit water laterally to the stream only during large precipitation events in accordance to the dsl concept quantified in fig 2 we improved the lupon et al 2018 best parameterization in terms of model efficiency to calibrate the single 13 0 km2 drainage area by manually adjusting the model parameters in order to maximize the values of four performance metrics the resultant stream runoff simulation was slightly better than the one presented by lupon et al 2018 i e we obtained a i higher nash sutcliffe ns efficiency index nash and sutcliffe 1970 ii higher log ns iii lower relative volume differences rvd between observed and simulated stream runoff and iv variance of the simulated time series closer to that of the observed data i e the ratio of observed to simulated time series var was closer to 1 a detailed comparison between model parameters used by lupon et al 2018 and model parameters used here can be found in the supplementary material supplementary table a1 further information on model configuration and calibration is available in lupon et al 2018 in order to explore the potential influence of future extreme precipitation events on stream runoff generation and thereby on dsl positions we considered two different parameterizations first we used the aforementioned manual parameterization which produced relatively fast rainfall runoff responses hereafter referred as to fast under future extreme precipitation events we then obtained a second model parameterization derived from the former which simulated a lower capacity of the system to generate fast rainfall runoff responses under such extreme events hereafter referred as to slow for that we changed the persist parameter time constant of the upper soil layer in the two landscape units considered generally this parameter defines the residence time of water of a specified soil layer within the specified model structure at the upper soil layer defined as quick layer in the present application fig 3 it regulates the immediacy of stream runoff generation during large precipitation events as we have observed in previous model applications we increased the value of the quick layer time constant so that i the ns efficiency index during the calibration process was maintained within 5 of the original fast parameterization and ii the rvd was maintained within 5 original rvd was 3 1 these criteria defined our limits of acceptability for behavioural models during calibration sensu e g beven 2000 hence in the slow parameterization water was transmitted more slowly to the stream during large storms we expected that this small change in present day parameterizations i e changing the value of one model parameter within the limits of acceptability for behavioural models might have a disproportionate impact in future rainfall runoff model simulations that included extreme precipitation events not observed during calibration or the reference period we considered previous observations and independent sets of data for validating the model at font del regàs daily fluctuations in stream runoff can be used as a proxy for daily riparian evapotranspiration dynamics because they are strongly correlated with independent sap flow measurements from riparian trees lupon et al 2016 based on these previous empirical evidences we validated the model by assessing the fit of the linear relationship between monthly mean values of simulated daily riparian evapotranspiration and monthly mean values of observed daily stream runoff fluctuations for the two year calibration period i e n 24 we carried out a further model validation by comparing the empirical dsl curve derived from the observed stream runoff measurements with the simulated dsl curves derived from the simulated stream runoff from fast and slow parameterizations for the calibration period as a reminder for any given period the dsl curve displays the proportion of lateral water flux contribution at every cm in the riparian profile which is derived from the characterized rz groundwater table stream runoff relationship 3 4 future climate scenarios and dominant source layer projections because of its longer available time series we used data from turó de l home a meteorological station located ca 6 km southwest from the font del regàs meteorological station to construct daily time series of temperature and precipitation at the study catchment for the reference period 1981 2000 for this we used the linear regression models r2 0 90 p 0 001 n 53 described by lupon et al 2018 that related monthly mean temperature and monthly total precipitation at font del regàs and turó de l home stations for the period 2010 2014 supplementary fig a2 using 1981 2000 as a baseline we generated synthetic temperature and precipitation time series by considering the representative concentration pathway rcp projection changes for 2081 2100 provided by ipcc for mediterranean zones rcp scenarios project an increase in temperature all year round more pronounced in summer than in winter that ranges from 0 75 c in all seasons under the rcp2 5 percentile 0 25 scenario to 6 c in summer and autumn under the rcp8 5 percentile 0 75 scenario precipitation is projected to decrease in april september by as much as 35 under the rcp8 5 percentile 0 25 scenario while small changes are expected in october march including a slight increase of 5 under the rcp2 5 percentile 0 75 scenario we applied five scenarios for seasonal changes in both temperature and precipitation that covered the whole range of plausible rcp projections table 1 which resulted in an overall change in both temperature and precipitation for the whole 20 year data series for each scenario five inter event length scenarios were applied by uniformly increasing the duration of the dry spells in the reference period from 0 no change to 200 without changing the overall precipitation amount supplementary fig a3 hence the inter event length was calculated as the difference in days between the last day of a given rainfall event which defined the start of the dry spell and the first day of the following event which defined the end of the dry spell rainfall events separated by one day without precipitation were considered independent subsequently the length of the inter event duration in the reference period was increased by 0 50 100 150 and 200 by delaying the end of the dry spell accordingly to keep the water volume constant the total amount of precipitation registered during the days that were originally part of a rainfall event and subsequently part of the dry spell was added to the first day of the following rainfall event these scenarios were meant to represent extreme hydrological conditions i e longer dry spells followed by larger precipitation events folwell et al 2016 inter event length scenarios are of interest because the dsl position could vary not only as a consequence of changes in the magnitude of annual precipitation and average temperature but also because of an increase in the occurrence of hydrological extremes we combined each of the five inter event length scenarios considered with each of the five temperature and precipitation scenarios generating a total of 125 climate scenarios table 1 these 125 synthetic future climatic scenarios together with the reference scenario were run in persist using both the fast and slow parameterizations obtained during calibration in order to produce daily time series of stream runoff at font del regàs for the corresponding 20 year periods in a further step stream runoff was used to back calculate groundwater tables at the rz using the estimated rz groundwater table stream runoff relationship fig 2 subsequently the dsl position was characterized for each of the future scenarios and compared with the dsl position of the reference period using the quantification method described in section 3 2 for both fast and slow parameterization outputs relationships between changes in the dsl position and changes in climate variables were established following the scenario neutral method proposed by bussi et al 2016 briefly a response surface is created by comparing a variable of interest here the position of the simulated dsl with defined climatic stressors here changes in temperature precipitation and inter event length thus in order to analyze the impact of future climate variable changes on the long term position of the dsl changes in the median depth of the dsl50 as the movement up or down with respect to the reference 1981 2000 case were plotted against overall 20 year changes in temperature precipitation and inter event length for all future scenarios 4 results 4 1 stream runoff calibration and dominant source layer validation for the two year calibration period average annual precipitation and stream runoff values at font del regàs were respectively 1087 and 256 mm year 1 and therefore the average annual runoff coefficient was 0 24 persist was able to successfully simulate both the temporal pattern and the magnitude of stream runoff fig 4 model simulations were virtually equivalent between the two parameter sets corresponding to fast and slow runoff response parameterizations i e the difference in performance metrics for the calibration period obtained from these two parameterizations was minimal ns efficiencies important to fit high runoffs and log ns important to fit low runoffs equalled 0 91 for the fast parameterization while the values for these two metrics were 0 86 and 0 88 respectively for the slow parameterization the model slightly underestimated the total stream discharge by 3 1 fast parameterization and 4 6 slow parameterization the var important to ensure that observed and simulated series have similar variances was 0 97 for both parameterizations the small discrepancy between observed and the two sets of simulated data was mainly associated with two large precipitation events one in october 2010 four day accumulated rainfall of 144 mm and one in november 2011 147 mm on november 15 fig 4a b simulated riparian evapotranspiration and observed diel stream runoff fluctuations as a proxy for observed riparian evapotranspiration dynamics were strongly related linear regression r2 0 92 p 0 0001 n 24 which provided a satisfactory validation of the model fig 5 a furthermore there was a good agreement between the dsl curves derived from observed and simulated data from both the fast and slow parameterizations fig 5b for the observed data dsl50 was located between 86 and 106 cm below the soil surface b s s whereas the simulated dsl50 was between 84 and 104 cm b s s for the fast parameterization and between 85 and 105 cm b s s for the slow parameterization therefore the dsl thickness equalled 21 cm in all three cases analogously dsl90 was located between 68 and 124 cm b s s and between 65 and 121 cm b s s using the observed data and the simulated fast and slow data respectively i e dsl thickness equalled 57 cm in all three cases 4 2 reference and future projections of climate and stream runoff the reference period 1981 2000 was characterized by an average annual air temperature of 12 9 0 6 c average standard deviation and an average annual precipitation of 764 203 mm year 1 the average duration of consecutive days with no rainfall during this period i e average inter event length was 4 3 4 7 days and the average daily rainfall event amount was 5 9 10 9 mm day 1 future 2081 2100 temperature scenarios showed increased annual average values that ranged from 13 6 c in the less extreme scenario t1 to 18 1 c in the most extreme scenario t5 table 2 the driest future precipitation scenario p1 led to an average annual precipitation of 583 171 mm year 1 whereas the value for the wettest scenario p5 was 786 213 mm year 1 slightly higher than the reference one table 2 future average inter event length increased from scenario l1 same as reference to scenario l2 12 9 9 4 days the combination of precipitation and inter event length scenarios led to a wide range of average daily rainfall event amounts for the future periods ranging from 4 5 8 8 mm day 1 for the combined l1 and p1 scenarios to 25 34 mm day 1 for the combined l5 and p5 scenarios table 2 the reference period 1981 2000 showed an average annual simulated stream runoff of 86 and 84 mm year 1 for fast and slow parameterizations respectively the overall runoff coefficient was 0 11 in both cases although the inter annual variation of this parameter was large ranging from 0 03 to 0 25 fig 6 the distributions of both annual stream runoff and runoff coefficient were very similar between the fast and the slow parameterizations in the reference period the 125 future 2081 2100 scenarios also produced a large range of annual stream runoff conditions and runoff coefficients from 12 to 374 mm year 1 and from 0 03 to 0 30 respectively considering all 125 scenarios both the slow and the fast parameterization produced similar results at the lower end i e the drier scenarios of the distributions of both annual stream runoff and runoff coefficient by contrast the fast parameterization led to larger annual stream runoff and runoff coefficients than the slow parameterization at the upper end of the distributions i e the wetter scenarios fig 6 there was a positive relationship between annual precipitation and both annual stream runoff exponential regression r2 0 60 p 0 0001 and annual runoff coefficient exponential regression r2 0 43 p 0 0001 however as precipitation increased a wide range of possible stream runoff conditions and runoff coefficients were projected supplementary fig a4 4 3 reference and future dominant source layer projections dsl curves derived from future scenarios differed from the dsl curve of the reference period for both the fast and the slow parameterizations table 3 fig 7 a b the depth at which the maximum proportion of lateral water flux occurred shifted from 98 cm b s s in the reference period to 116 13 cm b s s for the combined fast and slow parameterization scenarios in the future the maximum depth for this descriptor was found at 128 cm b s s for six of the future scenarios in both fast and slow parameterizations the upper depth that contributed to lateral flow to the stream was located at 61 cm b s s for the reference period while this depth was deeper for the slow parameterization scenarios 65 4 cm b s s the fast parameterization led to the activation of shallower depths in the riparian profile up to 27 cm b s s table 3 fig 7a specifically for the most extreme inter event length scenarios l3 to l5 in tables 1 and 2 the upper and lower depths delimiting dsl50 for the reference scenario were 87 and 114 cm b s s respectively these upper and lower depths shifted respectively 10 and 15 cm down the riparian profile for the combined fast and slow parameterizations in the future scenarios by contrast the thickness of dsl50 was similar for both the reference and the future cases varying between 26 and 36 cm table 3 in its turn dsl90 for the reference period was constrained between 76 and 139 cm b s s resulting in a dsl thickness of 64 cm for the slow parametrization the future thickness of dsl90 was similar to that simulated for the reference period yet its upper and lower delimiting depths were on average 4 and 5 cm deeper table 3 for the fast parameterization the activation of shallower depths under the most extreme inter event length scenarios led to the vertical expansion of dsl90 along the soil profile fig 7a for example scenario t5 p1 l5 tables 1 2 had a dsl90 divided into a shallow stratum between 35 and 55 cm b s s and a deeper stratum between 82 and 154 cm b s s which together led to a total thickness of 92 cm the dsl position changed in response to changes in climate variables and the patterns were consistent for both the fast and slow parameterizations fig 8 the position of dsl50 rose by only 2 cm only for the wettest scenarios while it shifted down as much as 28 cm for the driest scenarios the dsl50 position responded similarly to changes in precipitation and temperature i e as the system became warmer and drier dsl50 moved down in the riparian profile in similar proportions fig 8a d by contrast the dsl50 position was relatively insensitive to changes in inter event length fig 8b c e f 4 4 characterization of the riparian soil profile the riparian soil profile consisted of a 10 to 15 cm organic horizon underlain by a semi organic layer with large number of roots down to 35 to 45 cm b s s a horizon the highest organic matter content up to ca 6 was measured closer to the surface and then decreased with depth down to ca 1 at 1 35 m b s s fig 7c carbon and nitrogen contents followed a similar pattern to the one observed for the organic matter and varied from 0 3 to 2 2 and from 0 03 to 0 2 respectively fig 7c d 5 discussion 5 1 overall persist model performance persist successfully reproduced stream runoff magnitude and dynamics at font del regàs as indicated by all performance metrics ns log ns rvd and var and by visual inspection of the hydrographs fig 4c the overall calibration period was exceptionally wet which led to an exceptionally high runoff coefficient and high annual stream runoff yet they were within the plausible reference and future conditions according to our simulations fig 6 supplementary fig a4 this could imply that the two parameterizations obtained during the calibration procedure were primarily balanced for wet conditions which could bias future hydrological projections however the calibration period also included typical summer droughts e g only 25 mm of rainfall were recorded in the combined months of june and july of 2012 we argue that the overall exceptionally wet calibration period which included occasional typical dry conditions allowed us to calibrate the model under a wide range of stream runoff circumstances from low base flow to infrequent high stream runoff peaks produced by seldom observed large rainfall events all in all we believe that having a set of overall wet and occasional dry conditions was favourable for calibrating the model simulating future conditions and developing our main objective despite the relatively short time series used in addition the exceptionally wide weather conditions encountered during the calibration period ensured that a wide range of rz groundwater table depths was also captured this is essential to construct reliable relationships between rz groundwater tables and stream runoff which are the basis for subsequent dsl estimations in font del regàs these two variables were more strongly related i e they showed a higher r2 than in similar studies conducted in the boreal ecoregion e g bishop et al 2011 ledesma et al 2016 which further confirms the suitability of our approach finally model validation via comparison of i observed stream runoff fluctuations as a proxy for observed riparian evapotranspiration and simulated riparian evapotranspiration and ii observed and simulated dsls was satisfactory fig 5 overall accurate and validated model simulations were achieved suggesting that the two model parameterizations fast and slow were robust and could be used for stream runoff simulations and dsl estimations under reference and future climate scenarios 5 2 dominant source layer projections and response to climate variable changes in order to explore the potential response of the dsl to changes in climate we considered a wide range of climatic conditions based on an ensemble of 125 synthetic climate scenarios that together went beyond the available climate model projections this approach helped understanding the long term sensitivity of the dsl position to changes in temperature total precipitation and inter event length and widely covered potential uncertainties arising from the estimation of future climate variables and model parameterization changes in temperature and total precipitation led to similar changes in the dsl position fig 8 suggesting that these two factors will be equally important in determining the location of important lateral water fluxes in the future an increase in temperature will likely increase both evaporative demand from the atmosphere and water demand from plants wang et al 2012 lupon et al 2018 this increase in evapotranspiration rates in the long term might lead to a drop in rz groundwater tables and thus dsls and a consequent decrease in lateral water exports from rzs to streams notably a decrease in precipitation will have a direct effect on the water balance by decreasing water availability further lowering dsls and lateral water exports in turn a decrease in water availability can also affect plant phenology and growth vicente serrano et al 2013 and promote changes in vegetation that might further change evapotranspiration patterns in the rz peñuelas and boada 2003 poblador et al 2019 yet and in a desire for simplicity we did not consider possible changes in either vegetation cover or evapotranspiration patterns associated with future changes in climatic conditions further studies exploring this type of questions would be needed which could be especially important because the overall effect of climate change on evapotranspiration patterns is a complex issue still under debate matheny et al 2014 yu et al 2016 teuling et al 2019 on the other hand the dsl position was relatively insensitive to changes in inter event length for both fast and slow parameterizations for the overall 20 year periods fig 8 changes in inter event length modify the intra annual distribution of precipitation which in the most extreme scenarios can lead to i periods of very low and deep lateral water transfer from rzs to streams and ii activation of shallow conductive riparian layers in response to large rainfall events during the overall 20 year period inter annual compensatory effects may be concealing these two phenomena which could partially explain why temperature and total precipitation but not inter event length were the most important climate variables driving long term trends in the dsl position yet extreme precipitation events could cause sporadic hydrological activations of shallow rz layers i e organic and a horizons above 35 cm b s s poblador et al 2017 especially for the fast parameterization simulations fig 7a according to our simulations the frequency of daily events for which rz layers above 35 cm b s s will be hydrologically connected to the stream may increase with increasing inter event length i e from l1 to l5 scenarios supplementary fig a5 inter event length scenarios l2 to l5 included rainfall events larger than 200 mm day 1 and up to 268 mm day 1 which led to a range of associated daily simulated stream runoffs of 37 to 79 mm day 1 for the fast parameterization and of 0 1 to 6 4 mm day 1 for the slow parameterization these numbers highlight the discrepancy between the two parameterizations in simulating peaks in stream runoff under exceptionally large precipitation inputs in the future in light of their different outcomes the question that arises is whether the fast or the slow parameterizations considered in the present study yield realistic future scenario results rainfall events larger than 200 mm day 1 have been recorded on several occasions in the nw mediterranean region gonzález hidalgo et al 2003 llasat et al 2013 and so it is conceivable that they could occur anytime at font del regàs ledesma et al 2021 unfortunately most of these events do not have associated runoff data from neighboring forest headwater streams because catchments are generally ungauged and no systematic stream runoff measurements are available llasat et al 2013 consequently understanding runoff generation during extremely large rainfall events in these systems is challenging and stream runoff peaks appear to be strongly dependent on antecedent soil moisture conditions àvila et al 1992 bernal et al 2002 lana renault et al 2014 this dependency likely led to the wide range of simulated stream runoff conditions and runoff coefficients associated with high overall precipitation at the annual scale observed here supplementary fig a4 as an example in the context of this discussion a stream runoff peak of 52 mm day 1 was recorded in march 2013 at a forest headwater catchment close to font del regàs as a response to a two day rainfall event of 163 mm ledesma et al 2019 by contrast the peak in stream runoff recorded at font del regàs during the calibration period was 7 5 mm day 1 as a response to a two day rainfall event of 154 mm fig 4 thus we cannot be certain whether the fast or the slow parameterization produced more realistic outcomes and the true answer probably lies somewhere in between a way to overcome this limitation caused by epistemic uncertainty is to include a wide range of climatic conditions and contrasting model parameterizations in order to cover the range of plausible outcomes as we have done here epistemic uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge about how to represent a catchment system in terms of both model structure and parameters and may include things that have not yet been perceived as being important but which might result in reduced model performance when surprise events occur beven 2016 here we showed that even a minimalist approach to epistemic uncertainty using only a single model and changing a single parameter gave rise to a broad range of system behaviours when indeed surprise events i e extremely large precipitation events in future scenarios were present in the simulations such events were missing in the calibration period and the reference scenario when by contrast the fast and slow model parameterizations led to virtually equivalent stream runoff simulations future modelling work could improve on the work presented here by considering specific hydrological processes that could have greater relevance under future climate conditions for instance the hydrological activation of shallow rz layers might be constrained by the actual physical capacity of the soils to first infiltrate and subsequently transfer water laterally to the stream during extreme precipitation events these events can be associated with rapid runoff generation overland flow and destructive flash floods in mediterranean catchments llasat et al 2013 in its present form the dsl approach does not directly account for overland flow generation over unsaturated soils as it is based on the static logarithmic relationship between rz groundwater tables and stream runoff moreover the present approach does not consider the occurrence of reverse hydraulic gradients from the stream to the rz which may occur during dry periods in mediterranean catchments butturini et al 2003 lupon et al 2016 and may become more important under drier and warmer conditions nevertheless these dry period related situations entail very low transfer of both water and solutes independently on the direction of movement and are not as critical in the context of matter transfer as hydrological processes associated with extreme rainfall events despite these limitations the approach used here which combines the use of a well established rainfall runoff model and the well grounded dsl conceptual model provides a framework for hypothesis testing and prediction that can be useful to infer potential consequences of future climate for the transfer of water and solutes from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems and thus for surface water quantity and quality in mediterranean headwaters and similar systems located elsewhere 5 3 implications for surface water quality future changes in the dsl position will likely imply changes in the chemical signal transferred from the rz to the stream and thus in surface water quality at font del regàs the predicted range of change was wide from a shift up of 2 cm to a shift down of 28 cm though the general trend shown by most scenarios was towards moving down for instance the depth with the maximum contribution to lateral water flux is projected to move down an average of 18 13 cm from 98 to 116 cm b s s table 3 and many scenarios showed the maximum contributing depth as low as at 125 to 128 cm b s s fig 7 notably the soil chemistry associated with the deeper rz layers providing most of the lateral water flux in the future scenarios is different from the rz layers that contributed the most to the lateral water flux in the reference period in particular deeper rz layers showed lower organic matter carbon and nitrogen content as usually reported for forests soils jobbágy and jackson 2000 2001 this suggests that the future drop in the dsl position at font del regàs will entail a lower transfer of dissolved organic matter from the rz to the stream not only because of the anticipated decrease in water fluxes but also because dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen concentrations in rz water will likely be lower this potential outcome is relevant because dissolved organic matter inputs from terrestrial ecosystems are an important energy source for aquatic organisms and thus future declines could disrupt stream metabolism ecosystem productivity and food web structure elser et al 2000 bernal et al 2018 at the same time carbon budgets and cycling could be disrupted by a decrease in lateral carbon exports to illustrate potential changes in lateral doc exports and concentrations under future climate conditions we annually integrated the daily product of simulated lateral flow and measured carbon content in the riparian profile for the most extreme scenarios and compared the resulting lateral doc export and flow weighted concentration with the reference scenario we based these calculations on the fast parametrization simulations which were more conservative because the sporadic activation of shallow organic rich rz layers during large storm events could partially compensate for future declines in lateral doc exports and concentrations for this rough approximation we assumed that i measured carbon content pattern in the profile was representative of the entire rz and did not substantially change over time jobbágy and jackson 2000 and ii measured carbon content was proportional to riparian soil water doc concentrations hope et al 1997 evans et al 2006 the scenario with no changes in inter event length and the warmest driest future climate t5 p1 l1 table 2 resulted in a 65 lower water transfer a 71 lower doc transfer and a 19 lower annual average doc flow weighted concentration the equivalent scenario with the maximum increase in inter event length t5 p1 l5 only moderately compensated for these climatic changes resulting in a 54 lower water transfer a 60 lower doc transfer and a 12 lower annual average doc flow weighted concentration these heuristic calculations suggest that even in those cases for which the activation of shallow hydrological flow paths could offset declines in carbon export future declines in the dsl will alter carbon cycling and in stream processes in subhumid and semiarid mediterranean forest catchments that experience the proposed climate changes by substantially decreasing lateral carbon fluxes bernal et al 2019 moreover it is unlikely that rapid and intermittent inputs from shallow flow paths could sustain the ecological status of the aquatic environment in the long term such a pattern of inputs would likely have other undesirable consequences for the stability of stream ecosystems including high rates of bank erosion and transport of sediments as well as damage or scouring of stream and riparian biota fisher et al 1982 ledesma et al 2019 6 conclusions and further investigations this study combined the dsl concept and the use of climate scenarios in a rainfall runoff model to estimate future changes in the vertical position of predominant lateral water fluxes from the rz to the stream in a subhumid mediterranean catchment our model exercise illustrates that small changes in present day calibrations represented by rainfall runoff model parameterizations can have a significant impact on future projections of stream runoff two model parameterizations simulated the same stream runoff in the calibration period but produced significant differences in stream runoff responses under future scenarios with extreme precipitation events this is the result of epistemic uncertainty a common limitation in hydrological models and which can only be overcome with more data and information and hence more measurements investigations and understanding and that should be treated subjectively based on expert judgment beven and smith 2015 here we attempted to treat uncertainty in this way by using two contrasting behavioural parameterizations together with an ensemble of 125 synthetic climate scenarios as we consider it to be the most sensible approach for integrating hydrological modelling climate change projections and water resources management in catchments worldwide we showed that the dsl of riparian lateral water fluxes in mediterranean headwaters such as font del regàs will likely drop down in the future as a consequence of both an increase in average temperature and a decrease in total precipitation our simulations suggest that the dsl position is not sensitive to changes in inter event length though longer dry spells and larger rainfall events could lead to the sporadic hydrological activation of shallow organic rich soil layers in the rz overall these changes in predominant lateral flow paths will lead to i declines in lateral water export and in doc and likely other organic nutrients concentrations and exports from rzs to these mediterranean streams for most of the year and ii an increasing importance of extreme rainfall episodes on annual water balances this study highlights that the dsl concept in combination with the use of rainfall runoff models offer a simple and useful framework to assess stream water quantity and quality in forest headwaters worldwide this type of approaches can e g help to constrain lateral carbon exports from terrestrial ecosystems to inland waters which is critical to quantify global carbon balances tank et al 2018 studies of changes in the location of the dsl between wet and dry periods are needed in future applications aiming to investigate finer temporal scale patterns in hydrological processes and runoff generation changes associated with climate variation the inclusion of vegetation change scenarios associated with climate change as well as a dynamic rz groundwater table stream runoff relationship that accounts for potential seasonal variability will also be important to project possible future changes in the water balance more rigorously in conclusion an integrative dsl approach is needed for the management of water resources in forest headwater catchments credit authorship contribution statement josé l j ledesma conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

learning models proffer an empirically based approach to predicting water temperatures with a high degree of accuracy this study explores the potential of long short term neural network lstm a type of deep learning method to forecast daily river water temperatures and quantify temporal variations in thermal regime induced by changes in climate and by dam construction the performance of lstm is compared with that of several other models using daily water temperature data for nine river gauges around the world in a detailed analysis the models are evaluated for the yichang gauge on the yangtze river to reconstruct the natural thermal conditions and help to assess daily water temperature variations induced by operation of the three gorges reservoir tgr the collective results show that lstm outperforms other methods for predicting mean daily water temperature in rivers capturing accurately mean daily variations in thermal regime the construction of the tgr strongly influenced water temperature variations at yichang producing the strongest cooling effect from mid april to mid may and the greatest warming effect in late december and early january these marked effects are

human influence now referred to as the anthropocene in the past several decades two classes of water temperature models physical based and data driven models have been developed physical based models are based on heat budget equations and require site specific data that are unavailable for many river systems thus the geographic extent over which such models can be implemented is limited grabowski

deep learning models can meet the challenge to predict accurately daily variations in thermal regime variations under the influence of anthropogenic perturbations requires further investigation the goals of this paper are twofold 1 to evaluate the forecasting performance of an lstm model to predict mean daily river temperatures compared to that of several other river temperature predictive models and 2 to use the lstm to reconstruct the expected daily natural thermal regime of a regulated river that would occur in the absence of a dam and to identify factors influencing daily variations in the thermal regime of this river the results improve the proficiency to predict an important factor mean daily wt related to the environmental quality of river systems and also provide a new tool in evaluating the thermal regime variations in rivers regulated by dams 2 data for model calibration and verification to assess the performance of lstm in daily wt forecasting relative to other

table 1 in addition to providing information for evaluating model performance daily data on at q and wt for the yichang gauge located 44 km downstream from the tgr provided an opportunity to evaluate the capability of the different models to accurately reconstruct daily water temperatures that would occur in the absence of a large reservoir past work has indicated that water temperatures at yichang are strongly affected by the tgr liu et al 2018 to quantify the potential effects of tgr on the yangtze river thermal regime data on yichang were divided into a pre tgr calibration period 1983

validation period in the absence of tgr a necessary reconstruction for identifying the impacts of climate change and the tgr on wt the tgr began to fill in june 2003 to raise the water level of the reservoir to 135 m during the second filling stage of tgr from october 2006 to september 2008 the water level reached 156 m subsequently it rose to 173 m in november 2008 and by the end of october 2010 the third filling the reservoir water level was raised to its designed normal pool level of 175 m zhang et al 2012 since that time the water level of tgr has been lowered to 145 m for flood control during mid june to late september and then raised to 175 m for power generation from january to march liu et al 2015 zheng 2016 3 methodology 3 1 long short term memory neural network lstm lstm is a special kind of recurrent neural network rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 rnn has a recurrent hidden unit to deal with sequential data and the output of each time step serves as the input to the next time step a single rnn model updates only a single past state and it is trained by the backpropagation through time algorithm mozer 1989 werbos 1990 by which the loss function is propagated backward to determine updates to weights with simple recurrent networks backpropagation encounters the vanishing gradient problem in which the training signal becomes exponentially small as it propagates into the network making backpropagation ineffective for deep networks shen 2018 the lstm is a special variation of rnn which can effectively avoid the vanishing gradient problem of rnn lstm consists of an input layer one or more lstm layers one or more fully connected layers and an output layer the key to lstm is the hidden neurons in the lstm layer called memory cells lstm cells which not only receive information from the input layer but also perceive the information at the previous moment olah 2015 the lstm layer consists of two kinds of state the hidden state and the cell state at each time step the hidden state contains the output of the lstm layer for this time step and the cell state contains the information learned from the previous time steps the lstm cells use three gates the forget gate f t the input gate i t and the output gate o t to control the level of cell state reset forget the level of cell state update and the level of cell state added to the hidden state respectively fig 1 a the lstm layer uses the tanh as the activation function to update the cell and hidden state and the sigmoid function are used in the calculations for the gates the working mechanism of lstm layer can be expressed as following olah 2015 xiao et al 2019 1 f t σ w f x x t w f h h t 1 b f 2 i t σ w i x x t w i h h t 1 b i 3 o t σ w o x x t w o h h t 1 b o 4 c t tanh

weight matrices of the three gates and the candidate value b f b i b o and b c denote corresponding bias vectors represents the element wise multiplication between two vectors σ is the logistic sigmoid activation function tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function and h t is the output of lstm layer at time step t the working mechanism and data flows of lstm fig 1 involve several steps first the input data x t at time step t and the hidden state of the previous moment h t 1 flow to the forget gate to determine how much previous information should be removed from the cell state the data are transformed to a range from 0 to 1 by the sigmoid activation function σ with a value of one indicating completely keep it and a value of zero signaling completely remove it the retained information in the hidden state flows to the input gate where it serves as new input information to the memory cell for updating the cell state then the new candidate value c t is generated which is stored in the cell state c t finally the updated cell state c t flows to the output gate which controls the information within the cell state that is propagated to the hidden variable state at the next time step based on the lstm a 4 layer deep neural network model is constructed for wt forecasting this model consists of an input layer a lstm layer a fully connected layer and an output layer fig 1 b the number of lstm cells is set to a range of 30 to 50 by the trial and error method table s1 and a dropout value of 0 5 is applied empirically to help prevent overfitting yan et al 2020 zhang

piccolroaz 2015 it has a high degree of accuracy for wt forecasting cai et al 2018 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 in the model at is assumed to be the main proxy for the heat flux exchange at the air water interface and q is introduced to account for the water inflows and river thermal inertia in this study the most complete eight parameter a1 a8 formulation was used namely the a2s 8 model the

forest rf random forest rf breiman 2001 is one of the most successful predictors based on bagging a type of ensemble method applied to decision trees rf integrates a series of independently selected and identically distributed decision trees and obtains the final single prediction by averaging the outputs of all decision trees in the forest svetnik et al 2003 in rf each node has d features of the base decision tree d features are selected randomly from the feature set d features and then the optimal feature is chosen by the gini impurity index ig for the best split threshold strobl et al 2008 the ig can be expressed as follows breiman 2001 heddam et al 2020 9 i g f 1 i 1 m f i 2 where fi denotes the probability of class i at node m and the best split threshold is indicated by the lowest value of ig the number of decision trees in the rf model in this study was determined from trial and error by varying the volume of trees from 100 to 300 table s2 3 2 3 back propagation neural network bpnn back propagation neural network bpnn is a kind of multilayer feedforward neural network rumelhart et al 1988 which consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer a three layer bpnn was used in this study the main characteristics of bpnn are forward transmission of signals and back propagation of errors the data transmit layer by layer in the forward transmission process and the errors generated by the comparisons between the predicted and observed values are back propagated to each layer thereby adjusting the weights and thresholds of the neurons until the error meets the termination condition the number of hidden neurons is the primary requirement for the design of bpnn if there are too many hidden neurons there is too much flexibility which usually leads to an over fitting phenomenon in which a neural network is good at dealing with one dataset at the expense of being very bad at assessing other datasets tetko et al 1995 however too few hidden neurons restrict the learning capability of the model haykin 1998 thus the number of neurons in the hidden layer were determined by the trial and error approach in the range of 1 16 yan et al 2020 the bpnn model was trained over this range at an interval of one and the number of hidden layer neurons in the hidden layer that had the highest performance validation period was retained for the calibrated model table s3 considering both the prediction accuracy and the running time of model when the prediction accuracy can be achieved with fewer neurons as well as with more neurons the value of fewer neurons is used 3 3 data pre processing because differences in absolute values of the training testing time series have a negative effect on the model learning ability the data on at q and wt were standardized before training as 10 x norm x raw x σ x where x raw is the original data x norm is the standardized value of variable x x and σ x are the average value and standard deviation of respectively 3 4 model performance indicators model performance is evaluated using four different and widely employed metrics for water temperature forecasting graf et al 2019 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 moriasi et al 2015 the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the coefficient of determination r2 and they are given by 11

samples and y p and y o y o are the predicted and observed values respectively the smallest values of mae and rmse and values of nse and r2 closest to 1 indicate the highest prediction accuracy 4 results 4 1 model performance for daily wt forecasting comparison of the performances of the four models in predicting the mean annual daily wt for the calibration and validation periods for the nine gauges indicates that lstm outperformed the other models for both periods table 2 in particular for the validation periods for all gauges but yichang which is influenced strongly by the tgr the lstm model has values of mae 0 83 c values of rmse 1 00 c and values of nse and r2 0 90 these results are clearly better than those obtained from the a2s 8 air2stream in 8 parameter version rf and bpnn models fig 2 which have lower nse and r2 values and higher mae and rmse values than the lstm model averaged for the eight gauges excluding yichang the lstm model lowered mean mae and rmse values for the validation period by 13 96 and 13 68 respectively compared to a2s 8 by 44 52 and 44 46 respectively compared to rf and by 42 66 and 42 32 respectively compared to bpnn noticeably the lstm model performed much better than the a2s 8 model at the datong irondequoit and davos stations and performed slightly better than all other models for the cedar and sion stations table 2 with regard to the three benchmark models the a2s 8 model produced higher accuracy with substantially lower values of mean mae and rmse during the validation period than the rf model 36 03 and 36 53 respectively and the bpnn model 33 81 and 33 94 respectively furthermore the performance of the rf model was slightly worse than the bpnn model although mean values of the four metrics showed no significant differences given the wide distributions of the metrics for these two models fig 2 for yichang the mae rmse nse and r2 of the lstm for the calibration period pre tgr period 1983 2002 were 0 61 c 0 78 c 0 98 and 0 98 respectively table 2 indicating the lstm had a superior training effect compared to the other three models compared to the other eight gauges with no reservoir effects the performances of all four models deteriorated substantially for the yichang gauge in the validation period post tgr 2003 2013 this result is not surprising given the strong influence of the tgr on water temperatures in the post tgr period the average annual wt at yichang in post tgr period increased by 0 67 c relative to pre tgr period this change was accompanied by changes in at and q the average annual at in the pre tgr period 1983 2002 was 17 00 c and increased to 17 50 c in the post tgr period 2003 2013 whereas the average annual q in the post tgr decreased by 8 83 compared to the pre tgr value these changes challenge the capacity of the calibrated models to forecast conditions following reservoir construction nevertheless the lstm model still performed better than the other three models in the validation period overall the forecasting performances for all nine gauges are ranked as lstm a2s 8 bpnn rf 4 2 determining impacts of climate and dam construction on wt at yichang because the lstm model performed best for predicting mean daily water temperatures in the post tgr validation period for the yichang gauge this model was used to determine the impacts of climate as reflected in changes in air temperature and discharge and dam construction on the mean daily thermal regime at this location to conduct this analysis the post tgr period was divided into three subperiods sp sp1 135 m impoundment jun 2003 sep 2006 sp2 156 m impoundment oct 2006 sep 2008 and sp3 175 m impoundment oct 2008 dec 2013 for all three subperiods the annual pattern of mean daily at fluctuated around the pattern of mean daily at for the pre tgr period fig 3 a c with mean fluctuations of 0 59 c in sp1 0 74 c in sp2 and 0 39 c in sp3 observed mean daily q values for the three post dam subperiods qpost tgr red lines decreased in the flood season june to october and increased in the dry season january march relative to the pre tgr period qpre tgr green lines with the most pronounced differences occurring for sp3 fig 3 d f for wt the annual pattern of mean daily values following the closure of the tgr reservoir shows that wt relative to the pre tgr period increased from september february and decreased from march through june fig 3 g i to reconstruct wt in the absence of the reservoir which mainly affects discharge of the yangtze river measured values of q at yichang gauge were replaced in the calibrated lstm model with the daily inflow discharge to the tgr qpost tgr non tgr the q that would have occurred at yichang in the absence of the tgr these inflow values of q reported by the china three gorges operation are derived from information on the change in water storage in the tgr a storage capacity curve for the reservoir and the outflow of the tgr the reconstructed natural discharge qpost tgr non tgr blue lines for sp1 did not show obvious differences compared with the observed values of q qpost tgr red lines for this period fig 3 d the qpost tgr non tgr for sp2 exhibited an increase in october but the rest of the period was similar to qpost tgr fig 3 e notably the reconstructed discharges qpost tgr non tgr for sp3 are greater than observed qpost tgr for the flood season june october and lower than the observed qpost tgr in the dry season january march fig 3 f this increase in the range of mean daily discharge over the year for the reconstructed inflow qpost tgr non tgr compared to the observed qpost tgr reflects the influence of the tgr on flow extremes as it is operated for flood control and power generation the reconstructed discharges qpost tgr non tgr along with measured values of at were used to predict the wt for the 2003 2013 period that would have occurred in the absence of the tgr based on these predictions the impacts of the tgr δ tgr and climate change δ cli on mean daily wt at yichang were quantified as 15 δ tot w t obs p o s t t g r w t obs p r e t g r 16 δ cli w t sim p o s t t g r w t sim p r e t g r 17 δ tgr w t obs p o s t t g r w t sim p o s t t g r 18 ε w t sim p r e t g r w t obs p r e t g r where δ tot represents the total change of wt before and after dam δ cli is the contribution of changes in at and natural discharge to change in wt δ tgr is the change in wt ascribed to the construction of tgr assuming no other human perturbations except for the tgr ε is the bias of model i e mean error w t obs p o s t t g r and w t obs p r e t g r are observed values of wt in the post tgr and pre tgr periods respectively w t sim p o s t t g r is the simulated wt in the absence of the tgr using the lstm model with the reconstructed discharge qpost tgr non tgr and the observed at as the inputs w t sim p r e t g r is the simulated wt in the pre tgr period based on the observed q and at and δ tot δ cli δ tgr ε with regard to determining the influence of the tgr on wt the model can be considered reliable if ε δ tgr under these conditions the error associated with model bias is much smaller than the predicted impact of the tgr on wt the results are presented in a compact form by the climatological reference year in which the value of a variable for each day of the year is the average of all available observed values for that day over the period of record 29 february of leap year was not included cai et al 2018 simulations using the lstm model reveal that the absolute value of ε 0 02 c is small compared to absolute values of δ tgr indicating that the model is reliable for determining the influence of the tgr on wt the largest absolute values of ε for particular months occur in august and september but generally ε 0 5 δ tgr table 3 a comparison between the observed wt in the post tgr period the predicted wt after tgr and the predicted wt in the assumed case without tgr was shown in fig 4 it can be clearly seen that the predicted wt in the post tgr wtpost tgr sim green lines are not close to the observed values after tgr wtpost tgr red lines and the green lines are also significant substantially different from the blue lines the predicted wt in the assumed case without tgr the lstm was trained based on the statistical relationships for the observed wt observed q and the observed wt observed at in the pre tgr period although the observed q did not show significant alterations to the reconstructed q in the sp1 and sp2 but they are significantly different in the sp3 the period of strong forcing by meaning the forcing by tgr furthermore the statistical relationships between wt q was clearly disturbed in the post tgr liu et al 2018 thus the wtpost tgr sim green lines predicted by the lstm model which was trained by the pre tgr data showed obvious differences both to the wtpost tgr red lines and the wtpost tgr non tgr blue lines this indicated the importance of reconstructing the natural discharges that have occurred without tgr before predicting the wt in the absence of the dam the operation of tgr δ tgr is the major factor contributing to change in mean annual water temperature before and after the construction of the reservoir accounting for 93 of the increase in wt δ tot for sp1 81 of the increase for sp2 and 119 of the increase for sp3 table 3 by contrast changes in wt related to at and natural discharge climate range from 11 sp1 to 22 sp2 thus most change in wt at yichang before and after the construction of the tgr can be attributed to the influence of the reservoir rather than to changes in climate reservoir construction also is the major factor contributing to change in seasonal variation of wt before and after reservoir construction cooling in warm seasons march june and warming in cold seasons september february are mainly attributable to the operation of tgr consistent with the results of cai et al 2018 the largest effects of forcing by the tgr occur in april and december during the 175 m impoundment table 3 in april values of δ tgr of 2 19 c sp1 3 32 c sp2 and 3 38 c sp3 accounted for 183 sp1 123 sp2 and 98 sp3 of total cooling whereas in december values of δ tgr of 1 98 c sp1 3 99 c sp2 and 4 27 c sp3 accounted for 103 of total warming in all three post tgr subperiods variations in mean daily wt induced by climate change fig 3 j l δ cli green lines fluctuate above and below the value of zero throughout the year resulting in small average annual δ cli values of 0 05 c sp1 0 15 c sp2 and 0 12 c sp3 table 3 climate induced change is most distinct in april average δ cli 0 64 c for the three subperiods and september average δ cli 0 68 c for the three subperiods in general climate change had its largest impact on wt at yichang during sp2 with a range of 1 67 c δ cli 2 04 c the smallest effect was for sp3 where 1 18 c δ cli 1 15 c the annual pattern of changes in wt induced by the tgr δ tgr blue lines matches the total wt changes δ tot red lines fig 3 j l for all three subperiods confirming the major role of the tgr in producing changes in water temperature patterns of δ tgr by day for each month and each subperiod fig 5 illuminate in greater detail the monthly patterns table 3 these patterns confirm that the tgr acted as a cold source from the beginning of march to early july and a warm source from mid july to late february this pattern reflects the large thermal inertia of the tgr which delays the seasonal circle of wt toffolon et al 2010 cai et al 2018 more precisely the tgr effects can be roughly divided into four stages increasing cooling from march through mid may decreasing cooling from mid may through early july increasing warming from mid july to december and decreasing warming during january and february the largest cooling effects occurred in early april to early may and the most substantial warming happened in late december and early january the effect of increasing the water level or volume of water in the tgr is evident for cooling in that the amount of maximum cooling increases between sp1 and the two later subperiods by about 1 5 c moreover between sp2 and sp3 the timing of maximum cooling shifts from the beginning of april to the beginning of may the duration of maximum cooling also increases from sp2 to sp3 in general warming from mid july to late february increases as reservoir level increases sp1 to sp3 with this effect most pronounced in january and february when temperature increases for sp3 clearly exceed those for sp1 and sp2 these patterns generally reflect an increase in thermal inertia as the volume of the reservoir increases toffolon et al 2010 5 discussion a comparison between the deep learning method lstm and three benchmark models air2stream rf and bpnn at nine gauges on seven different rivers in different physiographic settings demonstrates the improved forecasting accuracy of lstm for predicting mean daily water temperatures based on air temperature and discharge previous studies using data for six of the nine gauges three swiss and three usa gauges zhu et al 2019b piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 examined in the present study revealed that the air2stream model outperformed conventional data driven methods feedforward neural network gaussian process regression decision tree the mohseni et al 1998 model the van vliet et al 2006 model linear regression the present study compared the air2stream model 8 parameter version to random forest rf and back propagation neural network bpnn the a2s 8 model outperformed than the rf and bpnn at the same studied gauges but did not perform as well as the lstm in contrast although the improvements by lstm for the mae and rmse relative to the a2s 8 were relatively small at two of the gauges 1 7 5 6 and 1 2 2 7 respectively the lstm decreased the mae and rmse at four of the gauges by 8 8 26 4 and 11 5 23 1 respectively the reason why the lstm outperforms than the benchmark models is the input and output of lstm are considered as a two time series sequence the lstm is deep in time which not only updates the past state but also can learn when to forget and how long to keep the state information shen 2018 the calibrated lstm model successfully reconstructed the daily water temperatures at yichang on the yangtze river that would occur in the absence of tgr which helped to quantify the influence of changes in air temperature and discharge surrogates for the influence of climate versus the influence of the tgr on changes in mean daily water temperatures at yichang past studies have revealed that tgr has changed the thermal regime of the yangtze river on the annual and seasonal scale using the air2stream model and non reconstructed q cai et al 2018 or using the linear regression model and reconstructed q from a conventional artificial neural network model tao et al 2020 the differences between the observed wt in the post tgr the predicted wt after tgr and the predicted wt in the assumed case without tgr demonstrated it s necessary to reconstruct the natural discharge q that would occur in the absence of tgr before reconstructing the wt without the dam fig 4 in addition the results of the present study confirm the efficiency of lstm to reconstruct natural thermal conditions in the absence of a large reservoir these results also indicate that that climate change has had a small impact on mean daily wt change at yichang fig 3 a finding consistent with previous efforts to unravel the effects of climate related and dam related effects on wt at yichang tao et al 2020 the daily timescale resolution of the analysis shows that the inertial effects of the reservoir affect the thermal regime of the yangtze river under its present operational stage 175 m by producing periods of increasing cooling in the spring decreasing cooling in early summer increasing warming from mid summer to early winter and decreasing warming in mid late winter the greatest cooling occurs in mid april to mid may cooling and the greatest warming in late december and early january in short lstm acts as a useful new tool to predict the daily water temperatures and to detect at high temporal resolution the impacts of climate change and reservoirs on the thermal regime of rivers the analysis in the present study assumes that the construction of tgr is the main significant anthropogenic perturbation during the post tgr period previous work that has attempted to decompose the changes in the thermal regime of the yangtze river at yichang suggests that other factors such as land use change or sewage discharges may have impacts on wt cai et al 2018 tao et al 2020 the effect of sewage discharge has been estimated as 0 1 c cai et al 2018 which is small compared to the total wt change before and after dam the effect of other factors such as land use are difficult to quantify according to the tao et al 2020 model warming in wt at yichiang related to the tgr occurred only from december through february in sp3 otherwise the tgr produced cooling during all seasons in sp1 sp2 and sp3 these results differ from those of the lstm model which indicate that the tgr has produced warming in wt over a substantial portion of the year july through february especially in sp3 the tao et al 2020 model attributed impacts related to factors other than at q and the tgr including other human impacts to a factor δ β 0 which contributed substantially to wt variations however the extent to which the factor δ β 0 isolates non reservoir related effects specifically other human related effects such as land use changes remains uncertain and is in need of further investigation differences between the predictions of the tao et al 2020 model and lstm model may also partly reflect modelling uncertainty e g the selection of prediction model the scenario reconstruction in the absence of tgr the model bias and the time scale used for analysis monthly versus daily full consideration of the impacts of other factors such as land use change on water temperature regimes requires comprehensive data on this change which is beyond the scope of the present study but which can be considered in future research although land use effects could be important the close association of the pattern of total change in wt with the pattern of change associated with the tgr fig 3 j l implies that the total change is associated mainly with the effect of the reservoir 6 conclusions this study has verified that a deep learning model lstm is a powerful tool for accurately forecasting river water temperatures and for reconstructing natural thermal regimes at a daily timescale that would occur in the absence of a large dam major conclusions include lstm outperformed three benchmark models air2stream rf bpnn based on metrics of predictive accuracy for nine gauges on seven rivers in china the united states and switzerland lstm predictions of river water temperatures in the absence of the three gorges reservoir indicate that the reservoir has had a much larger impact on changes in temperature than have changes in climate the influence of the dam on water temperatures has been greatest in the spring mid april to mid may when it has produced cooling of about 4 c and in early winter late december to early january when it has produced warming of about the same amount additional testing and evaluation of the deep learning approach to forecasting river water temperatures is needed to determine the extent to which this approach can be generalized as with all data driven approaches the capability of the model to predict accurately beyond the domain of the data used in model calibration remains unclear nevertheless the present study indicates that in cases where forecasting is a primary aim the method provides accurate predictions when calibrated using historical river data for on water temperature discharge and air temperature it also shows that the method is useful for deciphering how human related disturbances such as reservoir construction have influenced thermal regimes of rivers in this sense the deep learning model not only is a powerful forecasting tool but also is capable of providing explanatory insight into causes in changes in river water temperature credit

4777,accurate water temperature forecasting is essential for understanding thermal regimes of rivers in the context of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances such as dam construction machine learning models proffer an empirically based approach to predicting water temperatures with a high degree of accuracy this study explores the potential of long short term neural network lstm a type of deep learning method to forecast daily river water temperatures and quantify temporal variations in thermal regime induced by changes in climate and by dam construction the performance of lstm is compared with that of several other models using daily water temperature data for nine river gauges around the world in a detailed analysis the models are evaluated for the yichang gauge on the yangtze river to reconstruct the natural thermal conditions and help to assess daily water temperature variations induced by operation of the three gorges reservoir tgr the collective results show that lstm outperforms other methods for predicting mean daily water temperature in rivers capturing accurately mean daily variations in thermal regime the construction of the tgr strongly influenced water temperature variations at yichang producing the strongest cooling effect from mid april to mid may and the greatest warming effect in late december and early january these marked effects are most prominent at the highest water levels in the tgr the enhanced predictive capabilities of the lstm model provide a powerful tool for water temperature forecasting and ecological management of

environmental quality of rivers as well as the potential for change in thermal regimes related to human impacts a critical need exists to forecast accurately river temperatures in an era of increasing human influence now referred to as the anthropocene in the past several decades two classes of water temperature models physical based and data driven models have been developed physical based models are based on heat budget equations and require site specific data that are unavailable for many river systems thus the geographic extent over which such models can be implemented is limited grabowski et al 2016 jackson et al 2018 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2019 data driven models mainly use statistical or data mining techniques to model wt as a function of other explanatory variables such as air temperature and discharge air temperature at is commonly assumed to be the essential predictor for wt because variations in at can be viewed as a surrogate for net changes in heat flux at the air water interface van vliet et al 2013 ficklin et al 2013 discharge q acts as an additional explanatory variable that can strongly influence wt webb et al 2003 van vliet et al 2011 recent studies have

deposition and habitat suitability of aquatic animals e g chai et al 2019 li et al 2011 yi et al 2010 wang et al 2016 2018 a few studies have explored the impact of the tgr on variations in wt on the annual and seasonal using either a linear regression approach tao et al 2020 or a semi physical model air2stream cai et al 2018 however little effort has been made to daily variations in wt whether deep learning models can meet the challenge to predict accurately daily variations in thermal regime variations under the influence of anthropogenic perturbations requires further investigation the goals of this paper are twofold 1 to evaluate the forecasting performance of an lstm model to predict mean daily river temperatures compared to that of several other river temperature predictive models and 2 to use the lstm to reconstruct the expected daily natural thermal regime of a regulated river that would occur in the absence of a dam and to identify factors influencing daily variations in the thermal regime of this river the results improve the proficiency to predict an important factor mean daily wt related to the environmental quality of river systems and also provide a new tool in evaluating the thermal regime variations in rivers regulated by dams 2 data for model calibration and verification to assess the performance of lstm in daily wt forecasting relative to other methods a comparison between lstm and several benchmark models air2stream rf bpnn was conducted using daily wt data for nine gauges on seven rivers in a variety of physiographic settings table 1 data for gauges on rivers in switzerland yvonand sion and davos and the united states cedar fanno irondequoit were selected on the basis that these data were included in previous studies piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 zhu et al 2019b the three gauges on the yangtze river cuntan yichang and datong all have long term daily records of water temperature required for model calibration daily at and q two important controls of daily wt were used as input variables to predict the wt for the same day no lag time for the purpose of model calibration and validation data for each gauge were divided chronologically into calibration and validation periods by the ratio of 7 3 which is a commonly used ratio for model training and testing although there is no formal guideline khosravi et al 2018 table 1 in addition to providing information for evaluating model performance daily data on at q and wt for the yichang gauge located 44 km downstream from the tgr provided an opportunity to evaluate the capability of the different models to accurately reconstruct daily water temperatures that would occur in the absence of a large reservoir past work has indicated that water temperatures at yichang are strongly affected by the tgr liu et al 2018 to quantify the potential effects of tgr on the yangtze river thermal regime data on yichang were divided into a pre tgr calibration period 1983 2002 and a post tgr validation period 2003 2013 the lstm and benchmark models were compared and used to reconstruct the natural thermal conditions at yichang that would have occurred during the validation period in the absence of tgr a necessary reconstruction for identifying the impacts of climate change and the tgr on wt the tgr began to fill in june 2003 to raise the water level of the reservoir to 135 m during the second filling stage of tgr from october 2006 to september 2008 the water level reached 156 m subsequently it rose to 173 m in november 2008 and by the end of october 2010 the third filling the reservoir water level was raised to its designed normal pool level of 175 m zhang et al 2012 since that time the water level of tgr has been lowered to 145 m for flood control during mid june to late september and then raised to 175 m for power generation from january to march liu et al 2015 zheng 2016 3 methodology 3 1 long short term memory neural network lstm lstm is a special kind of recurrent neural network rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 rnn has a recurrent hidden unit to deal with sequential data and the output of each time step serves as the input to the next time step a single rnn model updates only a single past state and it is trained by the backpropagation through time algorithm mozer 1989 werbos 1990 by which the loss function is propagated backward to determine updates to weights with simple recurrent networks backpropagation encounters the vanishing gradient problem in which the training signal becomes exponentially small as it propagates into the network making backpropagation ineffective for deep networks shen 2018 the lstm is a special variation of rnn which can effectively avoid the vanishing gradient problem of rnn lstm consists of an input layer one or more lstm layers one or more fully connected layers and an output layer the key to lstm is the hidden neurons in the lstm layer called memory cells lstm cells which not only receive information from the input layer but also perceive the information at the previous moment olah 2015 the lstm layer consists of two kinds of state the hidden state and the cell state at each time step the hidden state contains the output of the lstm layer for this time step and the cell state contains the information learned from the previous time steps the lstm cells use three gates the forget gate f t the input gate i t and the output gate o t to control the level of cell state reset forget the level of cell state update and the level of cell state added to the hidden state respectively fig 1 a the lstm layer uses the tanh as the activation function to update the cell and hidden state and the sigmoid function are used in the calculations for the gates the working mechanism of lstm layer can be expressed as following olah 2015 xiao et al 2019 1 f t σ w f x x t w f h h t 1 b f 2 i t σ w i x x t w i h h t 1 b i 3 o t σ w o x x t w o h h t 1 b o 4 c t tanh w c x x t w c h h t 1 b c 5 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 6 h t tanh c t o t where x t is the input h t 1 is the hidden state at time t 1 w f x w f h w i x w i h w o x w o h w c x and w c h are corresponding weight matrices of the three gates and the candidate value b f b i b o and b c denote corresponding bias vectors represents the element wise multiplication between two vectors σ is the logistic sigmoid activation function tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function and h t is the output of lstm layer at time step t the working mechanism and data flows of lstm fig 1 involve several steps first the input data x t at time step t and the hidden state of the previous moment h t 1 flow to the forget gate to determine how much previous information should be removed from the cell state the data are transformed to a range from 0 to 1 by the sigmoid activation function σ with a value of one indicating completely keep it and a value of zero signaling completely remove it the retained information in the hidden state flows to the input gate where it serves as new input information to the memory cell for updating the cell state then the new candidate value c t is generated which is stored in the cell state c t finally the updated cell state c t flows to the output gate which controls the information within the cell state that is propagated to the hidden variable state at the next time step based on the lstm a 4 layer deep neural network model is constructed for wt forecasting this model consists of an input layer a lstm layer a fully connected layer and an output layer fig 1 b the number of lstm cells is set to a range of 30 to 50 by the trial and error method table s1 and a dropout value of 0 5 is applied empirically to help prevent overfitting yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 3 2 benchmark models 3 2 1 air2stream model the air2stream model is based on lumped heat budget exchange between an unknown water volume tributaries and atmosphere in the river toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 it has a high degree of accuracy for wt forecasting cai et al 2018 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 in the model at is assumed to be the main proxy for the heat flux exchange at the air water interface and q is introduced to account for the water inflows and river thermal inertia in this study the most complete eight parameter a1 a8 formulation was used namely the a2s 8 model the equations for the simple form of the air2stream model with eight parameters version can be expressed as follows 7 d t w dt 1 θ a 4 a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w θ a 5 a 6 cos 2 π t t y a 7 a 8 t w 8 θ q q q t 2 t 1 1 t 1 t 2 q t d t where tw is the water temperature ta is the air temperature ty denotes the duration of one year in the units used for time θ is the dimensionless discharge and q represents a reference value averaged over the time series from t1 to t2 more details about the air2stream model are reported in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 3 2 2 random forest rf random forest rf breiman 2001 is one of the most successful predictors based on bagging a type of ensemble method applied to decision trees rf integrates a series of independently selected and identically distributed decision trees and obtains the final single prediction by averaging the outputs of all decision trees in the forest svetnik et al 2003 in rf each node has d features of the base decision tree d features are selected randomly from the feature set d features and then the optimal feature is chosen by the gini impurity index ig for the best split threshold strobl et al 2008 the ig can be expressed as follows breiman 2001 heddam et al 2020 9 i g f 1 i 1 m f i 2 where fi denotes the probability of class i at node m and the best split threshold is indicated by the lowest value of ig the number of decision trees in the rf model in this study was determined from trial and error by varying the volume of trees from 100 to 300 table s2 3 2 3 back propagation neural network bpnn back propagation neural network bpnn is a kind of multilayer feedforward neural network rumelhart et al 1988 which consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer a three layer bpnn was used in this study the main characteristics of bpnn are forward transmission of signals and back propagation of errors the data transmit layer by layer in the forward transmission process and the errors generated by the comparisons between the predicted and observed values are back propagated to each layer thereby adjusting the weights and thresholds of the neurons until the error meets the termination condition the number of hidden neurons is the primary requirement for the design of bpnn if there are too many hidden neurons there is too much flexibility which usually leads to an over fitting phenomenon in which a neural network is good at dealing with one dataset at the expense of being very bad at assessing other datasets tetko et al 1995 however too few hidden neurons restrict the learning capability of the model haykin 1998 thus the number of neurons in the hidden layer were determined by the trial and error approach in the range of 1 16 yan et al 2020 the bpnn model was trained over this range at an interval of one and the number of hidden layer neurons in the hidden layer that had the highest performance validation period was retained for the calibrated model table s3 considering both the prediction accuracy and the running time of model when the prediction accuracy can be achieved with fewer neurons as well as with more neurons the value of fewer neurons is used 3 3 data pre processing because differences in absolute values of the training testing time series have a negative effect on the model learning ability the data on at q and wt were standardized before training as 10 x norm x raw x σ x where x raw is the original data x norm is the standardized value of variable x x and σ x are the average value and standard deviation of respectively 3 4 model performance indicators model performance is evaluated using four different and widely employed metrics for water temperature forecasting graf et al 2019 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 moriasi et al 2015 the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the coefficient of determination r2 and they are given by 11 m a e 1 n i 1 n y p y o 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y p y o 2 13 nse 1 i 1 n y p y o 2 i 1 n y o y o 2 14 r 2 1 n i 1 n y o y o y p y p 1 n i 1 n y o y o 2 1 n i 1 n y p y p 2 2 where n is the number of samples and y p and y o y o are the predicted and observed values respectively the smallest values of mae and rmse and values of nse and r2 closest to 1 indicate the highest prediction accuracy 4 results 4 1 model performance for daily wt forecasting comparison of the performances of the four models in predicting the mean annual daily wt for the calibration and validation periods for the nine gauges indicates that lstm outperformed the other models for both periods table 2 in particular for the validation periods for all gauges but yichang which is influenced strongly by the tgr the lstm model has values of mae 0 83 c values of rmse 1 00 c and values of nse and r2 0 90 these results are clearly better than those obtained from the a2s 8 air2stream in 8 parameter version rf and bpnn models fig 2 which have lower nse and r2 values and higher mae and rmse values than the lstm model averaged for the eight gauges excluding yichang the lstm model lowered mean mae and rmse values for the validation period by 13 96 and 13 68 respectively compared to a2s 8 by 44 52 and 44 46 respectively compared to rf and by 42 66 and 42 32 respectively compared to bpnn noticeably the lstm model performed much better than the a2s 8 model at the datong irondequoit and davos stations and performed slightly better than all other models for the cedar and sion stations table 2 with regard to the three benchmark models the a2s 8 model produced higher accuracy with substantially lower values of mean mae and rmse during the validation period than the rf model 36 03 and 36 53 respectively and the bpnn model 33 81 and 33 94 respectively furthermore the performance of the rf model was slightly worse than the bpnn model although mean values of the four metrics showed no significant differences given the wide distributions of the metrics for these two models fig 2 for yichang the mae rmse nse and r2 of the lstm for the calibration period pre tgr period 1983 2002 were 0 61 c 0 78 c 0 98 and 0 98 respectively table 2 indicating the lstm had a superior training effect compared to the other three models compared to the other eight gauges with no reservoir effects the performances of all four models deteriorated substantially for the yichang gauge in the validation period post tgr 2003 2013 this result is not surprising given the strong influence of the tgr on water temperatures in the post tgr period the average annual wt at yichang in post tgr period increased by 0 67 c relative to pre tgr period this change was accompanied by changes in at and q the average annual at in the pre tgr period 1983 2002 was 17 00 c and increased to 17 50 c in the post tgr period 2003 2013 whereas the average annual q in the post tgr decreased by 8 83 compared to the pre tgr value these changes challenge the capacity of the calibrated models to forecast conditions following reservoir construction nevertheless the lstm model still performed better than the other three models in the validation period overall the forecasting performances for all nine gauges are ranked as lstm a2s 8 bpnn rf 4 2 determining impacts of climate and dam construction on wt at yichang because the lstm model performed best for predicting mean daily water temperatures in the post tgr validation period for the yichang gauge this model was used to determine the impacts of climate as reflected in changes in air temperature and discharge and dam construction on the mean daily thermal regime at this location to conduct this analysis the post tgr period was divided into three subperiods sp sp1 135 m impoundment jun 2003 sep 2006 sp2 156 m impoundment oct 2006 sep 2008 and sp3 175 m impoundment oct 2008 dec 2013 for all three subperiods the annual pattern of mean daily at fluctuated around the pattern of mean daily at for the pre tgr period fig 3 a c with mean fluctuations of 0 59 c in sp1 0 74 c in sp2 and 0 39 c in sp3 observed mean daily q values for the three post dam subperiods qpost tgr red lines decreased in the flood season june to october and increased in the dry season january march relative to the pre tgr period qpre tgr green lines with the most pronounced differences occurring for sp3 fig 3 d f for wt the annual pattern of mean daily values following the closure of the tgr reservoir shows that wt relative to the pre tgr period increased from september february and decreased from march through june fig 3 g i to reconstruct wt in the absence of the reservoir which mainly affects discharge of the yangtze river measured values of q at yichang gauge were replaced in the calibrated lstm model with the daily inflow discharge to the tgr qpost tgr non tgr the q that would have occurred at yichang in the absence of the tgr these inflow values of q reported by the china three gorges operation are derived from information on the change in water storage in the tgr a storage capacity curve for the reservoir and the outflow of the tgr the reconstructed natural discharge qpost tgr non tgr blue lines for sp1 did not show obvious differences compared with the observed values of q qpost tgr red lines for this period fig 3 d the qpost tgr non tgr for sp2 exhibited an increase in october but the rest of the period was similar to qpost tgr fig 3 e notably the reconstructed discharges qpost tgr non tgr for sp3 are greater than observed qpost tgr for the flood season june october and lower than the observed qpost tgr in the dry season january march fig 3 f this increase in the range of mean daily discharge over the year for the reconstructed inflow qpost tgr non tgr compared to the observed qpost tgr reflects the influence of the tgr on flow extremes as it is operated for flood control and power generation the reconstructed discharges qpost tgr non tgr along with measured values of at were used to predict the wt for the 2003 2013 period that would have occurred in the absence of the tgr based on these predictions the impacts of the tgr δ tgr and climate change δ cli on mean daily wt at yichang were quantified as 15 δ tot w t obs p o s t t g r w t obs p r e t g r 16 δ cli w t sim p o s t t g r w t sim p r e t g r 17 δ tgr w t obs p o s t t g r w t sim p o s t t g r 18 ε w t sim p r e t g r w t obs p r e t g r where δ tot represents the total change of wt before and after dam δ cli is the contribution of changes in at and natural discharge to change in wt δ tgr is the change in wt ascribed to the construction of tgr assuming no other human perturbations except for the tgr ε is the bias of model i e mean error w t obs p o s t t g r and w t obs p r e t g r are observed values of wt in the post tgr and pre tgr periods respectively w t sim p o s t t g r is the simulated wt in the absence of the tgr using the lstm model with the reconstructed discharge qpost tgr non tgr and the observed at as the inputs w t sim p r e t g r is the simulated wt in the pre tgr period based on the observed q and at and δ tot δ cli δ tgr ε with regard to determining the influence of the tgr on wt the model can be considered reliable if ε δ tgr under these conditions the error associated with model bias is much smaller than the predicted impact of the tgr on wt the results are presented in a compact form by the climatological reference year in which the value of a variable for each day of the year is the average of all available observed values for that day over the period of record 29 february of leap year was not included cai et al 2018 simulations using the lstm model reveal that the absolute value of ε 0 02 c is small compared to absolute values of δ tgr indicating that the model is reliable for determining the influence of the tgr on wt the largest absolute values of ε for particular months occur in august and september but generally ε 0 5 δ tgr table 3 a comparison between the observed wt in the post tgr period the predicted wt after tgr and the predicted wt in the assumed case without tgr was shown in fig 4 it can be clearly seen that the predicted wt in the post tgr wtpost tgr sim green lines are not close to the observed values after tgr wtpost tgr red lines and the green lines are also significant substantially different from the blue lines the predicted wt in the assumed case without tgr the lstm was trained based on the statistical relationships for the observed wt observed q and the observed wt observed at in the pre tgr period although the observed q did not show significant alterations to the reconstructed q in the sp1 and sp2 but they are significantly different in the sp3 the period of strong forcing by meaning the forcing by tgr furthermore the statistical relationships between wt q was clearly disturbed in the post tgr liu et al 2018 thus the wtpost tgr sim green lines predicted by the lstm model which was trained by the pre tgr data showed obvious differences both to the wtpost tgr red lines and the wtpost tgr non tgr blue lines this indicated the importance of reconstructing the natural discharges that have occurred without tgr before predicting the wt in the absence of the dam the operation of tgr δ tgr is the major factor contributing to change in mean annual water temperature before and after the construction of the reservoir accounting for 93 of the increase in wt δ tot for sp1 81 of the increase for sp2 and 119 of the increase for sp3 table 3 by contrast changes in wt related to at and natural discharge climate range from 11 sp1 to 22 sp2 thus most change in wt at yichang before and after the construction of the tgr can be attributed to the influence of the reservoir rather than to changes in climate reservoir construction also is the major factor contributing to change in seasonal variation of wt before and after reservoir construction cooling in warm seasons march june and warming in cold seasons september february are mainly attributable to the operation of tgr consistent with the results of cai et al 2018 the largest effects of forcing by the tgr occur in april and december during the 175 m impoundment table 3 in april values of δ tgr of 2 19 c sp1 3 32 c sp2 and 3 38 c sp3 accounted for 183 sp1 123 sp2 and 98 sp3 of total cooling whereas in december values of δ tgr of 1 98 c sp1 3 99 c sp2 and 4 27 c sp3 accounted for 103 of total warming in all three post tgr subperiods variations in mean daily wt induced by climate change fig 3 j l δ cli green lines fluctuate above and below the value of zero throughout the year resulting in small average annual δ cli values of 0 05 c sp1 0 15 c sp2 and 0 12 c sp3 table 3 climate induced change is most distinct in april average δ cli 0 64 c for the three subperiods and september average δ cli 0 68 c for the three subperiods in general climate change had its largest impact on wt at yichang during sp2 with a range of 1 67 c δ cli 2 04 c the smallest effect was for sp3 where 1 18 c δ cli 1 15 c the annual pattern of changes in wt induced by the tgr δ tgr blue lines matches the total wt changes δ tot red lines fig 3 j l for all three subperiods confirming the major role of the tgr in producing changes in water temperature patterns of δ tgr by day for each month and each subperiod fig 5 illuminate in greater detail the monthly patterns table 3 these patterns confirm that the tgr acted as a cold source from the beginning of march to early july and a warm source from mid july to late february this pattern reflects the large thermal inertia of the tgr which delays the seasonal circle of wt toffolon et al 2010 cai et al 2018 more precisely the tgr effects can be roughly divided into four stages increasing cooling from march through mid may decreasing cooling from mid may through early july increasing warming from mid july to december and decreasing warming during january and february the largest cooling effects occurred in early april to early may and the most substantial warming happened in late december and early january the effect of increasing the water level or volume of water in the tgr is evident for cooling in that the amount of maximum cooling increases between sp1 and the two later subperiods by about 1 5 c moreover between sp2 and sp3 the timing of maximum cooling shifts from the beginning of april to the beginning of may the duration of maximum cooling also increases from sp2 to sp3 in general warming from mid july to late february increases as reservoir level increases sp1 to sp3 with this effect most pronounced in january and february when temperature increases for sp3 clearly exceed those for sp1 and sp2 these patterns generally reflect an increase in thermal inertia as the volume of the reservoir increases toffolon et al 2010 5 discussion a comparison between the deep learning method lstm and three benchmark models air2stream rf and bpnn at nine gauges on seven different rivers in different physiographic settings demonstrates the improved forecasting accuracy of lstm for predicting mean daily water temperatures based on air temperature and discharge previous studies using data for six of the nine gauges three swiss and three usa gauges zhu et al 2019b piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 examined in the present study revealed that the air2stream model outperformed conventional data driven methods feedforward neural network gaussian process regression decision tree the mohseni et al 1998 model the van vliet et al 2006 model linear regression the present study compared the air2stream model 8 parameter version to random forest rf and back propagation neural network bpnn the a2s 8 model outperformed than the rf and bpnn at the same studied gauges but did not perform as well as the lstm in contrast although the improvements by lstm for the mae and rmse relative to the a2s 8 were relatively small at two of the gauges 1 7 5 6 and 1 2 2 7 respectively the lstm decreased the mae and rmse at four of the gauges by 8 8 26 4 and 11 5 23 1 respectively the reason why the lstm outperforms than the benchmark models is the input and output of lstm are considered as a two time series sequence the lstm is deep in time which not only updates the past state but also can learn when to forget and how long to keep the state information shen 2018 the calibrated lstm model successfully reconstructed the daily water temperatures at yichang on the yangtze river that would occur in the absence of tgr which helped to quantify the influence of changes in air temperature and discharge surrogates for the influence of climate versus the influence of the tgr on changes in mean daily water temperatures at yichang past studies have revealed that tgr has changed the thermal regime of the yangtze river on the annual and seasonal scale using the air2stream model and non reconstructed q cai et al 2018 or using the linear regression model and reconstructed q from a conventional artificial neural network model tao et al 2020 the differences between the observed wt in the post tgr the predicted wt after tgr and the predicted wt in the assumed case without tgr demonstrated it s necessary to reconstruct the natural discharge q that would occur in the absence of tgr before reconstructing the wt without the dam fig 4 in addition the results of the present study confirm the efficiency of lstm to reconstruct natural thermal conditions in the absence of a large reservoir these results also indicate that that climate change has had a small impact on mean daily wt change at yichang fig 3 a finding consistent with previous efforts to unravel the effects of climate related and dam related effects on wt at yichang tao et al 2020 the daily timescale resolution of the analysis shows that the inertial effects of the reservoir affect the thermal regime of the yangtze river under its present operational stage 175 m by producing periods of increasing cooling in the spring decreasing cooling in early summer increasing warming from mid summer to early winter and decreasing warming in mid late winter the greatest cooling occurs in mid april to mid may cooling and the greatest warming in late december and early january in short lstm acts as a useful new tool to predict the daily water temperatures and to detect at high temporal resolution the impacts of climate change and reservoirs on the thermal regime of rivers the analysis in the present study assumes that the construction of tgr is the main significant anthropogenic perturbation during the post tgr period previous work that has attempted to decompose the changes in the thermal regime of the yangtze river at yichang suggests that other factors such as land use change or sewage discharges may have impacts on wt cai et al 2018 tao et al 2020 the effect of sewage discharge has been estimated as 0 1 c cai et al 2018 which is small compared to the total wt change before and after dam the effect of other factors such as land use are difficult to quantify according to the tao et al 2020 model warming in wt at yichiang related to the tgr occurred only from december through february in sp3 otherwise the tgr produced cooling during all seasons in sp1 sp2 and sp3 these results differ from those of the lstm model which indicate that the tgr has produced warming in wt over a substantial portion of the year july through february especially in sp3 the tao et al 2020 model attributed impacts related to factors other than at q and the tgr including other human impacts to a factor δ β 0 which contributed substantially to wt variations however the extent to which the factor δ β 0 isolates non reservoir related effects specifically other human related effects such as land use changes remains uncertain and is in need of further investigation differences between the predictions of the tao et al 2020 model and lstm model may also partly reflect modelling uncertainty e g the selection of prediction model the scenario reconstruction in the absence of tgr the model bias and the time scale used for analysis monthly versus daily full consideration of the impacts of other factors such as land use change on water temperature regimes requires comprehensive data on this change which is beyond the scope of the present study but which can be considered in future research although land use effects could be important the close association of the pattern of total change in wt with the pattern of change associated with the tgr fig 3 j l implies that the total change is associated mainly with the effect of the reservoir 6 conclusions this study has verified that a deep learning model lstm is a powerful tool for accurately forecasting river water temperatures and for reconstructing natural thermal regimes at a daily timescale that would occur in the absence of a large dam major conclusions include lstm outperformed three benchmark models air2stream rf bpnn based on metrics of predictive accuracy for nine gauges on seven rivers in china the united states and switzerland lstm predictions of river water temperatures in the absence of the three gorges reservoir indicate that the reservoir has had a much larger impact on changes in temperature than have changes in climate the influence of the dam on water temperatures has been greatest in the spring mid april to mid may when it has produced cooling of about 4 c and in early winter late december to early january when it has produced warming of about the same amount additional testing and evaluation of the deep learning approach to forecasting river water temperatures is needed to determine the extent to which this approach can be generalized as with all data driven approaches the capability of the model to predict accurately beyond the domain of the data used in model calibration remains unclear nevertheless the present study indicates that in cases where forecasting is a primary aim the method provides accurate predictions when calibrated using historical river data for on water temperature discharge and air temperature it also shows that the method is useful for deciphering how human related disturbances such as reservoir construction have influenced thermal regimes of rivers in this sense the deep learning model not only is a powerful forecasting tool but also is capable of providing explanatory insight into causes in changes in river water temperature credit

technique including combination of ahp process based entropy weights and topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution to evaluate resilient sustainable urban drainage management the mcdm models mentioned make valuable application achievements however they are most applicable to deterministic or fuzzy decision making dm background where uncertainties are usually neglectful in real world application managers or dms work in changing and uncertain environment multiple impact factors and information sources in water resources management often face various uncertainties caused by man made influence hydrological hydraulic analysis as well as social environmental management and economic development consequently these uncertainties make criteria performance values pvs and criteria weights cws unclear and characterized with stochastic factors leading to uncertain even erroneous dm results for example man made uncertainty in data monitoring and statistics lead to uncertain pvs meanwhile hydrology and environment related information such as streamflow water quality are inherently random implying that partial data used for pvs calculation are uncertain in terms of cws dms usually need to coordinate benefits of multiple groups investigators departments and policies zhu et al 2019 sometimes the fluctuation in policy conflicts between different interests and subjectivity and fuzziness of human judgement lead to uncertain and implicit cws as a result the final dm or assessment results for water resources management may produce a deviation to this end some scholars conducted related studies with considering potential uncertainties in water resources management qin et al 2008 conducted adapted planning of water resources management impacted by climate change using mcdm based expert system and demonstrated its feasibility and efficiency hutton et al 2014 considered key uncertainties in water distribution system wds modeling and real time data of wds the methodology proposed is verified to identify robust operational solutions efficiently based on monte carlo simulation subagadis et al 2016 developed novel fuzzy stochastic mcdm approach to systematically quantify both probabilistic and fuzzy uncertainties associated with complex groundwater agricultural system management lu et al 2017 proposed a cloud model based mcdm technique with monte carlo simulation for selecting contaminated groundwater remediation strategies fu et al 2017 proposed combined method of interval parameter programming ipp fuzzy programing fp and one dimensional water quality model for reginal development planning they considered uncertainties of economic population and environment protection to help dms understand the tradeoffs among competed objectives although these models considered uncertain factors in their respective applications the essence of stochastic mcdm cws calculation alternative ranking uncertainty and uncertainty effect reduction need further analysis to make robust control decisions zhu et al 2020 developed an effective stochastic multi attribute acceptability analysis smaa model based on stepwise weight information for robust reservoir operation incorporating uncertainties in pvs and cws furthermore conventional deterministic and stochastic mcdm models are effective to deal with quantitative criteria which can be quantified by respective methods however they are usually incapable to conduct feasible quantification and uncertainty analysis for qualitative criteria so it is critical to find workable way to disclose effect of uncertainty on mcdm and its propagation to decision error risk for water resources management characterized with quantitative and qualitative criteria in this work an uncertainty risk analysis and stochastic decision making oriented mcdm framework is developed to perform dm and assessment task with multiple uncertainties for uwr management the framework integrates uncertainties quantified by expected probabilistic distribution into mcdm model and provides risk formation and quantification process to dms for more robust decision release the framework is mainly composed of four parts 1 smaa grbp grey relational bidirectional projection for dm of quantitative criteria based on improved grey relational analysis gra and bidirectional projection bp 2 smaa ordinal smaa o model for dm of qualitative ordinal criteria 3 cws calculation by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp combined with improved entropy weighting iew and coordination based on maximum total deviations mtds 4 decision risk quantification by risk of errors in dm process redmp the case studies of reclaimed water utilization rwu assessment and dm of flood water control fwc are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of proposed methodology the parameter in novel smaa grbp model is analyzed to reveal its effect on dm and risk finally comparison analysis with conventional smaa 2 coupled smaa o is developed to show advantages of framework proposed 2 the problem description in this section we show the problem discussed in this work from two aspects the first is mcdm problem where qualitative ordinal indices are included the second is stochastic mcdm problem where complex uncertainties are integrated 2 1 the multi criteria system with qualitative ordinal indices in real world application the multi criteria evaluation system for unconventional water management is composed of numerous quantitative and qualitative indices fu et al 2018 the quantitative indices can be observed or quantified according to statistical data optimization tool monitoring equipment etc while for qualitative indices researchers find it difficult or costly to precisely quantified lahdelma et al 2003 instead descriptive language and ordinal rankings are adopted to qualitatively evaluate the performance of these indices the ordinal rankings are usually non linear which is not easily converted to membership function mf closeness degree function cdf widely used in conventional mcdm methods consequently it is critical to find an effective measure to handle mcdm problem which mixes quantitative and qualitative indices 2 2 the stochastic mcdm with uncertain factors in conventional deterministic mcdm methods the decision matrix contains deterministic performance values pvs of multiple criteria without considering their uncertain factors accordingly values of membership or closeness functions computed by models are constant in contrast when the stochastic decision matrix is adopted multiple criteria become random variables following probability distribution influenced by uncertainty the ranking information such as cdf will be stochastic and distribute within a certain range sometimes the cdfs of alternatives have overlapping area that makes dms difficult to identify and judge by deterministic mcdm model the difference between deterministic and stochastic mcdm models is elaborated based on an example in appendix a in this work dealing with two problems mentioned simultaneously stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa based improved mcdm model is proposed the cws determination method is updated and the effect of cws uncertainty on decision result is also considered the next section elaborated the methodology used in this work 3 methodology in this section details of the proposed methodology are exhibited the novel grbp based smaa model smaa grbp is proposed to solve stochastic dm problem quantitative criteria with uncertainties moreover the smaa o model is adopted to handle qualitative criteria which is difficult to quantify furthermore coordinated deterministic cws based on fahp and iew are developed to effectively describe the importance of multiple criteria finally the redmp index is used to quantify risk of potential erroneous decision under uncertainties the framework of proposed methodology is demonstrated in fig 1 3 1 conventional smaa 2 model and variants the stochastic factors in criteria pvs and cws make model inputs suffered from uncertainty deterministic mcdm models are usually incapable to solve dm of uwr management with multiple uncertainties and quantitative qualitative criteria unlike conventional models in smaa 2 the inverse weight space analysis iwsa helps dms to locate the most preferred alternative or solution even though pvs and cws preferences of dms are imprecise and uncertain the smaa models have attracted broad interests for scholars and variants are developed including smaa p smaa ahp smaa topsis smaa tri smaa topsis gca tervonen et al 2009 durbach et al 2014 okul et al 2014 yang and wang 2018 2020 pelissari et al 2019 yang et al 2021 among smaa and its variants smaa 2 is recognized as the most typical and basic framework of others the smaa 2 generalized the analysis to a common utility or value function to include various kinds of preference information and to consider holistically all ranks lahdelma and salminen 2001 suppose that total m alternatives and n criteria for dm are defined the cws vector can be expressed as ω ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω n unlike the deterministic mcdm the pvs in smaa 2 are described by stochastic variable v ij and its probability distribution function f v sv cws are represented by weight probability distribution function f w w in feasible space alternatives for dm are mapped to utility function values by real value utility function shown as follows 1 u i u v i ω j 1 n v ij ω j 2 w s ω r n j 1 n ω j 1 ω 0 where v ij is j th criteria value of i th solution u i is utility function which is function of cws and pvs ω j represents the cws vector w s denotes the feasible space of cws furthermore utility function can map random evaluation criteria and cws distribution to the utility distribution u v i ω the ranking of each alternative can be expressed as an integer from 1 to m by the sorting function the sorting function is shown as follows 3 r a n k v i ω 1 k ρ u v k ω u v i ω where the logical decision results of ρ true and ρ false are 1 and 0 respectively s v i denotes random vector of criteria values the favorable rank weight frw set w i r v is one of the critical concepts in smaa 2 any weight combination from weight set will allocate the utility value to the alternative to make its ranking preferred to r the definition of w i r sv is shown as follows 4 w i r v ω w s r a n k v i ω r based on analysis of frw set random criteria pvs and cws smaa 2 evaluates alternatives mainly through four evaluation indices including the rank acceptability index rai holistic acceptability index hai central weight vector cwv and confidence factor cf the details of four indices ae shown as follows 1 rank acceptability index rai the rai represents the expected value of frw it can be used to measure variation of different preferences or evaluations that give each alternative specific ranks and corresponding acceptable probabilities rai can be calculated as multidimensional integral over distribution of criteria pvs and frw 5 i a i r v f v v w i r v f ω ω d ω d v where the i a i r represents rai of rank r for the i th alternative v denotes corresponding decision matrix v v ij m n this multidimensional integral is difficult to compute its numerical solution precisely monte carlo simulation robert and castella 2004 is a well established method for computing approximative values for high dimensional integrals in this work we adopt the monte carlo simulation based on lhs sampling to compute rai 2 holistic acceptability index hai hai is used to examine overall acceptable level of each alternative through combining all rank acceptability indices it can be defined as the second order decision process the bigger hai means larger acceptability of alternative the hai is computed using following eq 6 6 i b i h r 1 m r i a i r where the r is meta weights disclosing contribution of alternative rankings to the hai the meta weights have three forms including centroid weight linear weight and inverse weight the mathematical expressions of three meta weights are elaborated in appendix b following fig 2 illustrates three forms of meta weights taking eight criteria for example observe that inverse and centroid weights place more emphasis on the weight of bottom rankings while the weight distribution of middle rankings in linear weight is bigger than others according to study conducted by barron and barrett 1996 when modeling normalized weights with full priority the centroid weight form is more accurate and reasonable in this paper we select centroid weight as the meta weight to calculate hais of alternatives 3 central weight vector cwv central weights vector cwv is proposed to describe weight space that assign an alternative to best r rank in this paper we consider the first rank i e the r 1 the cwv is the preferred single vector for preferences of dms who assign an alternative the first rank the cwv can be calculated by following equation 7 c w i v f v v w i r v ω f ω ω d ω d v i a i r r 1 where c w i denotes cwv that support the i th alternative to obtain the best ranking like eq 5 the multidimensional integral is solved by mc simulation 4 the confidence factor cf the confidence factor cf is used to represent probability and confidence degree that alternative obtains the first ranking when we select the corresponding cwv it can be computed as integral over criteria distribution 8 c f i v v r a n k v c w i 1 f v v d v with help of cf the proportion of the stochastic criterion space which makes alternative the best with respective cwvs can be determined lahdelma and salminen 2001 the higher cf implies alternative more confident to be the most preferred 3 2 novel grey relational bidirectional projection grbp based smaa 2 3 2 1 grey relational analysis gra and modification the grey system theory gst was firstly proposed by deng 1982 1989 as one of the components of gst grey relational analysis gra was proposed in 1995 which determines quality grade of samples according to the correlation between comparison sequence and reference sequence tan and deng 1995 yeh and chen 2004 tsai and hsu 2009 xu and yang 2015 the reference sequence has the best correlation with the largest degree of correlation and quality grade of sample can be obtained accordingly the uwr management is correlated with hydrology human production and living and environment elements such as inflow water use water quality and ecological flow these elements are uncertain and characterized by grey information caused by the inherent characteristic of randomness and fuzziness additionally inadequate monitoring data decision information and insignificant data distribution can also lead to grey information in uwr management yang et al 2020 gra can handle multiple grey information which are used to describe situation between black where information is unknown and white where information is deterministic the essential steps of gra are elaborated as follows 1 determine the alternative set ea a 1 a 2 a 3 a m and evaluation criteria set ec c 1 c 2 c 3 c n respectively 2 build the original decision matrix dmx x i j m n and normalize matrix according to following measure 9 v i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 3 locate the positive ideal pi and negative ideal ni alternatives respectively 4 calculate grey relational coefficient grc for pi and ni the conventional grey relational coefficient grc is defined as 10 ς i j μ ρ η δ i j ρ η δ i j v 0 j v i j ς i j μ ρ η δ i j ρ η δ i j v 0 j v i j η max i max j δ i j μ min i min j δ i j where ς i j is grc between the i th alternative and pi alternative ς i j is grc between the i th alternative and ni alternative respectively δ i j is difference sequence v 0 j and v 0 j denote the pi and ni alternatives of the j th criterion respectively v i j is the i th alternative of the j th criterion η and μ maximum and minimum difference values in difference sequence respectively ρ denotes identification coefficient whose range of value is 0 1 to offset uneven distribution problem in conventional grc in this work we introduced a new grc form the novel grc between the i th alternative and pi alternative ς ij and ni alternative ς ij are calculated according to following equation the r ς and r ς are respective grey relational coefficient matrixes 11 r ς ς ij m n r ς l ς ij m n ς ij max i max j v j v ij v j v ij max i max j v j v ij min i min j v j v ij ρ ς ij max i max j v j v ij v j v ij max i max j v j v ij min i min j v j v ij ρ 5 the grey relational degrees grds between the i th alternative and pi ni alternatives g r i and g r i are calculated by following equation 12 g r i j 1 n weigh t j t ς ij g r i j 1 n weigh t j t ς ij where g r i represents grd between the i th alternative and pi solution g r i represents grd between the i th alternative and ni solution weigh t j t is the weight of the j th criterion 3 2 2 gra bidirectional projection model grbp grey relational projection grp is an effective mcdm method which integrates grey relational analysis and projection model zhang et al 2013 grp can fully reflect whole space of criteria attributes and avoid unidirectional deviation conventional grp model is based on the traditional grc and one way projection method as we have discussed above grc in conventional gra model fails to satisfy the order preserving effect and solve uneven distribution problem while the one way projection method is difficult to distinguish the preferred alternative to some extent to this end in this study we combine the modified gra with bidirectional projection bp to develop novel grbp method the decision process of bp method is simple to operate and has higher degree of discrimination liu et al 2014 compared with conventional projection method bp is more reasonable to take the bidirectional projection magnitude into account the novel grbp helps to avoid maldistribution in gra and consider the distance and direction deviation between alternatives and the pi alternative simultaneously in grbp bidirectional projection values based on grc will replace original grey relational degree grd of gra model the bidirectional projection values bpvs of each alternative on the pi alternative and ni alternative are derived from following equations respectively 13 wr ς w e i g h t j ς i j w r ς 0 w e i g h t j ς 0 j bp v i wr ς wr ς 0 wr ς wr ς 0 wr ς wr ς 0 wr ς w r ς 0 j 1 n weigh t j ς ij 2 j 1 n weigh t j t 2 j 1 n weigh t j ς ij 2 j 1 n weigh t j t 2 j 1 n weigh t j ς ij 2 j 1 n weigh t j t 2 j 1 n weigh t j ς ij w e i g h t j t 14 wr ς w e i g h t j ς i j w r ς 0 w e i g h t j ς 0 j bp v i wr ς wr ς 0 wr ς wr ς 0 wr ς wr ς 0 wr ς w r ς 0 j 1 n weigh t j ς ij 2 j 1 n weigh t j t 2 j 1 n weigh t j ς ij 2 j 1 n weigh t j t 2 j 1 n weigh t j ς ij 2 j 1 n weigh t j t 2 j 1 n weigh t j ς ij w e i g h t j t where bp v i and bp v i are bidirectional projection of the i th alternative on the pi and ni alternatives respectively wr ς and wr ς are weighted grey relational coefficient matrixes wr ς 0 is weighted grc between the pi alternative and itself wr ς 0 is weighted grc between the ni alternative and itself instead of gcd which can be used to rank alternatives relative closeness degree rcd is adopted to obtain ranking sequence of alternatives and locate the preferred one the biggest rcd implies that alternative can be discerned as the best the calculation measure of rcd is shown as follows 15 rcd bp v i bp v i b p v i 3 2 3 the novel smaa 2 model based on grbp it is also workable to utilize smaa 2 in conjunction with other mcdm models to extend new forms of utility function in this work original utility function is modified by rcd based on coupled grbp model the novel utility function is developed as follows 16 nfun u i f u n g r b p v i ω where the grbp v i ω denotes rcd function incorporating grc in gra and bpv in bp the calculation measure of rcd is shown in section 3 2 2 the novel grbp based smaa 2 model can be regarded as an extension of conventional smaa 2 using utility function incorporating modified gra and bp the utility function for novel smaa model can efficiently utilize respective strengths of modified gra and bp specifically the gra helps to handle grey information caused by coherent randomness and fuzziness of water resources related data and information moreover it can reflect difference between changing trend in each alternative and the most preferred and emphasize internal connection between multiple quantitative qualitative criteria meanwhile the projection method can express the position relationship in the data curve between each alternative and the ideal alternative or negative ideal solution the novel projection method based on bp helps to improve the alternative discrimination and avert unidirectional deviation in conventional projection method on the other hand gra and bp can handle mcdm problems with multiple uncertainties and imprecision based on smaa 3 3 smaa o model smaa 2 and its modification models are efficient to handle quantitative criteria by means of linear utility function mapped from criteria pvs however when there exist qualitative criteria smaa 2 series models are hard to calculate utility function values directly since pvs of qualitative criteria are usually non linear smaa o is designed for problems where criteria information is totally or partially ordinal and difficult to precisely quantify i e the qualitative criteria like smaa 2 the rank acceptability holistic acceptability indices cwv and cf also apply to smaa o dms usually assign for evaluated alternatives certain rank levels according to qualitative description of ordinal criteria for the alternative with the best performance of a qualitative criterion corresponding ranking is assigned for 1 and so on let the r j 1 2 3 j max be the ranking sequence where 1 and j max denote the best and worst alternative rankings respectively if alternatives are considered equally preferred by dms then the same rank level is placed on these alternatives and rank levels are numbered consecutively for other alternatives therefore alternative placed on the j max th rank will follow j max n since performance of each alternative on ordinal criteria qualitative criteria is not necessarily linear the ordinal criteria cannot be used directly in a multi criteria value function moreover an arbitrary transformation of the scale would affect value function and preference relation among alternatives lahdelma et al 2003 similarly in terms of ordinal criteria monte carlo mc simulation is used to reflect qualitative rank sequence of each alternative with some quantitative cardinal values wang 2013 quantitative cardinal values corresponding to different qualitative sequencings can be generated randomly the law of mapping quantitative values and its feasible space can be reached in appendix c total j max 2 random numbers following uniform distribution are generated in the interval 0 1 by an independent mc simulation these numbers should be ensured distinct and ranked in the descending order the sample mapped quantitative cardinal values for qualitative ordinal rank levels under different mc simulation iterations are illustrated in fig 3 it can be observed from fig 3 that simulated mapping values satisfying feasible space are searched and utilized furthest as independent iterations of mc simulation increase 3 4 the deterministic and stochastic criteria weights cws acquirement 3 4 1 deterministic coordinated cws to effectively determine cws the subjective method of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp and objective method of improved entropy weighting iew are combined to acquire cws based on maximum total deviations mtds we further coordinate the cws ccws calculated by subjective and objective weighting methods to compromise conflicts in cws and make them more aligned with respective importance the illustration of iew method can be reached in yang et al 2019 the details of fahp and mtds are elaborated as follows 1 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp as a typical subjective weighting method ahp decomposes the elements related to the decision into levels such as objective level criteria level and alternative level and conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis on this basis in conventional ahp elements of the judgment matrix are reciprocal and the two comparison factors are easily influenced by other elements therefore based on conventional ahp the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp incorporating fuzzy theory is adopted with complementary judgment matrix cjm tanino 1984 zhang 2000 two factors are compared with each other and sum of weights of two comparison factors is 1 compared with conventional reciprocal judgment matrix the novel cjm is not affected by other elements so that the weighting process is more in line with the physical significance of weight allocation the basic process of fahp is exhibited in appendix d 2 novel coordinated cws based on maximizing total deviations mtds conventional subjective and objective cws combination methods are mainly based on linear combination coefficient lcc although lcc is simple to determine it is impacted by subjective bias and criteria importance uncertainty to this end the novel combination coefficient determination tool is developed based on mtds deviation is an important index to reflect the degree of difference if the pv of the j th criterion x i j has no deviation in all alternatives the x i j is considered having no business with rank sequence of criteria importance as a result the coefficient of this criterion can be assigned to 0 in contrary x i j will have serious effect on the rank sequence of criteria importance if deviation is significant then the corresponding coefficient should be bigger this principle helps to effectively identify relative importance of each criteria and assign reasonable cws let ω j ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω n be the coordinated combination cws α and β are coefficients of subjective fahp and objective iew respectively according to deviation principle the optimization model is established as follows to find maximum total deviations max d e v 17 max d e v j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 ω j j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 α f ω j β i ω j s t α 2 β 2 1 α β 0 where f ω j and i ω j are cws calculated by fahp and iew methods respectively x e j denotes mean value of the j th criterion in all alternatives the above model can be solved through building the lagrange function as follows 18 l α β j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 α f ω j β i ω j λ α 2 β 2 1 let the l α 0 l β 0 the coefficients α and β can be reached according to following formula 19 j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 f ω j 2 λ α 0 j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 i ω j 2 λ β 0 α 2 β 2 1 finally with the optimized α and β the coordinated cws can be determined based on subjective fahp and objective iew methods 3 4 2 stochastic coordinated cws the deterministic coordinated cws are computed based on maximizing total deviations however in real world cws information are inherently uncertain influenced by multiple factors the cws can be quantified as variables that vary over an interval the change laws of variables can be regarded as symmetric or asymmetric probability distributions in this work we considered coordinated cws following typically symmetric expressions including normal and uniform distributions the upper and lower bounds of two distributions are determined based on rules in yang and wang 2020 3 5 the risk of error in decision making process redmp rankings for alternatives or solutions of uwr management will be fluctuant when uncertain information is incorporated influenced by uncertainties the worst alternative or solution may obtain the first ranking with certain probability thus the rankings computed by smaa grbp coupled smaa o may be greatly different with results computed under deterministic dm environment leading to erroneous dm to this end risk of error in decision making process redmp is adopted to quantify potential decision error risk caused by uncertain information zhu et al 2017 dms can make more reliable decision by realizing potential risk in dm process redmp is calculated by following equation 20 redmp i 2 m β i i a i rfirst r e d m p i 2 m β i i a i rfirst β i i i 2 m i where β i represents risk weights to distinguish the contribution of each alternative to redmp i a i rfirst denotes the first ranking rai of alternative which obtains the i th ranking according to hai calculated by smaa model for instance one alternative gets the i th ranking with high probability according to hai however this alternative still has probability of obtaining the first ranking based on corresponding rai m denotes the quantity of alternatives or solutions 4 case study in this section two cases are studied to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of proposed framework the first case is reclaimed water utilization rwu assessment in yunnan province the other case is based on previous research where flood water control fwc decision making in three gorges dam tgd is studied 4 1 case 1 reclaimed water utilization assessment 4 1 1 description of reclaimed water utilization system as a typical uwr reclaimed water plays an increasingly important role in alleviating water shortage and water environmental pollution the comprehensive assessment of rwu and management involves multi level criteria system which includes quantitative and qualitative criteria simultaneously in this paper a case of yunnan province located in southwestern china is used to demonstrate feasibility of proposed methodology in recent years the province has focused on utilization of unconventional water resources especially reclaimed water to alleviate regional water shortage and extreme drought conduct reclaimed water utilization assessment and capacity analysis are necessary to evaluate exploitation level and potential rwu alternatives of ten cities are selected in this province these alternatives reflect exploitation and utilization situation of rwu in selected ten cities the multi stage comprehensive evaluation criteria system of rwu is established and shown in following fig 4 as shown in the fig 4 the and denote benefit and cost criteria respectively the and represent quantitative and qualitative criteria respectively the assessment criteria system contains pressure condition effect levels and total of sixteen quantitative and qualitative criteria the pressure criterion level shows demand for rwu the condition criterion level represents economic technical and social conditions for rwu the effect criterion level describes economic effect and potential risk of rwu 4 1 2 the assessment simulation scenarios and decision matrix the assessment simulation we conducted is divided into two steps 1 assessment is conducted without preference information on cws 2 assessment is conducted with available preference information on cws provided by dms and experts the first step shows that dms or experts may be unwilling or difficult to express their cws preferences due to inadequate information cognitive differences on multiple criteria etc nevertheless by means of the inverse weight space analysis smaa grbp and smaa o can preliminarily discriminate each rwu alternative in case 1 as more information are available for dms or experts the vague preference information become clearer and accurate since adequate information support them to show their cws preferences the assessment decision matrix is established in following table 1 the a1 to a10 represent sequence number of total ten alternatives the pvs of quantitative criteria are normalized and uniform probability distribution is used to simulate uncertainty and fluctuation on pvs the qualitative uncertainty is simulated by smaa o model the lower and upper bounds of pvs uncertainty are defined as 10 and 10 the uncertainty interval is modified within respective value ranges of quantitative criteria 4 1 3 the smaa grbp coupled smaa o model for stochastic mcdm sometimes dms or experts are reluctant to conduct their assessment due to inadequate information or cognitive divergence so they are inclined to wait and see initially to this end we firstly perform smaa grbp couple smaa o model to assess rwu under stochastic decision matrix and randomly generated cws within feasible weight space the smaa based mcdm model is numerically solved by total 10 000 independent latin hypercube sampling lhs mckay et al 1979 based monte carlo simulations the results of alternative including rais and cwvs are demonstrated in figs 5 and 6 it can be observed from fig 5 that rwu alternatives we selected are preliminarily assessed and ranked even though cws preference information is not available the a8 a9 and a1 a5 are alternatives whose utilization efficiency and exploring potential for rwu are preferable the alternatives a8 and a9 are especially preeminent whose rais for the best ranking are 0 412 and 0 381 respectively in contrast the a2 a4 a6 a7 and a10 are unlikely to get the first ranking since their rais for the rank 1 are zero the a6 has the largest rai for the rank 10 which indicates that a6 will obtain the worst ranking with higher possibility in feasible cws space observation of fig 6 shows that a2 a6 and a7 have no cwv due to smaller confidence of obtaining the best ranking the cwv of each alternative helps dms or experts to understand the circumstance of cws preference where alternatives can achieve the rank 1 when the cws preference approaches to cwv of one alternative it could be the most preferred one with help of cwvs dms or experts are capable to see advantages and disadvantages of each alternative for example a3 could be the leader once the c9 c10 c12 and c13 are emphasized and criteria including c3 c7 c8 and c14 are less important simultaneously in summary dms or experts have preliminary acknowledge of each alternative without showing their cws preference at the beginning of assessment they can identify potential preferred rwu alternative and realize effect of stochastic factors existed in rwu assessment as adequate assessment information is at hand the discussion between dms or experts helps them to give cws preference for rwu assessment the assessment result will be more elaborate with both stochastic decision matrix and cws preference information next we invite dms and experts to give importance score of each criterion to calculate subjective cws by fahp method the coordinated cws ccws with subjective cws from dms or experts and objective cws from iew are optimized by maximizing total deviations mtds the ccws without considering uncertainty are listed in table 2 moreover to disclose effect of ccws uncertainty on dm stochastic ccws following normal nccws and uniform distribution uccws are calculated according to section 3 4 2 then we run smaa grbp couple smaa o model with input information containing stochastic decision matrix ccws and stochastic ccws the rais for each ranking hais and corresponding cf under ccws are shown in table 3 the detailed histograms of rais hais and cf under ccws and two types of stochastic ccws are exhibited in figs 7 and 8 additionally redmps under three types of ccws are calculated and shown in fig 9 it can be found that results of rwu alternative assessment are clearer when detailed cws preference information is available for model the a9 obtains the first ranking with biggest rai for rank 1 73 9 and a8 follows behind the cf and hai of a9 are 87 8 and larger than 90 respectively it implies that a9 can be discerned as the typical rwu alternative with cws preference information in contrast the cfs and first rank acceptability of a1 a4 a6 a7 and a10 are zero indicating these alternatives are not possible to be preferred for the a6 whose rais distribute mainly in lower rankings without cws preference information it obtains the eighth rank when ccws information is available the a3 has more than 70 possibility of obtaining the lower rankings rank 8 to 10 especially for the 37 possibility of the worst ranking additionally it has the smallest hai 9 6 which demonstrates that a3 can be excluded to the preferred rwu alternative from perspective of different cws we can see that results under three types of deterministic and stochastic cws are almost consistent figs 7 and 8 the a9 is the most preferred one with high confidence higher than 87 and hai of the first ranking more than 90 however influenced by uncertain cws information results under uccws and nccws are less explicit than that of ccws for example a9 rais of the first ranking under ccws uccws and nccws are 0 739 0 727 and 0 728 respectively furthermore rwu assessment results under nncws are slightly clear in comparison with uccws the reason lies in that sampled cws in nccws have larger probability of distributing around the mean value than boundary values while uccws have equal probability for all values in the interval consequently cws follow uniform distribution bring greater uncertainty than normal distribution the same conclusion can be reached in results of redmp fig 9 the redmp of ccws is smaller than both stochastic ccws the redmp of stochastic uccws leads the nccws implying that uncertainty of cws should also be emphasized in rwu assessment finally the rwu alternatives of a9 can be selected as the most preferred and typical alternative for reclaimed water resources utilization a9 performs better on criteria including comprehensive benefits of reclaimed water system economic development policy support and sewage treatment capacity and technology the policy support contributes to sustainability of rwu and economic development provides economical support for promoting utilization efficiency the advanced reclaimed water treatment technology improves quality of rwu and large quantity of conventional water resources can be recyclable meanwhile we can also obtain learning experience from the a8 which is outstanding on several criteria the stochastic rwu assessment is beneficial for managers to recognize existed shortcomings and uncertain factors and drive rwu development in the right way 4 2 case 2 flood water control fwc decision making 4 2 1 the case background the flood water is one of typical uwr which brings abundant water energy resources to be developed however it is a threat to downstream area protection and dam safety the three gorges dam tgd plays important role in yangtze river flood control system tgd regulates upstream flood water and relieves flood control pressure of the downstream reaches including jing river and dongting lake in this case study we evaluated and selected the most preferred fwc alternative from typical multi objective flood control alternatives optimized by qin 2011 qin considered reservoir inflow forecast uncertainty to effectively guide the optimal reservoir operation for fwc total 10 000 independent flood events are simulated and ten pareto optimal scheduling alternatives consist of alternative set with inputting simulated flood events stochastic decision matrix including three quantitative criteria of flood control objectives and two flood risk criteria is developed the former three quantitative criteria contain peak reservoir discharge prd highest reservoir water level hrwl and end reservoir water level erwl these criteria approximately follow normal distribution when considering flood forecast uncertainty qin 2011 two flood risk criteria are defined as peak discharge overtopping risk pdor and reservoir water level overtopping risk rwlor respectively all of five criteria are cost type criteria i e the smaller the better furthermore to comprehensively evaluate alternatives for multi objective fwc we introduce two qualitative criteria ranked by dms and experts the first is downstream flood control reliability dfcr which is used to assess reliability and effectiveness of each alternative the other is reservoir flood mitigation safety rfms which helps to estimate overall security and risk level of the dam the novel qualitative criteria are integrated to stochastic decision matrix which is shown in table 4 4 2 2 the stochastic mcdm for fwc similarly fwc managers and experts are usually unwilling to show cws preferences for fwc decision making in the initial stage the reasons of unwilling can be summarized as 1 inadequate information on flood event such as specific flood volume arrival time of peak flood and flood control situation in downstream areas 2 the tradeoff between dam safety and downstream flood control 3 cognitive differences that need to be coordinated to this end we firstly run the model with stochastic decision matrix and random cws within feasible weight space the rais of fwc alternatives are computed in fig 10 the cwv of each alternative is exhibited in fig 11 although cws preference information of fwc is not available rais in fig 10 show that a6 and a8 have large possibility of attaining the top ranking and small possibility of worse rankings after rank 7 a6 and a8 are inclined to downstream flood control and security if dms and experts exhibit their preferences on protecting downstream area instead of upstream dam these two alternatives can be discerned and chosen as potential preferred alternatives in terms of a7 rais for top rankings before rank 3 are 0 119 0 281 and 0 172 respectively this alternative has great chance of obtaining a higher ranking even the rank 1 if its cwvs in fig 11 are consistent with concern of dms and experts moreover the a1 and a10 are more likely to be worse alternatives since their rai for lower rankings after rank 8 are over 0 60 table 4 shows that a1 and a10 are extreme fwc solutions which consider dam security and downstream flood control as key point respectively so these alternatives can be excluded from preferred solutions for fwc other alternatives such as a9 has possibility of attaining first ranking but it is possible to get the low rankings if its cwv exists deviation with cws preference of dms it can be seen from results above smaa grbp coupled smaa o model provides a preliminary alternative ranking sequence to dms as the adequate flood information is at hand and decision making consultation is conducted novel smaa model can further analyze these potential alternatives with preferences information from dms and experts next the coordinated cws preference information shown in table 5 and stochastic decision matrix are inputs of novel smaa model the effect of uncertain cws on fwc decision making is also studied the normal and uniform probabilistic distributions are used to quantify uncertainty of cws the model is numerically solved by 10 000 lhs based monte carlo simulations under coordinated and stochastic cws the computation results of rais hais and cfs are exhibited in figs 12 and 13 rais in fig 12 are more distinct when cws preference information is given it can be found that a6 and a8 are prominent from alternatives the a6 obtains the best ranking with corresponding rai 0 543 and rais for rankings after 5 are zero so we have reason to believe that a6 can be selected as the most preferred one with given cws preference in terms of a1 a2 and a9 a10 they have no possibility of attaining the rank 1 according to its rais implying that these alternatives can be rejected as feasible fwc solutions other alternatives still have opportunity of being the top alternative even though the possibility is very low fig 13 demonstrates holistic acceptability of respective rankings and confidence degrees it is obvious that a6 a8 and a7 occupy the top three rankings with more than 50 probability the a6 dominates other alternatives with higher than 80 cf under coordinated and stochastic cws preference since a1 a2 and a9 a10 are impossible to be the best alternative their cfs for the rank 1 are zero additionally the a1 and a10 obtain the worse rankings of rank 10 and rank 9 with larger probability respectively the same conclusion can be reached in the initial judgment stage where cws preference information is not at hand eventually we choose the a6 as the most preferred fwc alternatives considering uncertain pvs and cws simultaneously nevertheless the decision error risk still emerges and can be quantified by redmp in fig 14 the redmps of uccws and nccws are higher than that of ccws influenced by uncertain factors moreover it seems that uccws have higher decision error risk than nccws since their distinct distribution characters the difference between uccws and nccws is demonstrated by their rais in fig 12 where the latter is slightly clearer than former the fluctuation of redmp under three types of cws is accorded with uncertainty evolution process that changes from vague status to gradually explicit status dms can understand risk evolution existed in their fwc decision making and release scientific and effective solution for flood mitigation 4 2 3 the distribution characteristics analysis of relative closeness degree rcd in this section distribution characteristics of rcd computed by stochastic grbp smaa grbp and deterministic grbp are analyzed and shown in fig 15 the grbp model is run with inputs of deterministic decision matrix and coordinated cws of fwc the pvs of qualitative criteria are the mean of quantitative values simulated by smaa o in terms of smaa grbp the stochastic decision matrix and cws following normal distribution are regarded as model inputs as shown in fig 15 rcds computed by grbp are deterministic values marked by dotted lines the a6 and a8 are significantly superior to others with higher rcds 0 836 and 0 803 respectively however the gap between rcds of a6 and a8 is 0 033 implying that these alternatives are less distinguished according to grbp the reason may be ranking overlap between the a6 and a8 impacted by nonnegligible uncertainties in contrast rcds of fwc alternatives computed by smaa grbp coupled smaa o appear to follow normal probabilistic distribution when uncertain inputs are considered the rcds are distributed in certain interval with probability instead of constant values for example the rcd of a8 is capable to range from 0 650 to 0 930 in comparison with single value of 0 803 computed by grbp the overlapping areas are existed between possible rcd ranges of fwc alternatives indicating that alternative rankings are inconstant with certain probability therefore the decision error risk exists caused by uncertain factors in pvs and cws with help of redmp potential risk influenced by uncertainty of alternative rankings can be quantified additionally hais for a6 and a8 are 0 818 and 0 690 respectively making their rankings more explicit than deterministic grbp model in summary novel stochastic dm model can identify uncertainties in mcdm process and handle uncertain information effectively it provides feasible way for solving multicriteria assessment and dm problems where uncertainties are incorporated by means of smaa grbp dms and experts can realize impact of uncertainties on dm and potential risk making more reliable decision and assessment task 4 3 parameter analysis of smaa grbp coupled smaa o the identification coefficient ρ is an important parameter in smaa grbp model in this study the effect of identification coefficient on stochastic mcdm is analyzed total six groups of ρ are used to conduct parameter analysis the values of different ρ are 0 20 0 40 0 50 0 60 0 80 and 0 90 then we run the novel smaa grbp coupled smaa o model with each group of ρ and stochastic input information of rwu and fwc alternatives the rais for the first rank hais for the preferred alternative redmps and computation time are computed and exhibited in figs 16 and 17 the most preferred alternatives of rwu and fwc are consistent under different group of coefficients it is obvious that mcdm results of rwu and fwc present clearer as the identification coefficient increases from 0 40 to 0 90 specifically the rais for the first rank and hais for the best alternative approximately appear a linear growth trend since the rai and hai indices are discriminated gradually decision risk quantified by redmp significantly declines the results imply that uncertainty of stochastic mcdm appears to be negative correlation with identification coefficient considering uncertain criteria pvs and cws furthermore results of ccws are the most explicit in comparison with two types of stochastic cws indicating that uncertainty of cws should not be ignored in mcdm process additionally the computation time of deterministic cws seems to be shorter than stochastic cws it seems to cost much computation time when handling uncertain pvs and cws information simultaneously the computation time presents insignificant changing trends under different groups of ρ in terms of rwu assessment the computation time under nccws initially increases with ρ while declines when ρ is larger than 0 50 4 4 effectiveness analysis of novel smaa model to further demonstrate effectiveness of novel smaa grbp model proposed we conduct analysis with running smaa grbp and conventional smaa 2 models simultaneously the qualitative criteria ordinal are solved by smaa o inputs of both models are stochastic decision matrix and ccws of rwu and fwc alternatives the models are run independently based on the same number of lhs monte carlo simulations indices of rais and hais as well as redmp computed by respective smaa models are exhibited in figs 18 23 inspect of figs 19 and 22 stochastic dm results of rwu and fwc computed by novel smaa model are coincided with smaa 2 from aspect of final alternative rankings nevertheless novel smaa model outperforms smaa 2 on alternative discrimination and reducing decision error risk the better discrimination in smaa grbp derives from its efficient grey information handling by combined gra and bp in terms of rwu assessment rai first ranking and hai of the a9 figs 18 and 19 in smaa grbp dominate other alternatives however corresponding rais and hais of a5 a8 and a9 computed by smaa 2 have no obvious difference making it less explicit compared with smaa grbp for fig 20 redmp of smaa 2 is remarkedly higher than smaa grbp disclosing the greater uncertainty in stochastic dm the similar conclusion can be reached in fwc decision making problem observation of fig 21 shows that rais first ranking of a6 and a7 a8 are more distinct in comparison with smaa 2 the a7 can be eliminated by smaa grbp since its minor rai first ranking while the smaa 2 is less explicit to make this decision gaps of hais fig 22 between a6 a7 and a8 are widened distinctly in smaa grbp in contrast to smaa 2 moreover lower redmp fig 23 in smaa grbp makes dms and experts more confident to identify and release preferred and robust flood control alternative the a6 and a8 for fwc have similar differences in hai of the two models fig 22 also difference of redmp is unremarkable compared with rwu case figs 20 and 23 it seems that improvements by smaa grbp in terms of fwc is less significant than that of rwu the reason can be the different quantity of indices used in fwc and rwu the indices are sixteen for rwu while indices used in fwc are seven the uncertainty factors of rwu are more obvious and complex compared with fwc the uncertain information in rwu make conventional smaa 2 model unable to remarkably distinguish those alternatives and their rankings the advantage of proposed methodology is its ability to handle complex uncertain factors and inputs overall novel smaa grbp model is superior to conventional smaa 2 model coupled smaa o considering only uncertainty of criteria pvs the novel model enhances distinction of alternative rankings and reduces risk probability to some extent the same conclusion can be drawn under stochastic cws nccws and uccws the utility function based on gra and bp in smaa grbp contributes to impair impact of uncertain factors on rwu assessment and fwc decision making meanwhile novel utility function effectively reduces potential risk of dm error 5 conclusions unconventional water resources management assessment and decision making dm are involved in multiple quantitative qualitative criteria and uncertainties simultaneously conventional deterministic mcdm model is difficult to describe uncertainties and effectively handle mixed quantitative and qualitative criteria in this study a framework for solving multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria assessment and decision making impacted by uncertain factors is developed the framework contains 1 novel stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis model smaa grbp based on grey relational analysis gra modification and bidirectional projection bp 2 smaa ordinal model smaa o for solving qualitative criteria quantification problem 3 the maximum total deviations mtds based coordinated cws which integrate cws obtained by fahp and iew 4 the assessment or decision making error risk analysis by means of redmp based on case of reclaimed water utilization assessment in southeast of china yunnan province and case of flood water control fwc decision making in tgd several conclusions are reached there are multiple uncertainties in criteria pvs and cws of rwu assessment and fwc decision making these uncertainties should not be ignored by dms or experts since they bring unpredictable effect on final assessment and decision results novel smaa model proposed contributes to disclose effects of uncertain factors on dm by means of probabilistic ranking information including certain probability and confidence that alternatives obtain respective rankings stochastic distribution of rcds and possible decision or assessment error risk 1 at the beginning of rwu assessment and fwc decision making inadequate information makes dms or experts unable to express cws preference the smaa grbp coupled smaa o model is capable to discern potential preferred alternative without cws preference information the cwvs show dms or experts respective superiorities and inferiorities of each alternative 2 as more and more information and data are available effect of uncertain pvs and cws information on rwu assessment and fwc decision making is reduced consequently results of assessment and dm become clearer and gradually discriminated the novel smaa grbp model intuitively exhibits the process of uncertainty transferring and attenuation to dms guiding them to understand essence of stochastic mcdm problem and impact of multiple uncertainties on decision making process 3 identification coefficient ρ of novel model approximately presents positive correlation with ranking discrimination of alternatives the impact of uncertainties on rwu assessment and dm of fwc is effectively reduced as the identification coefficient increases additionally the decision error risk quantified by redmp is also declined 4 novel smaa grbp coupled smaa o model is verified to noticeably decrease influence of uncertain factors on dm and corresponding redmp the gra and bp based utility function proposed is more effective than that of conventional smaa 2 which provides a feasible variant of smaa model to solve complex mcdm problem with multiple uncertainties 5 in summary smaa grbp outperforms on discrimination of alternative rankings and decision error risk reduction effect the novel framework developed is demonstrated feasible tool to handle stochastic mcdm for complex uwr management incorporating quantitative and qualitative criteria dms or experts can use this framework to understand essence of stochastic mcdm and make the most feasible and robust decision or assessment with risk information

4778,in real world managers and decision makers dms of unconventional water resources uwr such as stormwater reclaimed and flood water resources often face various uncertainties and work in changing environment these uncertainties and changing factors derive from imprecise and uncertain information as well as subjective decision uncertainty associated with uwr management consequently in multi criteria decision making mcdm and assessment for uwr management there exist uncertainties on criteria weights cws and performance values pvs additionally qualitative criteria in multi criteria system are often difficult to quantify precisely making conventional mcdm models difficult to handle to this end considering uncertain pvs and cws integrated stochastic mcdm framework is developed for solving uwr management where quantitative and qualitative criteria are mixed the framework contains 1 novel stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa model based on modified grey relational analysis gra and bidirectional projection bp 2 smaa ordinal smaa o model for handling qualitative criteria 3 coordinated cws to compromise conflict of multiple criteria and simulate potential uncertainty 4 decision making dm risk quantification by risk analysis index the framework is demonstrated by two cases of reclaimed water utilization rwu assessment and flood water control fwc results show that framework can effectively handle uncertain information and qualitative criteria quantification parameter significance is analyzed to disclose its impact on dm uncertainty effectiveness analysis is conducted to demonstrate superiority of novel smaa grbp coupled smaa o results indicate that framework provides feasible way for understanding stochastic essence of dm process uncertainty propagation probabilistic ranking information and releasing robust decisions with quantified decision risk at hand keywords unconventional water resources management stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis grey relational analysis bidirectional projection uncertainty propagation quantified risk 1 introduction the unconventional water resources uwc management involves numerous influence factors and information sources including society economic human living ecology and environment lund 2015 for decision makers dms or managers they need to handle complex data collection information coordination competed objectives administration policy and multiple evaluation criteria and interest groups when alternatives or solutions for uwc are at hand finally they need to make assessment or decision based on information by suitable tools the multi criteria decision making mcdm is a collection of methods for comprehensive decision making and assessment work with multiple criteria and alternatives keeney 1970 loucks et al 1981 hwang and yoon 1981 brans et al 1986 mousseau et al 1999 these methods integrated numerous data information policies criteria and stakeholders realizing conflict coordination and collaborative decision making gradually mcdm models become effective tools for dms to make reliable decision or assessment since the end of last century studies on mcdm models have been attracting attention from scholars interested in water resources area shih and ingram 1981 raju et al 2000 khadam and kaluarachchi 2003 malekmohammadi et al 2011 banihabib et al 2017 ervural et al 2018 cambrainha and fontana 2018 tahmasebi birgani and yazdandoost 2018 raju et al 2000 implemented mcdm analysis for irrigation system by means of five models including promethee 2 preference ranking organisation method of enrichment evaluation exprom 2 extended version of promethee 2 electre 3 4 elimination and choice translating reality compromise programming cp and demonstrated feasibility of these models zeleny 1982 diakoulaki and koumoutsos 1991 rogers et al 2000 banihabib et al 2017 examined strategy for reducing water shortage and sustainable management with non compensatory model of electre 3 and compensatory model of simple additive weighting saw and analytical hierarchy process ahp saaty 1987 cambrainha and fontana 2018 balanced water supply demand strategies based on problem structuring method psm and mcdm method to alleviate water shortage tahmasebi birgani and yazdandoost 2018 adopted combined adaptive mcdm technique including combination of ahp process based entropy weights and topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution to evaluate resilient sustainable urban drainage management the mcdm models mentioned make valuable application achievements however they are most applicable to deterministic or fuzzy decision making dm background where uncertainties are usually neglectful in real world application managers or dms work in changing and uncertain environment multiple impact factors and information sources in water resources management often face various uncertainties caused by man made influence hydrological hydraulic analysis as well as social environmental management and economic development consequently these uncertainties make criteria performance values pvs and criteria weights cws unclear and characterized with stochastic factors leading to uncertain even erroneous dm results for example man made uncertainty in data monitoring and statistics lead to uncertain pvs meanwhile hydrology and environment related information such as streamflow water quality are inherently random implying that partial data used for pvs calculation are uncertain in terms of cws dms usually need to coordinate benefits of multiple groups investigators departments and policies zhu et al 2019 sometimes the fluctuation in policy conflicts between different interests and subjectivity and fuzziness of human judgement lead to uncertain and implicit cws as a result the final dm or assessment results for water resources management may produce a deviation to this end some scholars conducted related studies with considering potential uncertainties in water resources management qin et al 2008 conducted adapted planning of water resources management impacted by climate change using mcdm based expert system and demonstrated its feasibility and efficiency hutton et al 2014 considered key uncertainties in water distribution system wds modeling and real time data of wds the methodology proposed is verified to identify robust operational solutions efficiently based on monte carlo simulation subagadis et al 2016 developed novel fuzzy stochastic mcdm approach to systematically quantify both probabilistic and fuzzy uncertainties associated with complex groundwater agricultural system management lu et al 2017 proposed a cloud model based mcdm technique with monte carlo simulation for selecting contaminated groundwater remediation strategies fu et al 2017 proposed combined method of interval parameter programming ipp fuzzy programing fp and one dimensional water quality model for reginal development planning they considered uncertainties of economic population and environment protection to help dms understand the tradeoffs among competed objectives although these models considered uncertain factors in their respective applications the essence of stochastic mcdm cws calculation alternative ranking uncertainty and uncertainty effect reduction need further analysis to make robust control decisions zhu et al 2020 developed an effective stochastic multi attribute acceptability analysis smaa model based on stepwise weight information for robust reservoir operation incorporating uncertainties in pvs and cws furthermore conventional deterministic and stochastic mcdm models are effective to deal with quantitative criteria which can be quantified by respective methods however they are usually incapable to conduct feasible quantification and uncertainty analysis for qualitative criteria so it is critical to find workable way to disclose effect of uncertainty on mcdm and its propagation to decision error risk for water resources management characterized with quantitative and qualitative criteria in this work an uncertainty risk analysis and stochastic decision making oriented mcdm framework is developed to perform dm and assessment task with multiple uncertainties for uwr management the framework integrates uncertainties quantified by expected probabilistic distribution into mcdm model and provides risk formation and quantification process to dms for more robust decision release the framework is mainly composed of four parts 1 smaa grbp grey relational bidirectional projection for dm of quantitative criteria based on improved grey relational analysis gra and bidirectional projection bp 2 smaa ordinal smaa o model for dm of qualitative ordinal criteria 3 cws calculation by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp combined with improved entropy weighting iew and coordination based on maximum total deviations mtds 4 decision risk quantification by risk of errors in dm process redmp the case studies of reclaimed water utilization rwu assessment and dm of flood water control fwc are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of proposed methodology the parameter in novel smaa grbp model is analyzed to reveal its effect on dm and risk finally comparison analysis with conventional smaa 2 coupled smaa o is developed to show advantages of framework proposed 2 the problem description in this section we show the problem discussed in this work from two aspects the first is mcdm problem where qualitative ordinal indices are included the second is stochastic mcdm problem where complex uncertainties are integrated 2 1 the multi criteria system with qualitative ordinal indices in real world application the multi criteria evaluation system for unconventional water management is composed of numerous quantitative and qualitative indices fu et al 2018 the quantitative indices can be observed or quantified according to statistical data optimization tool monitoring equipment etc while for qualitative indices researchers find it difficult or costly to precisely quantified lahdelma et al 2003 instead descriptive language and ordinal rankings are adopted to qualitatively evaluate the performance of these indices the ordinal rankings are usually non linear which is not easily converted to membership function mf closeness degree function cdf widely used in conventional mcdm methods consequently it is critical to find an effective measure to handle mcdm problem which mixes quantitative and qualitative indices 2 2 the stochastic mcdm with uncertain factors in conventional deterministic mcdm methods the decision matrix contains deterministic performance values pvs of multiple criteria without considering their uncertain factors accordingly values of membership or closeness functions computed by models are constant in contrast when the stochastic decision matrix is adopted multiple criteria become random variables following probability distribution influenced by uncertainty the ranking information such as cdf will be stochastic and distribute within a certain range sometimes the cdfs of alternatives have overlapping area that makes dms difficult to identify and judge by deterministic mcdm model the difference between deterministic and stochastic mcdm models is elaborated based on an example in appendix a in this work dealing with two problems mentioned simultaneously stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa based improved mcdm model is proposed the cws determination method is updated and the effect of cws uncertainty on decision result is also considered the next section elaborated the methodology used in this work 3 methodology in this section details of the proposed methodology are exhibited the novel grbp based smaa model smaa grbp is proposed to solve stochastic dm problem quantitative criteria with uncertainties moreover the smaa o model is adopted to handle qualitative criteria which is difficult to quantify furthermore coordinated deterministic cws based on fahp and iew are developed to effectively describe the importance of multiple criteria finally the redmp index is used to quantify risk of potential erroneous decision under uncertainties the framework of proposed methodology is demonstrated in fig 1 3 1 conventional smaa 2 model and variants the stochastic factors in criteria pvs and cws make model inputs suffered from uncertainty deterministic mcdm models are usually incapable to solve dm of uwr management with multiple uncertainties and quantitative qualitative criteria unlike conventional models in smaa 2 the inverse weight space analysis iwsa helps dms to locate the most preferred alternative or solution even though pvs and cws preferences of dms are imprecise and uncertain the smaa models have attracted broad interests for scholars and variants are developed including smaa p smaa ahp smaa topsis smaa tri smaa topsis gca tervonen et al 2009 durbach et al 2014 okul et al 2014 yang and wang 2018 2020 pelissari et al 2019 yang et al 2021 among smaa and its variants smaa 2 is recognized as the most typical and basic framework of others the smaa 2 generalized the analysis to a common utility or value function to include various kinds of preference information and to consider holistically all ranks lahdelma and salminen 2001 suppose that total m alternatives and n criteria for dm are defined the cws vector can be expressed as ω ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω n unlike the deterministic mcdm the pvs in smaa 2 are described by stochastic variable v ij and its probability distribution function f v sv cws are represented by weight probability distribution function f w w in feasible space alternatives for dm are mapped to utility function values by real value utility function shown as follows 1 u i u v i ω j 1 n v ij ω j 2 w s ω r n j 1 n ω j 1 ω 0 where v ij is j th criteria value of i th solution u i is utility function which is function of cws and pvs ω j represents the cws vector w s denotes the feasible space of cws furthermore utility function can map random evaluation criteria and cws distribution to the utility distribution u v i ω the ranking of each alternative can be expressed as an integer from 1 to m by the sorting function the sorting function is shown as follows 3 r a n k v i ω 1 k ρ u v k ω u v i ω where the logical decision results of ρ true and ρ false are 1 and 0 respectively s v i denotes random vector of criteria values the favorable rank weight frw set w i r v is one of the critical concepts in smaa 2 any weight combination from weight set will allocate the utility value to the alternative to make its ranking preferred to r the definition of w i r sv is shown as follows 4 w i r v ω w s r a n k v i ω r based on analysis of frw set random criteria pvs and cws smaa 2 evaluates alternatives mainly through four evaluation indices including the rank acceptability index rai holistic acceptability index hai central weight vector cwv and confidence factor cf the details of four indices ae shown as follows 1 rank acceptability index rai the rai represents the expected value of frw it can be used to measure variation of different preferences or evaluations that give each alternative specific ranks and corresponding acceptable probabilities rai can be calculated as multidimensional integral over distribution of criteria pvs and frw 5 i a i r v f v v w i r v f ω ω d ω d v where the i a i r represents rai of rank r for the i th alternative v denotes corresponding decision matrix v v ij m n this multidimensional integral is difficult to compute its numerical solution precisely monte carlo simulation robert and castella 2004 is a well established method for computing approximative values for high dimensional integrals in this work we adopt the monte carlo simulation based on lhs sampling to compute rai 2 holistic acceptability index hai hai is used to examine overall acceptable level of each alternative through combining all rank acceptability indices it can be defined as the second order decision process the bigger hai means larger acceptability of alternative the hai is computed using following eq 6 6 i b i h r 1 m r i a i r where the r is meta weights disclosing contribution of alternative rankings to the hai the meta weights have three forms including centroid weight linear weight and inverse weight the mathematical expressions of three meta weights are elaborated in appendix b following fig 2 illustrates three forms of meta weights taking eight criteria for example observe that inverse and centroid weights place more emphasis on the weight of bottom rankings while the weight distribution of middle rankings in linear weight is bigger than others according to study conducted by barron and barrett 1996 when modeling normalized weights with full priority the centroid weight form is more accurate and reasonable in this paper we select centroid weight as the meta weight to calculate hais of alternatives 3 central weight vector cwv central weights vector cwv is proposed to describe weight space that assign an alternative to best r rank in this paper we consider the first rank i e the r 1 the cwv is the preferred single vector for preferences of dms who assign an alternative the first rank the cwv can be calculated by following equation 7 c w i v f v v w i r v ω f ω ω d ω d v i a i r r 1 where c w i denotes cwv that support the i th alternative to obtain the best ranking like eq 5 the multidimensional integral is solved by mc simulation 4 the confidence factor cf the confidence factor cf is used to represent probability and confidence degree that alternative obtains the first ranking when we select the corresponding cwv it can be computed as integral over criteria distribution 8 c f i v v r a n k v c w i 1 f v v d v with help of cf the proportion of the stochastic criterion space which makes alternative the best with respective cwvs can be determined lahdelma and salminen 2001 the higher cf implies alternative more confident to be the most preferred 3 2 novel grey relational bidirectional projection grbp based smaa 2 3 2 1 grey relational analysis gra and modification the grey system theory gst was firstly proposed by deng 1982 1989 as one of the components of gst grey relational analysis gra was proposed in 1995 which determines quality grade of samples according to the correlation between comparison sequence and reference sequence tan and deng 1995 yeh and chen 2004 tsai and hsu 2009 xu and yang 2015 the reference sequence has the best correlation with the largest degree of correlation and quality grade of sample can be obtained accordingly the uwr management is correlated with hydrology human production and living and environment elements such as inflow water use water quality and ecological flow these elements are uncertain and characterized by grey information caused by the inherent characteristic of randomness and fuzziness additionally inadequate monitoring data decision information and insignificant data distribution can also lead to grey information in uwr management yang et al 2020 gra can handle multiple grey information which are used to describe situation between black where information is unknown and white where information is deterministic the essential steps of gra are elaborated as follows 1 determine the alternative set ea a 1 a 2 a 3 a m and evaluation criteria set ec c 1 c 2 c 3 c n respectively 2 build the original decision matrix dmx x i j m n and normalize matrix according to following measure 9 v i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 3 locate the positive ideal pi and negative ideal ni alternatives respectively 4 calculate grey relational coefficient grc for pi and ni the conventional grey relational coefficient grc is defined as 10 ς i j μ ρ η δ i j ρ η δ i j v 0 j v i j ς i j μ ρ η δ i j ρ η δ i j v 0 j v i j η max i max j δ i j μ min i min j δ i j where ς i j is grc between the i th alternative and pi alternative ς i j is grc between the i th alternative and ni alternative respectively δ i j is difference sequence v 0 j and v 0 j denote the pi and ni alternatives of the j th criterion respectively v i j is the i th alternative of the j th criterion η and μ maximum and minimum difference values in difference sequence respectively ρ denotes identification coefficient whose range of value is 0 1 to offset uneven distribution problem in conventional grc in this work we introduced a new grc form the novel grc between the i th alternative and pi alternative ς ij and ni alternative ς ij are calculated according to following equation the r ς and r ς are respective grey relational coefficient matrixes 11 r ς ς ij m n r ς l ς ij m n ς ij max i max j v j v ij v j v ij max i max j v j v ij min i min j v j v ij ρ ς ij max i max j v j v ij v j v ij max i max j v j v ij min i min j v j v ij ρ 5 the grey relational degrees grds between the i th alternative and pi ni alternatives g r i and g r i are calculated by following equation 12 g r i j 1 n weigh t j t ς ij g r i j 1 n weigh t j t ς ij where g r i represents grd between the i th alternative and pi solution g r i represents grd between the i th alternative and ni solution weigh t j t is the weight of the j th criterion 3 2 2 gra bidirectional projection model grbp grey relational projection grp is an effective mcdm method which integrates grey relational analysis and projection model zhang et al 2013 grp can fully reflect whole space of criteria attributes and avoid unidirectional deviation conventional grp model is based on the traditional grc and one way projection method as we have discussed above grc in conventional gra model fails to satisfy the order preserving effect and solve uneven distribution problem while the one way projection method is difficult to distinguish the preferred alternative to some extent to this end in this study we combine the modified gra with bidirectional projection bp to develop novel grbp method the decision process of bp method is simple to operate and has higher degree of discrimination liu et al 2014 compared with conventional projection method bp is more reasonable to take the bidirectional projection magnitude into account the novel grbp helps to avoid maldistribution in gra and consider the distance and direction deviation between alternatives and the pi alternative simultaneously in grbp bidirectional projection values based on grc will replace original grey relational degree grd of gra model the bidirectional projection values bpvs of each alternative on the pi alternative and ni alternative are derived from following equations respectively 13 wr ς w e i g h t j ς i j w r ς 0 w e i g h t j ς 0 j bp v i wr ς wr ς 0 wr ς wr ς 0 wr ς wr ς 0 wr ς w r ς 0 j 1 n

j 1 n weigh t j ς ij w e i g h t j t where bp v i and bp v i are bidirectional projection of the i th alternative on the pi and ni alternatives respectively wr ς and wr ς are weighted grey relational coefficient matrixes wr ς 0 is weighted grc between the pi alternative and itself wr ς 0 is weighted grc between the ni alternative and itself instead of gcd which can be used to rank alternatives relative closeness degree rcd is adopted to obtain ranking sequence of alternatives and locate the preferred one the biggest rcd implies that alternative can be discerned as the best the calculation measure of rcd is shown as follows 15 rcd bp v i bp v i b p v i 3 2 3 the novel smaa 2 model based on grbp it is also workable to utilize smaa 2 in conjunction with other mcdm models to extend new forms of utility function in this work original utility function is modified by rcd based on coupled grbp model the novel utility function is developed as follows 16 nfun u i f u n g r b p v i ω where the grbp v i ω denotes rcd function incorporating grc in gra and bpv in bp the calculation measure of rcd is shown in section 3 2 2 the novel grbp based smaa 2 model can be regarded as an extension of conventional smaa 2 using utility function incorporating modified gra and bp the utility function for novel smaa model can efficiently utilize respective strengths of modified gra and bp specifically the gra helps to handle grey information caused by coherent randomness and fuzziness of water resources related data and information moreover it can reflect difference between changing trend in each alternative and the most preferred and emphasize internal connection between multiple quantitative qualitative criteria meanwhile the projection method can express the position relationship in the data curve between each alternative and the ideal alternative or negative ideal solution the novel projection method based on bp helps to improve the alternative discrimination and avert unidirectional deviation in conventional projection method on the other hand gra and bp can handle mcdm problems with multiple uncertainties and imprecision based on smaa 3 3 smaa o model smaa 2 and its modification models are efficient to handle quantitative criteria by means of linear utility function mapped from criteria pvs however when there exist qualitative criteria smaa 2 series models are hard to calculate utility function values directly since pvs of qualitative criteria are usually non linear smaa o is designed for problems where criteria information is totally or partially ordinal and difficult to precisely quantify i e the qualitative criteria like smaa 2 the rank acceptability holistic acceptability indices cwv and cf also apply to smaa o dms usually assign for evaluated alternatives certain rank levels according to qualitative description of ordinal criteria for the alternative with the best performance of a qualitative criterion corresponding ranking is assigned for 1 and so on let the r j 1 2 3 j max be the ranking sequence where 1 and j max denote the best and worst alternative rankings respectively if alternatives are considered equally preferred by dms then the same rank level is placed on these alternatives and rank levels are numbered consecutively for other alternatives therefore alternative placed on the j max th rank will follow j max n since performance of each alternative on ordinal criteria qualitative criteria is not necessarily linear the ordinal criteria cannot be used directly in a multi criteria value function moreover an arbitrary transformation of the scale would affect value function and preference relation among alternatives lahdelma et al 2003 similarly in terms of ordinal criteria monte carlo mc simulation is used to reflect qualitative rank sequence of each alternative with some quantitative cardinal values wang 2013 quantitative cardinal values corresponding to different qualitative sequencings can be generated randomly the law of mapping quantitative values and its feasible space can be reached in appendix c total j max 2 random numbers following uniform distribution are generated in the interval 0 1 by an independent mc simulation these numbers should be ensured distinct and ranked in the descending order the sample mapped quantitative cardinal values for qualitative ordinal rank levels under different mc simulation iterations are illustrated in fig 3 it can be observed from fig 3 that simulated mapping values satisfying feasible space are searched and utilized furthest as independent iterations of mc simulation increase 3 4 the deterministic and stochastic criteria weights cws acquirement 3 4 1 deterministic coordinated cws to effectively determine cws the subjective method of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp and objective method of improved entropy weighting iew are combined to acquire cws based on maximum total deviations mtds we further coordinate the cws ccws calculated by subjective and objective weighting methods to compromise conflicts in cws and make them more aligned with respective importance the illustration of iew method can be reached in yang et al 2019 the details of fahp and mtds are elaborated as follows 1 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp as a typical subjective weighting method ahp decomposes the elements related to the decision into levels such as objective level criteria level and alternative level and conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis on this basis in conventional ahp elements of the judgment matrix are reciprocal and the two comparison factors are easily influenced by other elements therefore based on conventional ahp the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp incorporating fuzzy theory is adopted with complementary judgment matrix cjm tanino 1984 zhang 2000 two factors are compared with each other and sum of weights of two comparison factors is 1 compared with conventional reciprocal judgment matrix the novel cjm is not affected by other elements so that the weighting process is more in line with the physical significance of weight allocation the basic process of fahp is exhibited in appendix d 2 novel coordinated cws based on maximizing total deviations mtds conventional subjective and objective cws combination methods are mainly based on linear combination coefficient lcc although lcc is simple to determine it is impacted by subjective bias and criteria importance uncertainty to this end the novel combination coefficient determination tool is developed based on mtds deviation is an important index to reflect the degree of difference if the pv of the j th criterion x i j has no deviation in all alternatives the x i j is considered having no business with rank sequence of criteria importance as a result the coefficient of this criterion can be assigned to 0 in contrary x i j will have serious effect on the rank sequence of criteria importance if deviation is significant then the corresponding coefficient should be bigger this principle helps to effectively identify relative importance of each criteria and assign reasonable cws let ω j ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω n be the coordinated combination cws α and β are coefficients of subjective fahp and objective iew respectively according to deviation principle the optimization model is established as follows to find maximum total deviations max d e v 17 max d e v j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 ω j j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 α f ω j β i ω j s t α 2 β 2 1 α β 0 where f ω j and i ω j are cws calculated by fahp and iew methods respectively x e j denotes mean value of the j th criterion in all alternatives the above model can be solved through building the lagrange function as follows 18 l α β j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 α f ω j β i ω j λ α 2 β 2 1 let the l α 0 l β 0 the coefficients α and β can be reached according to following formula 19 j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 f ω j 2 λ α 0 j 1 n i 1 m x i j x e j 2 i ω j 2 λ β 0 α 2 β 2 1 finally with the optimized α and β the coordinated cws can be determined based on subjective fahp and objective iew methods 3 4 2 stochastic coordinated cws the deterministic coordinated cws are computed based on maximizing total deviations however in real world cws information are inherently uncertain influenced by multiple factors the cws can be quantified as variables that vary over an interval the change laws of variables can be regarded as symmetric or asymmetric probability distributions in this work we considered coordinated cws following typically symmetric expressions including normal and uniform distributions the upper and lower bounds of two distributions are determined based on rules in yang and wang 2020 3 5 the risk of error in decision making process redmp rankings for alternatives or solutions of uwr management will be fluctuant when uncertain information is incorporated influenced by uncertainties the worst alternative or solution may obtain the first ranking with certain probability thus the rankings computed by smaa grbp coupled smaa o may be greatly different with results computed under deterministic dm environment leading to erroneous dm to this end risk of error in decision making process redmp is adopted to quantify potential decision error risk caused by uncertain information zhu et al 2017 dms can make more reliable decision by realizing potential risk in dm process redmp is calculated by following equation 20 redmp i 2 m β i i a i rfirst r e d m p i 2 m β i i a i rfirst β i i i 2 m i where β i represents risk weights to distinguish the contribution of each alternative to redmp i a i rfirst denotes the first ranking rai of alternative which obtains the i th ranking according to hai calculated by smaa model for instance one alternative gets the i th ranking with high probability according to hai however this alternative still has probability of obtaining the first ranking based on corresponding rai m denotes the quantity of alternatives or solutions 4 case study in this section two cases are studied to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of proposed framework the first case is reclaimed water utilization rwu assessment in yunnan province the other case is based on previous research where flood water control fwc decision making in three gorges dam tgd is studied 4 1 case 1 reclaimed water utilization assessment 4 1 1 description of reclaimed water utilization system as a typical uwr reclaimed water plays an increasingly important role in alleviating water shortage and water environmental pollution the comprehensive assessment of rwu and management involves multi level criteria system which includes quantitative and qualitative criteria simultaneously in this paper a case of yunnan province located in southwestern china is used to demonstrate feasibility of proposed methodology in recent years the province has focused on utilization of unconventional water resources especially reclaimed water to alleviate regional water shortage and extreme drought conduct reclaimed water utilization assessment and capacity analysis are necessary to evaluate exploitation level and potential rwu alternatives of ten cities are selected in this province these alternatives reflect exploitation and utilization situation of rwu in selected ten cities the multi stage comprehensive evaluation criteria system of rwu is established and shown in following fig 4 as shown in the fig 4 the and denote benefit and cost criteria respectively the and represent quantitative and qualitative criteria respectively the assessment criteria system contains pressure condition effect levels and total of sixteen quantitative and qualitative criteria the pressure criterion level shows demand for rwu the condition criterion level represents economic technical and social conditions for rwu the effect criterion level describes economic effect and potential risk of rwu 4 1 2 the assessment simulation scenarios and decision matrix the assessment simulation we conducted is divided into two steps 1 assessment is conducted without preference information on cws 2 assessment is conducted with available preference information on cws provided by dms and experts the first step shows that dms or experts may be unwilling or difficult to express their cws preferences due to inadequate information cognitive differences on multiple criteria etc nevertheless by means of the inverse weight space analysis smaa grbp and smaa o can preliminarily discriminate each rwu alternative in case 1 as more information are available for dms or experts the vague preference information become clearer and accurate since adequate information support them to show their cws preferences the assessment decision matrix is established in following table 1 the a1 to a10 represent sequence number of total ten alternatives the pvs of quantitative criteria are normalized and uniform probability distribution is used to simulate uncertainty and fluctuation on pvs the qualitative uncertainty is simulated by smaa o model the lower and upper bounds of pvs uncertainty are defined as 10 and 10 the uncertainty interval is modified within respective value ranges of quantitative criteria 4 1 3 the smaa grbp coupled smaa o model for stochastic mcdm sometimes dms or experts are reluctant to conduct their assessment due to inadequate information or cognitive divergence so they are inclined to wait and see initially to this end we firstly perform smaa grbp couple smaa o model to assess rwu under stochastic decision matrix and randomly generated cws within feasible weight space the smaa based mcdm model is numerically solved by total 10 000 independent latin hypercube sampling lhs mckay et al 1979 based monte carlo simulations the results of alternative including rais and cwvs are demonstrated in figs 5 and 6 it can be observed from fig 5 that rwu alternatives we selected are preliminarily assessed and ranked even though cws preference information is not available the a8 a9 and a1 a5 are alternatives whose utilization efficiency and exploring potential for rwu are preferable the alternatives a8 and a9 are especially preeminent whose rais for the best ranking are 0 412 and 0 381 respectively in contrast the a2 a4 a6 a7 and a10 are unlikely to get the first ranking since their rais for the rank 1 are zero the a6 has the largest rai for the rank 10 which indicates that a6 will obtain the worst ranking with higher possibility in feasible cws space observation of fig 6 shows that a2 a6 and a7 have no cwv due to smaller confidence of obtaining the best ranking the cwv of each alternative helps dms or experts to understand the circumstance of cws preference where alternatives can achieve the rank 1 when the cws preference approaches to cwv of one alternative it could be the most preferred one with help of cwvs dms or experts are capable to see advantages and disadvantages of each alternative for example a3 could be the leader once the c9 c10 c12 and c13 are emphasized and criteria including c3 c7 c8 and c14 are less important simultaneously in summary dms or experts have preliminary acknowledge of each alternative without showing their cws preference at the beginning of assessment they can identify potential preferred rwu alternative and realize effect of stochastic factors existed in rwu assessment as adequate assessment information is at hand the discussion between dms or experts helps them to give cws preference for rwu assessment the assessment result will be more elaborate with both stochastic decision matrix and cws preference information next we invite dms and experts to give importance score of each criterion to calculate subjective cws by fahp method the coordinated cws ccws with subjective cws from dms or experts and objective cws from iew are optimized by maximizing total deviations mtds the ccws without considering uncertainty are listed in table 2 moreover to disclose effect of ccws uncertainty on dm stochastic ccws following normal nccws and uniform distribution uccws are calculated according to section 3 4 2 then we run smaa grbp couple smaa o model with input information containing stochastic decision matrix ccws and stochastic ccws the rais for each ranking hais and corresponding cf under ccws are shown in table 3 the detailed histograms of rais hais and cf under ccws and two types of stochastic ccws are exhibited in figs 7 and 8 additionally redmps under three types of ccws are calculated and shown in fig 9 it can be found that results of rwu alternative assessment are clearer when detailed cws preference information is available for model the a9 obtains the first ranking with biggest rai for rank 1 73 9 and a8 follows behind the cf and hai of a9 are 87 8 and larger than 90 respectively it implies that a9 can be discerned as the typical rwu alternative with cws preference information in contrast the cfs and first rank acceptability of a1 a4 a6 a7 and a10 are zero indicating these alternatives are not possible to be preferred for the a6 whose rais distribute mainly in lower rankings without cws preference information it obtains the eighth rank when ccws information is available the a3 has more than 70 possibility of obtaining the lower rankings rank 8 to 10 especially for the 37 possibility of the worst ranking additionally it has the smallest hai 9 6 which demonstrates that a3 can be excluded to the preferred rwu alternative from perspective of different cws we can see that results under three types of deterministic and stochastic cws are almost consistent figs 7 and 8 the a9 is the most preferred one with high confidence higher than 87 and hai of the first ranking more than 90 however influenced by uncertain cws information results under uccws and nccws are less explicit than that of ccws for example a9 rais of the first ranking under ccws uccws and nccws are 0 739 0 727 and 0 728 respectively furthermore rwu assessment results under nncws are slightly clear in comparison with uccws the reason lies in that sampled cws in nccws have larger probability of distributing around the mean value than boundary values while uccws have equal probability for all values in the interval consequently cws follow uniform distribution bring greater uncertainty than normal distribution the same conclusion can be reached in results of redmp fig 9 the redmp of ccws is smaller than both stochastic ccws the redmp of stochastic uccws leads the nccws implying that uncertainty of cws should also be emphasized in rwu assessment finally the rwu alternatives of a9 can be selected as the most preferred and typical alternative for reclaimed water resources utilization a9 performs better on criteria including comprehensive benefits of reclaimed water system economic development policy support and sewage treatment capacity and technology the policy support contributes to sustainability of rwu and economic development provides economical support for promoting utilization efficiency the advanced reclaimed water treatment technology improves quality of rwu and large quantity of conventional water resources can be recyclable meanwhile we can also obtain learning experience from the a8 which is outstanding on several criteria the stochastic rwu assessment is beneficial for managers to recognize existed shortcomings and uncertain factors and drive rwu development in the right way 4 2 case 2 flood water control fwc decision making 4 2 1 the case background the flood water is one of typical uwr which brings abundant water energy resources to be developed however it is a threat to downstream area protection and dam safety the three gorges dam tgd plays important role in yangtze river flood control system tgd regulates upstream flood water and relieves flood control pressure of the downstream reaches including jing river and dongting lake in this case study we evaluated and selected the most preferred fwc alternative from typical multi objective flood control alternatives optimized by qin 2011 qin considered reservoir inflow forecast uncertainty to effectively guide the optimal reservoir operation for fwc total 10 000 independent flood events are simulated and ten pareto optimal scheduling alternatives consist of alternative set with inputting simulated flood events stochastic decision matrix including three quantitative criteria of flood control objectives and two flood risk criteria is developed the former three quantitative criteria contain peak reservoir discharge prd highest reservoir water level hrwl and end reservoir water level erwl these criteria approximately follow normal distribution when considering flood forecast uncertainty qin 2011 two flood risk criteria are defined as peak discharge overtopping risk pdor and reservoir water level overtopping risk rwlor respectively all of five criteria are cost type criteria i e the smaller the better furthermore to comprehensively evaluate alternatives for multi objective fwc we introduce two qualitative criteria ranked by dms and experts the first is downstream flood control reliability dfcr which is used to assess reliability and effectiveness of each alternative the other is reservoir flood mitigation safety rfms which helps to estimate overall security and risk level of the dam the novel qualitative criteria are integrated to stochastic decision matrix which is shown in table 4 4 2 2 the stochastic mcdm for fwc similarly fwc managers and experts are usually unwilling to show cws preferences for fwc decision making in the initial stage the reasons of unwilling can be summarized as 1 inadequate information on flood event such as specific flood volume arrival time of peak flood and flood control situation in downstream areas 2 the tradeoff between dam safety and downstream flood control 3 cognitive differences that need to be coordinated to this end we firstly run the model with stochastic decision matrix and random cws within feasible weight space the rais of fwc alternatives are computed in fig 10 the cwv of each alternative is exhibited in fig 11 although cws preference information of fwc is not available rais in fig 10 show that a6 and a8 have large possibility of attaining the top ranking and small possibility of worse rankings after rank 7 a6 and a8 are inclined to downstream flood control and security if dms and experts exhibit their preferences on protecting downstream area instead of upstream dam these two alternatives can be discerned and chosen as potential preferred alternatives in terms of a7 rais for top rankings before rank 3 are 0 119 0 281 and 0 172 respectively this alternative has great chance of obtaining a higher ranking even the rank 1 if its cwvs in fig 11 are consistent with concern of dms and experts moreover the a1 and a10 are more likely to be worse alternatives since their rai for lower rankings after rank 8 are over 0 60 table 4 shows that a1 and a10 are extreme fwc solutions which consider dam security and downstream flood control as key point respectively so these alternatives can be excluded from preferred solutions for fwc other alternatives such as a9 has possibility of attaining first ranking but it is possible to get the low rankings if its cwv exists deviation with cws preference of dms it can be seen from results above smaa grbp coupled smaa o model provides a preliminary alternative ranking sequence to dms as the adequate flood information is at hand and decision making consultation is conducted novel smaa model can further analyze these potential alternatives with preferences information from dms and experts next the coordinated cws preference information shown in table 5 and stochastic decision matrix are inputs of novel smaa model the effect of uncertain cws on fwc decision making is also studied the normal and uniform probabilistic distributions are used to quantify uncertainty of cws the model is numerically solved by 10 000 lhs based monte carlo simulations under coordinated and stochastic cws the computation results of rais hais and cfs are exhibited in figs 12 and 13 rais in fig 12 are more distinct when cws preference information is given it can be found that a6 and a8 are prominent from alternatives the a6 obtains the best ranking with corresponding rai 0 543 and rais for rankings after 5 are zero so we have reason to believe that a6 can be selected as the most preferred one with given cws preference in terms of a1 a2 and a9 a10 they have no possibility of attaining the rank 1 according to its rais implying that these alternatives can be rejected as feasible fwc solutions other alternatives still have opportunity of being the top alternative even though the possibility is very low fig 13 demonstrates holistic acceptability of respective rankings and confidence degrees it is obvious that a6 a8 and a7 occupy the top three rankings with more than 50 probability the a6 dominates other alternatives with higher than 80 cf under coordinated and stochastic cws preference since a1 a2 and a9 a10 are impossible to be the best alternative their cfs for the rank 1 are zero additionally the a1 and a10 obtain the worse rankings of rank 10 and rank 9 with larger probability respectively the same conclusion can be reached in the initial judgment stage where cws preference information is not at hand eventually we choose the a6 as the most preferred fwc alternatives considering uncertain pvs and cws simultaneously nevertheless the decision error risk still emerges and can be quantified by redmp in fig 14 the redmps of uccws and nccws are higher than that of ccws influenced by uncertain factors moreover it seems that uccws have higher decision error risk than nccws since their distinct distribution characters the difference between uccws and nccws is demonstrated by their rais in fig 12 where the latter is slightly clearer than former the fluctuation of redmp under three types of cws is accorded with uncertainty evolution process that changes from vague status to gradually explicit status dms can understand risk evolution existed in their fwc decision making and release scientific and effective solution for flood mitigation 4 2 3 the distribution characteristics analysis of relative closeness degree rcd in this section distribution characteristics of rcd computed by stochastic grbp smaa grbp and deterministic grbp are analyzed and shown in fig 15 the grbp model is run with inputs of deterministic decision matrix and coordinated cws of fwc the pvs of qualitative criteria are the mean of quantitative values simulated by smaa o in terms of smaa grbp the stochastic decision matrix and cws following normal distribution are regarded as model inputs as shown in fig 15 rcds computed by grbp are deterministic values marked by dotted lines the a6 and a8 are significantly superior to others with higher rcds 0 836 and 0 803 respectively however the gap between rcds of a6 and a8 is 0 033 implying that these alternatives are less distinguished according to grbp the reason may be ranking overlap between the a6 and a8 impacted by nonnegligible uncertainties in contrast rcds of fwc alternatives computed by smaa grbp coupled smaa o appear to follow normal probabilistic distribution when uncertain inputs are considered the rcds are distributed in certain interval with probability instead of constant values for example the rcd of a8 is capable to range from 0 650 to 0 930 in comparison with single value of 0 803 computed by grbp the overlapping areas are existed between possible rcd ranges of fwc alternatives indicating that alternative rankings are inconstant with certain probability therefore the decision error risk exists caused by uncertain factors in pvs and cws with help of redmp potential risk influenced by uncertainty of alternative rankings can be quantified additionally hais for a6 and a8 are 0 818 and 0 690 respectively making their rankings more explicit than deterministic grbp model in summary novel stochastic dm model can identify uncertainties in mcdm process and handle uncertain information effectively it provides feasible way for solving multicriteria assessment and dm problems where uncertainties are incorporated by means of smaa grbp dms and experts can realize impact of uncertainties on dm and potential risk making more reliable decision and assessment task 4 3 parameter analysis of smaa grbp coupled smaa o the identification coefficient ρ is an important parameter in smaa grbp model in this study the effect of identification coefficient on stochastic mcdm is analyzed total six groups of ρ are used to conduct parameter analysis the values of different ρ are 0 20 0 40 0 50 0 60 0 80 and 0 90 then we run the novel smaa grbp coupled smaa o model with each group of ρ and stochastic input information of rwu and fwc alternatives the rais for the first rank hais for the preferred alternative redmps and computation time are computed and exhibited in figs 16 and 17 the most preferred alternatives of rwu and fwc are consistent under different group of coefficients it is obvious that mcdm results of rwu and fwc present clearer as the identification coefficient increases from 0 40 to 0 90 specifically the rais for the first rank and hais for the best alternative approximately appear a linear growth trend since the rai and hai indices are discriminated gradually decision risk quantified by redmp significantly declines the results imply that uncertainty of stochastic mcdm appears to be negative correlation with identification coefficient considering uncertain criteria pvs and cws furthermore results of ccws are the most explicit in comparison with two types of stochastic cws indicating that uncertainty of cws should not be ignored in mcdm process additionally the computation time of deterministic cws seems to be shorter than stochastic cws it seems to cost much computation time when handling uncertain pvs and cws information simultaneously the computation time presents insignificant changing trends under different groups of ρ in terms of rwu assessment the computation time under nccws initially increases with ρ while declines when ρ is larger than 0 50 4 4 effectiveness analysis of novel smaa model to further demonstrate effectiveness of novel smaa grbp model proposed we conduct analysis with running smaa grbp and conventional smaa 2 models simultaneously the qualitative criteria ordinal are solved by smaa o inputs of both models are stochastic decision matrix and ccws of rwu and fwc alternatives the models are run independently based on the same number of lhs monte carlo simulations indices of rais and hais as well as redmp computed by respective smaa models are exhibited in figs 18 23 inspect of figs 19 and 22 stochastic dm results of rwu and fwc computed by novel smaa model are coincided with smaa 2 from aspect of final alternative rankings nevertheless novel smaa model outperforms smaa 2 on alternative discrimination and reducing decision error risk the better discrimination in smaa grbp derives from its efficient grey information handling by combined gra and bp in terms of rwu assessment rai first ranking and hai of the a9 figs 18 and 19 in smaa grbp dominate other alternatives however corresponding rais and hais of a5 a8 and a9 computed by smaa 2 have no obvious difference making it less explicit compared with smaa grbp for fig 20 redmp of smaa 2 is remarkedly higher than smaa grbp disclosing the greater uncertainty in stochastic dm the similar conclusion can be reached in fwc decision making problem observation of fig 21 shows that rais first ranking of a6 and a7 a8 are more distinct in comparison with smaa 2 the a7 can be eliminated by smaa grbp since its minor rai first ranking while the smaa 2 is less explicit to make this decision gaps of hais fig 22 between a6 a7 and a8 are widened distinctly in smaa grbp in contrast to smaa 2 moreover lower redmp fig 23 in smaa grbp makes dms and experts more confident to identify and release preferred and robust flood control alternative the a6 and a8 for fwc have similar differences in hai of the two models fig 22 also difference of redmp is unremarkable compared with rwu case figs 20 and 23 it seems that improvements by smaa grbp in terms of fwc is less significant than that of rwu the reason can be the different quantity of indices used in fwc and rwu the indices are sixteen for rwu while indices used in fwc are seven the uncertainty factors of rwu are more obvious and complex compared with fwc the uncertain information in rwu make conventional smaa 2 model unable to remarkably distinguish those alternatives and their rankings the advantage of proposed methodology is its ability to handle complex uncertain factors and inputs overall novel smaa grbp model is superior to conventional smaa 2 model coupled smaa o considering only uncertainty of criteria pvs the novel model enhances distinction of alternative rankings and reduces risk probability to some extent the same conclusion can be drawn under stochastic cws nccws and uccws the utility function based on gra and bp in smaa grbp contributes to impair impact of uncertain factors on rwu assessment and fwc decision making meanwhile novel utility function effectively reduces potential risk of dm error 5 conclusions unconventional water resources management assessment and decision making dm are involved in multiple quantitative qualitative criteria and uncertainties simultaneously conventional deterministic mcdm model is difficult to describe uncertainties and effectively handle mixed quantitative and qualitative criteria in this study a framework for solving multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria assessment and decision making impacted by uncertain factors is developed the framework contains 1 novel stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis model smaa grbp based on grey relational analysis gra modification and bidirectional projection bp 2 smaa ordinal model smaa o for solving qualitative criteria quantification problem 3 the maximum total deviations mtds based coordinated cws which integrate cws obtained by fahp and iew 4 the assessment or decision making error risk analysis by means of redmp based on case of reclaimed water utilization assessment in southeast of china yunnan province and case of flood water control fwc decision making in tgd several conclusions are reached there are multiple uncertainties in criteria pvs and cws of rwu assessment and fwc decision making these uncertainties should not be ignored by dms or experts since they bring unpredictable effect on final assessment and decision results novel smaa model proposed contributes to disclose effects of uncertain factors on dm by means of probabilistic ranking information including certain probability and confidence that alternatives obtain respective rankings stochastic distribution of rcds and possible decision or assessment error risk 1 at the beginning of rwu assessment and fwc decision making inadequate information makes dms or experts unable to express cws preference the smaa grbp coupled smaa o model is capable to discern potential preferred alternative without cws preference information the cwvs show dms or experts respective superiorities and inferiorities of each alternative 2 as more and more information and data are available effect of uncertain pvs and cws information on rwu assessment and fwc decision making is reduced consequently results of assessment and dm become clearer and gradually discriminated the novel smaa grbp model intuitively exhibits the process of uncertainty transferring and attenuation to dms guiding them to understand essence of stochastic mcdm problem and impact of multiple uncertainties on decision making process 3 identification coefficient ρ of novel model approximately presents positive correlation with ranking discrimination of alternatives the impact of uncertainties on rwu assessment and dm of fwc is effectively reduced as the identification coefficient increases additionally the decision error risk quantified by redmp is also declined 4 novel smaa grbp coupled smaa o model is verified to noticeably decrease influence of uncertain factors on dm and corresponding redmp the gra and bp based utility function proposed is more effective than that of conventional smaa 2 which provides a feasible variant of smaa model to solve complex mcdm problem with multiple uncertainties 5 in summary smaa grbp outperforms on discrimination of alternative rankings and decision error risk reduction effect the novel framework developed is demonstrated feasible tool to handle stochastic mcdm for complex uwr management incorporating quantitative and qualitative criteria dms or experts can use this framework to understand essence of stochastic mcdm and make the most feasible and robust decision or assessment with risk information

4779,in a context of rapid change mapping aquatic ecosystems is crucial for their protection particularly in regions of the world where a comprehensive inventory of water bodies is yet to be developed this paper presents a machine learning methodology for predictive aquatic ecosystem mapping two state of the art classifiers were used namely support vector machines svm and random forests rfc these were implemented in a gis environment and trained on a sample of 350 points of a western colombian catchment where the presence or absence or water was known beforehand sixty percent of the dataset was used to train the algorithms and the remainder was used to calibrate predictive accuracy both classifiers rendered a realistic picture of the catchment s water bodies rfc obtained a mean test score in excess of 0 93 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0 95 svm scored 0 89 and 0 89 respectively after optimization performance was better overall in flat regions svm identified correctly over 87 of the surface area of lentic and 82 of lotic water bodies while rfc scored over 80 in both cases in mountain regions precision dropped to 69 and 62 for svm and 65 and 76 for rfc this leads to three conclusions a the method provides satisfactory results at the regional scale and is versatile enough to export to other settings b local scale detail cannot be captured in the absence of an accurate high resolution digital elevation model particularly in mountain areas c complementing standard machine learning metrics with ad hoc indicators is likely needed in cases where the input dataset consists solely of unambiguous examples keywords machine learning freshwater ecosystem services big data supervised classification 1 introduction aquatic ecosystems are numerous and diverse in terms of their hydrological hydrogeological physical chemical and biological characteristics and provide multiple benefits to humans gwp imbo 2015 suitably there is no universal conceptualization of what an aquatic ecosystem is beyond an ecosystem that depends on water definitions are typically site or country specific and based on ad hoc initiatives for instance the australian aetg 2012 establishes that aquatic ecosystems are those that depend on flows or periodic or sustained inundation waterlogging for their ecological integrity e g wetlands rivers karst and other groundwater dependent ecosystems saltmarshes estuaries and areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed 6 m in other cases such as india s national plan for conservation of aquatic ecosystems the idea of aquatic ecosystem equates to a certain type of freshwater body i e wetlands including lakes mefcc 2019 for the purpose of the ensuing pages aquatic ecosystems are dealt with in a broad sense using the classification of lentic and lotic water bodies and paying attention to those types of aquatic ecosystems that do not necessarily consist of surface water accumulations i e crypto wetlands aquatic ecosystems are vulnerable to land management change and climate variability hestir et al 2015 as such they rank among the world s most endangered environmental assets take for instance wetlands the ramsar convention on wetlands estimates that approximately two thirds of the world s wetlands have disappeared since 1900 rcw 2015 this loss has also been quantified at 87 since 1700 with a considerable acceleration during the 20th and early 21st centuries davidson 2014 the environmental implications are dire because freshwater ecosystems play a major role in underpinning biodiversity according to stendera et al 2012 about 29 000 species have been described in freshwaters including 12 000 species of fish to go with another 17 000 species of microorganisms algae insects crustaceans annelids and mollusks these authors also indicate that freshwater ecosystems support one tenth of the world s animal species and about one third of all vertebrates the first step towards safeguarding aquatic ecosystems is to acknowledge their very existence this can be difficult in remote regions as well as in parts of those catchments where accessibility is an issue van deventer et al 2016 mapping provides information about the spatial extension and distribution of water bodies which in turn allows for the development of monitoring and protection strategies van deventer et al 2018 over the years environmental agencies worldwide have strived to map aquatic ecosystems within their jurisdictions dewnr 2015 dws 2017 often in the context of the evaluation of ecosystem services ec 2014 cea 2015 such initiatives have sometimes been hampered by the limitations of traditional mapping approaches and are still lacking in many parts of the world hestir et al 2015 mcmanamay et al 2017 over the years the issue of mapping water bodies has been tackled from different viewpoints including remote sensing ozesmi and bauer 2002 palmer et al 2015 for instance castaño castaño et al 2008 coupled satellite images with a detailed digital elevation model dem to map infiltration losses in spanish wetlands similarly tulbure et al 2016 examined the extent of surface water bodies based on three decades of seasonally continuous landsat time series in a semi arid region of australia remote sensing of surface water dynamics has been frequently used in the context of broader studies including those dealing with land use change drought and bird communities schaffer smith et al 2017 reiter et al 2015 the advent of machine learning techniques brought about innovative methods for predictive mapping of water bodies studies dealing with floodplain detection have become particularly prevalent in the literature for instance degiorgis et al 2012 used supervised classification to delineate flood prone areas in the po basin italy in turn jafarzadegan et al 2018 tried a geomorphic approach to map floodplains for the conterminous united states these authors showed probabilistic 100 year floodplain maps generated by means of machine learning approaches to match those generated through hydraulic modelling and well as federal emergency management agency maps along the same lines woznicki et al 2019 developed a spatially complete floodplain map of the conterminous united states using random forest classification this approach rendered generally accurate results except for the arid parts of the south west states finally manfreda et al 2015 delineated flood prone areas based on linear binary classifiers and dem derived morphologic features precedents of mapping aquatic ecosystems by means of machine learning classification and mixed data sources are relatively uncommon studies usually focus on a specific type of water body maxwell et al 2016 wen and hughes 2020 and rely to an important extent on remote sensing chignell et al 2018 while rightfully perceived as the tool of choice in mapping studies satellite based techniques can be problematic in instances where seasonal water surfaces shift geographically or vary between wet and dry periods this is relevant when cloud cover is frequent or permanent like it happens in mountain tropical regions anaya et al 2015 mapping surface water bodies in these contexts is challenging because cloud free satellite observation must be concurrent with the occurrence of water pekel et al 2016 furthermore detection efforts in rivers and streams have been observed to present significant uncertainties allen and pavelsky 2018 newer satellite technologies such as sentinel 1 make it possible to obtain clear images of the land surface even in the presence of clouds furthermore image composites can be used to offset the effect of cloud cover to a large extent however cloudless images are not exempt from shortcomings for instance tree canopies and hydrophyte vegetation may overshadow water as a result identifying water bodies directly can sometimes be troublesome particularly in the case of small to medium sized streams and ponds furthermore mapping extensive aquatic ecosystems such as crypto wetlands based on satellite images may be altogether unfeasible in humid climates where the water table is close to the surface but where water is not visible finally satellite images can pose issues of availability accessibility and affordability this all justifies the development of alternative approaches to map the presence aquatic ecosystems in this context this paper presents and validates an approach to map aquatic ecosystems the method is demonstrated through its application to a highly heterogeneous catchment characterized by the absence of cloudless remote sensing images and by the presence of large areas of difficult access two supervised classification methods were used support vector machines and random forests and satellite images were replaced with a number of spatially distributed environmental variables including temperature rainfall lithology landforms and water table depth the goal is to provide insights to the delineation of protection buffers by extrapolating the pattern recognition capabilities of supervised classification to develop predictive maps as well as to integrate state of the art machine learning applications with various types of information into a single gis tool 2 methods 2 1 study site this methodology is demonstrated through its application to the valle del cauca region colombia and more specifically to the sector of the cauca river basin that falls within the boundaries of the valle del cauca department fig 1 the study area covers nearly 11 000 km2 and consists of a narrow intramontane valley whose main axis runs from south to north two major mountain chains conform its eastern and western boundaries these are characterized by steep slopes and mountain peaks that exceed 4000 m a s l in altitude the flat section of the valley is approximately 40 km wide in the santiago de cali area and less than 10 km wide at its narrowest point around buga valley flats range in altitude between 900 north and 1000 m a s l south over an approximate distance of 215 km the cauca valley is a tectonic depression associated with a series of major geological faults that split the andean range in two subparallel branches quaternary materials filling the valley bottom result in a large aquifer system whose thickness is several hundred meters the mountain ranges to the east and west made up of igneous rocks conform the impervious lateral boundaries and the basement of the aquifer this setting is crucial for aquatic ecosystems in the valley flats the valley bottom features a poorly defined drainage network and a shallow water table that result in a strong interrelation between surface water and groundwater this gives rise to many springs and wetlands which often present intermittent links to floodplains and branching streams and rivers groundwater underpins numerous water bodies across the plain including the ramsar listed laguna de sonso wetland in some cases the behavior of these aquatic ecosystems alternates between lentic and lotic depending on aquifer discharge recent rainfall and surface runoff aquatic ecosystems in mountain areas typically take place in small depressions lagoons and lakes as well as along the surface drainage network streams and rivers and depend exclusively on precipitation climatic conditions are highly variable the city of santiago de cali located in the valley bottom mean altitude 1000 m a s l presents a dry summer tropical savanna climate average daily temperatures remain stable throughout the year ranging between 23 4 c in november and 24 3 c in august yearly rainfall exceeds 1000 mm and presents a bimodal distribution with peaks in april 130 mm and november 102 mm while july is the driest month 32 mm this provides a contrast with the farallones de cali national park located a few kilometers to the southwest of the city within the same municipality the mountains of the national park reach over 4200 m a s l in altitude and present a cold humid climate with temperatures that drop to below 5 c and yearly rainfall of 2800 mm the corporación autónoma regional del valle del cauca cvc is the national agency that manages the region s environment the cvc has compiled an inventory of water bodies that is publicly accessible through its website though not strictly comprehensive this inventory comprises over 1 500 natural aquatic ecosystems together with over 5 000 artificial water bodies such as irrigation reservoirs thus it provides an adequate benchmark for demonstration in the context of this research 2 2 conceptual model target and explanatory variables the underlying assumption of this approach is that the presence or absence of aquatic ecosystems target variable can be inferred from a mixture of spatially distributed explanatory variables the ensemble of target and explanatory variables is termed a conceptual model based on a training dataset machine learning algorithms use the conceptual model to identify patterns of explanatory variables that lead to the presence or absence of aquatic ecosystems the findings are then extrapolated to the remainder of the study area accuracy is evaluated by running the algorithms on an independent test set as well as by comparing the predictions of the model with the existing inventory of aquatic ecosystems from a hydrogeological standpoint classifications of aquatic ecosystems such as those found in the valley rely on a number of variables these include but are not restricted to parent rock geology lithology stratigraphy structural geology of the groundwater basin driving force mechanisms such as gravity pressure or density temperature dominated discharge groundwater quality and the geomorphology of the discharge point cantonati et al 2020 research in the context of spring potential studies suggests that additional predictors such as slope related indices topographic wetness index stream power index and drainage density can also be relevant ozdemir 2011a 2011b chen et al 2018 the conceptual model in this case involves twelve explanatory variables including altitude drainage density lithology geomorphology classic and morphometric water table depth distance to a major river thermal floor rainfall slope stream power index and topographic wetness index these are coded r altitude r draindens r geol r lndfcvc r geomorphon r nf17 r riverdist r pisoterm r rain r slope r spi and r twi respectively since the input dataset is relatively small by machine learning standards variables were reclassified on a one by one basis in order to facilitate supervised learning table 1 fig 2 presents a spatial overview of the reclassified outcome of each layer altitude was identified as an explanatory variable because there is a clear distinction between the type of aquatic ecosystems that take place in the valley flats and those that occur in the mountains the former are typically groundwater dependent whereas the latter take place in mostly impervious materials and rely on recent rainfall altitude was reclassified in 500 m steps from below 1000 m a s l in the valley bottom to over 4000 m a s l in the mountain tops the 30 m resolution dem collected by the alos satellite was downloaded from the website of the japan aerospace exploration agency alos world 3d 30 m aw3d30 version 3 1 the dem was also used to develop various ancillary layers such as slope and slope related indices slope and slope related variables are expected to play an important role in the presence of aquatic bodies this is because slope not only controls surface runoff but also constrains the spatial distribution of hydrological variables such as infiltration potential and soil moisture lentic aquatic ecosystems typically take place in topographic depressions and in gently sloping areas whereas the presence of lotic water bodies is not necessarily associated with steepness two slope related indices were used for further qualification these are the topographic wetness index twi and the stream power index spi the topographic wetness index is a well known algorithm that combines the upslope area draining into a pixel with the pixel slope in order to quantify topographic control on surface hydrological processes sørensen et al 2006 a high topographic wetness index represents a lower slope and a larger contributing area which in turn implies a greater potential for the accumulation of surface water lentic systems whereas a medium value suggests a transit channel lotic system low values point at a small potential for the development of aquatic ecosystems twi has been observed to be correlated with certain soil attributes including horizon depth silt percentage organic matter content and phosphorus moore et al 1993 much like the topographic wetness index the stream power index uses slope and contributing area as input variables however it combines them to estimate the erosive potential of surface runoff instead high scores represent regions characterized by steep slopes and flow accumulation which typically equates to a high erosive potential in this case both indices were computed with a resolution of 30x30 meters and categorized from very low to very high based on percentile distribution the presence of aquatic ecosystems is ultimately constrained by rain rainfall is associated with altitude although some important exceptions are observed in the eastern range in particular a large proportion of the southeastern mountains present rainfall values similar to those recorded in the valley bottom rainfall was reclassified in 200 mm intervals based on the resolution of the cvc database geology and geomorphology constrain surface runoff infiltration and erosive potential in the case at hand igneous and metamorphic rocks schists sandstone and conglomerates quartzodiorite and basalts amphibolites and gabbros make up the mountain areas while sedimentary deposits conform most of the valley bottom the lithological map was reclassified in six major units in order to minimize noise in the training and testing processes table 1 in contrast geomorphology can be approached from two different perspectives the first one is morphometric and relies chiefly on the dem pixels are classified on a scale of 1 to 10 where each score corresponds to a specific landform flat summit ridge shoulder spur slope hollow foot slope valley depression classification was implemented by means of qgis in built geomorphon plugin jasiewicz and stepinski 2013 which uses a series of pattern recognition algorithms geomorphon identifies the characteristics of each pixel by combining the elevation of neighbouring points with the line of sight principle stepinski and jasiewicz 2011 jasiewicz and stepinski 2013 the second geomorphological method is a standard descriptive classification where landforms are identified and mapped according to geological and geomorphological criteria i e alluvial fan fluvial terrace flood plain this was obtained directly from the cvc s official cartographic database landform descriptions were grouped as per table 1 drainage density is computed as the length of river reaches within a given sub catchment divided by the sub catchment area it is derived from geology and geomorphology and sometimes linked with terrain permeability meijerink 2007 development of drainage lines depends on local base level of erosion which is governed by tectonic or geomorphological history in permeable deposits such as alluvium or fluvial terraces low drainage density typically results in high infiltration this leaves little water for the formation of incised channels but favours the presence of lentic aquatic ecosystems if the water table is shallow enough rock outcrops such as those found in the mountains of the study area are much less likely to accumulate groundwater a well developed drainage network in these materials results in fast runoff particularly when weathered zone is small to non existent hence mountain areas are prone to lotic aquatic ecosystems with the exception of surface water accumulation in topographic depressions fig 2 presents the spatial distribution of drainage density categorized in 200 m km2 intervals as shown in this case the valley is controlled by a medium high density while the mountains present a broader range from very low to very high in areas underlain by groundwater aquifers water table depth can control the hydrological dynamics of aquatic ecosystems to a large extent this is because a shallow water table is likely to flood topographic depressions as well as to contribute to gaining river reaches and lentic water bodies during dry seasons furthermore a shallow water table may underpin ecological communities even if the water never rises to the surface as groundwater keeps the terrain moist and provides a plentiful supply for plants both situations occur in the cauca plain where the observed piezometric trends remain stable since the late 1960s despite widespread groundwater pumping a water table depth map of the valley was developed with groundwater levels from 1366 monitoring and production wells all of them collected in the field in june 2017 fig 2 dynamic levels were discarded prior to geostatistical interpolation in order to filter our instable levels affected by recent pumping this leaves the sample in 1248 data points this represents a spatial density close to one point per every two square kilometers the total aquifer surface located within the study area is approximately 3000 km2 which is considered sufficient in view of the relatively monotonous disposition of the water table a significant proportion of the aquatic ecosystems in the official inventory were observed to fall within approximately one kilometer of a river course this is largely because many of the existing water bodies in the valley are oxbow lakes and floodplain depressions hence distance to main surface water courses was deemed a potentially useful explanatory variable for aquatic ecosystems in the flats 2 3 supervised machine learning classification supervised classification is a major subdivision of machine learning it consists in predicting the outcome of a discrete target variable based on a number of explanatory variables and a series of examples whose result is known because of the mathematical complexity behind supervised classifiers is typically difficult to predict whether a given algorithm will perform better than another hence it is common practice to run several on the same dataset in order to compare performance and outcomes wang et al 2016 2017 qin et al 2018 mlmapper a qgis 3 2 plugin was used to run the machine learning algorithms mlmapper develops predictive maps based on point source ground truth data martínez santos and renard 2020 díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 this software features thirteen algorithms of the scikit learn 0 19 2 toolbox pedregosa et al 2011 representing several families of supervised learning classifiers in this case several trial runs were carried out using all of mlmappers thirteen algorithms these led to the conclusion that random forests rfc and support vector machines svm consistently rendered the most accurate results for the existing dataset therefore all other algorithms were discarded to place the focus on these two support vector machines are supervised learning algorithms that work both for classification and regression problems from a conceptual standpoint svms represent data as points in a multidimensional space data points are mapped in such a way that the instances of each category are separated by a gap termed a hyperplane mathematically the svm approach consists in finding the optimal hyperplane to distinguish among potential outcomes so that predictions can be made as to which side of the hyperplane an unknown outcome would fall into hsu and lin 2002 this is achieved in iterative fashion by prioritising always the hyperplane with the greatest discrimination margin svm handles both continuous and categorical variables and is typically effective in high dimensional spaces or at least when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples because of the use of support vectors in the decision function it is also efficient in terms of computational cost the possibility of using different kernel functions for decision including custom ones makes this technique highly versatile on the other hand svm may be vulnerable to overfitting when the number of explanatory variables is much greater than the number of samples besides svm does not directly render probability estimates which means these are calculated using five fold cross validation pedregosa et al 2011 in the context of environmental studies svm has been used to map groundwater potential martínez santos and renard 2020 estimate groundwater contamination díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 evaluate ecosystem service dynamics talukdar et al 2020 analyse hydrometeorologic monitoring networks asquith 2020 and predict landslide susceptibility huang and zhao 2018 among other applications the rfc classifier is a meta estimator based on decision tree algorithms breiman 2001 rfc fits a number of decision trees on various sub samples of a given dataset then it uses averaging to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting pedregosa et al 2011 it is thus described as an ensemble learning method that can be used both for classification and regression rfcs can be expected to outperform decision trees on a consistent basis as they are designed to reduce variance by averaging multiple deep decision trees trained on different parts of the same training set rfc implementation is straightforward conceptually and in practice furthermore it produces accurate predictions and can handle a large number of input variables biau 2012 perhaps the main disadvantage of a random forest is that the internal decision logic is lost to the user due to the implementation of a large number of decision trees although it is possible to compute feature importance to at least gain an understanding as to which variables drive predictions furthermore the ensemble approach can result in high computational costs potentially rendering the algorithm less efficient in instances where time is a constrain random forests are highly versatile and have been used in different fields of environmental science including fire severity mapping collins et al 2020 deforestation saha et al 2020 biomass mapping chen et al 2019 and flood susceptibility chen et al 2020 precedents also exist in the wetland and floodplain mapping literature maxwell et al 2016 berhane et al 2018 woznicki et al 2019 2 4 classifier training testing and feature importance a ground truth input dataset of 350 points was developed based on the official cartography of the cvc authority which is publicly available online www geo cvc gov co visor avanzado half of it represents locations in the catchment where aquatic ecosystems are known to exist this includes an even sample of lentic and lotic water bodies from mountain and valley areas since mlmapper works with point source data these were picked by identifying locations that could be identified unequivocally as water the second half of the dataset is made up of spots characterized by the absence of aquatic ecosystems these are randomly distributed across the region also covering high and low altitude areas mlmapper automatically splits this input dataset in two in this case 60 of the data was used to train the algorithms whereas the remaining 40 was used for testing the outcomes are visible to the algorithms during training so that the latter can develop patterns of explanatory variables that result in the presence or absence of aquatic ecosystems conversely outcomes are hidden to the classifiers in the test phase so that the algorithms have to guess the result based on what they learned during training because the input dataset is relatively small 10 fold cross validation was carried out during this process in order to maximize the training and testing value of the models machine learning performance is assessed based on a number of standard metrics table 2 preference is typically given to test score and to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc test score is computed as the number of correct guesses over the total number of attempts on the test dataset it thus provides a direct measure of predictive accuracy the auc is a probabilistic metric that evaluates the extent to which the algorithms are capable of distinguishing between classes both metrics rank the algorithms on a scale of 0 to 1 a higher score implying better performance a 0 5 score in either metric however implies that the prediction is no better than a random guess 50 chance the choice of explanatory variables is based on expert criteria beyond human judgement there is no telling as to whether a given conceptual model takes all relevant variables into account it is however possible to discard noisy irrelevant or counterproductive elements based on computing feature importance mlmapper uses recursive feature elimination for this purpose given an external estimator that assigns weights to features e g the coefficients of a linear model the goal of recursive feature elimination is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features the estimator is first trained on the initial set of explanatory variables and the importance of each of these is obtained either through a coefficient attribute or through a feature importance attribute the least important features are then pruned from the model that procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the optimal number of features to select is eventually reached pedregosa et al 2011 collinearity takes place when two or more variables of the conceptual model are highly correlated this may hurt classifier performance and interpretability because the regression coefficients of certain algorithms are not uniquely determined mlmapper incorporates a collinearity analysis function to prevent collinearity from having a negative impact on the results collinearity analysis is carried out prior to running the algorithms each algorithm is governed by a set of parameters parameter optimization may be carried out by different methods mlmapper picks the best result out of running grid search and randomized search routines parameter descriptions for each algorithm and their adjusted values are presented in table 3 3 results feature collinearity is typically addressed by means of establishing a pair wise correlation threshold between variables there is no consensus as to what the value of this threshold should be in machine learning applications although it is frequent to work anywhere within the 0 4 to 0 85 range dormann et al 2013 fig 3 presents a correlation matrix with the results of the collinearity analysis where pair wise correlation coefficients are expressed in the form of a coloured palette ranging from 1 0 inverse correlation to 1 0 direct correlation direct correlation coefficients were observed to be below 0 8 in all cases while one single inverse correlation slightly in excess of 0 8 was found for one of the variable combinations cvc s original landform classification vs the calculated water table level thus all variables were considered sufficiently independent from one another to justify their inclusion in the conceptual model feature selection reveals that the optimal number of variables for both the svm and rfc algorithms is seven fig 4 however feature elimination differs partially in terms of which variables should be kept in each case the svm classifier works best with altitude landforms thermal floor rainfall river distance slope and topographic wetness index while the rfc outcomes are optimized when using morphometry water table depth rainfall river distance stream power index slope and topographic wetness index four explanatory variables are thus common namely rainfall river distance slope and topographic wetness index landforms were also found to be of importance by both algorithms albeit under different conceptualizations rfc favours morphometry over a classic landform classification whereas the opposite applies to svm lithology and drainage density were ignored by both classifiers there are also some discrepancies in the relative importance of the explanatory variables fig 5 shows feature importance as computed by the rfc model topographic wetness index and landforms were the most important variables followed by morphometry slope and water table rainfall was also found to contribute to test score but only marginally in contrast svm presents variable coefficients of 0 20 for altitude 0 26 for morphometry 0 66 for thermal floor 0 14 for rainfall 0 56 for river distance 0 06 for slope and 2 07 for topographic wetness index table 3 shows the results of model optimization the highest optimized test score was obtained for the grid search optimization routine in both cases rfc scored over 0 93 while svm remained slightly below 0 90 table 5 in turn presents the key metrics for the optimized model runs as shown rfc outperforms svc in terms of train and test scores as well as in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0 95 vs 0 89 classifier outcomes were extrapolated to develop predictive maps from a mapping perspective the results should be interpreted as the likelihood of encountering aquatic ecosystems rather than as a delineation of surface water bodies fig 6 the ensemble map represents the arithmetic mean of the outcomes of the two classifiers for each pixel in other words the blue colour represents agreement on a positive outcome and the red colour means agreement on a negative outcome a yellow pixel reports a disagreement between the two classifiers both algorithms discriminate clearly between plain and mountain this is attributable to the effect of geomorphological variables such as topographic wetness index morphometry slope and landforms all of which delineate clear thresholds between the two subregions algorithm specific maps depict reality to an acceptable extent the cauca river corridor is delineated in blue the same as all major surface water courses in the valley this is consistent with the presence of numerous oxbow lakes ponds and riverine wetlands which make up for the vast majority of lentic systems in the plain it also represents adequately the fact that the water table is generally shallow thus underpinning many invisible aquatic ecosystems outside the official inventory furthermore both classifiers are correct in identifying surface divides as areas where water bodies are less likely to occur similar considerations apply to mountain areas svm and rfc identify valleys depressions and ridges the first two are mostly classified as areas suitable for the presence of aquatic ecosystems whereas the latter is delineated in red unsuitable in all cases 4 discussion a chief purpose of this tool would be the identification of areas where aquatic ecosystems are likely to occur based on a relatively small sample of known cases most of the ensuing analysis deals with lentic and lotic water bodies because the existing inventory focuses chiefly on these two ecosystems types however it is important to note that the predictive maps do not aim at depicting these specifically in the context of this study the definition of an aquatic ecosystem also encompasses areas where the water table may be shallow enough to underpin vegetation or where the surface of water bodies may be covered by tree canopies and or hydrophytes take for instance the area identified in blue in figs 6 and 7 presence of aquatic ecosystems in terms of surface this is much larger than the actual area known to contain surface water bodies this is because no explicit attempt was made to delineate the edges of surface water accumulations the idea was instead to extrapolate the pattern recognition capabilities of the classifiers to identify areas with a similar set of features to those in the training set for instance lentic ecosystems in the plain are often found at local scale lowlands close to topographic channels in areas with a shallow water table and with a high topographic wetness index from the point of view of the explanatory variables these features are practically identical to those that one would expect in crypto wetlands in the same area hence the map not only presents actual water bodies but also attempts to predict the potential location of other aquatic ecosystems in order to help complete the regional inventory in the field with this in mind the outcomes of fig 6 suggest that the actual surface area of aquatic ecosystems in the valle del cauca plain could be much larger than currently thought this is readily observed on the ground even if beyond this work no other attempts to define it have been made map outcomes are considered satisfactory from this perspective nevertheless local scale results suggest that there is room for further improvement particularly if outcomes are to be analysed under a different light for instance by determining the surface area of inventoried aquatic ecosystems that was correctly identified as per the existing field inventory it is possible to tell how well each algorithm fared in regard to predicting the presence of lentic and lotic aquatic ecosystems and thus to evaluate the reliability of the results beyond standard machine learning metrics table 6 presents the proportion of inventoried aquatic ecosystems as identified by svm and rfc as well as by the ensemble mean of the two this is computed as a pixel count several conclusions spring to mind a major one is that both classifiers perform better in flat regions this is attributed to two factors the first one has to do with the resolution of the output map 100x100 meter pixels indeed many mountain water bodies are small less than 1 ha in the case of lentic bodies a few meters wide in the case of the lotic ones and surrounded by steep slopes since the pixel surface area is 1 ha the presence of water in small depressions and narrow river valleys can be easily blurred by the factor of scale fig 7 a second plausible explanation is the digital elevation model close examination of the mountains shows that areas where lakes take place seldom show up as flats or depressions in the dem in fact despite its theoretically high accuracy altitude differences in excess of 25 m were found from one pixel to the next in mountain spots known to be flooded as this information is used to compute ancillary layers slope and slope related variables dem inaccuracies could represent a major source of error for the classifiers this has additional implications in terms of appraising the results standard machine learning metrics provide an accurate overview of algorithm performance but may prove suboptimal in terms of actually depicting how accurate the output is when expressed in map terms tables 4 and 5 suggest that auc and test scores machine learning metrics overstated success when compared with the results in terms of surface area map outcome this could be attributed to the fact that the input dataset consisted almost exclusively of unambiguous examples while both classifiers excelled at finding explanatory patterns an input dataset comprising potentially misleading situations could not be developed hence the algorithms could not be trained to depict conditions comprehensively at the local scale further research should attempt to deal with these shortcomings the above also explains an apparent contradiction in the results machine learning metrics suggest that rfc performs better than svm this holds true in the sense that rfc is able to predict the outcomes of the test dataset more accurately than svm however this only means that rfc found a higher correlation between the expected outcome and the explanatory variables when the results are examined in terms of surface area of known aquatic ecosystems it becomes evident that rfc was only able to outperform svm in identifying lotic ecosystems in mountain areas fig 7 and table 6 while svm obtained better results in every other respect in other words the map produced by svm is more reliable in pixel terms despite lower auc and test scores across the board these outcomes highlight two limitations of mlmapper both of which stem from the fact that the code was originally developed to deal with borehole data martínez santos and renard 2020 the first one is that mlmapper works with point source inputs this improves training potential with items whose spatial location is clearly defined boreholes springs but is less efficient than polygon based training when ground truth information presents a range of values for the same target feature crypto wetlands landforms rock types the second limitation is that mlmapper only supports binary classification by design this in turn means that the only way to have a gradation of the result is to perform ensembles of classifier results the supervised classification approach is versatile enough to export to other settings with the exception that the conceptual model should be derived based on site specific considerations for instance the use of evapotranspiration indicators such as the normalized difference vegetation index may prove valuable in arid and semiarid contexts where there is often a seasonal contrast between dry and humid areas in this case however this variable was ruled out for various reasons for one landsat 8 images of the study area with less than 40 cloud cover are rare furthermore sugar cane is ubiquitous across the plain and irrigation takes place all year round irrigated fields send an evapotranspiration signal as strong as that of the vegetation surrounding aquatic ecosystems thus making it difficult for the classifiers to discriminate between the two it is nevertheless hypothesized that this kind of input could have improved the detection of mountain water bodies had satellite images been used this is because exposed water surfaces are easily detected in the absence of cloud cover and vegetation which could have facilitated algorithm training 5 conclusions machine learning techniques provide a whole new set of insights in the field of environmental characterization supervised classification has proven adept at predicting spatially distributed variables such as landslide susceptibility groundwater potential spatial distribution of vegetation communities and habitats for fauna among others the main goal of this research was to adapt supervised classification approaches to map the potential for the presence of aquatic ecosystems in valley and mountain areas this is perceived as a welcome methodological addition to environmental management particularly in settings where comprehensive inventories of aquatic water bodies are yet to be developed and where mapping them may be challenging due to logistic difficulties difficulties in obtaining cloudless satellite images and other practical issues a significant added value is that the conceptual model i e explanatory and target variables can be defined on a case specific basis thus making the method readily exportable to other geographical settings this approach has been demonstrated through its application to a surface catchment in western colombia the presence of numerous lentic and lotic water bodies in flat and mountain regions of the study area allowed for the evaluation of random forests and support vector machine algorithms in a wide range of conditions overall both classifiers depicted field observations reliably random forests excel at identifying associations between the target and explanatory variables while support vector machines provided a better identification of water bodies when appraised in terms of surface area in this context a key finding is that standard machine learning metrics like training and test scores precision recall and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve though representative of algorithm performance may not render an entirely accurate picture of environmental conditions most notably at the local scale this implies that there is a need to develop complementary case specific indicators in instances such as the one at hand furthermore the use of state of the art analytical tools such as feature number optimization and recursive feature elimination is recommended to avoid unwanted noise from input variables on a final note this study shows that the pattern recognition capabilities of machine learning algorithms may be used as a first approximation to detect invisible aquatic ecosystems such as those covered by hydrophyte vegetation and crypto wetlands in this context a high resolution digital elevation model or ideally a choice among several options is crucial to aquatic ecosystem mapping due to the control that topography exerts over surface water runoff and accumulation as well as on groundwater discharge this becomes

4779,in a context of rapid change mapping aquatic ecosystems is crucial for their protection particularly in regions of the world where a comprehensive inventory of water bodies is yet to be developed this paper presents a machine learning methodology for predictive aquatic ecosystem mapping two state of the art classifiers were used namely support vector machines svm and random forests rfc these were implemented in a gis environment and trained on a sample of 350 points of a western colombian catchment where the presence or absence or water was known beforehand sixty percent of the dataset was used to train the algorithms and the remainder was used to calibrate predictive accuracy both classifiers rendered a realistic picture of the catchment s water bodies rfc obtained a mean test score in excess of 0 93 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0 95 svm scored 0 89 and 0 89 respectively after optimization performance was better overall in flat regions svm identified correctly over 87 of the surface area of lentic and 82 of lotic water bodies while rfc scored over 80 in both cases in mountain regions precision dropped to 69 and 62 for svm and 65 and 76 for rfc this leads to three conclusions a the method provides satisfactory results at the regional scale and is versatile enough to export to other settings b local scale detail cannot be captured in the absence of an accurate high resolution digital elevation model particularly in mountain areas c complementing standard machine learning metrics with ad hoc indicators is likely needed in cases where the input dataset consists solely of unambiguous examples keywords machine learning freshwater ecosystem services big data supervised classification 1 introduction aquatic ecosystems are numerous and diverse in terms of their hydrological hydrogeological physical chemical and biological characteristics and provide multiple benefits to humans gwp imbo 2015 suitably there is no universal conceptualization of what an aquatic ecosystem is beyond an ecosystem that depends on water definitions are typically site or country specific and based on ad hoc initiatives for instance the australian aetg 2012 establishes that aquatic ecosystems are those that depend on flows or periodic or sustained inundation waterlogging for their ecological integrity e g wetlands rivers karst and other groundwater dependent ecosystems saltmarshes estuaries and areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed 6 m in other cases such as india s national plan for conservation of aquatic ecosystems the idea of aquatic ecosystem equates to a certain type of freshwater body i e wetlands including lakes mefcc 2019 for the purpose of the ensuing pages aquatic ecosystems are dealt with in a broad sense using the classification of lentic and lotic water bodies and paying attention to those types of aquatic ecosystems that do not necessarily consist of surface water accumulations i e crypto wetlands aquatic ecosystems are vulnerable to land management change and climate variability hestir et al 2015 as such they rank among the world s most endangered environmental assets take for instance wetlands the ramsar convention on wetlands estimates that approximately two thirds of the world s wetlands have disappeared since 1900 rcw 2015 this loss has also been quantified at 87 since 1700 with a considerable acceleration during the 20th and early 21st centuries davidson 2014 the environmental implications are dire because freshwater ecosystems play a major role in underpinning biodiversity according to stendera et al 2012 about 29 000 species have been described in freshwaters including 12 000 species of fish to go with another 17 000 species of microorganisms algae insects crustaceans annelids and mollusks these authors also indicate that freshwater ecosystems support one tenth of the world s animal species and about one third of all vertebrates the first step towards safeguarding aquatic ecosystems is to acknowledge their very existence this can be difficult in remote regions as well as in parts of those catchments where accessibility is an issue van deventer et al 2016 mapping provides information about the spatial extension and distribution of water bodies which in turn allows for the development of monitoring and protection strategies van deventer et al 2018 over the years environmental agencies worldwide have strived to map aquatic ecosystems within their jurisdictions dewnr 2015 dws 2017 often in the context of the evaluation of ecosystem services ec 2014 cea 2015 such initiatives have sometimes been hampered by the limitations of traditional mapping approaches and are still lacking in many parts of the world hestir et al 2015 mcmanamay et al 2017 over the years the issue of mapping water bodies has been tackled from different viewpoints including remote sensing ozesmi and bauer 2002 palmer et al 2015 for instance castaño castaño et al 2008 coupled satellite images with a detailed digital elevation model dem to map infiltration losses in spanish wetlands similarly tulbure et al 2016 examined the extent of surface water bodies based on three decades of seasonally continuous landsat time series in a semi arid region of australia remote sensing of surface water dynamics has been frequently used in the context of broader studies including those dealing with land use change drought and bird communities schaffer smith et al 2017 reiter et al 2015 the advent of machine learning techniques brought about innovative methods for predictive mapping of water bodies studies dealing with floodplain detection have become particularly prevalent in the literature for instance degiorgis et al 2012 used supervised classification to delineate flood prone areas in the po basin italy in turn jafarzadegan et al 2018 tried a geomorphic approach to map floodplains for the conterminous united states these authors showed probabilistic 100 year floodplain maps generated by means of machine learning approaches to match those generated through hydraulic modelling and well as federal emergency management agency maps along the same lines woznicki et al 2019 developed a spatially complete floodplain map of the conterminous united states using random forest classification this approach rendered generally accurate results except for the arid parts of the south west states finally manfreda et al 2015 delineated flood prone areas based on linear binary classifiers and dem derived morphologic features precedents of mapping aquatic ecosystems by means of machine learning classification and mixed data sources are relatively uncommon studies usually focus on a specific type of water body maxwell et al 2016 wen and hughes 2020 and rely to an important extent on remote sensing chignell et al 2018 while rightfully perceived as the tool of choice in mapping studies satellite based techniques can be problematic in instances where seasonal water surfaces shift geographically or vary between wet and dry periods this is relevant when cloud cover is frequent or permanent like it happens in mountain tropical regions anaya et al 2015 mapping surface water bodies in these contexts is challenging because cloud free satellite observation must be concurrent with the occurrence of water pekel et al 2016 furthermore detection efforts in rivers and streams have been observed to present significant uncertainties allen and pavelsky 2018 newer satellite technologies such as sentinel 1 make it possible to obtain clear images of the land surface even in the presence of clouds furthermore image composites can be used to offset the effect of cloud cover to a large extent however cloudless images are not exempt from shortcomings for instance tree canopies and hydrophyte vegetation may overshadow water as a result identifying water bodies directly can sometimes be troublesome particularly in the case of small to medium sized streams and ponds furthermore mapping extensive aquatic ecosystems such as crypto wetlands based on satellite images may be altogether unfeasible in humid climates where the water table is close to the surface but where water is not visible finally satellite images can pose issues of availability accessibility and affordability this all justifies the development of alternative approaches to map the presence aquatic ecosystems in this context this paper presents and validates an approach to map aquatic ecosystems the method is demonstrated through its application to a highly heterogeneous catchment characterized by the absence of cloudless remote sensing images and by the presence of large areas of difficult access two supervised classification methods were used support vector machines and random forests and satellite images were replaced with a number of spatially distributed environmental variables including temperature rainfall lithology landforms and water table depth the goal is to provide insights to the delineation of protection buffers by extrapolating the pattern recognition capabilities of supervised classification to develop predictive maps as well as to integrate state of the art machine learning applications with various types of information into a single gis tool 2 methods 2 1 study site this methodology is demonstrated through its application to the valle del cauca region colombia and more specifically to the sector of the cauca river basin that falls within the boundaries of the valle del cauca department fig 1 the study area covers nearly 11 000 km2 and consists of a narrow intramontane valley whose main axis runs from south to north two major mountain chains conform its eastern and western boundaries these are characterized by steep slopes and mountain peaks that exceed 4000 m a s l in altitude the flat section of the valley is approximately 40 km wide in the santiago de cali area and less than 10 km wide at its narrowest point around buga valley flats range in altitude between 900 north and 1000 m a s l south over an approximate distance of 215 km the cauca valley is a tectonic depression associated with a series of major geological faults that split the andean range in two subparallel branches quaternary materials filling the valley bottom result in a large aquifer system whose thickness is several hundred meters the mountain ranges to the east and west made up of igneous rocks conform the impervious lateral boundaries and the basement of the aquifer this setting is crucial for aquatic ecosystems in the valley flats the valley bottom features a poorly defined drainage network and a shallow water table that result in a strong interrelation between surface water and groundwater this gives rise to many springs and wetlands which often present intermittent links to floodplains and branching streams and rivers groundwater underpins numerous water bodies across the plain including the ramsar listed laguna de sonso wetland in some cases the behavior of these aquatic ecosystems alternates between lentic and lotic depending on aquifer discharge recent rainfall and surface runoff aquatic ecosystems in mountain areas typically take place in small depressions lagoons and lakes as well as along the surface drainage network streams and rivers and depend exclusively on precipitation climatic conditions are highly variable the city of santiago de cali located in the valley bottom mean altitude 1000 m a s l presents a dry summer tropical savanna climate average daily temperatures remain stable throughout the year ranging between 23 4 c in november and 24 3 c in august yearly rainfall exceeds 1000 mm and presents a bimodal distribution with peaks in april 130 mm and november 102 mm while july is the driest month 32 mm this provides a contrast with the farallones de cali national park located a few kilometers to the southwest of the city within the same municipality the mountains of the national park reach over 4200 m a s l in altitude and present a cold humid climate with temperatures that drop to below 5 c and yearly rainfall of 2800 mm the corporación autónoma regional del valle del cauca cvc is the national agency that manages the region s environment the cvc has compiled an inventory of water bodies that is publicly accessible through its website though not strictly comprehensive this inventory comprises over 1 500 natural aquatic ecosystems together with over 5 000 artificial water bodies such as irrigation reservoirs thus it provides an adequate benchmark for demonstration in the context of this research 2 2 conceptual model target and explanatory variables the underlying assumption of this approach is that the presence or absence of aquatic ecosystems target variable can be inferred from a mixture of spatially distributed explanatory variables the ensemble of target and explanatory variables is termed a conceptual model based on a training dataset machine learning algorithms use the conceptual model to identify patterns of explanatory variables that lead to the presence or absence of aquatic ecosystems the findings are then extrapolated to the remainder of the study area accuracy is evaluated by running the algorithms on an independent test set as well as by comparing the predictions of the model with the existing inventory of aquatic ecosystems from a hydrogeological standpoint classifications of aquatic ecosystems such as those found in the valley rely on a number of variables these include but are not restricted to parent rock geology lithology stratigraphy structural geology of the groundwater basin driving force mechanisms such as gravity pressure or density temperature dominated discharge groundwater quality and the geomorphology of the discharge point cantonati et al 2020 research in the context of spring potential studies suggests that additional predictors such as slope related indices topographic wetness index stream power index and drainage density can also be relevant ozdemir 2011a 2011b chen et al 2018 the conceptual model in this case involves twelve explanatory variables including altitude drainage density lithology geomorphology classic and morphometric water table depth distance to a major river thermal floor rainfall slope stream power index and topographic wetness index these are coded r altitude r draindens r geol r lndfcvc r geomorphon r nf17 r riverdist r pisoterm r rain r slope r spi and r twi respectively since the input dataset is relatively small by machine learning standards variables were reclassified on a one by one basis in order to facilitate supervised learning table 1 fig 2 presents a spatial overview of the reclassified outcome of each layer altitude was identified as an explanatory variable because there is a clear distinction between the type of aquatic ecosystems that take place in the valley flats and those that occur in the mountains the former are typically groundwater dependent whereas the latter take place in mostly impervious materials and rely on recent rainfall altitude was reclassified in 500 m steps from below 1000 m a s l in the valley bottom to over 4000 m a s l in the mountain tops the 30 m resolution dem collected by the alos satellite was downloaded from the website of the japan aerospace exploration agency alos world 3d 30 m aw3d30 version 3 1 the dem was also used to develop various ancillary layers such as slope and slope related indices slope and slope related variables are expected to play an important role in the presence of aquatic bodies this is because slope not only controls surface runoff but also constrains the spatial distribution of hydrological variables such as infiltration potential and soil moisture lentic aquatic ecosystems typically take place in topographic depressions and in gently sloping areas whereas the presence of lotic water bodies is not necessarily associated with steepness two slope related indices were used for further qualification these are the topographic wetness index twi and the stream power index spi the topographic wetness index is a well known algorithm that combines the upslope area draining into a pixel with the pixel slope in order to quantify topographic control on surface hydrological processes sørensen et al 2006 a high topographic wetness index represents a lower slope and a larger contributing area which in turn implies a greater potential for the accumulation of surface water lentic systems whereas a medium value suggests a transit channel lotic system low values point at a small potential for the development of aquatic ecosystems twi has been observed to be correlated with certain soil attributes including horizon depth silt percentage organic matter content and phosphorus moore et al 1993 much like the topographic wetness index the stream power index uses slope and contributing area as input variables however it combines them to estimate the erosive potential of surface runoff instead high scores represent regions characterized by steep slopes and flow accumulation which typically equates to a high erosive potential in this case both indices were computed with a resolution of 30x30 meters and categorized from very low to very high based on percentile distribution the presence of aquatic ecosystems is ultimately constrained by rain rainfall is associated with altitude although some important exceptions are observed in the eastern range in particular a large proportion of the southeastern mountains present rainfall values similar to those recorded in the valley bottom rainfall was reclassified in 200 mm intervals based on the resolution of the cvc database geology and geomorphology constrain surface runoff infiltration and erosive potential in the case at hand igneous and metamorphic rocks schists sandstone and conglomerates quartzodiorite and basalts amphibolites and gabbros make up the mountain areas while sedimentary deposits conform most of the valley bottom the lithological map was reclassified in six major units in order to minimize noise in the training and testing processes table 1 in contrast geomorphology can be approached from two different perspectives the first one is morphometric and relies chiefly on the dem pixels are classified on a scale of 1 to 10 where each score corresponds to a specific landform flat summit ridge shoulder spur slope hollow foot slope valley depression classification was implemented by means of qgis in built geomorphon plugin jasiewicz and stepinski 2013 which uses a series of pattern recognition algorithms geomorphon identifies the characteristics of each pixel by combining the elevation of neighbouring points with the line of sight principle stepinski and jasiewicz 2011 jasiewicz and stepinski 2013 the second geomorphological method is a standard descriptive classification where landforms are identified and mapped according to geological and geomorphological criteria i e alluvial fan fluvial terrace flood plain this was obtained directly from the cvc s official cartographic database landform descriptions were grouped as per table 1 drainage density is computed as the length of river reaches within a given sub catchment divided by the sub catchment area it is derived from geology and geomorphology and sometimes linked with terrain permeability meijerink 2007 development of drainage lines depends on local base level of erosion which is governed by tectonic or geomorphological history in permeable deposits such as alluvium or fluvial terraces low drainage density typically results in high infiltration this leaves little water for the formation of incised channels but favours the presence of lentic aquatic ecosystems if the water table is shallow enough rock outcrops such as those found in the mountains of the study area are much less likely to accumulate groundwater a well developed drainage network in these materials results in fast runoff particularly when weathered zone is small to non existent hence mountain areas are prone to lotic aquatic ecosystems with the exception of surface water accumulation in topographic depressions fig 2 presents the spatial distribution of drainage density categorized in 200 m km2 intervals as shown in this case the valley is controlled by a medium high density while the mountains present a broader range from very low to very high in areas underlain by groundwater aquifers water table depth can control the hydrological dynamics of aquatic ecosystems to a large extent this is because a shallow water table is likely to flood topographic depressions as well as to contribute to gaining river reaches and lentic water bodies during dry seasons furthermore a shallow water table may underpin ecological communities even if the water never rises to the surface as groundwater keeps the terrain moist and provides a plentiful supply for plants both situations occur in the cauca plain where the observed piezometric trends remain stable since the late 1960s despite widespread groundwater pumping a water table depth map of the valley was developed with groundwater levels from 1366 monitoring and production wells all of them collected in the field in june 2017 fig 2 dynamic levels were discarded prior to geostatistical interpolation in order to filter our instable levels affected by recent pumping this leaves the sample in 1248 data points this represents a spatial density close to one point per every two square kilometers the total aquifer surface located within the study area is approximately 3000 km2 which is considered sufficient in view of the relatively monotonous disposition of the water table a significant proportion of the aquatic ecosystems in the official inventory were observed to fall within approximately one kilometer of a river course this is largely because many of the existing water bodies in the valley are oxbow lakes and floodplain depressions hence distance to main surface water courses was deemed a potentially useful explanatory variable for aquatic ecosystems in the flats 2 3 supervised machine learning classification supervised classification is a major subdivision of machine learning it consists in predicting the outcome of a discrete target variable based on a number of explanatory variables and a series of examples whose result is known because of the mathematical complexity behind supervised classifiers is typically difficult to predict whether a given algorithm will perform better than another hence it is common practice to run several on the same dataset in order to compare performance and outcomes wang et al 2016 2017 qin et al 2018 mlmapper a qgis 3 2 plugin was used to run the machine learning algorithms mlmapper develops predictive maps based on point source ground truth data martínez santos and renard 2020 díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 this software features thirteen algorithms of the scikit learn 0 19 2 toolbox pedregosa et al 2011 representing several families of supervised learning classifiers in this case several trial runs were carried out using all of mlmappers thirteen algorithms these led to the conclusion that random forests rfc and support vector machines svm consistently rendered the most accurate results for the existing dataset therefore all other algorithms were discarded to place the focus on these two support vector machines are supervised learning algorithms that work both for classification and regression problems from a conceptual standpoint svms represent data as points in a multidimensional space data points are mapped in such a way that the instances of each category are separated by a gap termed a hyperplane mathematically the svm approach consists in finding the optimal hyperplane to distinguish among potential outcomes so that predictions can be made as to which side of the hyperplane an unknown outcome would fall into hsu and lin 2002 this is achieved in iterative fashion by prioritising always the hyperplane with the greatest discrimination margin svm handles both continuous and categorical variables and is typically effective in high dimensional spaces or at least when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples because of the use of support vectors in the decision function it is also efficient in terms of computational cost the possibility of using different kernel functions for decision including custom ones makes this technique highly versatile on the other hand svm may be vulnerable to overfitting when the number of explanatory variables is much greater than the number of samples besides svm does not directly render probability estimates which means these are calculated using five fold cross validation pedregosa et al 2011 in the context of environmental studies svm has been used to map groundwater potential martínez santos and renard 2020 estimate groundwater contamination díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 evaluate ecosystem service dynamics talukdar et al 2020 analyse hydrometeorologic monitoring networks asquith 2020 and predict landslide susceptibility huang and zhao 2018 among other applications the rfc classifier is a meta estimator based on decision tree algorithms breiman 2001 rfc fits a number of decision trees on various sub samples of a given dataset then it uses averaging to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting pedregosa et al 2011 it is thus described as an ensemble learning method that can be used both for classification and regression rfcs can be expected to outperform decision trees on a consistent basis as they are designed to reduce variance by averaging multiple deep decision trees trained on different parts of the same training set rfc implementation is straightforward conceptually and in practice furthermore it produces accurate predictions and can handle a large number of input variables biau 2012 perhaps the main disadvantage of a random forest is that the internal decision logic is lost to the user due to the implementation of a large number of decision trees although it is possible to compute feature importance to at least gain an understanding as to which variables drive predictions furthermore the ensemble approach can result in high computational costs potentially rendering the algorithm less efficient in instances where time is a constrain random forests are highly versatile and have been used in different fields of environmental science including fire severity mapping collins et al 2020 deforestation saha et al 2020 biomass mapping chen et al 2019 and flood susceptibility chen et al 2020 precedents also exist in the wetland and floodplain mapping literature maxwell et al 2016 berhane et al 2018 woznicki et al 2019 2 4 classifier training testing and feature importance a ground truth input dataset of 350 points was developed based on the official cartography of the cvc authority which is publicly available online www geo cvc gov co visor avanzado half of it represents locations in the catchment where aquatic ecosystems are known to exist this includes an even sample of lentic and lotic water bodies from mountain and valley areas since mlmapper works with point source data these were picked by identifying locations that could be identified unequivocally as water the second half of the dataset is made up of spots characterized by the absence of aquatic ecosystems these are randomly distributed across the region also covering high and low altitude areas mlmapper automatically splits this input dataset in two in this case 60 of the data was used to train the algorithms whereas the remaining 40 was used for testing the outcomes are visible to the algorithms during training so that the latter can develop patterns of explanatory variables that result in the presence or absence of aquatic ecosystems conversely outcomes are hidden to the classifiers in the test phase so that the algorithms have to guess the result based on what they learned during training because the input dataset is relatively small 10 fold cross validation was carried out during this process in order to maximize the training and testing value of the models machine learning performance is assessed based on a number of standard metrics table 2 preference is typically given to test score and to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc test score is computed as the number of correct guesses over the total number of attempts on the test dataset it thus provides a direct measure of predictive accuracy the auc is a probabilistic metric that evaluates the extent to which the algorithms are capable of distinguishing between classes both metrics rank the algorithms on a scale of 0 to 1 a higher score implying better performance a 0 5 score in either metric however implies that the prediction is no better than a random guess 50 chance the choice of explanatory variables is based on expert criteria beyond human judgement there is no telling as to whether a given conceptual model takes all relevant variables into account it is however possible to discard noisy irrelevant or counterproductive elements based on computing feature importance mlmapper uses recursive feature elimination for this purpose given an external estimator that assigns weights to features e g the coefficients of a linear model the goal of recursive feature elimination is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features the estimator is first trained on the initial set of explanatory variables and the importance of each of these is obtained either through a coefficient attribute or through a feature importance attribute the least important features are then pruned from the model that procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the optimal number of features to select is eventually reached pedregosa et al 2011 collinearity takes place when two or more variables of the conceptual model are highly correlated this may hurt classifier performance and interpretability because the regression coefficients of certain algorithms are not uniquely determined mlmapper incorporates a collinearity analysis function to prevent collinearity from having a negative impact on the results collinearity analysis is carried out prior to running the algorithms each algorithm is governed by a set of parameters parameter optimization may be carried out by different methods mlmapper picks the best result out of running grid search and randomized search routines parameter descriptions for each algorithm and their adjusted values are presented in table 3 3 results feature collinearity is typically addressed by means of establishing a pair wise correlation threshold between variables there is no consensus as to what the value of this threshold should be in machine learning applications although it is frequent to work anywhere within the 0 4 to 0 85 range dormann et al 2013 fig 3 presents a correlation matrix with the results of the collinearity analysis where pair wise correlation coefficients are expressed in the form of a coloured palette ranging from 1 0 inverse correlation to 1 0 direct correlation direct correlation coefficients were observed to be below 0 8 in all cases while one single inverse correlation slightly in excess of 0 8 was found for one of the variable combinations cvc s original landform classification vs the calculated water table level thus all variables were considered sufficiently independent from one another to justify their inclusion in the conceptual model feature selection reveals that the optimal number of variables for both the svm and rfc algorithms is seven fig 4 however feature elimination differs partially in terms of which variables should be kept in each case the svm classifier works best with altitude landforms thermal floor rainfall river distance slope and topographic wetness index while the rfc outcomes are optimized when using morphometry water table depth rainfall river distance stream power index slope and topographic wetness index four explanatory variables are thus common namely rainfall river distance slope and topographic wetness index landforms were also found to be of importance by both algorithms albeit under different conceptualizations rfc favours morphometry over a classic landform classification whereas the opposite applies to svm lithology and drainage density were ignored by both classifiers there are also some discrepancies in the relative importance of the explanatory variables fig 5 shows feature importance as computed by the rfc model topographic wetness index and landforms were the most important variables followed by morphometry slope and water table rainfall was also found to contribute to test score but only marginally in contrast svm presents variable coefficients of 0 20 for altitude 0 26 for morphometry 0 66 for thermal floor 0 14 for rainfall 0 56 for river distance 0 06 for slope and 2 07 for topographic wetness index table 3 shows the results of model optimization the highest optimized test score was obtained for the grid search optimization routine in both cases rfc scored over 0 93 while svm remained slightly below 0 90 table 5 in turn presents the key metrics for the optimized model runs as shown rfc outperforms svc in terms of train and test scores as well as in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0 95 vs 0 89 classifier outcomes were extrapolated to develop predictive maps from a mapping perspective the results should be interpreted as the likelihood of encountering aquatic ecosystems rather than as a delineation of surface water bodies fig 6 the ensemble map represents the arithmetic mean of the outcomes of the two classifiers for each pixel in other words the blue colour represents agreement on a positive outcome and the red colour means agreement on a negative outcome a yellow pixel reports a disagreement between the two classifiers both algorithms discriminate clearly between plain and mountain this is attributable to the effect of geomorphological variables such as topographic wetness index morphometry slope and landforms all of which delineate clear thresholds between the two subregions algorithm specific maps depict reality to an acceptable extent the cauca river corridor is delineated in blue the same as all major surface water courses in the valley this is consistent with the presence of numerous oxbow lakes ponds and riverine wetlands which make up for the vast majority of lentic systems in the plain it also represents adequately the fact that the water table is generally shallow thus underpinning many invisible aquatic ecosystems outside the official inventory furthermore both classifiers are correct in identifying surface divides as areas where water bodies are less likely to occur similar considerations apply to mountain areas svm and rfc identify valleys depressions and ridges the first two are mostly classified as areas suitable for the presence of aquatic ecosystems whereas the latter is delineated in red unsuitable in all cases 4 discussion a chief purpose of this tool would be the identification of areas where aquatic ecosystems are likely to occur based on a relatively small sample of known cases most of the ensuing analysis deals with lentic and lotic water bodies because the existing inventory focuses chiefly on these two ecosystems types however it is important to note that the predictive maps do not aim at depicting these specifically in the context of this study the definition of an aquatic ecosystem also encompasses areas where the water table may be shallow enough to underpin vegetation or where the surface of water bodies may be covered by tree canopies and or hydrophytes take for instance the area identified in blue in figs 6 and 7 presence of aquatic ecosystems in terms of surface this is much larger than the actual area known to contain surface water bodies this is because no explicit attempt was made to delineate the edges of surface water accumulations the idea was instead to extrapolate the pattern recognition capabilities of the classifiers to identify areas with a similar set of features to those in the training set for instance lentic ecosystems in the plain are often found at local scale lowlands close to topographic channels in areas with a shallow water table and with a high topographic wetness index from the point of view of the explanatory variables these features are practically identical to those that one would expect in crypto wetlands in the same area hence the map not only presents actual water bodies but also attempts to predict the potential location of other aquatic ecosystems in order to help complete the regional inventory in the field with this in mind the outcomes of fig 6 suggest that the actual surface area of aquatic ecosystems in the valle del cauca plain could be much larger than currently thought this is readily observed on the ground even if beyond this work no other attempts to define it have been made map outcomes are considered satisfactory from this perspective nevertheless local scale results suggest that there is room for further improvement particularly if outcomes are to be analysed under a different light for instance by determining the surface area of inventoried aquatic ecosystems that was correctly identified as per the existing field inventory it is possible to tell how well each algorithm fared in regard to predicting the presence of lentic and lotic aquatic ecosystems and thus to evaluate the reliability of the results beyond standard machine learning metrics table 6 presents the proportion of inventoried aquatic ecosystems as identified by svm and rfc as well as by the ensemble mean of the two this is computed as a pixel count several conclusions spring to mind a major one is that both classifiers perform better in flat regions this is attributed to two factors the first one has to do with the resolution of the output map 100x100 meter pixels indeed many mountain water bodies are small less than 1 ha in the case of lentic bodies a few meters wide in the case of the lotic ones and surrounded by steep slopes since the pixel surface area is 1 ha the presence of water in small depressions and narrow river valleys can be easily blurred by the factor of scale fig 7 a second plausible explanation is the digital elevation model close examination of the mountains shows that areas where lakes take place seldom show up as flats or depressions in the dem in fact despite its theoretically high accuracy altitude differences in excess of 25 m were found from one pixel to the next in mountain spots known to be flooded as this information is used to compute ancillary layers slope and slope related variables dem inaccuracies could represent a major source of error for the classifiers this has additional implications in terms of appraising the results standard machine learning metrics provide an accurate overview of algorithm performance but may prove suboptimal in terms of actually depicting how accurate the output is when expressed in map terms tables 4 and 5 suggest that auc and test scores machine learning metrics overstated success when compared with the results in terms of surface area map outcome this could be attributed to the fact that the input dataset consisted almost exclusively of unambiguous examples while both classifiers excelled at finding explanatory patterns an input dataset comprising potentially misleading situations could not be developed hence the algorithms could not be trained to depict conditions comprehensively at the local scale further research should attempt to deal with these shortcomings the above also explains an apparent contradiction in the results machine learning metrics suggest that rfc performs better than svm this holds true in the sense that rfc is able to predict the outcomes of the test dataset more accurately than svm however this only means that rfc found a higher correlation between the expected outcome and the explanatory variables when the results are examined in terms of surface area of known aquatic ecosystems it becomes evident that rfc was only able to outperform svm in identifying lotic ecosystems in mountain areas fig 7 and table 6 while svm obtained better results in every other respect in other words the map produced by svm is more reliable in pixel terms despite lower auc and test scores across the board these outcomes highlight two limitations of mlmapper both of which stem from the fact that the code was originally developed to deal with borehole data martínez santos and renard 2020 the first one is that mlmapper works with point source inputs this improves training potential with items whose spatial location is clearly defined boreholes springs but is less efficient than polygon based training when ground truth information presents a range of values for the same target feature crypto wetlands landforms rock types the second limitation is that mlmapper only supports binary classification by design this in turn means that the only way to have a gradation of the result is to perform ensembles of classifier results the supervised classification approach is versatile enough to export to other settings with the exception that the conceptual model should be derived based on site specific considerations for instance the use of evapotranspiration indicators such as the normalized difference vegetation index may prove valuable in arid and semiarid contexts where there is often a seasonal contrast between dry and humid areas in this case however this variable was ruled out for various reasons for one landsat 8 images of the study area with less than 40 cloud cover are rare furthermore sugar cane is ubiquitous across the plain and irrigation takes place all year round irrigated fields send an evapotranspiration signal as strong as that of the vegetation surrounding aquatic ecosystems thus making it difficult for the classifiers to discriminate between the two it is nevertheless hypothesized that this kind of input could have improved the detection of mountain water bodies had satellite images been used this is because exposed water surfaces are easily detected in the absence of cloud cover and vegetation which could have facilitated algorithm training 5 conclusions machine learning techniques provide a whole new set of insights in the field of environmental characterization supervised classification has proven adept at predicting spatially distributed variables such as landslide susceptibility groundwater potential spatial distribution of vegetation communities and habitats for fauna among others the main goal of this research was to adapt supervised classification approaches to map the potential for the presence of aquatic ecosystems in valley and mountain areas this is perceived as a welcome methodological addition to environmental management particularly in settings where comprehensive inventories of aquatic water bodies are yet to be developed and where mapping them may be challenging due to logistic difficulties difficulties in obtaining cloudless satellite images and other practical issues a significant added value is that the conceptual model i e explanatory and target variables can be defined on a case specific basis thus making the method readily exportable to other geographical settings this approach has been demonstrated through its application to a surface catchment in western colombia the presence of numerous lentic and lotic water bodies in flat and mountain regions of the study area allowed for the evaluation of random forests and support vector machine algorithms in a wide range of conditions overall both classifiers depicted field observations reliably random forests excel at identifying associations between the target and explanatory variables while support vector machines provided a better identification of water bodies when appraised in terms of surface area in this context a key finding is that standard machine learning metrics like training and test scores precision recall and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve though representative of algorithm performance may not render an entirely accurate picture of environmental conditions most notably at the local scale this implies that there is a need to develop complementary case specific indicators in instances such as the one at hand furthermore the use of state of the art analytical tools such as feature number optimization and recursive feature elimination is recommended to avoid unwanted noise from input variables on a final note this study shows that the pattern recognition capabilities of machine learning algorithms may be used as a first approximation to detect invisible aquatic ecosystems such as those covered by hydrophyte vegetation and crypto wetlands in this context a high resolution digital elevation model or ideally a choice among several options is crucial to aquatic ecosystem mapping due to the control that topography exerts over surface water runoff and accumulation as well as on groundwater discharge this becomes
