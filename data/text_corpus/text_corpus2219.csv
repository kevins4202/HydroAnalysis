11095,the narrative of reusing water for agricultural purposes is sometimes conceived as being one of the reasons versus emotions which might not capture the complexity of the issue at hand including the legitimate fear of risks diffuse regulations and the visceral reactions from farmers and the public by analysing recent peer reviewed literature 2007 2017 from a holistic approach technical and social issues this review explores 1 the main characteristics of the reviewed literature on this topic geographical contexts research areas main topics and tools 2 relevant driving factors to effectively reconcile farmers needs and public perceptions of water reuse and 3 the current knowledge gaps and future challenges to be addressed by end users managers and authorities the article concludes by discussing the level of the knowledge in this area and advanced recommendations to further a better comprehension of technical and social driving factors of water reuse in agriculture keywords irrigation water reuse perception risks regulation yuck factor 1 introduction water scarcity and water pollution are both worldwide phenomena and two of the biggest challenges that humankind faces today and non conventional water resources are intended to close the gap between them sheidaei et al 2016 the worldwide water consumption continues to grow and it is estimated that by the year 2030 more than 160 of the total water volume available in the world will be needed to satisfy the global water requirements gosling and arnell 2016 lavrnic et al 2017 azhoni et al 2018 agriculture is the sector that is most affected by water scarcity as it accounts for 70 of global freshwater withdrawals and more than 90 of the consumption norton brandao et al 2013 several alternative solutions could be implemented in order to close the gap between water demand and water supply for agricultural use such as the control and reuse of runoff water al seekh and mohammad 2009 desalination of saline seawater avni et al 2013 ghermandi and minich 2017 cloud seeding chien et al 2017 and wastewater reuse van lier and huibers 2010 through the agenda 2030 for sustainable development the united nations is also pressing for the worldwide adoption of desalination and reuse technologies as an essential tool to attain its sustainable development goals sdgs to ensure water availability sustainable resource management and sanitation for all sdg 6 there must be integrated management of water resources furthermore the percentage of untreated wastewater should be halved by 2030 and a substantial global increase in the recycling and safe reuse of treated wastewater is required vanham et al 2018 water reuse is an intrinsic component of the natural water cycle since the discharge of effluent into watercourses and its dilution in the circulating water flow has traditionally allowed it to be indirectly reused downstream for urban agricultural and industrial purposes ortega and iglesias 2009 there are various qualities of reclaimed water depending on the type of treatment primary to advanced tertiary used to obtain it rahimi et al 2018 keeping the description simple without complex technical terms primary treatment stands for a 30 40 reduction of organic load and pathogens the secondary treatment stands for 95 and tertiary treatment stands for almost a 99 reduction of organic load with no significant pathogens after disinfection the last two levels also include disinfection meng et al 2016 according to tsagarakis et al 2013 primary treatment can be used for the controlled irrigation of forestland and parks as long as all the safety precaution measures are taken secondary treatment is appropriate for trees such as olive trees vineyards etc as long as it does not come into contact with the crops lastly tertiary treatment is appropriate for all types of crops consumed by human beings in addition two main types of water reuse for agricultural irrigation worldwide may be distinguished direct and indirect agricultural irrigation as a rule direct reuse in agriculture is the reuse of recycled water directly after treatment and with short term storage for a wide range of irrigation purposes in commercial and individual farms de miguel et al 2013 de sanctis et al 2017 in this case the irrigation water quality is determined by the quality of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent gémar et al 2018 therefore the target water quality can be easily attained by controlling the quality of the effluent sramkova et al 2018 indirect water reuse in agriculture occurs when treated wastewater is reused for the various aforementioned irrigation purposes but in the long term intermediate or seasonal storage in the following artificial or natural water bodies surface reservoirs aquifers rivers lakes and wetlands jeong et al 2016 many regions of the world are exploring the reuse of alternative water resources in response to emerging water scarcity challenges lazarova and bahri 2008 aleisa and al zubari 2017 current and future water shortages garcía rubio and guardiola 2012 mesa jurado et al 2012 and growing pressure on global water resources garcía cuerva et al 2016 tortajada and ong 2016 as half of the global water bodies are seriously contaminated wastewater treatment and reuse promote environmental security by alleviating the pollution of freshwater resources and providing more water for irrigation goonetilleke and vithanage 2017 wastewater reuse benefits are often mentioned in literature verlicchi et al 2012 beneduce et al 2017 the most relevant benefit is providing a new water supply source available for different water purposes and demands garcia and pargament 2015 additional advantages including 1 a reliable source of nutrients especially nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and organic matter which helps maintain fertility fertirrigation and the productivity of the soil miller 2006 parsons et al 2010 matheyarasu et al 2016 2 the use of less energy than other water use options e g importing water desalinated water adewumi et al 2010 3 to avoid the impact of new water supply developments e g dams ormerod and scott 2012 and 4 to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged into the environment meneses et al 2010 plumlee et al 2012 authors like alcón et al 2010 classify these benefits according to whether they are market or non market benefits from wastewater reuse in agriculture for example the market benefits stem from avoided losses of agricultural production because of water shortages and increased certainty in water supply while the non market benefits are related to the indirect reuse value associated with locally produced food and the non use values associated with the preservation of the ecological status of the river basin as well as with the social side effects of employment in agriculture accordingly the inclusion of alternative water resources is also increasingly seen to be part of a more integrated approach to managing the whole water cycle and a mechanism to support the circular economy and sustainable development goals smith et al 2018 despite the importance of treated wastewater irrigation to support the livelihoods of farmers information regarding the quantity of wastewater generated treated and used on a national scale is unavailable limited or out dated in numerous cases qadir et al 2007 however some data can be extracted from recent publications for example in the united states california and florida use significant amounts of reclaimed water for agriculture an estimated 46 of california s annual reclaimed water is reused for agriculture in florida it is 44 bryck et al 2008 most of the water reuse projects are located in arid and semi arid areas yet projects on wastewater reuse are being implemented increasingly more in humid areas due to rapid growth and urbanization perry and praskievicz 2017 in asia where about 32 of the wastewater generated is treated japan has adopted a comprehensive strategy for treated wastewater reuse in which 7 of wastewater is reused in agriculture funamiu et al 2008 in fact japan s reclaimed wastewater is focused on meeting urban water needs rather than providing water primarily for agriculture hara et al 2016 singapore has relied on malaysia for its freshwater supply although it started to consider reusing water as early as the 1970s lefebvre 2018 in china wastewater irrigation began in 1957 and now it is a very common practice particularly in suburban areas near the big and medium sized cities in the northwest zhang et al 2018 in australia the use of recycled water is increasing and it currently accounts for 4 of total consumption turner et al 2016 wastewater reuse in europe differs somewhat by geography according to sato et al 2013 in northern europe wastewater is reused primarily for environmental applications 51 of the projects and industry which accounts for 33 of the projects however in southern europe reclaimed wastewater is reused predominantly for agricultural irrigation 44 of the wastewater projects and urban or environmental purposes 37 of the projects wastewater reuse applications especially for agricultural irrigation have been developed in many countries in the mediterranean basin agrafioti and diamadopoulos 2012 in israel around 75 of its treated wastewater is reused and most of it in agriculture rygaard et al 2011 cyprus has also developed a sound water reuse strategy kathijotes and panayiotou 2013 in tunisia about 25 of reclaimed water is reused kellis et al 2013 while in spain about 22 of collected wastewater is reused for agriculture navarro 2018 a report by hamilton et al 2007 showed that around 20 mha of land was irrigated with reclaimed wastewater globally and a decade later thebo et al 2017 through a gis based analysis estimates that about 6 mha was irrigated using controlled treated wastewater and about 30 mha with diluted or untreated wastewater this is roughly 10 of the world irrigation surface area and 277 km3 of wastewater over the 864 km3 treated or not supplied annually ait mouheb et al 2018 although the technical aspects of wastewater reuse and management have often been considered as being a priority jafarinejad 2017 other concerns such as regulation and perception aspects have not been assessed or considered seriously enough and they have often been disregarded padilla rivera et al 2016 hui and cain 2018 this paper aims to synthesize current knowledge about the driving factors affecting water reuse in agriculture by considering technical and social components over the last decade 2 methodology 2 1 search terms in order to identify relevant literature we used the following search terms to guarantee a complex search string focused on the combination of technical and social components related to reclaimed water reuse the specific keywords used were as follows represents a search engine wild card technical terms recycl recla alternative non conventional water resources water reuse wastewater greywater desal sea water treat environment social terms percept attitude s belief s acceptance resist disgust support oppos yuck factor agreement impact benefit s participat public farmer s irrigator s stakeholder this string was applied to four different databases to ensure wide coverage web of science scopus proquest and doaj in each database the search process included the use of or operator for technical terms and the use of and operator for social terms both operators have been fixed as part of the title of the paper 2 2 screening and extraction the papers returned by the different databases were considered according to the inclusion criteria at three successive levels title abstract and full text on each level the content analysis compliance with each or more than one criteria was examined table 1 papers clearly focused on social attitudes environmental issues and those including transversal analysis from studies such as geography agronomy environmental sciences economics and sociology have been prioritized relevant data about each study were recorded in a spreadsheet e g author research area title of the paper year of publication journal name region or case study along with the main topics researched under scrutiny by each paper e g keywords tools research questions and main results relevant data were summarised and linear regressions were applied to reflect the nature of the research included in the literature main disciplines geographies topics tools approaches and to determine recent research trends on the topic key questions challenges throughout the last decade 3 literature review analysis 3 1 selection process the initial database search retrieved 1725 documents included duplicates table 2 for the purpose of this study only records from peer reviewed periodicals article and state of the art papers were included in the systematic review therefore books and book chapters proceedings papers phd thesis research projects reports or industry and government documents were excluded from the systematic review although they were used for the thematic review that helped identify key terms after screening for peer reviewed papers the number of appropriate articles was reduced to 1265 papers 73 3 of the initial amount from there the research category selection 1 1 the research category selection was specific for each database in web of science the selected research categories were water resources environmental sciences and studies engineering environmental chemical and civil agriculture multidisciplinary agriculture engineering economics ecology and agronomy in scopus we selected similar categories agricultural and biological sciences environmental sciences social science engineering economics econometrics and finance those subjects selected from proquest database were agriculture irrigation water reuse wastewater treatment and water management finally the subjects selected from doaj database were water supply hydraulic engineering environmental sciences agriculture and chemistry applied to each database enabled us to prioritize 875 papers 82 9 of the papers from web of sci and scopus the title analysis review resulted in the exclusion of 463 papers for different reasons a papers were not related to agricultural nor irrigation systems i e off topic papers b papers clearly focused on technical aspects i e simulation optimization models chemical methods health targets additionally a cross match of the title analysis results from each database was carried out to remove duplicates a total of 412 papers were moved to the abstract level of analysis during the abstract reading 69 papers were excluded due to the lack of even a minimum reference to social issues i e papers focused on wastewater infrastructure technical innovation when completing the final level of the reviewing process 217 papers were included for full text analysis from which 125 papers were selected for an in depth analysis of the main driving factors of reclaimed water reuse in agriculture from combining technical and social components 3 2 data analysis 3 2 1 distribution of reviewed papers by year there is an apparent increase in the yearly number of papers covering main technical and social driving factors of reclaimed water reuse in agriculture fig 1 according to the data analysis 41 6 of the total papers have been published in the last three years while 14 4 of the total papers have been published in one year 2010 the high productivity of peer reviewed papers published in 2010 could be explained through the several drought episodes that affected most european countries during 2005 and 2008 as most of the papers analysed mediterranean case studies the value of the coefficient of determination r2 indicates a positive but not significant correlation between the years studied 2007 2017 and the annual number of papers related to the subject nevertheless that percentage might be a very high portion of variation to predict in a field like the social sciences 3 2 2 research areas and geographical context the analysis of the researcher s profile is a first attempt to find out about the type of research that will be carried out and the approach technical and social or only social that will be prioritized main research areas have been identified from the first author s affiliation institution fig 2 note that in some papers authors do not share the same research area otherwise they provide new knowledge from other disciplines e g environmental sciences combined with studies in human society wester et al 2015 agricultural sciences collaborating with biological and chemical sciences michailidis et al 2015 or engineering and technology including management and planning issues miller robbie et al 2017 the analysis shows that the technology and agricultural science research areas account for 43 2 of the peer reviewed papers social research areas economics management and planning studies in human society and policy and political sciences provide 34 4 of the papers included in the database out of the 125 reviewed papers 55 2 concerned european case studies while in 11 papers 8 8 no geographical context is specified e g state of the art reviews jaramillo and restrepo 2017 or their research is focused on a global scale e g repeated treated wastewater gaps fatta kassinos et al 2011 on a european level research clearly focused on mediterranean countries such as spain greece italy uk and portugal interest in these countries is not by chance according to the world resources institute and the water risk atlas tool these regions will face a medium to high physical risk quantity and a high physical risk quality furthermore projected change in water stress shows how climate change are expected to affect the ratio of water reuse to be supplied in a 1 4 increase in the mediterranean area 3 2 3 keywords and researched topics a total of 23 keywords have been identified in reviewed papers covering the period 2007 2017 fig 3 for this analysis keywords regarding geographical locations agronomic parameters or physiological and structural properties have been excluded keywords can be grouped into five categories subject irrigation agriculture normative regulation rules risks environmental impact health risks climate change social perception yuck factor disgust etc and concepts reclaimed wastewater recycled water desalinated water etc 2 2 water reuse refers to the production of water through water treatment processes which introduces a feedback loop in the water cycle as such water reuse is not an additional water source but rather a product that needs to be tailored to the intended uses it differs to supply augmentation measures such as seawater desalination which in fact includes a new input to the water cycle currently there is a range of terminology and definitions used to define water reuse globally water reuse water recycling treated wastewater reuse and reclaimed water are all used interchangeably which has resulted in confusion between and within different countries for example treated water is wastewater that has been treated at the urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp to make sure its quality meets wastewater discharge authorization requirements while recycled or reclaimed water is wastewater that has undergone a more rigorous treatment process in a water reclamation facility wrf and can therefore be directly used for more restricted purposes e g irrigation or environmental uses without being diluted by other water flows ansari et al 2018 the concepts category includes 58 5 of the keywords followed by the social category 16 2 the most popular keywords were reclaimed water and irrigation agriculture many publications included the benefits of non conventional water resources in the introduction section as a way of counteracting risks although no specific keyword has been included as a reference e g hernández et al 2010 furthermore although a significant number of papers analyse the relevance of the yuck factor most of them did not include this subject in the keywords list petousi et al 2015 sheidaei et al 2016 note that papers may simultaneously focus on more than one researched topic e g farmers preferences and public perception starkl et al 2015 mayilla et al 2017 or monitoring effects and cost benefit analysis pedrero et al 2010 melgarejo et al 2016 by analysing the objectives of the articles we have been able to establish 10 research areas the top 5 researched topics are 1 public perception 23 2 2 monitoring water effects on crop yield 19 2 3 state of the art 13 6 4 innovative treatments 12 8 and 5 farmers preferences to reuse and pay for 10 4 social terms state of the art legislation regulation framework cost benefit analysis public perception farmers preferences and governance factors were established in 75 papers 60 of the total while technical terms innovative treatment long term benefits and impact and monitoring effects on crop yield were included in 50 papers 40 only in 2 out of the 11 years analysed 2014 and 2017 were the number of papers related to social issues less than 50 of the total production e g tram et al 2014 baghapour et al 2017 on the contrary in the years 2008 and 2015 there were more papers that focused on social terms e g petousi et al 2015 the distribution of reviewed papers per year allows us to determine how each researched topic has evolved over time without taking into account the state of the art exercises since they include an analysis of different researched topics in 2007 public perception menegaki et al 2007 and monitoring effects candela et al 2007 focused the interest of the researcher in 2008 governance factors nancarrow et al 2008 legislation iglesias and ortega 2008 and innovative treatment illueca muñoz et al 2008 joined the scientific production topics one year later more attention was paid to perceptive issues from farmers russell and lux 2009 and the public dolnicar and schäfer 2009 in 2010 long term benefits leong 2010 and the impact muñoz et al 2010 of using reclaimed water were added to the initial research areas of study one year later a cost benefit analysis was included in the analysis of non conventional water resources molinos senante et al 2011 and more attention was paid to monitoring effects morugán coronado et al 2011 in 2012 studies focused on farmers preferences and public perception kemp et al 2012 risk assessment cirelli et al 2012 was conducted and a year later new studies on cost benefit analysis alcón et al 2013 and monitoring effects pedrero et al 2013 were carried out innovative treatment ortega reig et al 2014 and monitoring effects contreras et al 2014 were developed in 2014 while in 2015 and 2016 public perception interest increased march et al 2015 saldías et al 2016 finally there was a renewed interest in innovative treatment licata et al 2017 and monitoring effects romero trigueros et al 2017 in 2017 it is worth pointing out the greater interest in finding out about the public s perception of using non conventional water resources rather than asking farmers if they are willing to use and pay to reuse these treated water resources 3 2 4 analysis tools a total of 17 analysis tools from quantitative qualitative and mixed methods have been used in the reviewed papers fig 4 the qualitative tools category includes six types of analysis to promote stakeholders interaction questionnaire interview focus groups and to provide evidence and strategies from collecting data literature review swot analysis together with the establishment of a protocol the quantitative tools category includes four types of analysis focused on field experimentation soil analysis water monitoring plant growth measurements and chemical modelling finally the mixed tools category that includes seven types of analysis to compare parameters test analysis indicators define systematic approaches cost benefit analysis risk assessment life cycle assessment and promote stakeholders involvement decision support system agent based model 86 papers used qualitative analysis methods heinz et al 2011 mahesh et al 2015 while 67 papers targeted by quantitative tools díaz et al 2013 maestre valero et al 2016 and 19 papers used mixed tools vergine et al 2017 note that papers may simultaneously use more than one analysis tool from quantitative qualitative and or mixed methods e g frijns et al 2016 as for the internal category analysis the most popular qualitative tools were the questionnaire and the literature review 76 7 while the soil analysis and the water monitoring were the most popular tools from a quantitative perspective 82 1 the use of mixed tools was less significant and the most popular tool was the cost benefit analysis 4 results it is time for the literature review to answer the following question what insights have been gained from different technical and social science approaches to understand driven factors and public responses towards water reuse we structure our response to this query around three broad and interrelated strands of thinking which have emerged from the last decade literature risks regulation and the yuck factor 4 1 risks notions of risk are social constructions deeply embedded in historical social and cultural context which are perceived differently by individuals communities and institutions dobbie and brown 2014 it is understandable that from both the community farmers and the public and the institutional perspective water managers major concerns about water reuse schemes are driven by the potential risks both environmental and health grant et al 2012 4 1 1 environmental risks the presence of nutrients is one of the most clearly diagnosed effects in the literature pedrero et al 2010 although the nutrients in treated municipal wastewater provide fertilizer value to crop or landscape production in certain instances they are in excess of plant needs and they can cause problems related to excessive vegetative growth delayed or uneven maturity or reduced quality nutrients produced in important quantities include nitrogen and phosphorus and occasionally potassium zinc boron and sulphur díaz et al 2013 alterations such as the increase of organic matter pools salinity and soil accumulation of contaminants are other effects that are reported most often contreras et al 2014 human and animal pathogens phytopathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria and their genes are important biological contaminants that can be transported by wastewater and or be enriched in soil becerra castro et al 2015 wastewater also contains other pollutants such as metals metalloids residual drugs organic compounds endocrine disruptor compounds and active residues of personal care products qadir et al 2010 additionally the regular reuse of wastewater can modify the minerals macro and micronutrients for plant growth soil ph soil buffer capacity and cation exchange capacity bañón et al 2011 some studies clearly focused on the farmers perception of environmental risks for example sheidaei et al 2016 investigated drivers of perceived health and environmental risks of wastewater reuse in iran and they concluded that while farmers were aware of the contribution of wastewater to fertilize the soil and its reliability as a water resource they were concerned about its negative impact on the environment another study conducted by mahesh et al 2015 in an indian micro watershed in which irrigation water is a mixture of canal water from the musi river and groundwater farmers felt that the soil quality had changed over time due to the influence of wastewater irrigation in line with the research studies of biggs and jiang 2009 finally although most of the studies are short term the main impact identified in perceived soil quality was the result of the duration of wastewater reuse chen et al 2016 4 1 2 health risks citizens may perceive health risks or suspect that pathogens and chemicals are present in reclaimed water and evidence suggests that the perceptions of health risks increase when reclaimed water comes into contact with humans kandiah et al 2017 perceptions about health risks describe people s subjective judgement of health risks or behaviours and it could be triggered off by factors such as tradition family pressure community norms time pressure and inconvenience karg and drechsel 2011 food safety is a major public concern that attracts the attention of researchers and stakeholders altogether khan et al 2009 farahat et al 2017 contaminated food sources can lead to many serious health problems such as the depletion of essential nutrients in the body that decrease the body s immune system orisakwe et al 2012 furthermore various studies have demonstrated that there are high levels of bacteria and enteric viruses in treated wastewater osuolale and okoh 2017 which are commonly resistant to conventional wastewater treatment processes and disinfection and they can be spread in the environment through wastewater effluents symonds et al 2014 in fact they are present in domestic wastewater and they can be transmitted into the environment because they are not removed properly in conventional wwtps and they survive a long time in the environment moazeni et al 2017 according to a recent study of saldías et al 2016 carried out in india when asked directly about 75 of the respondents claimed that they were aware of the health risks associated with the reuse of wastewater while about 78 of farmers said that they would grow other crops if the water quality was better e g vegetables for a higher income however although farmers had years of experience in using wastewater in some cases they had very little knowledge of the health risks involved this could be explained by the fact that farmers do not consume what they produce or because they do not get feedback about the risks perceived by consumers keraita et al 2008 results also emphasize how farmers perceptions of health and environmental risks are products of a complex set of factors among which previous knowledge distance from the farm to the wastewater plant or canal closeness and market value orientation are the most important factors to understand their predisposition or objection to using wastewater sheidaei et al 2016 4 2 regulations risks based on water and soil quality standards for irrigation water reuse is rather a broad topic which includes an extensive amount of guidelines and regulations that vary in how specific they are for a particular end use of water most papers based wastewater reuse regulation to the world health organization who document reuse of effluents wastewater treatment methods and health safeguards 1973 aimed at protecting public health and favouring the rational reuse of wastewater and excretion in agriculture mara and kramer 2008 another papers fixed the wastewater quality guidelines for agricultural reuse published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao in 1987 heinz et al 2011 more recently the us environmental protection agency and the united states agency for international development updated the guidelines for wastewater reuse in 2012 to include advances in wastewater treatment technologies best practices to involve communities in planning projects and factors that support the expansion of safe and sustainable water reuse jaramillo and restrepo 2017 on a european level the council directive 2000 60 ec the water framework directive and the council directive 91 271 eec the urban waste water treatment directive established the basis for national frameworks european commission 1991 the first one indirectly recognizes reuse as a strategy to increase water availability which therefore contributes to the good status of water bodies while the second one consider that treated wastewater shall be reused whenever appropriate paranychianakis et al 2015 the blueprint for safeguarding european waters 2012 identified water reuse as an important measure requiring eu attention and that a coordinated effort would be required to inject confidence and increase the adoption of water reuse practices this was pursued even further in the 2015 communication closing the loop an eu action plan for the circular economy that identified a series of activities to promote the reuse of treated wastewater more recently in may 2018 a proposal for a regulation from the european parliament and the council on minimum requirements for water reuse com 2018 337 was launched because reusing treated waste water generally has less of an environmental impact than water transfers or desalination for example and it generates a range of environmental economic and social benefits the recommendations on reusing wastewater established by these organizations and political frameworks are the background of most of the legal guidelines proposed in countries such as the united states portugal spain italy cyprus france australia israel jordan kuwait oman saudi arabia and china angelakis and gikas 2014 vergine et al 2017 in some cases regulations on a regional level have been given priority over the global framework for example the state of california was a pioneer regarding water reuse seeing as it has had regulations since 1918 california state board of health on a european level the spanish royal decree 1620 2007 was another considerable step forward in regulating water reuse as it clarifies both the responsibilities of the public administrations and the concession holders and end users establishing permitted uses and quality criteria the minimum frequency of sampling the benchmark for analytical methods and the conformity criteria iglesias et al 2010 molina and melgarejo 2016 molle et al 2012 and fawell et al 2016 analysed how most of the water reuse regulations in several eu countries have not been developed in line with the transversal principles of the eu such as the precautionary principle in another case study sheidaei et al 2016 asked farmers what they knew about laws and regulations on the safe reuse of wastewater in agriculture and only half of them responded positively 4 3 yuck factor the standard explanation about public resistance to water reuse projects is the yuck factor or the feeling of dread and disgust that is associated with drinking or buying agricultural products produced with wastewater the yuck factor has also been defined as a psychological repugnance disgust or profound discomfort marks et al 2008 it has become associated with the affect heuristic which holds that people s willingness to accept a given hazard is determined by an emotional response affect which precedes the cognitive evaluation of information fife schaw et al 2008 on the contrary to these explanations which focus on psychological aversion authors like ormerod and scott 2012 argue that the yuck factor is based on the social and cultural perceptions of risk according to this opinion influences intention to accept and intention influences behaviour in view of the critical importance of the yuck factor for the successful implementation of water reuse schemes a growing body of social research has sought to understand why farmers and with greater interest the public favour or reject reclaimed water reuse and which challenges should be addressed in order to ensure the mutual comprehension between farmers demands and public perception 4 3 1 farmers leeway farmers are ultimately the end users of reclaimed water and their decision to irrigate or not with alternative water can make or break any water reuse project furthermore a special group of professionals sharing their experiences of the irrigation process make suggestions that could affect future reuse projects in nearby areas mayilla et al 2016 mojid et al 2010 pointed out how farmers express two opposing viewpoints towards the quality of wastewater repugnance in the family and social spheres which is valuable in the economic and agricultural sphere although many farmers recognized the fertility values of wastewater they had inadequate insight into it and applied fertilizers at rates based on the mind s eye the main factors identified as being important for perception include the quality of the water being delivered to the farm ortega reig et al 2014 the capacity of farmers to manage the agricultural hazards from irrigation with reclaimed water bakopoulou et al 2010 society s concerns about reuse for irrigation wester et al 2015 and the recognition of the reuse benefits in terms of livelihood provisions and economic gains carr et al 2011 menegaki et al 2007 found that the vast majority of farmers support water reuse as a concept and that support for reuse decreases as the degree of contact with reclaimed water increases the use of language is very important when asking about farmers willingness to use wastewater for example while treated implies that the effluent described has been transformed from its previous polluted state recycled suggests a return towards an even earlier purer source material menegaki et al 2009 at this point it has to be noted that in some papers technical use and common use of specific terms such as recycled and treated wastewater is not well explained the results of their study show how farmers who were willing to use purified effluent to irrigate crops were not willing to pay more when it is described as recycled water instead of treated wastewater another study from bakopoulou et al 2010 conducted in the thessaly region concludes that the majority of farmers 58 are willing to pay half the price of freshwater for recycled water used to irrigate their crops a relatively high percentage of them 34 would not pay for recycled water if they had fresh water available for crop irrigation while a very low percentage of farmers 8 would pay a little less for recycled water than for fresh water so the authors conclude that farmers income decreases the probability that they will pay half the price of fresh water for recycled water when both fresh and recycled water are available as the cost of recycled water is an important factor to encourage farmers to reuse reclaimed water and to favour the acceptance of water reuse most water reuse projects involve a direct or indirect subsidy that is suppliers tend to offer recycled water at concession prices for example in spain public administrations can cover a maximum of about 70 of the operation costs related to conveying water from the wwtp to irrigate fields and about 10 of the total cost of installing the irrigation system used elbana et al 2010 however under the terms of the wfd the real cost of reclaimed water should be paid by the end user but this is not yet the case in regions such as spain for example 4 3 2 public trust a significant number of surveys have been carried out all over the world in order to understand how the public perception acceptance and opposition interact with institutional water reuse promotion petousi et al 2015 several studies that clearly focused on public perception have assessed the levels of acceptance of recycled reclaimed wastewater for a range of purposes that vary in the extent to which they involve human contact regardless of the measure of acceptance used the same pattern emerges water reuse acceptance drops with increasing human contact boyer et al 2012 according to a recent and complete review study conducted by fielding et al 2018 80 or more of participants found it acceptable to use recycled water for public or home garden irrigation although no attention has been paid to the fact that each reviewed study uses different methods to ask the public specific questions different concepts about whether they accept using wastewater to irrigate food crops and landscape maintenance which ranges from as low as 40 50 browning aiken et al 2011 buyukkamaci and alkan 2013 to as high as 70 90 chen et al 2015 there might be different reasons to explain the lowest percentages 1 many citizens can perceive health risks or suspect them according to the appearance colour and odour hurlimann and mckay 2007 2 communities suspected that plans were being made in secret and that their concerns were being ignored beveridge et al 2017 or 3 water reuse organisations failed to adequately promote the benefits of their operations mujeriego et al 2008 studies including bdour et al 2009 nancarrow et al 2010 and adewumi et al 2014 suggest that public acceptance of reuse is a product of attitude emotion control over the source of water subjective norms influence of people around you knowledge or information about the scheme associated risks trust in the implementing authority physical quality satisfaction choice specific use source s of recycled water cost and water scarcity individually or combined these factors have been investigated in various places where water reuse schemes have been implemented or are planned for example several modelling based studies have argued that higher levels of trust are associated with lower perceptions of risk which in turn increase the likelihood of acceptance ross et al 2014 trust has been linked to the concept of contagion stemming from the feeling of once in contact always in contact rozin et al 2015 this affective reaction means that people cannot separate the final product of water reuse clean water from its contaminated source human excreta another recent study argued that affective reactions to contagion pinpoint a social representation of water reuse a way in which it is understood in the public domain that differs significantly from a scientific and technical understanding callaghan et al 2012 the authors point out that individuals may be aware of and influenced by the social representation of water reuse even if they themselves do not fully adopt that representation in view of this and according to tram et al 2014 water reuse professionals recognize the positive roles that reclaimed water may have in the water supply system and they are of the opinion that risk aversion and management are imperative in reclaimed water reuse due to upstream water quality issues accidental spills or mismatches of uses and water quality dupont 2013 another common assumption collected by stenekes et al 2006 is that water reuse projects fail because the public is unable to comprehend specialist information about risks and beliefs therefore if the public were educated they would accept change more readily the media could provide part of this education goodwin et al 2017 for example dolnicar et al 2010 explored the effect of information on the acceptance of recycled and desalinated water in a study based on 1000 australian subjects and it found a positive association between the provision of information and public acceptance of alternative sources of water hurlimann et al 2009 noted that at mawson lakes australia respondents trusted the water authority more when they were well informed about recycled water and furthermore respondents exhibited greater levels of satisfaction with the use of recycled non drinking water in another case study from the jordan valley more than 70 of respondents expressed their willingness to learn more about water treatment and reuse al mashaqbeh et al 2012 most of these studies show how the public acceptance of reuse is more likely when the protection of the environment and the promotion of water conservation are clear benefits and when the awareness of water supply problems in the community is high dare and mohtar 2018 both factors are closely interrelated and their inclusion is partly due to the fact that the regions of the world where water reuse is more commonplace tend to be those that regularly experience water scarcity notably the u s the states of california texas and arizona australia and mediterranean countries hurlimann and dolnicar 2016 for instance dolnicar et al 2011 concluded that the awareness of real water scarcity problems as well as previous experience with water restrictions would increase the likelihood of respondents accepting water reuse 5 discussion ten years ago angelakis and durham 2008 asked if water reuse for agricultural purposes was one of the most misunderstood water applications just like the anthropogenic water cycle the success and failure of water reuse schemes around the world compared to the drivers for such schemes is shaped by complex interrelationships between technological economic and socio political factors although the successful implementation of innovation and new technology which basically focused on ensuring reused water quality has been promoted in the past this engineering performance has not always been associated with the comprehension of the social environment in which the water reuse project should be applied gu et al 2015 furthermore it must be acknowledged that many well established reuse schemes were implemented before widespread public involvement became an imperative of water sector planning and management and they have therefore benefited according to this priority was given to obtaining a new water resource while both environmental and health risks and regulation issues were excluded from social debate duong and saphores 2015 however for farmers and the public risks and regulations are key issues to accept or refuse water reuse a recent study carried out by antwi agyei et al 2015 shows how farmers tend to overestimate or underestimate risks depending on how the study is introduced farmers were inclined to overestimate risks to highlight the need to be helped if there was any possibility that they would benefit for example to request new investment in innovation and water quality equipment or by asking for a reduction in the cost of water reuse however as farmers knew that the practice is not socially acceptable they tended to underestimate risks when talking to the administration the media health authorities or the public who they thought could threaten their business both extremes are supported by the findings of covello and johnson 1987 namely that risks are exaggerated or minimized according to the social cultural and moral acceptability of the underlying activities and hence the general theory that the perception of risk is formed socially risk perception is clearly linked to regulation and an example of that is the controversy between the defenders of strict water quality standards to completely protect public health and the defenders of a pragmatic stance which recognizes existing wastewater reuse practices and promotes non drinking water uses with less restrictive water quality standards kosovac et al 2017 both concepts agree that if water quality problems are going to be overcome it is necessary to promote tertiary treatment plants that take into consideration farmers requirements and public perception deniz et al 2010 furthermore this technological investment should be included in regulation frameworks in line with an international effort to reduce discrepancies between current standards on water quality and potential water uses which is requested a lot especially on a eu level accordingly regulations must be open to public consultancy in order to ensure good governance principles and they should be adapted to suit the context health risks and affordability of each individual country ricart et al 2018 this last point is particularly relevant in view of the water reuse potential because more convincing regulatory and financial incentives may bring attention to more technical investment or social debate for example in an eu context five of the member states with the highest reuse potential italy germany france portugal and greece could reach the same water reuse rate as spain by 2025 european commission 2016 also in israel it is estimated that by the year 2040 treated sewage effluent will become the main source of irrigation water supplying 70 of the total irrigation water that will be used in the country bakopoulou et al 2010 from the reviewed literature it has long been recognised that the main challenges to more effective water management are largely socio institutional rather than technical with institutional fragmentation limited long term strategic planning lack of project demonstration and inadequate community participation bischel et al 2012 in particular the perceived benefits of adopting recycled water may appear distant and abstract to the individual brouwer et al 2015 benefits such as improved water availability for future generations may not be worth the perceived short term health risks this means that individuals may be more inclined to favour their current health at the expense of long term water security a problem which by nature has been described as a social dilemma kemp et al 2012 moreover water reuse can potentially suffer by being associated with recycling according to this while many recycled products have a higher ethical value this does not necessarily mean a higher economic value because these products are commonly thought to be of poorer quality than non recycled counterparts this raises hopes that recycled water as well as potentially food products irrigated with recycled water could be cheaper meehan et al 2013 this research supports the view that the cultural meanings associated with water and water uses are an important source of many people s response to reclaimed water proposals cognitive factors such as the law of contagion and the law of similarity may explain many of the cultural perceptions that people may have about water reuse the first one suggests that once water has been in contact with contaminants it might be psychologically very difficult for people to accept that it has been purified secondly the appearance of a substance s condition or status is psychologically linked to perceptions of reality combined these factors can create mental barriers to accepting reused water as a source of pure water so why do these laws affect specific water reuse projects and others do not the main reason is related to value differences although two projects may be technically similar people may perceive value differently depending on the problem that the community needs to solve alternatives for solving the problem and how this information is passed on to important audiences indirect potable water reuse is typically a new product or idea for communities its value must be compelling and described in simple and meaningful terms for example when reclaimed wastewater is used directly for supply e g irrigation purposes it might be considered as being a private asset with a market value however if it is used for environmental purposes such as water body augmentation reclaimed effluent is a public asset that has no market value but whose environmental value in terms of the supplying ecosystem services becomes difficult to quantify engel and schaefer 2013 public opposition to recycle water is still a barrier to it being adopted this public opposition can be explained by a plethora of reasons suggested by the reviewed literature the study of marks et al 2008 based on baseline data concerning attitudes to water recycling and its uses in a representative sample of australians from major urban areas reinforces the fact that the public acceptance of water recycling cannot be achieved simply by reducing the objective level of risk as assessed by experts which is associated with the required technologies for example studies focusing on farmers willingness to pay to reuse reclaimed water or consumers willingness to buy food produced with recycled water show that a high number of farmers and consumers have a positive opinion although with different priorities water supply cost and quality for irrigators and health risks and contagion for citizens paranychianakis et al 2015 however a recent study conducted by frijns et al 2016 focused on the opinions of farmers and consumers with regard to water reuse products obtained at interviews and focus group sessions in four european water reuse schemes which showed how farmers in the focus group did not believe that consumers would consider products that are irrigated with reused water as being better or more likeable products in their opinion the agricultural reuse of recycled water might only be successful if the quality of the water as well as the final product is guaranteed and certified and if the switch to recycled water is accompanied by a comprehensive communication plan to increase public acceptance of recycled water furthermore the citizens that participated in the focus group meeting believe that a very important precondition for the eventual success of water recycling is a well functioning system of guarantees and certification accordingly some type of identification should be promoted as a way of mutual understanding between the producer and the consumer furthermore communication should not only focus on the solution water reuse but also on the underlying problem water scarcity water consumption water pollution by promoting more active public involvement methods such as site visits to water recycling facilities and water tasting events to show people different types of water mineral tap reclaimed adapa et al 2016 an original strategy proposed by baumann and kasperson 1974 and later recovered by dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 focuses on converting water reuse programs on pleasant things that the public enjoys and approves of in the words of the authors put the reclaimed water in an attractive setting and invite the public to look at it sniff it picnic around it fish in it and swim in it p 670 for example in italy at the milano nosedo wwtp the largest plant in the region treating approximately 150 million m3 year of wastewater managers promote open days to show the general public and farmers the activities of the plant to favour acceptance in a large agricultural region cultivating corn rice grass and grain recent findings have illustrated that while awareness of the real occurrence of de facto reuse is generally low people who are aware that de facto reuse occurs in their supply area are considerably more likely up to 10 times more to have a high level of acceptance for potable reuse scenarios rice et al 2016 this suggests that rather than being aware of the need for reuse as a solution to water supply issues awareness of reuse as an existing normal part of the water resource context may be a significant driver of acceptance however the facto reuse will not be useful to improve the understanding of the benefit of alternative water resources if reclaimed water is not integrated into the holistic water system just two examples the city of los angeles is currently discharging treated wastewater into the ocean at a rate of about 1 5 mm3 d leverenz et al 2011 and according to the costa brava water consortium catalonia spain less than 10 of the total volume of the wwtp 0 5 hm3 and 1 is included in the water system and 90 is going into rivers and lakes also during scarcity periods elbana et al 2010 in order to reverse this situation new strategies to move from traditional wwtps to innovative constructed wetlands cws have been promoted in some regions as cost effective treatment that can remove a wide range of contaminants by using a combination of physical chemical and biological processes ayaz et al 2015 vymazal and brezinova 2015 machado et al 2017 sometimes this process has been favoured by a marketing campaign for example the government of singapore through the public utilities board in 2000 launched a wastewater recycling demonstration project in which a portion of the treated effluent from the bedok sewage treatment plant was diverted into the water purification plant called newater factory khan and gerrard 2006 the use of language is not free the aim of the promoters was to ensure that the project was well accepted by the public and that the concept new left the origin waste of water in second place 6 conclusion water scarcity and the deterioration of the quality of water resources needs modern water resource management policies to be adopted this management should be flexible so that it can continually cope with changes in availability and demand for water resources such a holistic approach requires supply and demand water management reclaimed water is becoming increasingly more relevant to achieve water reuse driving factors risks regulation and the yuck factor a comprehensive approach between farmers and the public is needed the implementation of innovative technologies and tools should focus on this task for example by promoting scale up and long term water soil and crop analysis or by overcoming the risk management without risk awareness and the analysis of risks cost nexus it will be very difficult to promote a behaviour change towards healthy and feasible water reuse practices moreover to reduce health risks interventions and regulation frameworks are likely to be successful if they are implemented in a participatory manner to get the government at risk social groups and other major stakeholders involved accordingly a re orientation of the water governance towards integrated water management is needed furthermore too often in stakeholders consultations water reuse is excluded from the integrated water management scenarios and often regardless of the potential of water reuse as an alternative the challenge for the water reuse specialists here is to educate and re orient their own institutions to adopt more conscious and sustainable practices by bridging the tight but artificial divisions of water supply and sanitation case studies extracted from the literature show how the best way to try to convince the public on this crucial subject is by building and running demonstration sites a few years before the full scale implementation and invite the public to visit them in order to alleviate fears as citizens become more familiar with the technology and general understanding of the associated benefits of increasing water reuse officials planners and managers may come up against less opposition to additional applications and achieve greater water savings through the widespread implementation of water reuse programs direct site visits to wastewater treatment plants and seeing the effluent of such facilities could have a significant impact on increasing public acceptance because studies have shown that although people accept experts opinions on the quality of treated wastewater they rely more on their personal impressions of the effluent often based on turbidity and particulate matter the challenge is to identify public knowledge and perceptions and systematically address concerns through a framework of educational policy and management strategies to address this gap between technical and social driving factors of water reuse it is essential that engineers and social scientists work together engineers can provide the best safest and most energy efficient solutions to augment water supplies whereas social scientists can facilitate better understanding of the reasons why the public objects to the reuse of water from alternative sources social scientists can also suggest ways in which public policy makers may be able to increase the acceptance of alternative water sources and find solutions that are most acceptable for the community finally managers can profit from this coupled technical social approach to promote holistic water management between urban and agricultural

11095,the narrative of reusing water for agricultural purposes is sometimes conceived as being one of the reasons versus emotions which might not capture the complexity of the issue at hand including the legitimate fear of risks diffuse regulations and the visceral reactions from farmers and the public by analysing recent peer reviewed literature 2007 2017 from a holistic approach technical and social issues this review explores 1 the main characteristics of the reviewed literature on this topic geographical contexts research areas main topics and tools 2 relevant driving factors to effectively reconcile farmers needs and public perceptions of water reuse and 3 the current knowledge gaps and future challenges to be addressed by end users managers and authorities the article concludes by discussing the level of the knowledge in this area and advanced recommendations to further a better comprehension of technical and social driving factors of water reuse in agriculture keywords irrigation water reuse perception risks regulation yuck factor 1 introduction water scarcity and water pollution are both worldwide phenomena and two of the biggest challenges that humankind faces today and non conventional water resources are intended to close the gap between them sheidaei et al 2016 the worldwide water consumption continues to grow and it is estimated that by the year 2030 more than 160 of the total water volume available in the world will be needed to satisfy the global water requirements gosling and arnell 2016 lavrnic et al 2017 azhoni et al 2018 agriculture is the sector that is most affected by water scarcity as it accounts for 70 of global freshwater withdrawals and more than 90 of the consumption norton brandao et al 2013 several alternative solutions could be implemented in order to close the gap between water demand and water supply for agricultural use such as the control and reuse of runoff water al seekh and mohammad 2009 desalination of saline seawater avni et al 2013 ghermandi and minich 2017 cloud seeding chien et al 2017 and wastewater reuse van lier and huibers 2010 through the agenda 2030 for sustainable development the united nations is also pressing for the worldwide adoption of desalination and reuse technologies as an essential tool to attain its sustainable development goals sdgs to ensure water availability sustainable resource management and sanitation for all sdg 6 there must be integrated management of water resources furthermore the percentage of untreated wastewater should be halved by 2030 and a substantial global increase in the recycling and safe reuse of treated wastewater is required vanham et al 2018 water reuse is an intrinsic component of the natural water cycle since the discharge of effluent into watercourses and its dilution in the circulating water flow has traditionally allowed it to be indirectly reused downstream for urban agricultural and industrial purposes ortega and iglesias 2009 there are various qualities of reclaimed water depending on the type of treatment primary to advanced tertiary used to obtain it rahimi et al 2018 keeping the description simple without complex technical terms primary treatment stands for a 30 40 reduction of organic load and pathogens the secondary treatment stands for 95 and tertiary treatment stands for almost a 99 reduction of organic load with no significant pathogens after disinfection the last two levels also include disinfection meng et al 2016 according to tsagarakis et al 2013 primary treatment can be used for the controlled irrigation of forestland and parks as long as all the safety precaution measures are taken secondary treatment is appropriate for trees such as olive trees vineyards etc as long as it does not come into contact with the crops lastly tertiary treatment is appropriate for all types of crops consumed by human beings in addition two main types of water reuse for agricultural irrigation worldwide may be distinguished direct and indirect agricultural irrigation as a rule direct reuse in agriculture is the reuse of recycled water directly after treatment and with short term storage for a wide range of irrigation purposes in commercial and individual farms de miguel et al 2013 de sanctis et al 2017 in this case the irrigation water quality is determined by the quality of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent gémar et al 2018 therefore the target water quality can be easily attained by controlling the quality of the effluent sramkova et al 2018 indirect water reuse in agriculture occurs when treated wastewater is reused for the various aforementioned irrigation purposes but in the long term intermediate or seasonal storage in the following artificial or natural water bodies surface reservoirs aquifers rivers lakes and wetlands jeong et al 2016 many regions of the world are exploring the reuse of alternative water resources in response to emerging water scarcity challenges lazarova and bahri 2008 aleisa and al zubari 2017 current and future water shortages garcía rubio and guardiola 2012 mesa jurado et al 2012 and growing pressure on global water resources garcía cuerva et al 2016 tortajada and ong 2016 as half of the global water bodies are seriously contaminated wastewater treatment and reuse promote environmental security by alleviating the pollution of freshwater resources and providing more water for irrigation goonetilleke and vithanage 2017 wastewater reuse benefits are often mentioned in literature verlicchi et al 2012 beneduce et al 2017 the most relevant benefit is providing a new water supply source available for different water purposes and demands garcia and pargament 2015 additional advantages including 1 a reliable source of nutrients especially nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and organic matter which helps maintain fertility fertirrigation and the productivity of the soil miller 2006 parsons et al 2010 matheyarasu et al 2016 2 the use of less energy than other water use options e g importing water desalinated water adewumi et al 2010 3 to avoid the impact of new water supply developments e g dams ormerod and scott 2012 and 4 to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged into the environment meneses et al 2010 plumlee et al 2012 authors like alcón et al 2010 classify these benefits according to whether they are market or non market benefits from wastewater reuse in agriculture for example the market benefits stem from avoided losses of agricultural production because of water shortages and increased certainty in water supply while the non market benefits are related to the indirect reuse value associated with locally produced food and the non use values associated with the preservation of the ecological status of the river basin as well as with the social side effects of employment in agriculture accordingly the inclusion of alternative water resources is also increasingly seen to be part of a more integrated approach to managing the whole water cycle and a mechanism to support the circular economy and sustainable development goals smith et al 2018 despite the importance of treated wastewater irrigation to support the livelihoods of farmers information regarding the quantity of wastewater generated treated and used on a national scale is unavailable limited or out dated in numerous cases qadir et al 2007 however some data can be extracted from recent publications for example in the united states california and florida use significant amounts of reclaimed water for agriculture an estimated 46 of california s annual reclaimed water is reused for agriculture in florida it is 44 bryck et al 2008 most of the water reuse projects are located in arid and semi arid areas yet projects on wastewater reuse are being implemented increasingly more in humid areas due to rapid growth and urbanization perry and praskievicz 2017 in asia where about 32 of the wastewater generated is treated japan has adopted a comprehensive strategy for treated wastewater reuse in which 7 of wastewater is reused in agriculture funamiu et al 2008 in fact japan s reclaimed wastewater is focused on meeting urban water needs rather than providing water primarily for agriculture hara et al 2016 singapore has relied on malaysia for its freshwater supply although it started to consider reusing water as early as the 1970s lefebvre 2018 in china wastewater irrigation began in 1957 and now it is a very common practice particularly in suburban areas near the big and medium sized cities in the northwest zhang et al 2018 in australia the use of recycled water is increasing and it currently accounts for 4 of total consumption turner et al 2016 wastewater reuse in europe differs somewhat by geography according to sato et al 2013 in northern europe wastewater is reused primarily for environmental applications 51 of the projects and industry which accounts for 33 of the projects however in southern europe reclaimed wastewater is reused predominantly for agricultural irrigation 44 of the wastewater projects and urban or environmental purposes 37 of the projects wastewater reuse applications especially for agricultural irrigation have been developed in many countries in the mediterranean basin agrafioti and diamadopoulos 2012 in israel around 75 of its treated wastewater is reused and most of it in agriculture rygaard et al 2011 cyprus has also developed a sound water reuse strategy kathijotes and panayiotou 2013 in tunisia about 25 of reclaimed water is reused kellis et al 2013 while in spain about 22 of collected wastewater is reused for agriculture navarro 2018 a report by hamilton et al 2007 showed that around 20 mha of land was irrigated with reclaimed wastewater globally and a decade later thebo et al 2017 through a gis based analysis estimates that about 6 mha was irrigated using controlled treated wastewater and about 30 mha with diluted or untreated wastewater this is roughly 10 of the world irrigation surface area and 277 km3 of wastewater over the 864 km3 treated or not supplied annually ait mouheb et al 2018 although the technical aspects of wastewater reuse and management have often been considered as being a priority jafarinejad 2017 other concerns such as regulation and perception aspects have not been assessed or considered seriously enough and they have often been disregarded padilla rivera et al 2016 hui and cain 2018 this paper aims to synthesize current knowledge about the driving factors affecting water reuse in agriculture by considering technical and social components over the last decade 2 methodology 2 1 search terms in order to identify relevant literature we used the following search terms to

initial database search retrieved 1725 documents included duplicates table 2 for the purpose of this study only records from peer reviewed periodicals article and state of the art papers were included in the systematic review therefore books and book chapters proceedings papers phd thesis research projects reports or industry and government documents were excluded from the systematic review although they were used for the thematic review that helped identify key terms after screening for peer reviewed papers the number of appropriate articles was reduced to 1265 papers 73 3 of the initial amount from there the research category selection 1 1 the research category selection was specific for each database in web of science the selected research categories were water resources environmental sciences and studies engineering environmental chemical and civil agriculture multidisciplinary agriculture engineering economics ecology and agronomy in scopus we selected similar categories agricultural and biological sciences environmental sciences social science engineering economics econometrics and finance those subjects selected from proquest database were agriculture irrigation water reuse wastewater treatment and water management finally the subjects selected from doaj database were water supply hydraulic engineering environmental sciences agriculture and chemistry applied to each database enabled us to prioritize 875 papers 82 9 of the papers from web of sci and scopus the title analysis review resulted in the exclusion of 463 papers for different reasons a papers were not related to agricultural nor irrigation systems i e off topic papers b papers clearly focused on technical aspects i e simulation optimization models chemical methods health

level of the reviewing process 217 papers were included for full text analysis from which 125 papers were selected for an in depth analysis of the main driving factors of reclaimed water reuse in agriculture from combining technical and social components 3 2 data analysis 3 2 1 distribution of reviewed papers by year there is an apparent increase in the yearly number of papers covering main technical and social driving factors of reclaimed water reuse in agriculture fig 1 according to the data analysis 41 6 of the total papers have been published in the last three years while 14 4 of the total papers have been published in one year 2010 the high productivity of peer reviewed papers published in 2010 could be explained through the several drought episodes that affected most european countries during 2005 and 2008 as most of the papers analysed mediterranean case studies the value of the coefficient of determination r2 indicates a positive but not significant correlation between the years studied 2007 2017 and the annual number of papers related to the subject nevertheless that percentage might be a very high portion of variation to predict in a field like the social sciences

this analysis keywords regarding geographical locations agronomic parameters or physiological and structural properties have been excluded keywords can be grouped into five categories subject irrigation agriculture normative regulation rules risks environmental impact health risks climate change social perception yuck factor disgust etc and concepts reclaimed wastewater recycled water desalinated water etc 2 2 water reuse refers to the production of water through water treatment processes which introduces a feedback loop in the water cycle as such water reuse is not an additional water source but rather a product that needs to be tailored to the intended uses it differs to supply augmentation measures such as seawater desalination which in fact includes a new input to the water cycle currently there is a range of terminology and definitions used to define water reuse globally water reuse water recycling treated wastewater reuse and reclaimed water are all used interchangeably which has resulted in confusion between and within different countries for example treated water is wastewater that has been treated at the urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp to make sure its quality meets wastewater discharge authorization requirements while recycled or reclaimed water is wastewater that has undergone a more rigorous treatment process in a water reclamation facility wrf and can therefore be directly used for more restricted purposes e g irrigation or environmental uses without being diluted by other water flows ansari et al 2018 the concepts category includes 58 5 of the keywords followed by the social category 16 2 the most popular keywords were reclaimed water and irrigation agriculture many publications included the benefits of non conventional water resources in the introduction section as a way of counteracting risks although no specific keyword has been included as a reference e g hernández et al 2010 furthermore although a significant

allows us to determine how each researched topic has evolved over time without taking into account the state of the art exercises since they include an analysis of different researched topics in 2007 public perception menegaki et al 2007 and monitoring effects candela et al 2007 focused the interest of the researcher in 2008 governance factors nancarrow et al 2008 legislation iglesias and ortega 2008 and innovative treatment illueca muñoz et al 2008 joined the scientific production topics one year later more attention was paid to perceptive issues from farmers russell and lux 2009 and the public dolnicar and schäfer 2009 in 2010 long term benefits leong 2010 and the impact muñoz et al 2010 of using reclaimed water were added to the initial research areas of study one year later a cost benefit analysis was included in the analysis of non conventional water resources molinos senante et al 2011 and more attention was paid to monitoring effects morugán coronado et al 2011 in 2012 studies focused on farmers preferences and public perception kemp et al 2012 risk assessment cirelli et al 2012 was conducted and a year later new studies on cost benefit analysis alcón et al 2013 and monitoring effects pedrero et al 2013 were carried out innovative treatment ortega reig et al 2014 and monitoring effects contreras et al 2014 were developed in 2014 while in 2015 and 2016 public perception interest increased march et al 2015 saldías et al 2016 finally there was a renewed interest in innovative treatment licata et al 2017 and monitoring effects romero trigueros et al 2017 in 2017 it is worth pointing out the greater interest in finding out about the public s perception of using non conventional water resources rather than asking farmers if they are willing to use and pay to reuse these treated water resources 3 2 4 analysis tools a total of 17 analysis tools from quantitative qualitative and mixed methods have been used in the reviewed papers fig 4 the qualitative tools category includes six types of analysis to promote stakeholders interaction questionnaire interview focus groups and to provide evidence and strategies from collecting data literature review swot analysis together with the establishment of a protocol the quantitative tools category includes four types of analysis focused on field experimentation soil analysis water monitoring plant growth measurements and chemical modelling finally the mixed tools category that includes seven types of analysis to compare parameters test analysis indicators define systematic approaches cost benefit analysis risk assessment life cycle assessment and promote stakeholders involvement decision support system agent based model 86 papers used qualitative analysis methods heinz et al 2011 mahesh et al 2015 while 67 papers targeted by quantitative tools díaz et al 2013 maestre valero et al 2016 and 19 papers used mixed tools vergine et al 2017 note that papers may simultaneously use more than one analysis tool from quantitative qualitative and or mixed methods e g frijns et al 2016 as for the internal category analysis the most popular qualitative tools were the questionnaire and the literature review 76 7 while the soil analysis and the water monitoring were the most popular tools from a quantitative perspective 82 1 the use of mixed tools was less significant and the most popular tool was the cost benefit analysis 4 results it is time for the literature review to answer the following question what insights have been gained from different technical and social science approaches to understand driven factors and public responses towards water reuse we structure our response to this query around three broad and interrelated strands of thinking which have emerged from the last decade literature risks regulation and the yuck factor 4 1 risks notions of risk are social constructions deeply embedded in historical social and cultural context which are perceived differently by individuals communities and institutions dobbie and brown 2014 it is understandable that from both the community farmers and the public and the institutional perspective water managers major concerns about water reuse schemes are driven by the potential risks both environmental and health grant et al 2012 4 1 1 environmental risks the presence of nutrients is one of the most clearly diagnosed effects in the literature pedrero et al 2010 although the nutrients in treated municipal wastewater provide fertilizer value to crop or landscape production in certain instances they are in excess of plant needs and they can cause problems related to excessive vegetative growth delayed or uneven maturity or reduced quality nutrients produced in important quantities include nitrogen and phosphorus and occasionally potassium zinc boron and sulphur díaz et al 2013 alterations such as the increase of organic matter pools salinity and soil accumulation of contaminants are other effects that are reported most often contreras et al 2014 human and animal pathogens phytopathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria and their genes are important biological contaminants that can be transported by wastewater and or be enriched in soil becerra castro et al 2015 wastewater also contains other pollutants such as metals metalloids residual drugs organic compounds endocrine disruptor compounds and active residues of personal care products qadir et al 2010 additionally the regular reuse of wastewater can modify the minerals macro and micronutrients for plant growth soil ph soil buffer capacity and cation exchange capacity bañón et al 2011 some studies clearly focused on the farmers perception of environmental risks for example sheidaei et al 2016 investigated drivers of perceived health and environmental risks of wastewater reuse in iran and they concluded that while farmers were aware of the contribution of wastewater to fertilize the soil and its reliability as a water resource they were concerned about its negative impact on the environment another study conducted by mahesh et al 2015 in an indian micro watershed in which irrigation water is a mixture of canal water from the musi river and groundwater farmers felt that the soil quality had changed over time due to the influence of wastewater irrigation in line with the research studies of biggs and jiang 2009 finally although most of the studies are short term the main impact identified in perceived soil quality was the result of the duration of wastewater reuse chen et al 2016 4 1 2 health risks citizens may perceive health risks or suspect that pathogens and chemicals are present in reclaimed water and evidence suggests that the perceptions of health risks increase when reclaimed water comes into contact with humans kandiah et al 2017 perceptions about health risks describe people s subjective judgement of health risks or behaviours and it could be triggered off by factors such as tradition family pressure community norms time pressure and inconvenience karg and drechsel 2011 food safety is a major public concern that attracts the attention of researchers and stakeholders altogether khan et al 2009 farahat et al 2017 contaminated food sources can lead to many serious health problems such as the depletion of essential nutrients in the body that decrease the body s immune system orisakwe et al 2012 furthermore various studies have demonstrated that there are high levels of bacteria and enteric viruses in treated wastewater osuolale and okoh 2017 which are commonly resistant to conventional wastewater treatment processes and disinfection and they can be spread in the environment through wastewater effluents symonds et al 2014 in fact they are present in domestic wastewater and they can be transmitted into the environment because they are not removed properly in conventional wwtps and they survive a long time in the environment moazeni et al 2017 according to a recent study of saldías et al 2016 carried out in india when asked directly about 75 of the respondents claimed that they were aware of the health risks associated with the reuse of wastewater while about 78 of farmers said that they would grow other crops if the water quality was better e g vegetables for a higher income however although farmers had years of experience in using wastewater in some cases they had very little knowledge of the health risks involved this could be explained by the fact that farmers do not consume what they produce or because they do not get feedback about the risks perceived by consumers keraita et al 2008 results also emphasize how farmers perceptions of health and environmental risks are products of a complex set of factors among which previous knowledge distance from the farm to the wastewater plant or canal closeness and market value orientation are the most important factors to understand their predisposition or objection to using wastewater sheidaei et al 2016 4 2 regulations risks based on water and soil quality standards for irrigation water reuse is rather a broad topic which includes an extensive amount of guidelines and regulations that vary in how specific they are for a particular end use of water most papers based wastewater reuse regulation to the world health organization who document reuse of effluents wastewater treatment methods and health safeguards 1973 aimed at protecting public health and favouring the rational reuse of wastewater and excretion in agriculture mara and kramer 2008 another papers fixed the wastewater quality guidelines for agricultural reuse published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao in 1987 heinz et al 2011 more recently the us environmental protection agency and the united states agency for international development updated the guidelines for wastewater reuse in 2012 to include advances in wastewater treatment technologies best practices to involve communities in planning projects and factors that support the expansion of safe and sustainable water reuse jaramillo and restrepo 2017 on a european level the council directive 2000 60 ec the water framework directive and the council directive 91 271 eec the urban waste water treatment directive established the basis for national frameworks european commission 1991 the first one indirectly recognizes reuse as a strategy to increase water availability which therefore contributes to the good status of water bodies while the second one consider that treated wastewater shall be reused whenever appropriate paranychianakis et al 2015 the blueprint for safeguarding european waters 2012 identified water reuse as an important measure requiring eu attention and that a coordinated effort would be required to inject confidence and increase the adoption of water reuse practices this was pursued even further in the 2015 communication closing the loop an eu action plan for the circular economy that identified a series of activities to promote the reuse of treated wastewater more recently in may 2018 a proposal for a regulation from the european parliament and the council on minimum requirements for water reuse com 2018 337 was launched because reusing treated waste water generally has less of an environmental impact than water transfers or desalination for example and it generates a range of environmental economic and social benefits the recommendations on reusing wastewater established by these organizations and political frameworks are the background of most of the legal guidelines proposed in countries such as the united states portugal spain italy cyprus france australia israel jordan kuwait oman saudi arabia and china angelakis and gikas 2014 vergine et al 2017 in some cases regulations on a regional level have been given priority over the global framework for example the state of california was a pioneer regarding water reuse seeing as it has had regulations since 1918 california state board of health on a european level the spanish royal decree 1620 2007 was another considerable step forward in regulating water reuse as it clarifies both the responsibilities of the public administrations and the concession holders and end users establishing permitted uses and quality criteria the minimum frequency of sampling the benchmark for analytical methods and the conformity criteria iglesias et al 2010 molina and melgarejo 2016 molle et al 2012 and fawell et al 2016 analysed how most of the water reuse regulations in several eu countries have not been developed in line with the transversal principles of the eu such as the precautionary principle in another case study sheidaei et al 2016 asked farmers what they knew about laws and regulations on the safe reuse of wastewater in agriculture and only half of them responded positively 4 3 yuck factor the standard explanation about public resistance to water reuse projects is the yuck factor or the feeling of dread and disgust that is associated with drinking or buying agricultural products produced with wastewater the yuck factor has also been defined as a psychological repugnance disgust or profound discomfort marks et al 2008 it has become associated with the affect heuristic which holds that people s willingness to accept a given hazard is determined by an emotional response affect which precedes the cognitive evaluation of information fife schaw et al 2008 on the contrary to these explanations which focus on psychological aversion authors like ormerod and scott 2012 argue that the yuck factor is based on the social and cultural perceptions of risk according to this opinion influences intention to accept and intention influences behaviour in view of the critical importance of the yuck factor for the successful implementation of water reuse schemes a growing body of social research has sought to understand why farmers and with greater interest the public favour or reject reclaimed water reuse and which challenges should be addressed in order to ensure the mutual comprehension between farmers demands and public perception 4 3 1 farmers leeway farmers are ultimately the end users of reclaimed water and their decision to irrigate or not with alternative water can make or break any water reuse project furthermore a special group of professionals sharing their experiences of the irrigation process make suggestions that could affect future reuse projects in nearby areas mayilla et al 2016 mojid et al 2010 pointed out how farmers express two opposing viewpoints towards the quality of wastewater repugnance in the family and social spheres which is valuable in the economic and agricultural sphere although many farmers recognized the fertility values of wastewater they had inadequate insight into it and applied fertilizers at rates based on the mind s eye the main factors identified as being important for perception include the quality of the water being delivered to the farm ortega reig et al 2014 the capacity of farmers to manage the agricultural hazards from irrigation with reclaimed water bakopoulou et al 2010 society s concerns about reuse for irrigation wester et al 2015 and the recognition of the reuse benefits in terms of livelihood provisions and economic gains carr et al 2011 menegaki et al 2007 found that the vast majority of farmers support water reuse as a concept and that support for reuse decreases as the degree of contact with reclaimed water increases the use of language is very important when asking about farmers willingness to use wastewater for example while treated implies that the effluent described has been transformed from its previous polluted state recycled suggests a return towards an even earlier purer source material menegaki et al 2009 at this point it has to be noted that in some papers technical use and common use of specific terms such as recycled and treated wastewater is not well explained the results of their study show how farmers who were willing to use purified effluent to irrigate crops were not willing to pay more when it is described as recycled water instead of treated wastewater another study from bakopoulou et al 2010 conducted in the thessaly region concludes that the majority of farmers 58 are willing to pay half the price of freshwater for recycled water used to irrigate their crops a relatively high percentage of them 34 would not pay for recycled water if they had fresh water available for crop irrigation while a very low percentage of farmers 8 would pay a little less for recycled water than for fresh water so the authors conclude that farmers income decreases the probability that they will pay half the price of fresh water for recycled water when both fresh and recycled water are available as the cost of recycled water is an important factor to encourage farmers to reuse reclaimed water and to favour the acceptance of water reuse most water reuse projects involve a direct or indirect subsidy that is suppliers tend to offer recycled water at concession prices for example in spain public administrations can cover a maximum of about 70 of the operation costs related to conveying water from the wwtp to irrigate fields and about 10 of the total cost of installing the irrigation system used elbana et al 2010 however under the terms of the wfd the real cost of reclaimed water should be paid by the end user but this is not yet the case in regions such as spain for example 4 3 2 public trust a significant number of surveys have been carried out all over the world in order to understand how the public perception acceptance and opposition interact with institutional water reuse promotion petousi et al 2015 several studies that clearly focused on public perception have assessed the levels of acceptance of recycled reclaimed wastewater for a range of purposes that vary in the extent to which they involve human contact regardless of the measure of acceptance used the same pattern emerges water reuse acceptance drops with increasing human contact boyer et al 2012 according to a recent and complete review study conducted by fielding et al 2018 80 or more of participants found it acceptable to use recycled water for public or home garden irrigation although no attention has been paid to the fact that each reviewed study uses different methods to ask the public specific questions different concepts about whether they accept using wastewater to irrigate food crops and landscape maintenance which ranges from as low as 40 50 browning aiken et al 2011 buyukkamaci and alkan 2013 to as high as 70 90 chen et al 2015 there might be different reasons to explain the lowest percentages 1 many citizens can perceive health risks or suspect them according to the appearance colour and odour hurlimann and mckay 2007 2 communities suspected that plans were being made in secret and that their concerns were being ignored beveridge et al 2017 or 3 water reuse organisations failed to adequately promote the benefits of their operations mujeriego et al 2008 studies including bdour et al 2009 nancarrow et al 2010 and adewumi et al 2014 suggest that public acceptance of reuse is a product of attitude emotion control over the source of water subjective norms influence of people around you knowledge or information about the scheme associated risks trust in the implementing authority physical quality satisfaction choice specific use source s of recycled water cost and water scarcity individually or combined these factors have been investigated in various places where water reuse schemes have been implemented or are planned for example several modelling based studies have argued that higher levels of trust are associated with lower perceptions of risk which in turn increase the likelihood of acceptance ross et al 2014 trust has been linked to the concept of contagion stemming from the feeling of once in contact always in contact rozin et al 2015 this affective reaction means that people cannot separate the final product of water reuse clean water from its contaminated source human excreta another recent study argued that affective reactions to contagion pinpoint a social representation of water reuse a way in which it is understood in the public domain that differs significantly from a scientific and technical understanding callaghan et al 2012 the authors point out that individuals may be aware of and influenced by the social representation of water reuse even if they themselves do not fully adopt that representation in view of this and according to tram et al 2014 water reuse professionals recognize the positive roles that reclaimed water may have in the water supply system and they are of the opinion that risk aversion and management are imperative in reclaimed water reuse due to upstream water quality issues accidental spills or mismatches of uses and water quality dupont 2013 another common assumption collected by stenekes et al 2006 is that water reuse projects fail because the public is unable to comprehend specialist information about risks and beliefs therefore if the public were educated they would accept change more readily the media could provide part of this education goodwin et al 2017 for example dolnicar et al 2010 explored the effect of information on the acceptance of recycled and desalinated water in a study based on 1000 australian subjects and it found a positive association between the provision of information and public acceptance of alternative sources of water hurlimann et al 2009 noted that at mawson lakes australia respondents trusted the water authority more when they were well informed about recycled water and furthermore respondents exhibited greater levels of satisfaction with the use of recycled non drinking water in another case study from the jordan valley more than 70 of respondents expressed their willingness to learn more about water treatment and reuse al mashaqbeh et al 2012 most of these studies show how the public acceptance of reuse is more likely when the protection of the environment and the promotion of water conservation are clear benefits and when the awareness of water supply problems in the community is high dare and mohtar 2018 both factors are closely interrelated and their inclusion is partly due to the fact that the regions of the world where water reuse is more commonplace tend to be those that regularly experience water scarcity notably the u s the states of california texas and arizona australia and mediterranean countries hurlimann and dolnicar 2016 for instance dolnicar et al 2011 concluded that the awareness of real water scarcity problems as well as previous experience with water restrictions would increase the likelihood of respondents accepting water reuse 5 discussion ten years ago angelakis and durham 2008 asked if water reuse for agricultural purposes was one of the most misunderstood water applications just like the anthropogenic water cycle the success and failure of water reuse schemes around the world compared to the drivers for such schemes is shaped by complex interrelationships between technological economic and socio political factors although the successful implementation of innovation and new technology which basically focused on ensuring reused water quality has been promoted in the past this engineering performance has not always been associated with the comprehension of the social environment in which the water reuse project should be applied gu et al 2015 furthermore it must be acknowledged that many well established reuse schemes were implemented before widespread public involvement became an imperative of water sector planning and management and they have therefore benefited according to this priority was given to obtaining a new water resource while both environmental and health risks and regulation issues were excluded from social debate duong and saphores 2015 however for farmers and the public risks and regulations are key issues to accept or refuse water reuse a recent study carried out by antwi agyei et al 2015 shows how farmers tend to overestimate or underestimate risks depending on how the study is introduced farmers were inclined to overestimate risks to highlight the need to be helped if there was any possibility that they would benefit for example to request new investment in innovation and water quality equipment or by asking for a reduction in the cost of water reuse however as farmers knew that the practice is not socially acceptable they tended to underestimate risks when talking to the administration the media health authorities or the public who they thought could threaten their business both extremes are supported by the findings of covello and johnson 1987 namely that risks are exaggerated or minimized according to the social cultural and moral acceptability of the underlying activities and hence the general theory that the perception of risk is formed socially risk perception is clearly linked to regulation and an example of that is the controversy between the defenders of strict water quality standards to completely protect public health and the defenders of a pragmatic stance which recognizes existing wastewater reuse practices and promotes non drinking water uses with less restrictive water quality standards kosovac et al 2017 both concepts agree that if water quality problems are going to be overcome it is necessary to promote tertiary treatment plants that take into consideration farmers requirements and public perception deniz et al 2010 furthermore this technological investment should be included in regulation frameworks in line with an international effort to reduce discrepancies between current standards on water quality and potential water uses which is requested a lot especially on a eu level accordingly regulations must be open to public consultancy in order to ensure good governance principles and they should be adapted to suit the context health risks and affordability of each individual country ricart et al 2018 this last point is particularly relevant in view of the water reuse potential because more convincing regulatory and financial incentives may bring attention to more technical investment or social debate for example in an eu context five of the member states with the highest reuse potential italy germany france portugal and greece could reach the same water reuse rate as spain by 2025 european commission 2016 also in israel it is estimated that by the year 2040 treated sewage effluent will become the main source of irrigation water supplying 70 of the total irrigation water that will be used in the country bakopoulou et al 2010 from the reviewed literature it has long been recognised that the main challenges to more effective water management are largely socio institutional rather than technical with institutional fragmentation limited long term strategic planning lack of project demonstration and inadequate community participation bischel et al 2012 in particular the perceived benefits of adopting recycled water may appear distant and abstract to the individual brouwer et al 2015 benefits such as improved water availability for future generations may not be worth the perceived short term health risks this means that individuals may be more inclined to favour their current health at the expense of long term water security a problem which by nature has been described as a social dilemma kemp et al 2012 moreover water reuse can potentially suffer by being associated with recycling according to this while many recycled products have a higher ethical value this does not necessarily mean a higher economic value because these products are commonly thought to be of poorer quality than non recycled counterparts this raises hopes that recycled water as well as potentially food products irrigated with recycled water could be cheaper meehan et al 2013 this research supports the view that the cultural meanings associated with water and water uses are an important source of many people s response to reclaimed water proposals cognitive factors such as the law of contagion and the law of similarity may explain many of the cultural perceptions that people may have about water reuse the first one suggests that once water has been in contact with contaminants it might be psychologically very difficult for people to accept that it has been purified secondly the appearance of a substance s condition or status is psychologically linked to perceptions of reality combined these factors can create mental barriers to accepting reused water as a source of pure water so why do these laws affect specific water reuse projects and others do not the main reason is related to value differences although two projects may be technically similar people may perceive value differently depending on the problem that the community needs to solve alternatives for solving the problem and how this information is passed on to important audiences indirect potable water reuse is typically a new product or idea for communities its value must be compelling and described in simple and meaningful terms for example when reclaimed wastewater is used directly for supply e g irrigation purposes it might be considered as being a private asset with a market value however if it is used for environmental purposes such as water body augmentation reclaimed effluent is a public asset that has no market value but whose environmental value in terms of the supplying ecosystem services becomes difficult to quantify engel and schaefer 2013 public opposition to recycle water is still a barrier to it being adopted this public opposition can be explained by a plethora of reasons suggested by the reviewed literature the study of marks et al 2008 based on baseline data concerning attitudes to water recycling and its uses in a representative sample of australians from major urban areas reinforces the fact that the public acceptance of water recycling cannot be achieved simply by reducing the objective level of risk as assessed by experts which is associated with the required technologies for example studies focusing on farmers willingness to pay to reuse reclaimed water or consumers willingness to buy food produced with recycled water show that a high number of farmers and consumers have a positive opinion although with different priorities water supply cost and quality for irrigators and health risks and contagion for citizens paranychianakis et al 2015 however a recent study conducted by frijns et al 2016 focused on the opinions of farmers and consumers with regard to water reuse products obtained at interviews and focus group sessions in four european water reuse schemes which showed how farmers in the focus group did not believe that consumers would consider products that are irrigated with reused water as being better or more likeable products in their opinion the agricultural reuse of recycled water might only be successful if the quality of the water as well as the final product is guaranteed and certified and if the switch to recycled water is accompanied by a comprehensive communication plan to increase public acceptance of recycled water furthermore the citizens that participated in the focus group meeting believe that a very important precondition for the eventual success of water recycling is a well functioning system of guarantees and certification accordingly some type of identification should be promoted as a way of mutual understanding between the producer and the consumer furthermore communication should not only focus on the solution water reuse but also on the underlying problem water scarcity water consumption water pollution by promoting more active public involvement methods such as site visits to water recycling facilities and water tasting events to show people different types of water mineral tap reclaimed adapa et al 2016 an original strategy proposed by baumann and kasperson 1974 and later recovered by dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 focuses on converting water reuse programs on pleasant things that the public enjoys and approves of in the words of the authors put the reclaimed water in an attractive setting and invite the public to look at it sniff it picnic around it fish in it and swim in it p 670 for example in italy at the milano nosedo wwtp the largest plant in the region treating approximately 150 million m3 year of wastewater managers promote open days to show the general public and farmers the activities of the plant to favour acceptance in a large agricultural region cultivating corn rice grass and grain recent findings have illustrated that while awareness of the real occurrence of de facto reuse is generally low people who are aware that de facto reuse occurs in their supply area are considerably more likely up to 10 times more to have a high level of acceptance for potable reuse scenarios rice et al 2016 this suggests that rather than being aware of the need for reuse as a solution to water supply issues awareness of reuse as an existing normal part of the water resource context may be a significant driver of acceptance however the facto reuse will not be useful to improve the understanding of the benefit of alternative water resources if reclaimed water is not integrated into the holistic water system just two examples the city of los angeles is currently discharging treated wastewater into the ocean at a rate of about 1 5 mm3 d leverenz et al 2011 and according to the costa brava water consortium catalonia spain less than 10 of the total volume of the wwtp 0 5 hm3 and 1 is included in the water system and 90 is going into rivers and lakes also during scarcity periods elbana et al 2010 in order to reverse this situation new strategies to move from traditional wwtps to innovative constructed wetlands cws have been promoted in some regions as cost effective treatment that can remove a wide range of contaminants by using a combination of physical chemical and biological processes ayaz et al 2015 vymazal and brezinova 2015 machado et al 2017 sometimes this process has been favoured by a marketing campaign for example the government of singapore through the public utilities board in 2000 launched a wastewater recycling demonstration project in which a portion of the treated effluent from the bedok sewage treatment plant was diverted into the water purification plant called newater factory khan and gerrard 2006 the use of language is not free the aim of the promoters was to ensure that the project was well accepted by the public and that the concept new left the origin waste of water in second place 6 conclusion water scarcity and the deterioration of the quality of water resources needs modern water resource management policies to be adopted this management should be flexible so that it can continually cope with changes in availability and demand for water resources such a holistic approach requires supply and demand water management reclaimed water is becoming increasingly more relevant to achieve water reuse driving factors risks regulation and the yuck factor a comprehensive approach between farmers and the public is needed the implementation of innovative technologies and tools should focus on this task for example by promoting scale up and long term water soil and crop analysis or by overcoming the risk management without risk awareness and the analysis of risks cost nexus it will be very difficult to promote a behaviour change towards healthy and feasible water reuse practices moreover to reduce health risks interventions and regulation frameworks are likely to be successful if they are implemented in a participatory manner to get the government at risk social groups and other major stakeholders involved accordingly a re orientation of the water governance towards integrated water management is needed furthermore too often in stakeholders consultations water reuse is excluded from the integrated water management scenarios and often regardless of the potential of water reuse as an alternative the challenge for the water reuse specialists here is to educate and re orient their own institutions to adopt more conscious and sustainable practices by bridging the tight but artificial divisions of water supply and sanitation case studies extracted from the literature show how the best way to try to convince the public on this crucial subject is by building and running demonstration sites a few years before the full scale implementation and invite the public to visit them in order to alleviate fears as citizens become more familiar with the technology and general understanding of the associated benefits of increasing water reuse officials planners and managers may come up against less opposition to additional applications and achieve greater water savings through the widespread implementation of water reuse programs direct site visits to wastewater treatment plants and seeing the effluent of such facilities could have a significant impact on increasing public acceptance because studies have shown that although people accept experts opinions on the quality of treated wastewater they rely more on their personal impressions of the effluent often based on turbidity and particulate matter the challenge is to identify public knowledge and perceptions and systematically address concerns through a framework of educational policy and management strategies to address this gap between technical and social driving factors of water reuse it is essential that engineers and social scientists work together engineers can provide the best safest and most energy efficient solutions to augment water supplies whereas social scientists can facilitate better understanding of the reasons why the public objects to the reuse of water from alternative sources social scientists can also suggest ways in which public policy makers may be able to increase the acceptance of alternative water sources and find solutions that are most acceptable for the community finally managers can profit from this coupled technical social approach to promote holistic water management between urban and agricultural

11096,application of livestock manure has become a principal nutrient source in groundwater and surface water the goal of this research was to investigate the effect of controlled drainage cd on nitrogen n fate and transport for a subsurface drained grass field receiving liquid swine lagoon effluent sle a four year field experiment was conducted on a naturally poorly drained pasture in eastern north carolina the 1 25 ha experimental field was artificially drained by subsurface drains installed at 1 0 m depth and 12 5 m spacing two treatments replicated twice were implemented conventional drainage fd and cd the cd management protocol was more intensive compared to previous studies the drain outlets of cd plot were set at 36 cm below soil surface all year round except several days before irrigation application when water table depth was shallower than 65 cm below surface controlled drainage significantly reduced drainage flow and tn loading via subsurface drain lines by an average of 397 mm yr 1 93 and 34 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 94 respectively drainmod hydrologic simulations indicated that 96 of the reduction in predicted drain flow was attributed to increased lateral seepage the nitrogen that did not drain from the field in response to cd was lost via enhanced denitrification 67 and lateral seepage to adjacent fields 33 this study clearly demonstrated how cd management affects the n fate and transport through seepage and denitrification process keywords controlled drainage swine lagoon effluent drainage water quality nitrogen denitrification lateral

require improved drainage the benefits of improved drainage include a dryer soil profile a deeper water table and reduced frequencies of surface ponding runoff and soil erosion poole et al 2013 these conditions favor increasing the rate of sle infiltration application and potential nutrient losses over application of manure is linked to nitrous oxide gas emission bad odor and the transport of n phosphorus and pathogens to ground and surface water larney et al 2011 a conventional or free drainage fd system drains an agricultural field with the same intensity regardless of the actual need for drainage this increases n export via excess drainage to receiving streams controlled drainage cd is a drainage water management dwm practice that has been proposed to reduce n losses from artificially drained agricultural land evans et al 1995 skaggs et al 2012a controlled drainage is implemented using drainage control structures that are installed at drain outlets to vary the levels of these outlets and thus adjust the intensity of drainage according to the agronomic and farming needs skaggs 1999 the required control level of drainage outlets varies during the year and from year to year depending on the cropping system and weather conditions the performance of cd depends upon several factors including climatological conditions soil properties cropping system farming practices drainage system design drain depth and spacing and management protocol of control structures reported n reduction via drain outlets by cd varied over a wide range from 18 to more than 75 skaggs et al 2010 2012a it has been hypothesized that cd reduces n loss from drained cropland via three mechanisms 1 reducing tile drainage flow 2 enhancing denitrification in the soil profile and 3 increasing crop n uptake skaggs et al 2012a poole et al 2013 the reduction in subsurface drainage d flow by cd may be associated with an increase in evapotranspiration et surface runoff ro and both lateral ls and vertical seepage vs long term drainmod simulations indicated that the increase in et by cd would not exceed 10 in most cases skaggs et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 the ls and or vs might have played an important role when an observed reduction in total outflow sum of d and ro by cd exceeds 20 skaggs et al 2010 if ls and or vs occurred nitrogen reduction efficiency of cd might be considerably lower than the measured n reduction via drain outlets understanding the fate of the water and n that did not leave the field via drainage outlets is key to quantifying the actual cd performance for reducing n export from drained agricultural fields drury et al 2009 found greater ro reduced drainage and lower total water loss from cd plots compared with fd plots in a four year experimental study conducted on a clay loam soil in ontario canada sunohara et al 2014 found 50 less drainage higher ls and vs from cd plots compared to fd plots in a four year experiment david et al 2015 suggested that shallow groundwater was moving laterally from cd to fd as they observed an increase in drainage flow from fd system shortly after initiating cd in a two year experiment in illinois moreover the difference between nitrate n concentrations in drainage outflow from fd and cd systems was not significant therefore they suggested no reduction in nitrate n load in cd system drainmod simulation skaggs et al 2012b burchell 2003 poole 2006 negm et al 2017 was performed based on the field measured data to estimate the water loss through lateral seepage from cd plots nitrogen losses through lateral seepage in cd plots were estimated according to the lateral seepage water flux and groundwater nitrogen concentration measured in the field the crop yield increase is associated with an increase in plant n uptake and subsequent decrease in n leaching in the soil profile skaggs et al 2012a poole et al 2013 delbecq et al 2012 and ghane et al 2012 found cd increases corn and soybean yields in the u s midwest by 2 1 9 8 however helmers et al 2012 reported that cd reduced corn yield while soybean yield was not significantly changed cordeiro and ranjan 2012 and woli et al 2010 found no significant difference in crop yields between cd and fd plots the grass yield and nitrogen content were measured during 2011 2014 in this study for estimating the impact of cd on grass nitrogen uptake nitrogen load reduction through decreased drainage volume in cd plots has been widely accepted as an important mechanism however the enhanced denitrification in cd plots could be difficult to identify if there was neither measurement of denitrification indexes e g redox readings nor significant nitrate n concentration reduction in cd treatment most previous researches on cd were carried out on artificially drained fields planted to row crops and receiving inorganic nitrogen fertilizers research investigating the effect of cd on nutrient loss from grass field receiving organic fertilizer is lacking the objectives of this study were to 1 experimentally evaluate the performance of controlled drainage for reducing n loadings from a subsurface drained grass field receiving sle 2 investigate the fate of nitrogen that did not drain from the field in response to controlled drainage 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field and controlled drainage settings a four year experiment 2011 2014 was carried out on a 1 25 ha pasture located in the lower coastal plain of north carolina at the tidewater research station 35 50 47 6 n 76 40 0 58 w fig 1 the soil on the site is a poorly drained cape fear loam with approximately 10 organic matter gilliam et al 1979 there is a loamy sand layer extends from 135 cm to 210 cm below ground surface and an estimated impervious layer at 300 cm below ground surface burchell et al 2005 the field is relatively flat with an average slope of 0 07 the 30 year 1981 2010 normal yearly precipitation is 1321 mm the site receives liquid sle from a 0 4 ha lagoon northeast to the site fig 1 in early 2010 eight 125 m long lateral subsurface drains 10 cm diameter were installed at 1 m depth and 12 5 m spacing all subsurface drains were connected to a non perforated main drain discharging into a sump where drainage water was pumped to a shallow receiving open ditch the subsurface lateral drains were evenly divided into two groups four drains managed in cd mode and four kept in fd mode the outer drains of each group were operated as guard drains to hydraulically isolate the inner experimental drains cd1 and cd2 vs fd1 and fd2 fig 1 additionally plastic liners were buried between the lagoon and the cd plots as well as between fd plots and the south of the field burchell et al 2005 agri drain drainage control structures were installed on each experimental drain line tall fescue festuca arundinacea schreb and perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l were grown on the site realistic plant available nitrogen pan rate is expected to be 164 8 kg ha 1 year 1 with 7 85 ton ha 1 year 1 grass yield for fescue hay in cape fear loam crouse 2014 the recommended pan for this field was 195 kg ha 1 year 1 that is 390 kg ha 1 year 1 of total nitrogen barker 1990 the cd outlets level was kept at 36 cm below soil surface when the water depth at the control structure was shallower than 65 cm three days before sle application drain outlets were lowered by an additional 30 cm drain outlets were reset to 36 cm below soil surface just before irrigation this management strategy aimed at avoiding ro keeping irrigated water in the soil profile for a long enough time to allow for grass uptake promoting denitrification in the saturated zone of the soil profile and preventing nutrient rich wastewater from leaving the field via the drainage system cd outlet level was only lowered twice 74 cm deep during february 27 march 3 2013 and 92 cm deep during november 13 21 2013 during the four year experiment 2 2 data collection a v notch weir inside each control structure was used for drainage flow measurement the stages upstream and downstream of each weir were measured by potentiometers in two still wells connected to the structure campbell scientific cr 200 data loggers were used to store drainage flow data every 10 min and trigger automatic water samplers to collect composite drainage water samples 125 ml is collected in a composite sample bottle for every 0 5 m3 of drainage water passing over the weir in addition to adjusting cd outlet levels all water samples were collected and sampler bottles were emptied just before application of the sle water table depth midway between experimental drain lines was measured every 60 min by u20 13 ft hobo automatic water level loggers hanging in two 5 1 cm diameter pvc monitoring wells fig 1 two sets of groundwater sampling wells were installed near the monitoring wells each set consists of three wells screened at different depths 0 75 1 00 m 1 25 1 50 m and 2 0 2 25 m for shallow medium and deep wells groundwater samples were grabbed monthly in 2011 and biweekly during 2012 2014 precipitation was recorded using two on site hobo tipping bucket automatic rain gauges calibrated with manual measurements precipitation samples were collected since june 2012 nitrogen wet deposition during 2011 2013 was estimated based on mean n concentration in 2014 and precipitation volume in 2011 2013 nitrogen dry deposition was not measured on site swine lagoon effluent was applied based on recommended rates by a sprinkler irrigation system the uniformity of irrigation water was assessed by measuring the average irrigation water depth at 17 manual rain gauges at different locations in the field wastewater in the 17 rain gauges during irrigation was collected for n species concentration measurement additionally lagoon wastewater was sampled several times per year by the tidewater research station for estimating pan drainage water groundwater in three different depths fig 1 precipitation and irrigation samples were analyzed for nitrate n total kjeldahl n tkn and ammonium ammonia n an concentrations analytical procedures were based on epa approved wet chemistry analyses of nutrients usepa 1983 water samples were filtered 1 μm diameter filter for an and nitrate n concentration analysis unfiltered samples were used for tkn concentration analysis the grass was cut three to four times a year mainly during may october the cut grass was air dried for several days before baled and weighed grass samples were collected oven dried at 70 c for three days ground and analyzed for moisture carbon c and n contents the moisture content of grass samples and grass biomass yield from the two treatments were measured separately since june 27 2012 the air dried grass yield from cd and fd plots counted to 29 3 and 28 8 of total yield from the whole field including the undrained south field the air dried grass yield during january 2011 may 2012 was estimated based on the above percentage and the average moisture content 0 504 of all measured grass samples during june 2012 december 2014 2 3 water balance the water balance components for the experimental field were used to investigate the fate of the water that did not leave the field via the drainage system because of cd the water balance for an artificially drained field during a time step δt can be described by eq 1 at the soil surface and eq 2 in the soil profile skaggs et al 2012b 1 p i r r f r o δ s s where p is precipitation mm irr is irrigation mm f is infiltration into the soil mm ro is surface runoff mm and δss is the change in surface water storage mm 2 δ v a d e t c l s v s f where δva is the change in the water free pore space air volume of the soil section mm d is subsurface drainage flow mm etc is actual crop evapotranspiration mm ls and vs are lateral and vertical seepage from the soil section mm the δva term can be estimated by assuming δva f δwtd where f is drainable porosity and δwtd is the change in shallow wtd during time δt the drainable porosity which varies with different soil textures was assumed as 0 08 in this study combining and rearranging eqs 1 and 2 yield eq 3 3 p i r r d f δ w t d e t c r o l s v s δ s s n w b c where nwbc is a term lumping non measured water balance components etc ro ls vs and δss mm lateral seepage was found the dominant seepage pathway through drainmod simulation of the field hydrology liu et al 2019 therefore the vs was assumed to be zero in this site the et c can be estimated to be equal to potential et c petc when upward flux from the water table can supply petc the ro and δss were non zero only during and shortly after intense precipitation events thus they were zero when the water table was below the soil surface which was the majority of the experimental period when the two cases above are met simultaneously we can assume that 4 δ w b n w b c p e t c p i r r d f δ w t d p e t c l s where δwb is the water balance term mm it could be used to infer water stress affecting grass growth and the likelihood of seepage existence 2 4 nitrogen balance the n mass balance can be described by eq 5 5 n i n p n f x n w d n d d n u p n d n r o n l s n v o l n d e n δ s n where ni np nfx nwd and ndd are n input from irrigation precipitation biological fixation wet and dry deposition kg n ha 1 nup nd nro nls nvol nden and δsn are n loss through plant uptake subsurface drainage surface runoff lateral seepage ammonia volatilization denitrification and change in n in the soil profile the cd and fd plots were assumed to receive the same amount of n input the nvol from the two treatments should also be similar the nro is usually small since ro rarely occurred in this study according to previous observation burchell et al 2005 and drainmod simulation liu et al 2019 thus nro was ignored in eq 5 additionally no significant difference in soil n content between cd and fd plots was found in 2015 the initial soil n contents were assumed similar for the two plots therefore δsn should also be similar for cd and fd plots so the difference of n losses via subsurface drainage between fd and cd plots could be expressed as 6 δ n d δ n u p δ n l s δ n d e n where δ n d δ n u p δ n l s and δ n d e n are the difference of n loss via d grass uptake ls and denitrification between cd and fd plots kg n ha 1 the δ n l s term was estimated by drainmod predicted lateral seepage liu et al 2019 and measured groundwater n concentration δnden could be estimated from eq 6 2 5 statistical analysis the glimmix procedure sas 2016 was used to assess the significance of the difference between daily cd and fd wtd the mixed or glimmix procedure sas 2016 was used to perform repeated measures anova for flow weighted mean concentrations fwmc of different n species nitrate n an on tn in drainage water and groundwater samples n loading via subsurface drainage and grass n uptake from fd and cd treatments in general treatment fd vs cd was used as fixed effect time was set as repeated factor spatial power or unstructured was used as covariance structure since the time lag was not evenly distributed the population means of flow weighted mean concentration fwmc of n in drainage water for both cd and fd treatments were estimated with the repeated measures anova with 95 confidence limits tukey s method was used as an adjustment to control type i error for pairwise comparison of treatment population means studentized residual plots were checked to verify that assumptions for parametric statistical tests including normality and equal variance were not severely violated if the studentized residual plots were highly skewed logarithmic transformation base 10 a small constant number was included in the logarithmic transformation when the independent value was 0 was applied to the data before performing the repeated measures anova 2 6 estimation of n loss through lateral seepage the drainmod model skaggs 1999 cox et al 1994 skaggs et al 2010 2012b mohammadighavam and klove 2016 was used to simulate the hydrology of the drained field in both fd and cd plots and predict the main components of the water balance including lateral seepage drainmod was calibrated using the four years of measured daily subsurface drainage volume cm per drainage area and water table depths cm the estimated lateral seepage volume from both cd and fd plots were then used in estimating nitrogen loss through lateral seepage nls the volume of predicted lateral seepage in each soil layer fig 2 was estimated through ratio of transmissivity of that layer to the total transmissivity of the whole wetted soil profile groundwater n concentration at shallow medium and deep depths fig 1 were used to estimate n losses from 0 to 112 5 cm 112 5 cm to 175 cm 175 cm to 300 cm below ground respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 precipitation and irrigation yearly precipitation at experimental site ranged from 992 mm 2014 to 1245 mm 2012 which was less than the 30 year normal value 1321 mm fig 3 monthly precipitation varied widely ranging from 14 mm may 2011 to 335 mm august 2011 on average precipitation in june july august and september represented 48 of the annual precipitation fig 3 these summer months are characterized by large storm events sometimes long dry periods and high et the sle was mainly applied from march to november with the only winter application in january 2013 the annual sle application rate ranged from 69 mm 2014 to 145 mm 2011 3 1 2 subsurface drainage the observed subsurface drainage d outflow from cd plots was substantially less compared to fd plots due to the cd management protocol yearly subsurface drainage from fd plots ranged from 245 mm 2011 to 534 mm 2012 for cd plots yearly subsurface drainage varied between 6 mm 2011 and 61 mm 2013 table 1 yearly mean subsurface drainage from fd and cd plots was 426 mm and 29 mm representing 34 8 and only 2 4 of average annual water input respectively p and irr table 1 the large volume of water that did not leave cd plots via the subsurface drainage system may have left the field via other pathways including et ro ls and vs the monthly fd flow exhibited distinct seasonality fig 3 the lowest drainage flow d was consistently observed in april may and june approximately 76 of d occurred in 1st and 3rd quarters of the years the cd flow occurred occasionally for short durations in very wet periods or after drainage outlet was lowered fig 4 average daily fd flow average of fd1 and fd2 ranged from 0 to 29 mm with 75 of daily flows lower than 1 4 mm average daily cd flow ranged from 0 to 8 mm with only 8 9 of daily flows larger than 0 a few incidents of power outage disrupted pumping of the subsurface drainage water at the site these incidents resulted in less drainage volume than what should have been observed for instance hurricane irene contributed 193 mm precipitation on august 27 2011 a power outage occurred on the site until september 15 2011 the precipitation was 335 mm in august and 145 mm in september while the corresponding measured subsurface drainage flows were only 9 1 mm and 114 mm respectively similar power failures occurred 5 times fig 4 subsurface drainage from fd plots in january and february 2014 65 mm and 64 mm were greater than the water inputs at the two instances 62 mm and 52 mm the estimated δv a during this period was 5 6 mm additionally the et and ro in these two months were nearly 0 therefore the differences between water input and fd flow might be a result of inaccurately recorded snow fall or an evidence of fd receiving seepage from a nearby area eq 3 3 1 3 groundwater table the wtd at cd was generally shallower compared to fd treatment the difference in wtd between the two treatments increased during wet periods fig 4 the difference in yearly mean wtd between cd and fd increased from 0 04 m 2011 to 0 19 m and 0 20 m in 2013 and 2014 fig 4 the daily cd wtd was significantly shallower than fd wtd by 0 15 m over the four year study period p 0 001 the wtd response to water input in cd plots was largely depended on the volume of water input the antecedent soil water conditions before precipitation or irrigation and the weir level of the cd treatment following water input the wtd at cd rose to a shallower depth compared to the fd treatment fig 4 this is primarily caused by the difference between the two treatments in the antecedent soil water conditions in other words wtd prior to water input was most often shallower at cd meanwhile drainable porosity was lower when the water table was shallow in addition the water table drawdown rate at cd treatment was considerably slower than the drawdown rate of the water table at fd fig 4 this was mainly due to higher subsurface drainage rates in fd plots fig 4 the wtd at cd and fd tended to be similar during extended dry periods e g january august 26 2011 fig 3 the water table drawdown rates for both treatments increased as the water table got deeper during periods with high pet and or low water input the wtd fell below the drain depths in june july october and november the deepest wtd wtd 1 70 m occurred in june 2011 the drop in the water table level below drain depth in october and november in 2013 and 2014 might indicate the possibility of vs ls or enhanced et by relatively deep rooted tall fescue and ryegrass since the growth rate of the two cool season grass were high in the fall season in contrast wtds were seldom lower than drain level in winter 3 1 4 water balance for cd treatment cumulative δwb were greater than etc in fall 2011 2012 2013 and spring 2014 the four year average δwb in cd plots was 224 mm which was almost 7 times higher than the four year average d 29 1 mm table 1 this suggests the water supply in the field not only more likely meets the et demand but the excess indicates ro and or seepage ls and or vs out of the system in contrast δwb for the fd treatment was less than or equal to 0 in most of the time during 2011 2014 the four year average δwb in fd plots was 167 mm table 1 that means water supply in fd plots may not meet et demand under field conditions vegetation might be subject to drought stress furthermore there is a possibility that fd plots are receiving water through seepage fig 4 interestingly the absolute value of δwb in cd and fd plots were similar it might be possible that water seeps from cd to fd plots underneath the guard drains liu et al 2019 the major pathway for lateral seepage might be a loamy sand layer 135 cm 210 cm below the soil surface below the subsurface drain lines and bottom of the plastic curtains in that area gilliam et al 1979 liu et al 2019 when lateral seepage was considered in a companion hydrological modeling study the agreement between predicted and observed wtd for cd plots ranged from acceptable to excellent the estimated four year reduction of subsurface drainage by cd was 358 mm yr 1 where 96 of the reduced water went to enhanced ls the remaining 4 of reduced subsurface drainage went to increased et and ro as well as the difference of δva and δss liu et al 2019 3 2 nitrogen dynamics 3 2 1 nitrogen inputs nitrogen input from irrigation was primarily in an consists of 71 80 of tn and on forms measured tn concentration in precipitation ranged from 0 45 to 5 62 mg l 1 with a median concentration of 1 30 mg l 1 in 2014 measured wet n deposition was 15 7 kg ha 1 consists of 4 9 kg ha 1 an 8 8 kg ha 1 on and 1 94 kg ha 1 nitrate n estimated n input via wet deposition was 17 1 kg ha 1 19 7 kg ha 1 and 18 1 kg ha 1 in 2011 2012 and 2013 3 2 2 nitrogen losses via subsurface drainage nitrate n was the main n form transported via subsurface drainage fig 5 the estimated population mean epm of nitrate n flow weighted mean concentration fwmc in drainage water was significantly p 0 0004 lower for cd plots 4 10 mg n l 1 compared to fd plots 7 52 mg n l 1 table 2 the epm of tn fwmc was also significantly lower p 0 03 table 2 for the cd plots 6 95 mg n l 1 compared to the fd plots 9 06 mg n l 1 however epm of an and on fwmcs in drainage water for the cd treatment were significantly higher p 0 0001 for both an and on table 2 than the corresponding concentrations for the fd treatment the nitrate n fwmc showed large temporal variations for both cd and fd plots the nitrate n fwmc tended to increase during spring to a peak in early to mid summer then slowly drop down during mid to late summer before increasing again to another peak in early winter the nitrate n fwmc then tended to decrease through the winter until the end of the next spring this pattern was consistent with temporal variation in flow volume as most of the drainage flow occurs during summer and winter highest nitrate n fwmc of fd mostly happened in winter however highest nitrate n fwmc of cd usually occurred in summer after relatively long dry periods followed by large storm events that generated flow in the cd plots fig 5 throughout the study period the nitrate n fwmcs for cd were consistently lower than the corresponding concentrations for fd except for several single events for example mean nitrate n concentration from water samples in cd plots collected on july 13 and 26 2012 as well as august 30 2013 were 5 94 2 05 and 1 56 mg n l 1 higher than that from fd plots respectively the differences in nitrate n concentrations between fd and cd plots increased with time following the same trend of the differences of wtd between fd and cd plots fig 4 compared to fd relatively shallower groundwater table presumably led to the formation of anaerobic zones in the organic carbon rich top soil layers with higher frequency and longer duration enhancing denitrification in cd plots thus the observed decrease in nitrate n concentration for cd plots compared to fd plots was likely due to an increase in denitrification under cd treatment lower nitrate n concentrations in drainage water from cd compared to fd plots were also observed by fausey 2005 in a four year field experiment on a silty clay soil in ohio however several researchers did not observe significant differences of nitrate n concentrations in drainage water between cd and fd treatments wesström et al 2014 lalonde et al 1996 williams et al 2015 moreover poole et al 2018 observed higher nitrate n concentrations at a significant level of α 0 1 p value 0 075 from cd than that of fd in a multi year corn wheat soybean production system on an artificially drained field in eastern north carolina it should be mentioned that none of the cited studies implemented a comparable cd management protocol in terms of maintaining a yearlong shallow control depth the applied an and the mineralized on are nitrified under well aerated soil conditions more frequently occurred anaerobic conditions under cd treatment created unfavorable conditions for the nitrification process myrold 2005 this most likely explains the observed higher an concentration in drainage water for cd treatment since cd drainage events only occurred under shallow water table conditions when saturated flow occurred through the on rich top soil profile more on could be leached during these drainage events moreover flow through the connected macro pores resulting from soil cracks and root channels in the topsoil profile most likely increased on leaching under cd treatment controlled drainage caused a substantial reduction in tn mass loss loading via subsurface drainage nitrate n accounted for 83 6 and 53 4 of tn lost from fd and cd plots respectively table 3 subsurface drain lines in cd plots exported 96 less nitrate n and 94 less tn than corresponding losses from fd plots the huge reduction of n losses from cd plots was due to the large reduction 93 of subsurface drainage flow volume and the significant reduction of nitrate n concentrations the an and on only accounted for 2 9 and 13 5 of tn loading from fd plots and 21 and 25 6 of tn loading from cd plots respectively table 3 the higher percentage of an and on losses from cd plots were mainly due to higher an and on concentrations concentrations of an and on increased rapidly after irrigation n input loadings of n species were affected by timing and amount of nitrogen inputs grass uptake n transformations in the soil profile and drainage flow rates 3 2 3 nitrogen concentration in groundwater the estimated population mean concentration epmc values of nitrate n in groundwater for cd were significantly lower than the concentration values for fd at all three groundwater sampling depths fig 6 table 4 additionally the nitrate n epmc for cd plots decreased sharply from 4 70 mg n l 1 n 56 at shallow sampling depth 0 75 1 0 m to 0 04 mg n l 1 n 74 at medium sampling depth 1 25 1 5 m and then to 0 01 mg n l 1 n 76 at deep sampling depth 2 0 2 25 m in contrast the epmc of nitrate n for fd at the corresponding sampling depths were 17 36 16 39 and 0 06 mg n l 1 for the fd treatment the nitrate n concentrations in groundwater remained high at depths deeper than the subsurface drain for the fd treatment this nitrate enriched groundwater is intercepted by the subsurface drains the near zero nitrate concentration at the deepest sampling well does not affect the nitrate level in drainage outflow since the water table was deeper than the drain depth however the negligible nitrate n concentration in the deep well of both fd and cd plots indicates that surficial groundwater percolating into deeper groundwater and eventually reaching surface waters do not carry nitrate n through this pathway enhanced denitrification might have occurred in cd plots resulting in more n losses through denitrification process in cd plots the tn epmc from the shallow and medium wells of cd were significantly lower than tn concentration at corresponding sampling depths from fd however there was no significant difference between tn concentration values at the deepest wells for both fd and cd plots the tn epmc for both plots declined to lower than 1 5 mg n l 1 the on was the major n form in groundwater at the deepest sampling wells for both cd and fd plots table 4 the an epmc decreased significantly from 0 06 mg n l 1 n 53 in shallow depth to 0 02 mg n l 1 n 72 in medium depth and then increased significantly to 0 18 mg n l 1 n 76 in deep depth for fd plots the an epmc from cd plots was stable in shallow n 56 and medium n 74 depths however it also increased significantly from 0 05 n 74 in medium depth to 0 37 mg n l 1 n 76 in deep depth the an epmc for cd was not significantly different from an concentration for fd at shallow and medium depths however an concentration for deep groundwater well at cd was significantly higher than corresponding concentration for fd the increase of an concentration at the deepest well may have resulted from inhibition of removing an through nitrification and promotion of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra under continuously anaerobic conditions myrold 2005 the on epmc in groundwater for fd decreased significantly from 4 37 mg n l 1 n 53 at shallow depth to 1 12 mg n l 1 n 72 at medium depth and slightly declined to 0 84 mg n l 1 n 76 at deep sampling well the corresponding on concentration for cd decreased significantly from 2 34 n 56 at shallow depth to 0 63 mg n l 1 n 74 at medium depth and then increased significantly to 1 00 mg n l 1 n 76 at deep wells table 4 the observed lower on concentration for cd plots at shallow and medium depths could be attributed to the on mineralization associated with the consumption of dissolved organic carbon doc through enhanced denitrification process this hypothesis also could explain the increase of an at the deeper depths as well 3 2 4 grass biomass yield and nitrogen uptake there was no statistically significant difference between cd and fd oven dried grass yield for most cutting events except on september 10 2012 when the field was very wet under cd treatment table 5 mean n contents of grass samples collected from fd and cd treatments were 2 46 and 2 27 respectively the nitrogen content of grass sampled from fd treatment was significantly higher n 16 p value 0 0270 than that from cd plots nitrogen uptake by grass over each harvest n 9 from may 11 2012 after harvest to september 18 2014 from cd and fd treatments were 58 3 0 4 kg n ha 1 mean standard error and 56 5 0 7 kg n ha 1 respectively higher yearly n uptake from cd plots compared to fd plots were found in 2013 and 2014 drier years table 6 the overall n uptake on cd treatment was 3 2 16 29 kg ha 1 higher compared with fd treatment during the measurement period from may 11 2012 after harvest to september 18 2014 table 6 however the difference was not significant p 0 951 these findings support the hypothesis that cd reduces the rate of downward movement of dissolved nutrients making these nutrients more available for grown plants during dry growing seasons skaggs et al 2012a poole et al 2013 grass n uptake was the major n sink during the four year experiment grass uptake n was close to the crop realistic nitrogen rate for fescue hay 164 8 kg n ha 1 year 1 crouse 2014 in 2013 and 2014 the n uptake in 2011 was still reasonable due to less grass dry matter under drought stress however the n uptake from both cd and fd plots in 2012 were more than the sum of n uptake in 2013 and 2014 part of the reason is due to more sufficient and evenly distributed water supply in 2012 table 1 fig 3 secondly sufficient water supply in summer also promoted the growth and n uptake of warm season grass weeds in the experimental site thirdly the tn input through sle application in 2012 was more than 1 5 times as much as recommended n application rate 330 kg n ha 1 year 1 more n input might led to higher n uptake 3 2 5 nitrogen balance and enhanced denitrification in cd plots the tn losses through lateral seepage ls in cd and fd plots were affected by both ls volume and groundwater tn concentration at different depths of the soil profile both fd and cd plots were source of ls in 2011 the very dry year so nls in 2011 was leaving both treatments to unmanaged surrounding portions of the field fd and cd plots were sink and source respectively of ls during 2012 2014 table 6 the mean nls entering fd plots accounted for less than 4 of nd however the nls leaving cd plots were more than four times as much as nd table 6 in addition nearly 74 7 of total volume of ls in cd plots occurred through a loamy sand layer extending from 135 cm to 210 cm however the corresponding nls only accounted for 30 1 of total nls due to a huge reduction of groundwater nitrate n concentration with depths in cd plots this situation specifically resulted from the presence and location of a highly conductive sand layer in the soil profile if the sand layer where the majority of ls flux occurs was located shallower in the soil profile ls was expected to transport substantially greater n from cd plots to fd this would reduce the actual performance of the cd system for reducing n loss from the drained field yearly nd from fd plots only accounted for 9 9 to 16 8 of tn input percentage of nd from cd plots were even lower ranging from 0 28 to 1 5 of tn input the four year average δ n d was 34 5 kg n ha 1 consists of 0 1 kg n ha 1 δnup 11 3 kg n ha 1 δnls and 23 3 kg n ha 1 δnden from cd plots table 6 the δnden in 2012 was nearly double to triple the values in the rest of years a possible reason might be the wet field condition promoted more nden rather than nup in 2012 from cd plots so the 67 of the reduced tn loading in cd plots was due to enhanced denitrification the four year average reduction of tn output summary of nd and nls in cd plot was still as high as 66 after considering the contribution of nls table 6 the estimated increase in nden caused by cd in 2013 and 2014 was close to and slightly higher than drainmod nii simulated increase in nden caused by cd for a corn field skaggs et al 2012c on a portsmouth soil near this study site however the fertilization amount and soil organic carbon were lower vegetation was different row crop vs pasture and drainage outlet management protocol was less intense than this study site as a result cd in the simulated system caused less reduction in subsurface drainage volume and nitrogen concentration than observed in this study the estimated increase in nden from this study was also higher than predicted by drainmod nii drainmod dssat and rzwqm dssat models for corn soybean production on drained soils in midwestern us negm et al 2017 thorp et al 2008 youssef et al 2018 this is also expected because of the colder weather and the less intense management protocol of cd for row crops compared to our study 4 summary and conclusion a four year 2011 2014 experimental study was carried out to 1 evaluate the performance of controlled drainage for reducing nitrogen losses from a subsurface drained grass field receiving liquid swine lagoon effluent sle in eastern north carolina and 2 investigate the fate of nitrogen that did not drain from the field in response to controlled drainage the site was artificially drained by a set of subsurface drain tubing 1 m deep and spaced 12 5 m apart two treatments replicated twice were implemented controlled drainage cd and free drainage fd drainage outlets of the cd treatment were set at a depth of 36 cm below ground with few exceptions tall fescue and ryegrass were grown on the field site precipitation irrigation groundwater table depth drainage flow rate and oven dried grass biomass yield were measured nitrogen concentrations in precipitation swine lagoon effluent drainage water and groundwater as well as the n content of the oven dried grass biomass samples and soil samples were measured the principal conclusions of this research are summarized as follows controlled drainage significantly reduced drainage flow and tn loading via subsurface drain lines by an average of 397 mm yr 1 93 and 34 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 94 respectively the nitrogen load reduction resulted from reductions in both drainage flow and nitrogen concentration in drainage water drainmod model hydrological simulations indicated that 96 of the reduction in predicted drain flow was attributed to increased ls and the remaining 4 increased et and or ro liu et al 2019 the model prediction was supported by a water balance based on experimental data the nitrogen that did not leave the field via the subsurface drainage system under cd was lost via enhanced denitrification 67 and transported via lateral seepage to adjacent fields 33 considering n transported via ls the 94 apparent n reduction efficiency of cd is reduced to 66 the daily mean cd wtd was significantly shallower than fd wtd by 15 cm the shallower water table likely caused anaerobic conditions to occur more frequently and for longer durations in a fine textured high organic matter soil which enhance denitrification despite the lack of direct measurement of denitrification rates nor the oxidation reduction status of the soil profile both the estimated nitrogen balance and the significant reduction in groundwater nitrate concentration with depth for cd plots provide sufficient evidence for enhanced denitrification under cd it should be emphasized that the performance of cd varies depending on local site conditions including soil properties land slope climate cropping system nutrient management and the design and management of the drainage system this study clearly demonstrates how soil properties and intensity of cd

11096,application of livestock manure has become a principal nutrient source in groundwater and surface water the goal of this research was to investigate the effect of controlled drainage cd on nitrogen n fate and transport for a subsurface drained grass field receiving liquid swine lagoon effluent sle a four year field experiment was conducted on a naturally poorly drained pasture in eastern north carolina the 1 25 ha experimental field was artificially drained by subsurface drains installed at 1 0 m depth and 12 5 m spacing two treatments replicated twice were implemented conventional drainage fd and cd the cd management protocol was more intensive compared to previous studies the drain outlets of cd plot were set at 36 cm below soil surface all year round except several days before irrigation application when water table depth was shallower than 65 cm below surface controlled drainage significantly reduced drainage flow and tn loading via subsurface drain lines by an average of 397 mm yr 1 93 and 34 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 94 respectively drainmod hydrologic simulations indicated that 96 of the reduction in predicted drain flow was attributed to increased lateral seepage the nitrogen that did not drain from the field in response to cd was lost via enhanced denitrification 67 and lateral seepage to adjacent fields 33 this study clearly demonstrated how

require improved drainage the benefits of improved drainage include a dryer soil profile a deeper water table and reduced frequencies of surface ponding runoff and soil erosion poole et al 2013 these conditions favor increasing the rate of sle infiltration application and potential nutrient losses over application of manure is linked to nitrous oxide gas emission bad odor and the transport of n phosphorus and pathogens to ground and surface water larney et al 2011 a conventional or free drainage fd system drains an agricultural field with the same intensity regardless of the actual need for drainage this increases n export via excess drainage to receiving streams controlled drainage cd is a drainage water management dwm practice that has been proposed to reduce n losses from artificially drained agricultural land evans et al 1995 skaggs et al 2012a controlled drainage is implemented using drainage control structures that are installed at drain outlets to vary the levels of these outlets and thus adjust the intensity of drainage according to the agronomic and farming needs skaggs 1999 the required control level of drainage outlets varies during the year and from year to year depending on the cropping system and weather conditions the performance of cd depends upon several factors including climatological conditions soil properties cropping system farming practices drainage system design drain depth and spacing and management protocol of control structures reported n reduction via drain outlets by cd varied over a wide range from 18 to more than 75 skaggs et al 2010 2012a it has been hypothesized that cd reduces n loss from drained cropland via three mechanisms 1 reducing tile drainage flow 2 enhancing denitrification in the soil profile and 3 increasing crop n uptake skaggs et al 2012a poole et al 2013 the reduction in subsurface drainage d flow by cd may be associated with an increase in evapotranspiration et surface runoff ro and both lateral ls and vertical seepage vs long term drainmod simulations indicated that the increase in et by cd would not exceed 10 in most cases skaggs et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 the ls and or vs might have played an important role when an observed reduction in total outflow sum of d and ro by cd exceeds 20 skaggs et al 2010 if ls and or vs occurred nitrogen reduction efficiency of cd might be considerably lower than the measured n reduction via drain outlets understanding the fate of the water and n that did not leave the field via drainage outlets is key to quantifying the actual cd performance for reducing n export from drained agricultural fields drury et al 2009 found greater ro reduced drainage and lower total water loss from cd plots compared with fd plots in a four year experimental study conducted on a clay loam soil in ontario canada sunohara et al 2014 found 50 less drainage higher ls and vs from cd plots compared to fd plots in a four year experiment david et al 2015 suggested that shallow groundwater was moving laterally from cd to fd as they observed an increase in drainage flow from fd system shortly after initiating cd in a two year experiment in illinois moreover the difference between nitrate n concentrations in drainage outflow from fd and cd systems was not significant therefore they suggested no reduction in nitrate n load in cd system drainmod simulation skaggs et al 2012b burchell 2003 poole 2006 negm et al 2017 was performed based on the field measured data to estimate the water loss through lateral seepage from cd plots nitrogen losses through lateral seepage in cd plots were estimated according to the lateral seepage water flux and groundwater nitrogen concentration measured in the field the crop yield increase is associated with an increase in plant n uptake and subsequent decrease in n leaching in the soil profile skaggs et al 2012a poole et al 2013 delbecq et al 2012 and ghane et al 2012 found cd increases corn and soybean yields in the u s midwest by 2 1 9 8 however helmers et al 2012 reported that cd reduced corn yield while soybean yield was not significantly changed cordeiro and ranjan 2012 and woli et al 2010 found no significant difference in crop yields between cd and fd plots the grass yield and nitrogen content were measured during 2011 2014 in this study for estimating the impact of cd on grass nitrogen uptake nitrogen load reduction through decreased drainage volume in cd plots has been widely accepted as an important mechanism however the enhanced denitrification in cd plots could be difficult to identify if there was neither measurement of denitrification indexes e g redox readings nor significant nitrate n concentration reduction in cd treatment most previous researches on cd were carried out on artificially drained fields planted to row crops and receiving inorganic nitrogen fertilizers research investigating the effect of cd on nutrient loss from grass field receiving organic fertilizer is lacking the objectives of this study were to 1 experimentally evaluate the performance of controlled drainage for reducing n loadings from a subsurface drained grass field receiving sle 2 investigate the fate of nitrogen that did not drain from the field in response to controlled drainage 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field and controlled drainage settings a four year experiment 2011 2014 was carried out on a 1 25 ha pasture located in the lower coastal plain of north carolina at the tidewater research station 35 50 47 6 n 76 40 0 58 w fig 1 the soil on the site is a poorly drained cape fear loam with approximately 10 organic matter gilliam et al 1979 there is a loamy sand layer extends from 135 cm to 210 cm below ground surface and an estimated impervious layer at 300 cm below ground surface burchell et al 2005 the field is relatively flat with an average slope of 0 07 the 30 year 1981 2010 normal yearly precipitation is 1321 mm the site receives liquid sle from a 0 4 ha lagoon northeast to the site fig 1 in early 2010 eight 125 m long lateral subsurface drains 10 cm diameter were installed at 1 m depth and 12 5 m spacing all subsurface drains were connected to a non perforated main drain discharging into a sump where drainage water was pumped to a shallow receiving open ditch the subsurface lateral drains were evenly divided into two groups four drains managed in cd mode and four kept in fd mode the outer drains of each group were operated as guard drains to hydraulically isolate the inner experimental drains cd1 and cd2 vs fd1 and fd2 fig 1 additionally plastic liners were buried between the lagoon and the cd plots as well as between fd plots and the south of the field burchell et al 2005 agri drain drainage control structures were installed on each experimental drain line tall fescue festuca arundinacea schreb and perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l were grown on the site realistic plant available nitrogen pan rate is expected to be 164 8 kg ha 1 year 1 with 7 85 ton ha 1 year 1 grass yield for fescue hay in cape fear loam crouse 2014 the recommended pan for this field was 195 kg ha 1 year 1 that is 390 kg ha 1 year 1 of total nitrogen barker 1990 the cd outlets level was kept at 36 cm below soil surface when the water depth at the control structure was shallower than 65 cm three days before sle application drain outlets were lowered by an additional 30 cm drain outlets were reset to 36 cm below soil surface just before irrigation this management strategy aimed at avoiding ro keeping irrigated water in the soil profile for a long enough time to allow for grass uptake promoting denitrification in the saturated zone of the soil profile and preventing nutrient rich wastewater from leaving the field via the drainage system cd outlet level was only lowered twice 74 cm deep during february 27 march 3 2013 and 92 cm deep during november 13 21 2013 during the four year experiment 2 2 data collection a v notch weir inside each control structure was used for drainage flow measurement the stages upstream and downstream of each weir were measured by potentiometers in two still wells connected to the structure campbell scientific cr 200 data loggers were used to store drainage flow data every 10 min and trigger automatic water samplers to collect composite drainage water samples 125 ml is collected in a composite sample bottle for every 0 5 m3 of drainage water passing over the weir in addition to adjusting cd outlet levels all water samples were collected and sampler bottles were emptied just before application of the sle water table depth midway between experimental drain lines was measured every 60 min by u20 13 ft hobo automatic water level loggers hanging in two 5 1 cm diameter pvc monitoring wells fig 1 two sets of groundwater sampling wells were installed near the monitoring wells each set consists of three wells screened at different depths 0 75 1 00 m 1 25 1 50 m and 2 0 2 25 m for shallow medium and deep wells groundwater samples were grabbed monthly in 2011 and biweekly during 2012 2014 precipitation was recorded using two on site hobo tipping bucket automatic rain gauges calibrated with manual measurements precipitation samples were collected since june 2012 nitrogen wet deposition during 2011 2013 was estimated based on mean n concentration in 2014 and precipitation volume in 2011 2013 nitrogen dry deposition was not measured on site swine lagoon effluent was applied based on recommended rates by a sprinkler irrigation system the uniformity of irrigation water was assessed by measuring the average irrigation water depth at 17 manual rain gauges at different locations in the field wastewater in the 17 rain gauges during irrigation was collected for n species concentration measurement additionally lagoon wastewater was sampled several times per year by the tidewater research station for estimating pan drainage water groundwater in three different depths fig 1 precipitation and irrigation samples were analyzed for nitrate n total kjeldahl n tkn and ammonium ammonia n an concentrations analytical procedures were based on epa approved wet chemistry analyses of nutrients usepa 1983 water samples were filtered 1 μm diameter filter for an and nitrate n concentration analysis unfiltered samples were used for tkn concentration analysis the grass was cut three to four times a year mainly during may october the cut grass was air dried for several days before baled and weighed grass samples were collected oven dried at 70 c for three days ground and analyzed for moisture carbon c and n contents the moisture content of grass samples and grass biomass yield from the two treatments were measured separately since june 27 2012 the air dried grass yield from cd and fd plots counted to 29 3 and 28 8 of total yield from the whole field including the undrained south field the air dried grass yield during january 2011 may 2012 was estimated based on the above percentage and the average moisture content 0 504 of all measured grass samples during june 2012 december 2014 2 3 water balance the water balance components for the experimental field were used to investigate the fate of the water that did not leave the field via the drainage system because of cd the water balance for an artificially drained field during a time step δt can be described by eq 1 at the soil surface and eq 2 in the soil profile skaggs et al 2012b 1 p i r r f r o δ s s where p is precipitation mm irr is irrigation mm f is infiltration into the soil mm ro is surface runoff mm and δss is the change in surface water storage mm 2 δ v a d e t c l s v s f where δva is the change in the water free pore space air volume of the soil section mm d is subsurface drainage flow mm etc is actual crop evapotranspiration mm ls and vs are lateral and vertical seepage from the soil section mm the δva term can be estimated by assuming δva f δwtd where f is drainable porosity and δwtd is the change in shallow wtd during time δt the drainable porosity which varies with different soil textures was assumed as 0 08 in this study combining and rearranging eqs 1 and 2 yield eq 3 3 p i r r d f δ w t d e t c r o l s v s δ s s n w b c where nwbc is a term lumping non measured water balance components etc ro ls vs and δss mm lateral seepage was found the dominant seepage pathway through drainmod simulation of the field hydrology liu et al 2019 therefore the vs was assumed to be zero in this site the et c can be estimated to be equal to potential et c petc when upward flux from the water table can supply petc the ro and δss were non zero only during and shortly after intense precipitation events thus they were zero when the water table was below the soil surface which was the majority of the experimental period when the two cases above are met simultaneously we can assume that 4 δ w b n w b c p e t c p i r r d f δ w t d p e t c l s where δwb is the water balance term mm it could be used to infer water stress affecting grass growth and the likelihood of seepage existence 2 4 nitrogen balance the n mass balance can be described by eq 5 5 n i n p n f x n w d n d d n u p n d n r o n l s n v o l n d e n δ s n where ni np nfx nwd and ndd are n input from irrigation precipitation biological fixation wet and dry deposition kg n ha 1 nup nd nro nls nvol nden and δsn are n loss through plant uptake subsurface drainage surface runoff lateral seepage ammonia volatilization denitrification and change in n in the soil profile the cd and fd plots were assumed to receive the same amount of n input the nvol from the two treatments should also be similar the nro is usually small since ro rarely occurred in this study according to previous observation burchell et al 2005 and drainmod simulation liu et al 2019 thus nro was ignored in eq 5 additionally no significant difference in soil n content between cd and fd plots was found in 2015 the initial soil n contents were assumed similar for the two plots therefore δsn should also be similar for cd and fd plots so the difference of n losses via subsurface drainage between fd and cd plots could be expressed as 6 δ n d δ n u p δ n l s δ n d e n where δ n d δ n u p δ n l s and δ n d e n are the difference of n loss via d grass uptake ls and denitrification between cd and fd plots kg n ha 1 the δ n l s term was estimated by drainmod predicted lateral seepage liu et al 2019 and measured groundwater n concentration δnden could be estimated from eq 6 2 5 statistical analysis the glimmix procedure sas 2016 was used to assess the significance of the difference between daily cd and fd wtd the mixed or glimmix procedure sas 2016 was used to perform repeated measures anova for flow weighted mean concentrations fwmc of different n species nitrate n an on tn in drainage water and groundwater samples n loading via subsurface drainage and grass n uptake from fd and cd treatments in general treatment fd vs cd was used as fixed effect time was set as repeated factor spatial power or unstructured was used as covariance structure since the time lag was not evenly distributed the population means of flow weighted mean concentration fwmc of n in drainage water for both cd and fd treatments were estimated with the repeated measures anova with 95 confidence limits tukey s method was used as an adjustment to control type i error for pairwise comparison of treatment population means studentized residual plots were checked to verify that assumptions for parametric statistical tests including normality and equal variance were not severely violated if the studentized residual plots were highly skewed logarithmic transformation base 10 a small constant number was included in the logarithmic transformation when the independent value was 0 was applied to the data before performing the repeated measures anova 2 6 estimation of n loss through lateral seepage the drainmod model skaggs 1999 cox et al 1994 skaggs et al 2010 2012b mohammadighavam and klove 2016 was used to simulate the hydrology of the drained field in both fd and cd plots and predict the main components of the water balance including lateral seepage drainmod was calibrated using the four years of measured daily subsurface drainage volume cm per drainage area and water table depths cm the estimated lateral seepage volume from both cd and fd plots were then used in estimating nitrogen loss through lateral seepage nls the volume of predicted lateral seepage in each soil layer fig 2 was estimated through ratio of transmissivity of that layer to the total transmissivity of the whole wetted soil profile groundwater n concentration at shallow medium and deep depths fig 1 were used to estimate n losses from 0 to 112 5 cm 112 5 cm to 175 cm 175 cm to 300 cm below ground respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 precipitation and irrigation yearly precipitation at experimental site ranged from 992 mm 2014 to 1245 mm 2012 which was less than the 30 year normal value 1321 mm fig 3 monthly precipitation varied widely ranging from 14 mm may 2011 to 335 mm august 2011 on average precipitation in june july august and september represented 48 of the annual precipitation fig 3 these summer months are characterized by large storm events sometimes long dry periods and high et the sle was mainly applied from march to november with the only winter application in january 2013 the annual sle application rate ranged from 69 mm 2014 to 145 mm 2011 3 1 2 subsurface drainage the observed subsurface drainage d outflow from cd plots was substantially less compared to fd plots due to the cd management protocol yearly subsurface drainage from fd plots ranged from 245 mm 2011 to 534 mm 2012 for cd plots yearly subsurface drainage varied between 6 mm 2011 and 61 mm 2013 table 1 yearly mean subsurface drainage from fd and cd plots was 426 mm and 29 mm representing 34 8 and only 2 4 of average annual water input respectively p and irr table 1 the large volume of water that did not leave cd plots via the subsurface drainage system may have left the field via other pathways including et ro ls and vs the monthly fd flow exhibited distinct seasonality fig 3 the lowest drainage flow d was consistently observed in april may and june approximately 76 of d occurred in 1st and 3rd quarters of the years the cd flow occurred occasionally for short durations in very wet periods or after drainage outlet was lowered fig 4 average daily fd flow average of fd1 and fd2 ranged from 0 to 29 mm with 75 of daily flows lower than 1 4 mm average daily cd flow ranged from 0 to 8 mm with only 8 9 of daily flows larger than 0 a few incidents of power outage disrupted pumping of the subsurface drainage water at the site these incidents resulted in less drainage volume than what should have been observed for instance hurricane irene contributed 193 mm precipitation on august 27 2011 a power outage occurred on the site until september 15 2011 the precipitation was 335 mm in august and 145 mm in september while the corresponding measured subsurface drainage flows were only 9 1 mm and 114 mm respectively similar power failures occurred 5 times fig 4 subsurface drainage from fd plots in january and february 2014 65 mm and 64 mm were greater than the water inputs at the two instances 62 mm and 52 mm the estimated δv a during this period was 5 6 mm additionally the et and ro in these two months were nearly 0 therefore the differences between water input and fd flow might be a result of inaccurately recorded snow fall or an evidence of fd receiving seepage from a nearby area eq 3 3 1 3 groundwater table the wtd at cd was generally shallower compared to fd treatment the difference in wtd between the two treatments increased during wet periods fig 4 the difference in yearly mean wtd between cd and fd increased from 0 04 m 2011 to 0 19 m and 0 20 m in 2013 and 2014 fig 4 the daily cd wtd was significantly shallower than fd wtd by 0 15 m over the four year study period p 0 001 the wtd response to water input in cd plots was largely depended on the volume of water input the antecedent soil water conditions before precipitation or irrigation and the weir level of the cd treatment following water input the wtd at cd rose to a shallower depth compared to the fd treatment fig 4 this is primarily caused by the difference between the two treatments in the antecedent soil water conditions in other words wtd prior to water input was most often shallower at cd meanwhile drainable porosity was lower when the water table was shallow in addition the water table drawdown rate at cd treatment was considerably slower than the drawdown rate of the water table at fd fig 4 this was mainly due to higher subsurface drainage rates in fd plots fig 4 the wtd at cd and fd tended to be similar during extended dry periods e g january august 26 2011 fig 3 the water table drawdown rates for both treatments increased as the water table got deeper during periods with high pet and or low water input the wtd fell below the drain depths in june july october and november the deepest wtd wtd 1 70 m occurred in june 2011 the drop in the water table level below drain depth in october and november in 2013 and 2014 might indicate the possibility of vs ls or enhanced et by relatively deep rooted tall fescue and ryegrass since the growth rate of the two cool season grass were high in the fall season in contrast wtds were seldom lower than drain level in winter 3 1 4 water balance for cd treatment cumulative δwb were greater than etc in fall 2011 2012 2013 and spring 2014 the four year average δwb in cd plots was 224 mm which was almost 7 times higher than the four year average d 29 1 mm table 1 this suggests the water supply in the field not only more likely meets the et demand but the excess indicates ro and or seepage ls and or vs out of the system in contrast δwb for the fd treatment was less than or equal to 0 in most of the time during 2011 2014 the four year average δwb in fd plots was 167 mm table 1 that means water supply in fd plots may not meet et demand under field conditions vegetation might be subject to drought stress furthermore there is a possibility that fd plots are receiving water through seepage fig 4 interestingly the absolute value of δwb in cd and fd plots were similar it might be possible that water seeps from cd to fd plots underneath the guard drains liu et al 2019 the major pathway for lateral seepage might be a loamy sand layer 135 cm 210 cm below the soil surface below the subsurface drain lines and bottom of the plastic curtains in that area gilliam et al 1979 liu et al 2019 when lateral seepage was considered in a companion hydrological modeling study the agreement between predicted and observed wtd for cd plots ranged from acceptable to excellent the estimated four year reduction of subsurface drainage by cd was 358 mm yr 1 where 96 of the reduced water went to enhanced ls the remaining 4 of reduced subsurface drainage went to increased et and ro as well as the difference of δva and δss liu et al 2019 3 2 nitrogen dynamics 3 2 1 nitrogen inputs nitrogen input from irrigation was primarily in an consists of 71 80 of tn and on forms measured tn concentration in precipitation ranged from 0 45 to 5 62 mg l 1 with a median concentration of 1 30 mg l 1 in 2014 measured wet n deposition was 15 7 kg ha 1 consists of 4 9 kg ha 1 an 8 8 kg ha 1 on and 1 94 kg ha 1 nitrate n estimated n input via wet deposition was 17 1 kg ha 1 19 7 kg ha 1 and 18 1 kg ha 1 in 2011 2012 and 2013 3 2 2 nitrogen losses via subsurface drainage nitrate n was the main n form transported via subsurface drainage fig 5 the estimated population mean epm of nitrate n flow weighted mean concentration fwmc in drainage water was significantly p 0 0004 lower for cd plots 4 10 mg n l 1 compared to fd plots 7 52 mg n l 1 table 2 the epm of tn fwmc was also significantly lower p 0 03 table 2 for the cd plots 6 95 mg n l 1 compared to the fd plots 9 06 mg n l 1 however epm of an and on fwmcs in drainage water for the cd treatment were significantly higher p 0 0001 for both an and on table 2 than the corresponding concentrations for the fd treatment the nitrate n fwmc showed large temporal variations for both cd and fd plots the nitrate n fwmc tended to increase during spring to a peak in early to mid summer then slowly drop down during mid to late summer before increasing again to another peak in early winter the nitrate n fwmc then tended to decrease through the winter until the end of the next spring this pattern was consistent with temporal variation in flow volume as most of the drainage flow occurs during summer and winter highest nitrate n fwmc of fd mostly happened in winter however highest nitrate n fwmc of cd usually occurred in summer after relatively long dry periods followed by large storm events that generated flow in the cd plots fig 5 throughout the study period the nitrate n fwmcs for cd were consistently lower than the corresponding concentrations for fd except for several single events for example mean nitrate n concentration from water samples in cd plots collected on july 13 and 26 2012 as well as august 30 2013 were 5 94 2 05 and 1 56 mg n l 1 higher than that from fd plots respectively the differences in nitrate n concentrations between fd and cd plots increased with time following the same trend of the differences of wtd between fd and cd plots fig 4 compared to fd relatively shallower groundwater table presumably led to the formation of anaerobic zones in the organic carbon rich top soil layers with higher frequency and longer duration enhancing denitrification in cd plots thus the observed decrease in nitrate n concentration for cd plots compared to fd plots was likely due to an increase in denitrification under cd treatment lower nitrate n concentrations in drainage water from cd compared to fd plots were also observed by fausey 2005 in a four year field experiment on a silty clay soil in ohio however several researchers did not observe significant differences of nitrate n concentrations in drainage water between cd and fd treatments wesström et al 2014 lalonde et al 1996 williams et al 2015 moreover poole et al 2018 observed higher nitrate n concentrations at a significant level of α 0 1 p value 0 075 from cd than that of fd in a multi year corn wheat soybean production system on an artificially drained field in eastern north carolina it should be mentioned that none of the cited studies implemented a comparable cd management protocol in terms of maintaining a yearlong shallow control depth the applied an and the mineralized on are nitrified under well aerated soil conditions more frequently occurred anaerobic conditions under cd treatment created unfavorable conditions for the nitrification process myrold 2005 this most likely explains the observed higher an concentration in drainage water for cd treatment since cd drainage events only occurred under shallow water table conditions when saturated flow occurred through the on rich top soil profile more on could be leached during these drainage events moreover flow through the connected macro pores resulting from soil cracks and root channels in the topsoil profile most likely increased on leaching under cd treatment controlled drainage caused a substantial reduction in tn mass loss loading via subsurface drainage nitrate n accounted for 83 6 and 53 4 of tn lost from fd and cd plots respectively table 3 subsurface drain lines in cd plots exported 96 less nitrate n and 94 less tn than corresponding losses from fd plots the huge reduction of n losses from cd plots was due to the large reduction 93 of subsurface drainage flow volume and the significant reduction of nitrate n concentrations the an and on only accounted for 2 9 and 13 5 of tn loading from fd plots and 21 and 25 6 of tn loading from cd plots respectively table 3 the higher percentage of an and on losses from cd plots were mainly due to higher an and on concentrations concentrations of an and on increased rapidly after irrigation n input loadings of n species were affected by timing and amount of nitrogen inputs grass uptake n transformations in the soil profile and drainage flow rates 3 2 3 nitrogen concentration in groundwater the estimated population mean concentration epmc values of nitrate n in groundwater for cd were significantly lower than the concentration values for fd at all three groundwater sampling depths fig 6 table 4 additionally the nitrate n epmc for cd plots decreased sharply from 4 70 mg n l 1 n 56 at shallow sampling depth 0 75 1 0 m to 0 04 mg n l 1 n 74 at medium sampling depth 1 25 1 5 m and then to 0 01 mg n l 1 n 76 at deep sampling depth 2 0 2 25 m in contrast the epmc of nitrate n for fd at the corresponding sampling depths were 17 36 16 39 and 0 06 mg n l 1 for the fd treatment the nitrate n concentrations in groundwater remained high at depths deeper than the subsurface drain for the fd treatment this nitrate enriched groundwater is intercepted by the subsurface drains the near zero nitrate concentration at the deepest sampling well does not affect the nitrate level in drainage outflow since the water table was deeper than the drain depth however the negligible nitrate n concentration in the deep well of both fd and cd plots indicates that surficial groundwater percolating into deeper groundwater and eventually reaching surface waters do not carry nitrate n through this pathway enhanced denitrification might have occurred in cd plots resulting in more n losses through denitrification process in cd plots the tn epmc from the shallow and medium wells of cd were significantly lower than tn concentration at corresponding sampling depths from fd however there was no significant difference between tn concentration values at the deepest wells for both fd and cd plots the tn epmc for both plots declined to lower than 1 5 mg n l 1 the on was the major n form in groundwater at the deepest sampling wells for both cd and fd plots table 4 the an epmc decreased significantly from 0 06 mg n l 1 n 53 in shallow depth to 0 02 mg n l 1 n 72 in medium depth and then increased significantly to 0 18 mg n l 1 n 76 in deep depth for fd plots the an epmc from cd plots was stable in shallow n 56 and medium n 74 depths however it also increased significantly from 0 05 n 74 in medium depth to 0 37 mg n l 1 n 76 in deep depth the an epmc for cd was not significantly different from an concentration for fd at shallow and medium depths however an concentration for deep groundwater well at cd was significantly higher than corresponding concentration for fd the increase of an concentration at the deepest well may have resulted from inhibition of removing an through nitrification and promotion of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra under continuously anaerobic conditions myrold 2005 the on epmc in groundwater for fd decreased significantly from 4 37 mg n l 1 n 53 at shallow depth to 1 12 mg n l 1 n 72 at medium depth and slightly declined to 0 84 mg n l 1 n 76 at deep sampling well the corresponding on concentration for cd decreased significantly from 2 34 n 56 at shallow depth to 0 63 mg n l 1 n 74 at medium depth and then increased significantly to 1 00 mg n l 1 n 76 at deep wells table 4 the observed lower on concentration for cd plots at shallow and medium depths could be attributed to the on mineralization associated with the consumption of dissolved organic carbon doc through enhanced denitrification process this hypothesis also could explain the increase of an at the deeper depths as well 3 2 4 grass biomass yield and nitrogen uptake there was no statistically significant difference between cd and fd oven dried grass yield for most cutting events except on september 10 2012 when the field was very wet under cd treatment table 5 mean n contents of grass samples collected from fd and cd treatments were 2 46 and 2 27 respectively the nitrogen content of grass sampled from fd treatment was significantly higher n 16 p value 0 0270 than that from cd plots nitrogen uptake by grass over each harvest n 9 from may 11 2012 after harvest to september 18 2014 from cd and fd treatments were 58 3 0 4 kg n ha 1 mean standard error and 56 5 0 7 kg n ha 1 respectively higher yearly n uptake from cd plots compared to fd plots were found in 2013 and 2014 drier years table 6 the overall n uptake on cd treatment was 3 2 16 29 kg ha 1 higher compared with fd treatment during the measurement period from may 11 2012 after harvest to september 18 2014 table 6 however the difference was not significant p 0 951 these findings support the hypothesis that cd reduces the rate of downward movement of dissolved nutrients making these nutrients more available for grown plants during dry growing seasons skaggs et al 2012a poole et al 2013 grass n uptake was the major n sink during the four year experiment grass uptake n was close to the crop realistic nitrogen rate for fescue hay 164 8 kg n ha 1 year 1 crouse 2014 in 2013 and 2014 the n uptake in 2011 was still reasonable due to less grass dry matter under drought stress however the n uptake from both cd and fd plots in 2012 were more than the sum of n uptake in 2013 and 2014 part of the reason is due to more sufficient and evenly distributed water supply in 2012 table 1 fig 3 secondly sufficient water supply in summer also promoted the growth and n uptake of warm season grass weeds in the experimental site thirdly the tn input through sle application in 2012 was more than 1 5 times as much as recommended n application rate 330 kg n ha 1 year 1 more n input might led to higher n uptake 3 2 5 nitrogen balance and enhanced denitrification in cd plots the tn losses through lateral seepage ls in cd and fd plots were affected by both ls volume and groundwater tn concentration at different depths of the soil profile both fd and cd plots were source of ls in 2011 the very dry year so nls in 2011 was leaving both treatments to unmanaged surrounding portions of the field fd and cd plots were sink and source respectively of ls during 2012 2014 table 6 the mean nls entering fd plots accounted for less than 4 of nd however the nls leaving cd plots were more than four times as much as nd table 6 in addition nearly 74 7 of total volume of ls in cd plots occurred through a loamy sand layer extending from 135 cm to 210 cm however the corresponding nls only accounted for 30 1 of total nls due to a huge reduction of groundwater nitrate n concentration with depths in cd plots this situation specifically resulted from the presence and location of a highly conductive sand layer in the soil profile if the sand layer where the majority of ls flux occurs was located shallower in the soil profile ls was expected to transport substantially greater n from cd plots to fd this would reduce the actual performance of the cd system for reducing n loss from the drained field yearly nd from fd plots only accounted for 9 9 to 16 8 of tn input percentage of nd from cd plots were even lower ranging from 0 28 to 1 5 of tn input the four year average δ n d was 34 5 kg n ha 1 consists of 0 1 kg n ha 1 δnup 11 3 kg n ha 1 δnls and 23 3 kg n ha 1 δnden from cd plots table 6 the δnden in 2012 was nearly double to triple the values in the rest of years a possible reason might be the wet field condition promoted more nden rather than nup in 2012 from cd plots so the 67 of the reduced tn loading in cd plots was due to enhanced denitrification the four year average reduction of tn output summary of nd and nls in cd plot was still as high as 66 after considering the contribution of nls table 6 the estimated increase in nden caused by cd in 2013 and 2014 was close to and slightly higher than drainmod nii simulated increase in nden caused by cd for a corn field skaggs et al 2012c on a portsmouth soil near this study site however the fertilization amount and soil organic carbon were lower vegetation was different row crop vs pasture and drainage outlet management protocol was less intense than this study site as a result cd in the simulated system caused less reduction in subsurface drainage volume and nitrogen concentration than observed in this study the estimated increase in nden from this study was also higher than predicted by drainmod nii drainmod dssat and rzwqm dssat models for corn soybean production on drained soils in midwestern us negm et al 2017 thorp et al 2008 youssef et al 2018 this is also expected because of the colder weather and the less intense management protocol of cd for row crops compared to our study 4 summary and conclusion a four year 2011 2014 experimental study was carried out to 1 evaluate the performance of controlled drainage for reducing nitrogen losses from a subsurface drained grass field receiving liquid swine lagoon effluent sle in eastern north carolina and 2 investigate the fate of nitrogen that did not drain from the field in response to controlled drainage the site was artificially drained by a set of subsurface drain tubing 1 m deep and spaced 12 5 m apart two treatments replicated twice were implemented controlled drainage cd and free drainage fd drainage outlets of the cd treatment were set at a depth of 36 cm below ground with few exceptions tall fescue and ryegrass were grown on the field site precipitation irrigation groundwater table depth drainage flow rate and oven dried grass biomass yield were measured nitrogen concentrations in precipitation swine lagoon effluent drainage water and groundwater as well as the n content of the oven dried grass biomass samples and soil samples were measured the principal conclusions of this research are summarized as follows controlled drainage significantly reduced drainage flow and tn loading via subsurface drain lines by an average of 397 mm yr 1 93 and 34 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 94 respectively the nitrogen load reduction resulted from reductions in both drainage flow and nitrogen concentration in drainage water drainmod model hydrological simulations indicated that 96 of the reduction in predicted drain flow was attributed to increased ls and the remaining 4 increased et and or ro liu et al 2019 the model prediction was supported by a water balance based on experimental data the nitrogen that did not leave the field via the subsurface drainage system under cd was lost via enhanced denitrification 67 and transported via lateral seepage to adjacent fields 33 considering n transported via ls the 94 apparent n reduction efficiency of cd is reduced to 66 the daily mean cd wtd was significantly shallower than fd wtd by 15 cm the shallower water table likely caused anaerobic conditions to occur more frequently and for longer durations in a fine textured high organic matter soil which enhance denitrification despite the lack of direct measurement of denitrification rates nor the oxidation reduction status of the soil profile both the estimated nitrogen balance and the significant reduction in groundwater nitrate concentration with depth for cd plots provide sufficient evidence for enhanced denitrification under cd it should be emphasized that the performance of cd varies depending on local site conditions including soil properties land slope climate cropping system nutrient management and the design and management of the drainage system this study clearly demonstrates how soil properties and intensity of cd

11097,this paper examines whether longer training increases farm participation in community managed water user associations in a context where assignment to training duration was not randomized and none of these institutions existed before training began we also examine whether participation is affected when farm managers migrate and leave farm operations to other workers in a context where only managers have been directly trained almost all managers are male and females are increasingly operating farms we collected microdata from 1855 farms in southern tajikistan where farm managers in 40 subdistricts received longer training while those in the other 40 received shorter training these treatment and control subdistricts were selected by constructing propensity scores and matching without replacement to address observable selection effects that may affect assignment to training duration farms were then selected from a census using a stratified random sampling process a difference in difference technique with right hand side covariates is employed where both sets of data were collected after training was completed this choice of econometric methods controls against farm level selection effects but introduces a potential bias due to measurement error longer training has a causal effect on increasing participation in wuas results also demonstrate that when male workers not directly trained operate farms participation is not affected however participation is negatively affected when female workers operate farms these results provide evidence for designing irrigation management programs to target female workers directly in order to strengthen institutions whose success depends on active farm participation keywords participation training gender difference in difference propensity scores tajikistan 1 introduction in tajikistan water user associations wuas are legally mandated to bring publicly provided irrigation water to the farm gate republic of tajikistan 2006 wuas in tajikistan serve dehkan meaning private farms and legally dehkan farms not farmers are eligible members of a wua these wuas are participatory institutions this implies that the participation and cooperation of representatives of member farms is needed for wuas to perform their mandated duty of water delivery successfully beresford 2010 1 1 most irrigation management is participatory globally authors such as das 2014 have commented on the neo liberal policy of the 1990s that encouraged the transfer of irrigation management from state to non state actors namely farmer communities due to issues around improving cost recovery and performance of systems suhardiman and giordano 2014 provide a succinct explanation around the beliefs and evidence that led to such devolution of responsibilities from the state to farmer communities these topics in participatory irrigation are acknowledged but are beyond the scope of this paper the dehkan farm is headed by a manager a legally recognized position that is listed on the title of the dehkan farm the farm title also lists the workers of the farm these are individuals with a legal claim to work on the farm who also have a stake in the outputs of the farm the farm manager and the listed workers typically belong to the same family but not necessarily the same household 2 2 a family is defined as a set of individuals related through blood or through marriage a household is defined as a set of individuals who consume food cooked in the same kitchen the manager is the operator of the farm and represents the farm at the wuas when physically in residence 3 3 when the manager is physically present he is the operator for the farm when the manager is not physically present this could be because either they are deceased or they have migrated to dushanbe or overseas in these cases another member of the farm listed on the title became the operator in cases of migration the name of the manager is not legally changed on the title of the farm the wua law republic of tajikistan 2006 specifies the roles of the members dehkan farms are supposed to pay an irrigation service fee toward the expense of water provision which is levied seasonally and a wua membership fee toward the expenses of wua services provided which is levied annually they are also expected to contribute to uncompensated pre irrigation season repair and maintenance of canals that is coordinated by the wuas through the provision of labour of the workers of the farm listed on the title for the task dehkan farms are encouraged to sign a contract with the wua at the start of the year in the contract water needs are stated for planning purposes representatives of member farms are encouraged to attend wua meetings participation can be assessed by examining these member mandated functions in wuas yakubov 2011 some wuas in tajikistan were created using longer and more gradual training processes 20 24 months in contrast to other wuas that were created with 3 6 months of training consequently the managers of the farms served by such wuas received longer training on how to participate and cooperate with the wua for more successful irrigation management only managers of farms were trained irrespective of the length of training the institutional literature on farmer participation in community based participatory management organizations suggests that longer training can increase the likelihood and extent of participation and cooperation which is needed for such organizations to function successfully yap salinas 1994 kazbekov et al 2009 mukhtarov et al 2015 estimating the impact of longer training using quantitative econometric methods can provide important information to target efforts to strengthen participation and functioning of new institutions 4 4 while estimating the impact of longer training on water delivery is a worthy question the lack of gauges at inlets and outlets to measure water flows in distributary canals and watercourses complicates addressing this question for examples of such work see fernández pacheco et al 2015 however conducting such evaluations in tajikistan is challenging for at least two important reasons first assignment to longer training was not random introducing potential selection bias the second challenge pertains to the establishment of a baseline dehkan farms were created in the mid 2000s through the de collectivization of the soviet era collectives the government enacted the wua law in 2006 and mandated wuas to be responsible for delivering water to farms even so there was no participatory management irrigation organization in place until 2012 the process of creating the wuas only began in 2012 through coordinated international assistance and government policy at the start of the training consequently wuas were not functioning and there were no functional wuas in which farms could participate wuas were established and the managers of the farms were trained in gravity schemes in southern tajikistan the breadbasket of the country by usaid and by the government during 2012 and 2013 managers of farms in wuas created by usaid received 20 24 months of training while those in wuas created by the government received three to six months of training balasubramanya et al 2018 5 5 training was directed only at the managers of the farms not at the listed members of the farm training materials used to establish wuas were developed by usaid in consultation with the government and the same sets of materials were used in all cases the training covered topics pertaining to creating irrigation schedules coordinating routine repair cleaning and maintenance of canals and water courses setting levying and collecting wua membership fees from dehkan farms which is retained by the wua towards its operational costs collecting irrigation fees from dehkan farms and transferring them to the district irrigation department maintaining financial accounts organizing and scheduling meetings of members all wuas were imparted training in these topics using the same set of materials but the duration of time over which the wuas were trained in these topics significantly differed between wuas established by usaid and those established by the government with usaid wuas receiving repeated sets of the same training at regular intervals over the 20 24 month period in all cases the trainers were male and the trainees were dehkan farm managers only managers were trained these trainings were conducted by bringing together managers whose farms were in geographic proximity since 98 of dehkan farm managers are male food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2018 this implies that training in participatory irrigation was overwhelmingly provided to males migration of mostly males to either urban areas or overseas is rather common in tajikistan a study in 2013 estimated that 28 of households had at least one migrant with migration greater in locations with rural and poorer households danzer et al 2013 another study with a study area matching that in this paper estimated that in 2015 48 of rural households in southern tajikistan had at least one migrant buisson et al 2016 a consequence of migration is that farm workers who were not directly trained in participatory irrigation are increasingly operating farms with female farmers 6 6 a study by the world bank in 2016 estimated that 56 of the agricultural work force in tajikistan is female slavchevska et al 2016 constituting an important share of non trained individuals operating farms in this study 21 of farms were operated by women in 2014 which increased to 35 in 2016 whether training can increase participation in circumstances when individuals not directly trained are managing the farm would depend on the diffusion of information from those who were directly trained the farm managers in this case to those who were not trained but are now taking on the role of operating the farm the literature on whether and to whom information diffuses from farmers directly trained and produces associated behavior changes suggests that the evidence is mixed and depends on farmer and farm characteristics of trained and other farmers such as age education social status and connections land size and quality and endowments e g see clausen et al 2017 feder et al 2004 7 7 this literature has focused on pest management seed choice and fertilizer application the diffusion of information to females to encourage participation is also likely to depend on pre existing differences in the endowments capabilities and capacities of males and female e g see agarwal 2006 social structures around age caste and religion e g guijt and shah 1998 local power structures e g cleaver 1998 and bargaining power within the household e g meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 cleaver and elson 1995 however the perceived costs and benefits of participating are also important determinants and are often not given adequate attention van koppen and hussein 2007 meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 this paper examines whether longer training has a causal effect on increasing the probability of member farm participation in wuas in a context where no participatory organization existed before the training began 8 8 a broader and worthy research question is what are the factors that affect participation in wuas papers such as nagrah et al 2016 hu et al 2014 and aydogdu et al 2015 address this question the current paper is not equipped to answer this question since the aim of this paper is to identify the effects of training and gender the study was designed to ensure that subdistricts served by wuas created with longer and shorter training were selected in pairs matched on other factors that affect participation see section 5 2 for more details consequently the tradeoff is that identifying the effects of other factors that also affect participation is beyond the scope of this paper the paper considers a sample of 1855 member farms in 80 subdistricts 9 9 in tajikistan a subdistrict is called a jamoat irrigated by gravity irrigation schemes 10 10 tajikistan also has lift irrigation schemes in these geographies wuas have been established by the world bank wuas in lift irrigation schemes are not part of the current study in southern tajikistan where member farm managers in 40 subdistricts received longer training the treatment group and those in the other 40 subdistricts received shorter training the control group these 80 subdistricts were selected from a population of subdistricts by constructing propensity scores and conducting a 1 1 matching without replacement to control against selection of observable confounders at the sub district level rosenbaum and rubin 1985 member farms in these matched subdistricts were then selected from a census of member farms through a stratified random sampling process to arrive at a representative sample of farms in southern tajikistan since there was no organization for member farms to participate in before the end of the training controlling against selection effects at the farm level entailed using a difference in difference did technique with time varying and time invariant right hand side covariates with data collected in two time periods after the training of managers of member farms was completed balasubramanya et al 2018 11 11 this is in contrast to the standard did approach where one set of observations would have been collected at the time the training commenced and the other after the training was completed this approach introduces a potential bias in the estimated effects of training due to measurement error but controls against selection effects as demonstrated in balasubramanya et al 2018 and explained further in the methodology section of this paper the paper also considers whether participation is affected when the farm is operated by a person who was not trained and whether any effect depends on the gender of that non trained individual this is motivated by the observation that an increasing number of farms 50 in this paper are being operated by individuals male and female who were not directly trained to keep training costs low most training programs train lead farmers managers in this paper anderson and feder 2007 who are often male as is the case in this paper however diffusion of information to vulnerable individuals in the community e g see alesina and la ferrara 2000 and to females e g see kumar and quisumbing 2011 beaman and dillon 2018 has often not been observed when lead male farmers are trained since women s networks are often different than men s das 2014 mayoux 1995 agarwal 2006 p 284 in the context of tajikistan almost everyone who was trained was male irrigation was historically regarded as a man s job the realities of high male outmigration imply that those who were trained are decreasingly managing their farms and the agricultural workforce is getting feminized mukhamedova and wegerich 2018 in these circumstances an understanding of how participation is affected when untrained males and females operate farms can provide information for redesigning training in participatory irrigation to suit the needs of the workforce and to strengthen functioning of irrigation management the context of the participatory irrigation intervention renders the application of other methods of establishing causal effects impossible using a method of synthetic controls abadie and gardeazabal 2003 was not possible due to the non existence of data on participation from before the starting of the training using experimental methods tellez foster et al 2017 was not possible due to the non strategic setting since data on subdistricts were available they were used to select matched pairs of treatment and control clusters in order to control for selection on observable confounders this modified did technique with the inclusion of time varying right hand side covariates controls for selection on time invariant and time variant unobservable confounders this paper contributes to the literature in three ways first rather than using cross sectional data e g nagrah et al 2016 qiao et al 2009 or conducting qualitative analysis e g aydogdu et al 2015 to analyze participation panel data are used these data control for several types of selection effects and generate evidence needed for adaptive management and targeted investments in the early years of institutions whose success depends on member participation the second contribution is to understand how participation and thus the functioning of these participatory institutions is likely to be affected as the gender composition of the agricultural workforce changes due to labor market adjustments the third contribution is to contextualize the results presented in balasubramanya et al 2018 that examined the effects of longer training on wuas performance of mandated functions that paper demonstrated that wuas with longer training were able to recover membership fees from 19 more members and were 10 more likely to hold meetings with members for planning purposes the current paper uses a different primary dataset that was collected using a different study design that was specifically tailored for testing the effects of training duration and other determinants of farm participation such as gender the results in this paper demonstrate that dehkan farms whose managers received longer training are 8 more likely to pay their membership fees 20 more likely to sign a water contract with the wua and 9 more likely to attend the wua meetings dehkan farms whose managers received longer training contributed seven more person days of labor towards routine pre irrigation repair and maintenance of canals participation was not affected when the farm was operated by a male worker who was not directly trained however participation was negatively affected when the farm was operated by a female with such farms 9 less likely to pay their membership fees than farms operated by males 11 less likely to sign a water contract and 3 less likely to attend the wua meetings a limitation of the paper is that it is not possible to test formally whether participation outcomes for farms with longer and shorter training would have changed in the absence of the intervention this is because participatory organizations with longer and shorter training came into existence at the same time 2012 which coincides with the commencement of the intervention under consideration in this paper before 2012 no participatory water management institutions existed and consequently pre 2012 participation data do not exist the choice of methods in the paper is based on the observation that standard methods to control for selection effects cannot be readily employed on this context the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a context for how participatory wuas evolved in tajikistan section 3 presents a conceptual framework and reviews literature concerning length of training and participation in wuas globally and in central asia along with literature on the diffusion of information from trained to other farmers section 4 describes the methodology while section 5 presents the study design and section 6 contains details on data summary statistics and results are presented in section 7 section 8 aggregates the results and discusses them in relation to the existing literature and the evaluation of participatory institutions 2 evolution of participatory water user associations in tajikistan within the former soviet union tajikistan was designated as central asia s main hub of cotton cultivation which was practiced on collective farms food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2012 only 4 of the land in tajikistan is agricultural with 95 of crop cultivation on irrigated land food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2012 southern tajikistan is the most populous part of the country where cotton and wheat production are dominant wuas were created in tajikistan in response to the de collectivization of the collective farms into dehkan private farms which began in the mid 2000s with the departure of russian irrigation specialists and the lack of soviet subsidies irrigation departments called vodkhozes were not able to deal with the challenge of providing water to thousands of private farms gunchinmaa and yakubov 2009 shahriari 2009 the government enacted the wua law republic of tajikistan 2006 and named the wua as the institution responsible for delivering water to the farms international assistance for creating these organizations was requested wuas were piloted by several international organizations and a countrywide program to create new wuas gained momentum in 2011 more than 300 wuas are now functional in tajikistan with the service area typically in the range of 1400 ha to 1600 ha balasubramanya et al 2016 all wuas require their member farms participation and cooperation for irrigation service delivery participatory governance and civic engagement are not new to tajikistan cieslewska 2010 for instance even though state directed institutions dominated the agriculture and water sectors during the soviet era o hara 2000 traditional neighbourhood mahalla councils which were elected by the households in the neighbourhood played an important though informal role in addressing local problems including water related disputes in the community such neighbourhood councils continue to play an important role today 3 conceptual framework 3 1 participation in community managed resource systems key among ostrom 1990 eight principles for managing subtractable common pool resources is the concept of participation and the arrangements that facilitate such participation participation is viewed as a way of reconnecting disengaged citizens with the decision making process in contexts of democratic deficit pratchett 1999 619 as well as improving the quality of those decisions martin 2009 beyond mere participation gurung 1992 32 states how it is important that users abide by the terms of agreement before during and after the implementation process of the participatory management program the collective management of common pool resources such as water critically depends on users continuously following the rules cleaver 1999 among decentralized participatory institutions such as wuas external professionals may deploy an enabling logic but the users in fact perform the service task for themselves bovaird et al 2015 for example wuas coordinate routine cleaning and repair of irrigation canals before the start of the irrigation season but member farms must contribute labour of the workers of the farm in order to improve irrigation service delivery for all member farms accordingly users may be viewed as being in partnership with their organizations as they participate to co produce services beresford 2010 3 2 training members in participatory management in the literature on institutional reform and service provision it has become widely accepted that participation of users is required for institutions to be fully effective bovaird et al 2015 however when newly established members of participatory institutions such as managers of member farms in the case of wuas may need training to comprehend how they need to participate and cooperate with the institution nagrah et al 2016 since these new water users may be constrained in participating and cooperating effectively due to a lack of knowledge hu et al 2014 the length of the training period provided can be an important variable determining user participation yap salinas 1994 for example nagrah et al 2016 note that without a sufficiently long period of training farmers in pakistan may not be ready or even interested in the task of participating in a wua and following its rules in turkey aydogdu et al 2015 found that farmers lacked sufficient knowledge regarding wuas and needed more training to perform the wua functions independently in contrast a high degree of understanding about water user associations was found to be an important factor determining respondents satisfaction based on surveys in inner mongolia qiao et al 2009 822 concerning post soviet states with a similar recent history to tajikistan service user satisfaction and willingness to pay among armenian wuas was compromised by insufficient unreliable and untimely delivery of water due in part to inadequate training of wuas and their users alaverdyan and houston 2004 11 in kyrgyzstan improved water delivery was brought about after a lengthy four year period of training encouraged member participation johnson and stoutjesdijk 2008 311 by contrast training time was limited or nonspecific in uzbekistan leading to poor rates of payment of fees and participation in wua governance wegerich 2000 3 3 gender and irrigation the inclusion on women in water policy emerged as part of a broader change in neoliberal policy that called for local approach and people s participation in water planning and management in part to increase cost recovery of projects and improve design and delivery of services zwarteveen et al 2012 das 2014 whittington 1998 in the domestic water sector the rational for females participating was that women stood to gain from reductions in time and effort spent collecting water for domestic purposes najlis and edwards 1991 the empirical evidence on women s participation in rural water supply schemes has been mixed for example narayan 1995 found that only 17 of 121 such projects in 47 developing countries had achieved a high level of female participation reasons for low female participation included pre existing differences in endowments social norms perceptions local power structures and division of labor and bargaining power within the household e g see agarwal 2006 guijt and shah 1998 cleaver 1998 meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 singh et al 2005 das 2014 in the irrigation sector meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 have noted that women s participation in wuas in south asia was rather low despite being heavily involved in agricultural activities reasons for low participation included membership rules often based on land ownership which is usually in the man s name and high opportunity costs of women s time van koppen and hussein 2007 have pointed that women s involvement in irrigation depends on whether the system is a dual female farming system or a male farming system where men are the breadwinners and whether irrigation projects incorporate multiple uses of water to include drinking and domestic water use while not the focus of this paper these factors suggest that women s participation varies across geographies and cases and is dependent on the perceived costs and benefits from participation 3 4 migration agriculture and gender rapid changes in the gender composition of the agricultural work force can change the roles of women in agriculture specifically pertaining to labor allocation and decision making these changes occur due to changes in household labor availability and cash income sources zimmerer 1993 taylor and dyer 2006 gray 2009 for example van rooij 2000 finds that migration improved the purchasing power of households to hire labor thus reducing women s effort in contrast sadiqi and ennaji 2004 found that women in migrant households in morocco reported an increase in workloads the same authors found improvements in female autonomy and decision making by expanding the set of roles as did taylor et al 2007 in guatemala however paris et al 2005 found reduced autonomy and decision making among migrant households in india due to increased burden of work the effects of the roles of women depend on the type of migration type of household access to land and livestock holdings family structures and size of remittances maharjan et al 2012 paris et al 2005 desai and banerji 2008 gray 2009 for example maharjan et al 2012 note that in households with high remittances women experienced reductions in physical burden and improvements in decision making while those in households with low remittances experienced the opposite effects in contexts such as tajikistan where cotton wheat systems were historically male systems van koppen and hussein 2007 a rapid and drastic feminization of the dehkan farm production system due to high rates of male outmigration presents an interesting case mukhamedova and wegerich 2018 found that despite dehkan farms being male systems gender based occupational segregation were being challenged in tajikistan with women stepping into roles that men traditionally performed including irrigation despite the high opportunity costs of women s time and the pre existing cultural barriers that might hinder such changes 3 5 diffusion of information from trained farmers to other men and women farmer training programs are typically designed to improve performance by providing technical information to increase human capital anderson and feder 2004 since farmers often rely on other farmers for information about agricultural practices rees 2000 such programs usually train head farmers or village heads who in turn share that technical information with other farmers anderson and feder 2007 this also keep costs of programs low feder et al 2004 the literature on whether information diffuses from directly trained farmers to other farmers and encourages changes in behaviors usually regards farmers as ungendered 12 12 this might be because these farming systems are predominantly single sex however gender roles in agiculture are changing across the globe world bank 2016 and the evidence on diffusion is mixed for example feder et al 2004 found that while indonesian farmers directly trained in pest management reduced pesticide use farmers not directly trained did not experience an improvement in either knowledge or a reduction in pesticide use in contrast in uganda clausen et al 2017 found that farmers directly trained in pest management were also able to reduce the pesticide use of neighboring farmers these differences in diffusion of information and associated changes in behaviors are likely to depend on several factors the complexity of the knowledge to be shared e g rola et al 2002 and the strength of interpersonal networks e g tripp et al 2005 are two such factors also important are the social status of persons chosen for training e g see pemsl et al 2006 and idiosyncratic characteristics of farmers and their farms e g fuglie and kascak 2001 in addition to the factors discussed in 3 3 and 3 4 diffusion of information to women is likely to depend upon whether those who were trained are part of women s networks which are often distinct from men s networks mayoux 1995 das 2014 using low cost options to diffuse information which often involves using pre existing networks may have unfortunate distributional consequences for diffusion of information to women for example beaman and dillon 2018 find that when the information on composting is spread using existing social networks in mali where networks are among lead male farmers less influential farmers and female farmers in particular lose out on receiving valuable information within a household the diffusion of information is likely to depend on factors that were discussed in section 3 3 male migration could change the information that is shared within the household with women if the roles of women are likely to change however the same factors such as family structures relative bargaining power social norms and power structures may prevent women from gaining information even when they need to have it in order to undertake new roles 3 6 hypotheses the paper considers member mandated functions as specified in the wua law republic of tajikistan 2006 and introduces a number of hypotheses regarding the effects of longer training on these indicators a list of indicators is provided in table 1 a irrigation fees longer training is expected to increase the probability of a farm paying the seasonal irrigation fees b wua membership fees longer training is expected to increase the probability of a farm paying its annual membership fees c participation in pre irrigation cleaning of canals longer training is expected to increase the number of person days of labor that the member farm contributes towards cleaning d legal relations longer training is expected to increase the probability of a farm signing a contract with a wua and is expected to increase the probability of the manager or listed worker of a farm attending a wua meeting training in tajikistan was imparted to managers lead farmers almost all of whom are male irrigation was historically viewed as a man s job especially on cotton wheat cultivating dehkan farms since migration has led to the departure of males and females have expanded their roles intra household sharing of information may have changed to equip women to execute the job that men were traditionally undertaking however the fact that all those who were trained were male coupled with pre existing social norms and women s relative socioeconomic status may hamper the extent to which such information is transferred from men and received by women consequently participation is not expected to be affected when non trained males operate the farm but participation is expected to be lower when females operate the farm 4 methodology consider the following equation 1 y j t μ γ s j θ t ω s j t β x j t ϑ j t where y j t refers to a participation indicator for farm j at time t s j is a categorical variable that denotes the treatment status of farm j with s j 1 if the farm manager received longer training and s j 0 if the manager received shorter training the variable ω reports the causal effect of longer training on participation x j t refers to a set of farm specific covariates at time t that might also influence y j t ϑ j t is the error term 13 13 the error structure is assumed to follow e ϑ j t s j t 0 s j t this is because the identifying assumption is that by explicitly accounting for the errors are uncorrelated with s t and t the difference in difference did technique identifies the causal effect of longer training by comparing the average change in participation over a time period for the treatment group to that for the control group while controlling for differences at the starting points and common time trends typically the did technique would be executed by collecting data on participation and other covariates from farms first at the start of the training i e when t 0 and again at some time t 0 after training was completed thus creating a panel dataset therefore the standard did technique assumes that both treatment and control groups were participating even before the training began that is y j t 0 when t 0 allowing for a pre training comparison of trends in outcomes between the two groups under this condition called the standard condition the did technique eliminates time invariant unobservable selection effects μ in eq 1 such as any farm specific area specific or agency specific fixed effects that are constant over time but may drive differences in level of participation and provides an unbiased estimate of ω however if participation indicators take values of zero in the pre intervention period y j t 0 t 0 then there are no pre intervention trends to compare in the case of tajikistan there were no participatory institutions for farms to participate in before training began in the area under study if the did technique were implemented by collecting the first set of data on participation and covariates at the start of the training when y j 0 0 for all farms and by collecting the next set of data at some time t 0 for all farms where y j t 0 for all farms then this would mathematically be equivalent to using cross sectional data rather than panel data under this condition the did technique would not be able to eliminate the time invariant unobservable selection effects μ and would provide a biased estimate of ω since the case of tajikistan imposes the condition where for all farms y j t 0 t 0 the difference in difference estimator is used in a modified setting where both the first and the second sets of data are collected in time periods after the training was completed this modification of standard practice eliminates bias in the estimation of ω due to time invariant unobservable selection effects μ but introduces a potential bias due to measurement error however the magnitude of any bias due to measurement error is reduced to zero as the first set of data is collected closer to the time when training commenced i e closer to t 0 therefore collecting the first set of data as close as possible to t 0 would minimize bias due to this measurement error while also eliminating bias due to time invariant unobservable selection effects μ a mathematical proof of the elimination of bias due to these unobservable selection effects μ and a minimization of the bias due to measurement error as the first set of data is collected closer to the time when training commences can be found in balasubramanya et al 2018 apart from time invariant unobservable selection effects there may be time varying unobservable selection effects that also bias the estimation of ω these are controlled for by including a host of farm specific time varying covariates x j t on the right hand side of the modified did equation as demonstrated in balasubramanya et al 2018 5 study design 5 1 determining sample size number of clusters and number of observations per cluster a wua usually provides water to member farms in one or two subdistricts 14 14 it is unlikely that a dehkan farm is not a member of a wua wuas have been created across all gravity schemes in southern tajikistan and data collected from wuas in a separate study demonstrate that all farms in the command area are member farms balasubramanya et al 2016 enabling each subdistrict to be classified as either a treatment subdistrict where farm managers received longer training or a control subdistrict where farm managers received shorter training power calculations were conducted to determine the number of treatment and control subdistricts the number of observations within a subdistrict and the sample size the minimum detectable effect mde size was calculated using the formula 2 m d e 2 487 σ y 1 r 2 1 ρ 1 a t b t 1 a c b c ρ 1 a t 1 a c in eq 2 a c and a t represent the number of control and treatment subdistricts and b c and b t represent the number of member farms per subdistrict the variable σ y is the standard deviation of the outcome variable and the variable ρ refers to the intra subdistrict correlation associated with that outcome variable r 2 is the coefficient of determination outcome variables and their means standard deviations σ y and intra subdistrict correlations ρ were taken from the tajikistan living standards measurement survey t lsms world bank 2003 15 15 the t lsms 2003 was preferred to the t lsms from 2007 and 2009 due to a larger sample of rural households in the agricultural provinces the coefficient of determination and the level of confidence were set at conventional rates of 0 8 and 0 95 respectively two outcome variables from the t lsms database were used as proxies for the range of indicators to be assessed these were proportion of farms that irrigated their agricultural plot and proportion of farms that believed their plot received adequate water supply a sensitivity analysis was subsequently carried out by varying the number of control and treatment subdistricts respectively a c and a t the number of member farms per subdistrict b c and b t and the sample size results using the proportion of farms that irrigated their agricultural plot are reported in figs 1 and 2 for a given sample size the mde is smaller as the number of clusters in the sample increases fig 2 and as the number of observations per cluster in the sample decreases fig 2 a study design of 40 treatment and 40 control subdistricts with 25 farms per subdistrict emerged suitable the mde for this study design is an increase of 10 in the proportion of households irrigating their plots and an increase of 6 in the proportion of households that felt that their plots had adequate water for the design of 40 treatment and 40 control clusters the mde falls as the sample size increases i e the number of observations per cluster increases but the change in the mde is rather small fig 3 16 16 results from using the proportion of households that believed their plot received adequate water supply are also similar 5 2 selecting the clusters since assignment to longer training was not random treatment and control subdistricts to be sampled in this assessment were selected by constructing propensity scores and then using a 1 1 matching process without replacement to select matched pairs of treatment and control subdistricts a pre sampling survey of all subdistricts where irrigated cultivation of wheat and cotton was practiced 164 of the 406 subdistricts was conducted of the164 subdistricts 116 were in khatlon province 21 in sughd province and 27 in drs province information on demographic attributes agricultural practices land use and farm attributes and irrigation infrastructure was collected propensity scores were constructed to calculate the probability of each subdistrict being treated i e where farm managers received longer training a complete list of attributes that were used to construct the propensity scores and the model of treatment can be found in table 2 17 17 the propensity score also takes into account ethnic composition of subdistricts the number of rural health centers and schools and the number of agricultural markets in the subdistrict it also takes into account whether land reforms have been completed and the number of years of tenure of the current subdistrict leader these could affect selection into treatment and hence were accounted for while selecting the treated and control groups using the propensity scores subdistricts with farms whose managers received longer training were matched using a caliper size of 0 12 to subdistricts with farms whose managers received shorter training without replacement to their nearest neighbor 1 1 match to select 40 subdistricts of each type the differences between the subdistrict attributes for unmatched and matched subdistricts is displayed in table 3 when unmatched treatment and control subdistricts displayed significant differences on a number of attributes these differences did not emerge for the matched pairs 5 3 selecting dehkan farms records of the population of dehkan farms were not available in any government office at the national level therefore a census of all dehkan farms in the 80 selected subdistricts was undertaken by the research team information on the name of the farm and the name of the manager of the farm was collected in addition farms were categorized on two key variables the type of canal from which the farm was irrigated primary secondary or tertiary and the farm s location on that canal head middle or tail these two variables affect water availability at the farm level and may influence participation for example managers of farms located on the tail of a tertiary canal may be more inclined to attend wua meetings because their access to water is deeply dependent on the actions of farmers at the head on the other hand these managers may be less likely to pay the irrigation fees if they perceive that they are unlikely to receive water anyway a stratified random sampling method using these two characteristics was used to select 25 dehkan farms from each of the 80 selected subdistricts totaling 2000 farms this process randomly selects the nine types of farms in proportion to their numbers in the population producing a representative sample of farms in each subdistrict 5 4 clustering the sample was selected by first selecting clusters subdistricts and then selecting farms within each cluster consequently the econometric analysis of the data in the paper has been conducted by clustering results at the sub district level to account for the fact than two farms within the same cluster are likely to be more similar than two farms in different clusters 6 data a panel data set was collected through surveys conducted with the 2000 farms the first survey was conducted in 2015 to collect information on the 2014 calendar year the second survey was conducted in 2017 to collect information about the 2016 calendar year 6 1 respondent both surveys were targeted at the farm managers since they are the operators of the farms and had received the training however this was often not possible due to overseas or rural to urban male migration for the first survey if the manager had not migrated and was in residence during 2014 2015 the manager was interviewed 18 18 we did not find any case where the manager who was trained was in residence but was not the operator of the farm if the manager was not in residence during 2014 2015 the listed worker of the farm who had taken on the operations of the farm was interviewed for the second survey if the respondent of the first survey was still in residence they were interviewed 19 19 we did not find any cases where the respondent of the first survey was still in residence and was not the prime operator of the farm if the respondent of the first survey had migrated then the person who had taken on the operations of the farm was interviewed interviews were scheduled in advance to check whether the person who had answered the first survey was available and to coordinate with the new operator when needed data were also collected on the gender of the respondent who was the operator of the farm for that calendar year 6 2 attrition between first and second survey in the first survey respondents from 1957 of the 2000 member farms agreed to participate in the study and were consequently interviewed the second survey was answered by 1855 of the 1957 member farms using data collected from the first survey no statistically significant differences were observed between farms in the treatment and control group within the subsample of 102 member farms that did not answer the second survey the primary reason that these member farms could not be surveyed again was because production on these dehkan farms had ceased after the first survey and before the implementation of the second survey most often due to male migration 6 3 final sample data pertaining to 1855 member farms are used in the analysis with 933 farms whose managers received longer training treatment group and 922 farms whose managers received shorter training control group 6 4 left hand side variables indicators pertaining to member farm participation were constructed to reflect the roles as delineated in the wua law of 2006 respondents were asked if the farm has paid its irrigation fees and its wua membership dues for the calendar year respondents were also asked to report on the number of listed workers of the farm who had participated in canal cleaning and the number of days of labor each of those workers had contributed in order to calculate person days of labor that the farm had contributed towards repair and maintenance finally respondents were asked if the farm had a signed a contract with the wua for the calendar year and if the farm had been represented at the wua planning meetings in the calendar year data on these indicators were collected in both surveys 6 5 right hand side variables data on farm membership size and demographics cotton acreage and cultivation of other crops were collected these data were also elicited in both surveys table 4 provides summary statistics for these key variables in 2014 a male who was not directly trained operated 30 of farms in the treatment group and 35 of farms in the control group in 2016 males who were not directly trained operated 29 of farms in the treatment group and 31 of farms in the control group regarding the gender of the farm operator females operated 10 of the treatment group farms and 11 of the control group farms in 2014 for 2016 these values changed to 16 and 19 for treatment group and control group respectively the number of listed workers of the farm did not change significantly within and between groups across years they fell from 7 workers to 6 workers for the treatment group and from 8 workers to 7 workers for the control group the gender composition of the workers of the farm listed on the farm title changed within and between groups while 46 and 48 of listed farm workers in the treatment and control groups during 2014 were female 53 and 51 of listed farm workers in the treatment and control groups during 2016 were female their difference in difference 53 46 51 48 is 4 and is significant at 5 the share of workers of the farm listed on the farm title spending the majority of their working time on the farm increased within both groups but not between groups while 79 of listed farm workers in the treatment group and 72 of listed farm workers in the control group worked a majority of their time on the farm during 2014 these increased later to 87 and 82 for the treatment and control groups respectively the number of households associated with the member farms did not change staying at around three households for both groups during both surveys the area of land covered by the title of the member farms also did not change much between the two surveys for both groups this is because rental markets for land are not well developed in tajikistan 20 20 in the first survey the per farm land rented was 0 14 ha for the treatment group and 0 13 ha for the control group in the second survey these numbers were 0 15 ha and 0 09 ha for the treatment and control group respectively the cultivated area of the member farms did not significantly change within and between the two groups over the two surveys in 2014 the treatment group cultivated 4 19 ha per member farm on average and the control group cultivated 4 43 ha these changed to 4 01 ha and 4 48 ha in 2016 for the treatment and control group respectively irrigated area of the member farms also did not significantly change within and between the two groups in 2014 the treated group irrigated 4 15 ha and the control group irrigated 4 05 ha on average these changed to 3 95 ha and 4 18 ha in 2016 the share of member farms cultivating cotton remained the same within each group in 2014 67 of treatment member farms and 47 of control member farms cultivated cotton and in 2016 these changed to 70 of treatment member farms and 49 of control member farms the area under cotton cultivation also remained the same between both within and between the groups in 2014 the treatment member farms cultivated 3 27 ha of cotton on average and the control member farms cultivated 3 95 ha of cotton on average in 2016 the treatment member farms were cultivating 3 18 ha of cotton while the control member farms were cultivating 3 81 ha of cotton on average the following variables were only measured during the first survey because they either changed at the same rate over time for both groups or were time invariant treatment and control member farms were of the similar age with treatment member farms 4 83 years old standard deviation sd 0 32 in 2015 and control member farms around 5 63 years old in 2015 sd 0 47 the average treatment member farm was 1 75 km away from the nearest road sd 0 27 while the average control member farm was 2 03 km away sd 0 33 the age of the member farm manager was similar for both groups with managers around 48 years of age in 2015 standard deviation of 0 43 and 0 48 for the treatment and control group respectively the treatment group had a slightly higher share of member farm managers who had completed secondary education with 29 as compared to 24 for the control group these variables were also included on the right hand side of the difference in difference estimating equations but the estimated coefficients are not reported in the paper because being time invariant they are eliminated by the difference in difference technique during estimation 7 results 7 1 causal effects of longer training on participation and cooperation member farms whose managers were provided with longer training were 8 more likely to pay their membership fees than member farms whose managers were provided with shorter training p 0 10 table 5 member farms receiving longer training contributed seven more person days of labor per member farm p 0 01 towards pre irrigation season cleaning of canals were 19 more likely to have signed a contract with their wuas p 0 01 and 9 more likely to attend the wua meetings p 0 05 the coefficients of determination r squared in these regressions are low because these are not ordinary least squares regressions with cross sectional data since these regressions are difference in differences fixed effects using panel data which is clustered at the subdistrict the f statistic is a more reliable indicator of explanatory power these values are below 0 1 for the regressions where the effect of training is positive and significant at the usual levels 7 2 effect on participation when farm was operated by non trained male worker the likelihood of a farm paying its irrigation fees wua membership fees signing a contract with the wua and being represented at wua planning meetings was not affected when the farm was operated by a non trained male worker table 5 however when the farm was operated by a male worker who had not been directly trained that farm contributed two fewer man days of labor than when the farm was operated by the manager who had been directly trained p 0 1 table 5 while shortages of labor may be an explanation a negative effect is not observed when farms are operated by females which usually happens when males migrated see section 7 3 below 21 21 all regressions including the one pertaining to contribution of man days of labor include the number of farm members the share of members that work permanently on the farm and the share of members that are female to control for changes in labor and gender composition none of these is significant in column 3 of table 5 7 3 effect on participation when farm was operated by non trained female worker the gender of the operator of the farm was significant in determining participation as seen in table 5 a farm operated by a female worker who were not trained because only managers were trained and almost all managers are male was 9 less likely to pay its membership fees p 0 01 11 less likely to sign a contract p 0 05 and 3 less likely to attend wua meetings p 0 1 22 22 the negative effect of female farm management on participation does not depend on the length of training interacting the female operator variable with longer training and including it in all regressions does not appear significant at 10 and the magnitude and significance on the longer training variable remains the same whether this interaction term is included or not 8 discussion in countries such as tajikistan formal participatory institutions for irrigation are being newly developed after the state control era of the soviet union participatory irrigation required members to participate so that irrigation services can be generated for all if an important share of members do not participate that compromises the delivery of irrigation services even for those who do participate a classic collective action problem while training in participation is usually provided to lead farmers who are often male managers in the case of tajikistan larger macroeconomic and labor market forces are changing gender based roles in agriculture understanding the role of the length of training in enhancing participation in wuas and examining whether participation is lower when farms are managed by non trained female workers is important to understand whether program design and policymaking can have a role to play in increasing participation so that the irrigation system can continue to function and deliver services for all members such evidence is often hard to generate due to methodological challenges quantitative assessments of participation in newly created community management institutions is challenging because control groups and baselines are often difficult to identify selection into participatory organizations is not random complicating the isolation of causal effects from observable and unobservable confounders further when participatory institutions are created for the first time all participation variables take values of zero at baseline because the intervention also created the notion of membership further complicating the elimination of unobservable confounders in this paper these methodological challenges were addressed using quasi experimental methods to construct a control group a modified baseline after the newly created institutions started functioning to control for time invariant unobservable confounders and a difference in difference approach with a range of right hand side indicators to also control for time varying confounders though there is a potential bias in the results due to measurement error the bias due to selection effects is controlled for and the results can provide evidence for programming and decision making the results demonstrate that farms that had longer training had a higher probability of paying their membership fees signing a water contract and attending wua meetings information on participation diffused from trained male managers to untrained male workers but not from trained male managers to female workers this is demonstrated by the absence of a significant effect on participation when farms were operated by male workers who were not directly trained and by the presence of a significantly lower effect on participation when farms were operated by female workers such evidence is useful for programming purposes since longer training produces greater participation supplemental or refresher training modules can be designed to provide targeted training in areas where shorter training was provided if more female workers are likely to operate farms then investing in the human capital of female workers by directly training them in participatory management may be needed rather than relying on traditional methods of training male lead farmers and expecting diffusion to other farmers across gender lines in addition in the current context where most migrants are males the functioning of young participatory organizations such as wuas may be enhanced if knowledge is housed with female workers these new trainees are economically less mobile and have to continue farming to feed their families even while males are absent training female farmers directly will require changing the design of training programs trainings may need to be conducted by bringing together a male and female representative from each farm and bringing together members of geographically proximate farms so that both sexes receive the same information in the event that only women are trained breaking the training into smaller modules grouping women who belong to the same social network e g extended family neighborhood and ensuring a mixed age of women are present in the group may help increase the probability of attendance from a cultural perspective female trainers will be required if women are to be trained but also if male female pairs from the farms are to be trained trainers would also be in male female pairs since the opportunity cost of women s time is high childcare services may need to be provided at the training location during training hours in order to encourage attendance keeping the training location at the village may also reduce barriers to female mobility these changes in the design of training programs are necessary but not sufficient conditions for building capacity of female farmers who now form 55 of the agricultural workforce

11097,this paper examines whether longer training increases farm participation in community managed water user associations in a context where assignment to training duration was not randomized and none of these institutions existed before training began we also examine whether participation is affected when farm managers migrate and leave farm operations to other workers in a context where only managers have been directly trained almost all managers are male and females are increasingly operating farms we collected microdata from 1855 farms in southern tajikistan where farm managers in 40 subdistricts received longer training while those in the other 40 received shorter training these treatment and control subdistricts were selected by constructing propensity scores and matching without replacement to address observable selection effects that may affect assignment to training duration farms were then selected from a census using a stratified random sampling process a difference in difference technique with right hand side covariates is employed where both sets of data were collected after training was completed this choice of econometric methods controls against farm level selection effects but introduces a potential bias due to measurement error longer training has a causal effect on increasing participation in wuas results also demonstrate that when male workers not directly trained operate farms participation is not affected however participation is negatively affected when female workers operate farms these results provide evidence for designing irrigation management programs to target female workers directly in order to strengthen institutions whose success depends on active farm participation keywords participation training gender difference in difference propensity scores tajikistan 1 introduction in tajikistan water user associations wuas are legally mandated to bring publicly provided irrigation water to the farm gate republic of tajikistan 2006 wuas in tajikistan serve dehkan meaning private farms and legally dehkan farms not farmers are eligible members of a wua these wuas are participatory institutions this implies that the participation and cooperation of representatives of member farms is needed for wuas to perform their mandated duty of water delivery successfully beresford 2010 1 1 most irrigation management is participatory globally authors such as das 2014 have commented on the neo liberal policy of the 1990s that encouraged the transfer of irrigation management from state to non state actors namely farmer communities due to issues around improving cost recovery and performance of systems suhardiman and giordano 2014 provide a succinct explanation around the beliefs and evidence that led to such devolution of responsibilities from the state to farmer communities these topics in participatory irrigation are acknowledged but are beyond the scope of this paper the dehkan farm is headed by a manager a legally recognized position that is listed on the title of the dehkan farm the farm title also lists the workers of the farm these are individuals with a legal claim to work on the farm who also have a stake in the outputs of the farm the farm manager and the listed workers typically belong to the same family but not necessarily the same household 2 2 a family is defined as a set of individuals related through blood or through marriage a household is defined as a set of individuals who consume food cooked in the same kitchen the manager is the operator of the farm and represents the farm at the wuas when physically in residence 3 3 when the manager is physically present he is the operator for the farm when the manager is not physically present this could be because either they are deceased or they have migrated to dushanbe or overseas in these cases another member of the farm listed on the title became the operator in cases of migration the name of the manager is not legally changed on the title of the farm the wua law republic of tajikistan 2006 specifies the roles of the members dehkan farms are supposed to pay an irrigation service fee toward the expense of water provision which is levied seasonally and a wua membership fee toward the expenses of wua services provided which is levied annually they are also expected to contribute to uncompensated pre irrigation season repair and maintenance of canals that is coordinated by the wuas through the provision of labour of the workers of the farm listed on the title for the task dehkan farms are encouraged to sign a contract with the wua at the start of the year in the contract water needs are stated for planning purposes representatives of member farms are encouraged to attend wua meetings participation can be assessed by examining these member mandated functions in wuas yakubov 2011 some wuas in tajikistan were created using longer and more gradual training processes 20 24 months in contrast to other wuas that were created with 3 6 months of training consequently the managers of the farms served by such wuas received longer training on how to participate and cooperate with the wua for more successful irrigation management only managers of farms were trained irrespective of the length of training the institutional literature on farmer participation in community based participatory management organizations suggests that longer training can increase the likelihood and extent of participation and cooperation which is needed for such organizations to function successfully yap salinas 1994 kazbekov et al 2009 mukhtarov et al 2015 estimating the impact of longer training using quantitative econometric methods can provide important information to target efforts to strengthen participation and functioning of new institutions 4 4 while estimating the impact of longer training on water delivery is a worthy question the lack of gauges at inlets and outlets to measure water flows in distributary canals and watercourses complicates addressing this question for examples of such work see fernández pacheco et al 2015 however conducting such evaluations in tajikistan is challenging for at least two important reasons first assignment to longer training was not random introducing potential selection bias the second challenge pertains to the establishment of a baseline dehkan farms were created in the mid 2000s through the de collectivization of the soviet era collectives the government enacted the wua law in 2006 and mandated wuas to be responsible for delivering water to farms even so there was no participatory management irrigation organization in place until 2012 the process of creating the wuas only began in 2012 through coordinated international assistance and government policy at the start of the training consequently wuas were not functioning and there were no functional wuas in which farms could participate wuas were established and the managers of the farms were trained in gravity schemes in southern tajikistan the breadbasket of the country by usaid and by the government during 2012 and 2013 managers of farms in wuas created by usaid received 20 24 months of training while those in wuas created by the government received three to six months of training balasubramanya et al 2018 5 5 training was directed only at the managers of the farms not at the listed members of the farm training materials used to establish wuas were developed by usaid in consultation with the government and the same sets of materials were used in all cases the training covered topics pertaining to creating irrigation schedules coordinating routine repair cleaning and maintenance of canals and water courses setting levying and collecting wua membership fees from dehkan farms which is retained by the wua towards its operational costs collecting irrigation fees from dehkan farms and transferring them to the district irrigation department maintaining financial accounts organizing and scheduling meetings of members all wuas were imparted training in these topics using the same set of materials but the duration of time over which the wuas were trained in these topics significantly differed between wuas established by usaid and those established by the government with usaid wuas receiving repeated sets of the same training at regular intervals over the 20 24 month period in all cases the trainers were male and the trainees were dehkan farm managers only managers were trained these trainings were conducted by bringing together managers whose farms were in geographic proximity since 98 of dehkan farm managers are male food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2018 this implies that training in participatory irrigation was overwhelmingly provided to males migration of mostly males to either urban areas or overseas is rather common in tajikistan a study in 2013 estimated that 28 of households had at least one migrant with migration greater in locations with rural and poorer households danzer et al 2013 another study with a study area matching that in this paper estimated that in 2015 48 of rural households in southern tajikistan had at least one migrant buisson et al 2016 a consequence of migration is that farm workers who were not directly trained in participatory irrigation are increasingly operating farms with female farmers 6 6 a study by the world bank in 2016 estimated that 56 of the agricultural work force in tajikistan is female slavchevska et al 2016 constituting an important share of non trained individuals operating farms in this study 21 of farms were operated by women in 2014 which increased to 35 in 2016 whether training can increase participation in circumstances when individuals not directly trained are managing the farm would depend on the diffusion of information from those who were directly trained the farm managers in this case to those who were not trained but are now taking on the role of operating the farm the literature on whether and to whom information diffuses from farmers directly trained and produces associated behavior changes suggests that the evidence is mixed and depends on farmer and farm characteristics of trained and other farmers such as age education social status and connections land size and quality and endowments e g see clausen et al 2017 feder et al 2004 7 7 this literature has focused on pest management seed choice and fertilizer application the diffusion of information to females to encourage participation is also likely to depend on pre existing differences in the endowments capabilities and capacities of males and female e g see agarwal 2006 social structures around age caste and religion e g guijt and shah 1998 local power structures e g cleaver 1998 and bargaining power within the household e g meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 cleaver and elson 1995 however the perceived costs and benefits of participating are also important determinants and are often not given adequate attention van koppen and hussein 2007 meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 this paper examines whether longer training has a causal effect on increasing the probability of member farm participation in wuas in a context where no participatory organization existed before the training began 8 8 a broader and worthy research question is what are the factors that affect participation in wuas papers such as nagrah et al 2016 hu et al 2014 and aydogdu et al 2015 address this question the current paper is not equipped to answer this question since the aim of this paper is to identify the effects of training and gender the study was designed to ensure that subdistricts served by wuas created with longer and shorter training were selected in pairs matched on other factors that affect participation see section 5 2 for more details consequently the tradeoff is that identifying the effects of other factors that also affect participation is beyond the scope of this paper the paper considers a sample of 1855 member farms in 80 subdistricts 9 9 in tajikistan a subdistrict is called a jamoat irrigated by gravity irrigation schemes 10 10 tajikistan also has lift irrigation schemes in these geographies wuas have been established by the world bank wuas in lift irrigation schemes are not part of the current study in southern tajikistan where member farm managers in 40 subdistricts received longer training the treatment group and those in the other 40 subdistricts received shorter training the control group these 80 subdistricts were selected from a population of subdistricts by constructing propensity scores and conducting a 1 1 matching without replacement to control against selection of observable confounders at the sub district level rosenbaum and rubin 1985 member farms in these matched subdistricts were then selected from a census of member farms through a stratified random sampling process to arrive at a representative sample of farms in southern tajikistan since there was no organization for member farms to participate in before the end of the training controlling against selection effects at the farm level entailed using a difference in difference did technique with time varying and time invariant right hand side covariates with data collected in two time periods after the training of managers of member farms was completed balasubramanya et al 2018 11 11 this is in contrast to the standard did approach where one set of observations would have been collected at the time the training commenced and the other after the training was completed this approach introduces a potential bias in the estimated effects of training due to measurement error but controls against selection effects as demonstrated in balasubramanya et al 2018 and explained further in the methodology section of this paper the paper also considers whether participation is affected when the farm is operated by a person who was not trained and whether any effect depends on the gender of that non trained individual this is motivated by the observation that an increasing number of farms 50 in this paper are being operated by individuals male and female who were not directly trained to keep training costs low most training programs train lead farmers managers in this paper anderson and feder 2007 who are often male as is the case in this paper however diffusion of information to vulnerable individuals in the community e g see alesina and la ferrara 2000 and to females e g see kumar and quisumbing 2011 beaman and dillon 2018 has often not been observed when lead male farmers are trained since women s networks are often different than men s das 2014 mayoux 1995 agarwal 2006 p 284 in the context of tajikistan almost everyone who was trained was male irrigation was historically regarded as a man s job the realities of high male outmigration imply that those who were trained are decreasingly managing their farms and the agricultural workforce is getting feminized mukhamedova and wegerich 2018 in these circumstances an understanding of how participation is affected when untrained males and females operate farms can provide information for redesigning training in participatory irrigation to suit the needs of the workforce and to strengthen functioning of irrigation management the context of the participatory irrigation intervention renders the application of other methods of establishing causal effects impossible using a method of synthetic controls abadie and gardeazabal 2003 was not possible due to the non existence of data on participation from before the starting of the training using experimental methods tellez foster et al 2017 was not possible due to the non strategic setting since data on subdistricts were available they were used to select matched pairs of treatment and control clusters in order to control for selection on observable confounders this modified did technique with the inclusion of time varying right hand side covariates controls for selection on time invariant and time variant unobservable confounders this paper contributes to the literature in three ways first rather than using cross sectional data e g nagrah et al 2016 qiao et al 2009 or conducting qualitative analysis e g aydogdu et al 2015 to analyze participation panel data are used these data control for several types of selection effects and generate evidence needed for adaptive management and targeted investments in the early years of institutions whose success depends on member participation the second contribution is to understand how participation and thus the functioning of these participatory institutions is likely to be affected as the gender composition of the agricultural workforce changes due to labor market adjustments the third contribution is to contextualize the results presented in balasubramanya et al 2018 that examined the effects of longer training on wuas performance of mandated functions that paper demonstrated that wuas with longer training were able to recover membership fees from 19 more members and were 10 more likely to hold meetings with members for planning purposes the current paper uses a different primary dataset that was collected using a different study design that was specifically tailored for testing the effects of training duration and other determinants of farm participation such as gender the results in this paper demonstrate that dehkan farms whose managers received longer training are 8 more likely to pay their membership fees 20 more likely to sign a water contract with the wua and 9 more likely to attend the wua meetings dehkan farms whose managers received longer training contributed seven more person days of labor towards routine pre irrigation repair and maintenance of canals participation was not affected when the farm was operated by a male worker who was not directly trained however participation was negatively affected when the farm was operated by a female with such farms 9 less likely to pay their membership fees than farms operated by males 11 less likely to sign a water contract and 3 less likely to attend the wua meetings a limitation of the paper is that it is not possible to test formally whether participation outcomes for farms with longer and shorter training would have changed in the absence of the intervention this is because participatory organizations with longer and shorter training came into existence at the same time 2012 which coincides with the commencement of the intervention under consideration in this paper before 2012 no participatory water management institutions existed and consequently pre 2012 participation data do not exist the choice of methods in the paper is based on the observation that standard methods to control for selection effects cannot be readily employed on this context the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a context for how participatory wuas evolved in tajikistan section 3 presents a conceptual framework and reviews literature concerning length of training and participation in wuas globally and in central asia along with literature on the diffusion of information from trained to other farmers section 4 describes the methodology while section 5 presents the study design and section 6 contains details on data summary statistics and results are presented in section 7 section 8 aggregates the results and discusses them in relation to the existing literature and the evaluation of participatory institutions 2 evolution of participatory water user associations in tajikistan within the former soviet union tajikistan was designated as central asia s main hub of cotton cultivation which was practiced on collective farms food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2012 only 4 of the land in tajikistan is agricultural with 95 of crop cultivation on irrigated land food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2012 southern tajikistan is the most populous part of the country where cotton and wheat production are dominant wuas were created in tajikistan in response to the de collectivization of the collective farms into dehkan private farms which began in the mid 2000s with the departure of russian irrigation specialists and the lack of soviet subsidies irrigation departments called vodkhozes were not able to deal with the challenge of providing water to thousands of private farms gunchinmaa and yakubov 2009 shahriari 2009 the government enacted the wua law republic of tajikistan 2006 and named the wua as the institution responsible for delivering water to the farms international assistance for creating these organizations was requested wuas were piloted by several international organizations and a countrywide program to create new wuas gained momentum in 2011 more than 300 wuas are now functional in tajikistan with the service area typically in the range of 1400 ha to 1600 ha balasubramanya et al 2016 all wuas require their member farms participation and cooperation for irrigation service delivery participatory governance and civic engagement are not new to tajikistan cieslewska 2010 for instance even though state directed institutions dominated the agriculture and water sectors during the soviet era o hara 2000 traditional neighbourhood mahalla councils which were elected by the households in the neighbourhood played an important though informal role in addressing local problems including water related disputes in the community such neighbourhood councils continue to play an important role today 3 conceptual framework 3 1 participation in community managed resource systems key among ostrom 1990 eight principles for managing subtractable common pool resources is the concept of participation and the arrangements that facilitate such participation participation is viewed as a way of reconnecting disengaged citizens with the decision making process in contexts of democratic deficit pratchett 1999 619 as well as improving the quality of those decisions martin 2009 beyond mere participation gurung 1992 32 states how it is important that users abide by the terms of agreement before during and after the implementation process of the participatory management program the collective management of common pool resources such as water critically depends on users continuously following the rules cleaver 1999 among decentralized participatory institutions such as wuas external professionals may deploy an enabling logic but the users in fact perform the service task for themselves bovaird et al 2015 for example wuas coordinate routine cleaning and repair of irrigation canals before the start of the irrigation season but member farms must contribute labour of the workers of the farm in order to improve irrigation service delivery for all member farms accordingly users may be viewed as being in partnership with their organizations as they participate to co produce services beresford 2010 3 2 training members in participatory management in the literature on institutional reform and service provision it has become widely accepted that participation of users is required for institutions to be fully effective bovaird et al 2015 however when newly established members of participatory institutions such as managers of member farms in the case of wuas may need training to comprehend how they need to participate and cooperate with the institution nagrah et al 2016 since these new water users may be constrained in participating and cooperating effectively due to a lack of knowledge hu et al 2014 the length of the training period provided can be an important variable determining user participation yap salinas 1994 for example nagrah et al 2016 note that without a sufficiently long period of training farmers in pakistan may not be ready or even interested in the task of participating in a wua and following its rules in turkey aydogdu et al 2015 found that farmers lacked sufficient knowledge regarding wuas and needed more training to perform the wua functions independently in contrast a high degree of understanding about water user associations was found to be an important factor determining respondents satisfaction based on surveys in inner mongolia qiao et al 2009 822 concerning post soviet states with a similar recent history to tajikistan service user satisfaction and willingness to pay among armenian wuas was compromised by insufficient unreliable and untimely delivery of water due in part to inadequate training of wuas and their users alaverdyan and houston 2004 11 in kyrgyzstan improved water delivery was brought about after a lengthy four year period of training encouraged member participation johnson and stoutjesdijk 2008 311 by contrast training time was limited or nonspecific in uzbekistan leading to poor rates of payment of fees and participation in wua governance wegerich 2000 3 3 gender and irrigation the inclusion on women in water policy emerged as part of a broader change in neoliberal policy that called for local approach and people s participation in water planning and management in part to increase cost recovery of projects and improve design and delivery of services zwarteveen et al 2012 das 2014 whittington 1998 in the domestic water sector the rational for females participating was that women stood to gain from reductions in time and effort spent collecting water for domestic purposes najlis and edwards 1991 the empirical evidence on women s participation in rural water supply schemes has been mixed for example narayan 1995 found that only 17 of 121 such projects in 47 developing countries had achieved a high level of female participation reasons for low female participation included pre existing differences in endowments social norms perceptions local power structures and division of labor and bargaining power within the household e g see agarwal 2006 guijt and shah 1998 cleaver 1998 meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 singh et al 2005 das 2014 in the irrigation sector meinzen dick and zwarteveen 1998 have noted that women s participation in wuas in south asia was rather low despite being heavily involved in agricultural activities reasons for low participation included membership rules often based on land ownership which is usually in the man s name and high opportunity costs of women s time van koppen and hussein 2007 have pointed that women s involvement in irrigation depends on whether the system is a dual female farming system or a male farming system where men are the breadwinners and whether irrigation projects incorporate multiple uses of water to include drinking and domestic water use while not the focus of this paper these factors suggest that women s participation varies across geographies and cases and is dependent on the perceived costs and benefits from participation 3 4 migration agriculture and gender rapid changes in the gender composition of the agricultural work force can change the roles of women in agriculture specifically pertaining to labor allocation and decision making these changes occur due to changes in household labor availability and cash income sources zimmerer 1993 taylor and dyer 2006 gray 2009 for example van rooij 2000 finds that migration improved the purchasing power of households to hire labor thus reducing women s effort in contrast sadiqi and ennaji 2004 found that women in migrant households in morocco reported an increase in workloads the same authors found improvements in female autonomy and decision making by expanding the set of roles as did taylor et al 2007 in guatemala however paris et al 2005 found reduced autonomy and decision making among migrant households in india due to increased burden of work the effects of the roles of women depend on the type of migration type of household access to land and livestock holdings family structures and size of remittances maharjan et al 2012 paris et al 2005 desai and banerji 2008 gray 2009 for example maharjan et al 2012 note that in households with high remittances women experienced reductions in physical burden and improvements in decision making while those in households with low remittances experienced the opposite effects in contexts such as tajikistan where cotton wheat systems were historically male systems van koppen and hussein 2007 a rapid and drastic feminization of the dehkan farm production system due to high rates of male outmigration presents an interesting case mukhamedova and wegerich 2018 found that despite dehkan farms being male systems gender based occupational segregation were being challenged in tajikistan with women stepping into roles that men traditionally performed including irrigation despite the high opportunity costs of women s time and the pre existing cultural barriers that might hinder such changes 3 5 diffusion of information from trained farmers to other men and women farmer training programs are typically designed to improve performance by providing technical information to increase human capital anderson and feder 2004 since farmers often rely on other farmers for information about agricultural practices rees 2000 such programs usually train head farmers or village heads who in turn share that technical information with other farmers anderson and feder 2007 this also keep costs of programs low feder et al 2004 the literature on whether information diffuses from directly trained farmers to other farmers and encourages changes in behaviors usually regards farmers as ungendered 12 12 this might be because these farming systems are predominantly single sex however gender roles in agiculture are changing across the globe world bank 2016 and the evidence on diffusion is mixed for example feder et al 2004 found that while indonesian farmers directly trained in pest management reduced pesticide use farmers not directly trained did not experience an improvement in either knowledge or a reduction in pesticide use in contrast in uganda clausen et al 2017 found that farmers directly trained in pest management were also able to reduce the pesticide use of neighboring farmers these differences in diffusion of information and associated changes in behaviors are likely to depend on several factors the complexity of the knowledge to be shared e g rola et al 2002 and the strength of interpersonal networks e g tripp et al 2005 are two such factors also important are the social status of persons chosen for training e g see pemsl et al 2006 and idiosyncratic characteristics of farmers and their farms e g fuglie and kascak 2001 in addition to the factors discussed in 3 3 and 3 4 diffusion of information to women is likely to depend upon whether those who were trained are part of women s networks which are often distinct from men s networks mayoux 1995 das 2014 using low cost options to diffuse information which often involves using pre existing networks may have unfortunate distributional consequences for diffusion of information to women for example beaman and dillon 2018 find that when the information on composting is spread using existing social networks in mali where networks are among lead male farmers less influential farmers and female farmers in particular lose out on receiving valuable information within a household the diffusion of information is likely to depend on factors that were discussed in section 3 3 male migration could change the information that is shared within the household with women if the roles of women are likely to change however the same factors such as family structures relative bargaining power social norms and power structures may prevent women from gaining information even when they need to have it in order to undertake new roles 3 6 hypotheses the paper considers member mandated functions as specified in the wua law republic of tajikistan 2006 and introduces a number of hypotheses regarding the effects of longer training on these indicators a list of indicators is provided in table 1 a irrigation fees longer training is expected to increase the probability of a farm paying the seasonal irrigation fees b wua membership fees longer training is expected to increase the probability of a farm paying its annual membership fees c participation in pre irrigation cleaning of canals longer training is expected to increase the number of person days of labor that the member farm contributes towards cleaning d legal relations longer training is expected to increase the probability of a farm signing a contract with a wua and is expected to increase the probability of the manager or listed worker of a farm attending a wua meeting training in tajikistan was imparted to managers lead farmers almost all of whom are male irrigation was historically viewed as a man s job especially on cotton wheat cultivating dehkan farms since migration has led to the departure of males and females have expanded their roles intra household sharing of information may have changed to equip women to execute the job that men were traditionally undertaking however the fact that all those who were trained were male coupled with pre existing social norms and women s relative socioeconomic status may hamper the extent to which such information is transferred from men and received by women consequently participation is not expected to be affected when non trained males operate the farm but participation is expected to be lower when females operate the farm 4 methodology consider the following equation 1 y j t μ γ s j θ t ω s j t β x j t ϑ j t where y j t refers to a participation indicator for farm j at time t s j is a categorical variable that denotes the treatment status of farm j with s j 1 if the farm manager received longer training and s j 0 if the manager received shorter training the variable ω reports the causal effect of longer training on participation x j t refers to a set of farm specific covariates at time t that might also influence y j t ϑ j t is the error term 13 13 the error structure is assumed to follow e ϑ j t s j t 0 s j t this is because the identifying assumption is that by explicitly accounting for the errors are uncorrelated with s t and t the difference in difference did technique identifies the causal effect of longer training by comparing the average change in participation over a time period for the treatment group to that for the control group while controlling for differences at the starting points and common time trends typically the did technique would be executed by collecting data on participation and other covariates from farms first at the start of the training i e when t 0 and again at some time t 0 after training was completed thus creating a panel dataset therefore the standard did technique assumes that both treatment and control groups were participating even before the training began that is y j t 0 when t 0 allowing for a pre training comparison of trends in outcomes between the two groups under this condition called the standard condition the did technique eliminates time invariant unobservable selection effects μ in eq 1 such as any farm specific area specific or agency specific fixed effects that are constant over time but may drive differences in level of participation and provides an unbiased estimate of ω however if participation indicators take values of zero in the pre intervention period y j t 0 t 0 then there are no pre intervention trends to compare in the case of tajikistan there were no participatory institutions for farms to participate in before training began in the area under study if the did technique were implemented by collecting the first set of data on participation and covariates at the start of the training when y j 0 0 for all farms and by collecting the next set of data at some time t 0 for all farms where y j t 0 for all farms then this would mathematically be equivalent to using cross sectional data rather than panel data under this condition the did technique would not be able to eliminate the time invariant unobservable selection effects μ and would provide a biased estimate of ω since the case of tajikistan imposes the condition where for all farms y j t 0 t 0 the difference in difference estimator is used in a modified setting where both the first and the second sets of data are collected in time periods after the training was completed this modification of standard practice eliminates bias in the estimation of ω due to time invariant unobservable selection effects μ but introduces a potential bias due to measurement error however the magnitude of any bias due to measurement error is reduced to zero as the first set of data is collected closer to the time when training commenced i e closer to t 0 therefore collecting the first set of data as close as possible to t 0 would minimize bias due to this measurement error while also eliminating bias due to time invariant unobservable selection effects μ a mathematical proof of the elimination of bias due to these unobservable selection effects μ and a minimization of the bias due to measurement error as the first set of data is collected closer to the time when training commences can be found in balasubramanya et al 2018 apart from time invariant unobservable selection effects there may be time varying unobservable selection effects that also bias the estimation of ω these are controlled for by including a host of farm specific time varying covariates x j t on the right hand side of the modified did equation as demonstrated in balasubramanya et al 2018 5 study design 5 1 determining sample size number of clusters and number of observations per cluster a wua usually provides water to member farms in one or two subdistricts 14 14 it is unlikely that a dehkan farm is not a member of a wua wuas have been created across all gravity schemes in southern tajikistan and data collected from wuas in a separate study demonstrate that all farms in the command area are member farms balasubramanya et al 2016 enabling each subdistrict to be classified as either a treatment subdistrict where farm managers received longer training or a control subdistrict where farm managers received shorter training power calculations were conducted to determine the number of treatment and control subdistricts the number of observations within a subdistrict and the sample size the minimum detectable effect mde size was calculated using the formula 2 m d e 2 487 σ y 1 r 2 1 ρ 1 a t b t 1 a c b c ρ 1 a t 1 a c in eq 2 a c and a t represent the number of control and treatment subdistricts and b c and b t represent the number of member farms per subdistrict the variable σ y is the standard deviation of the outcome variable and the variable ρ refers to the intra subdistrict correlation associated with that outcome variable r 2 is the coefficient of determination outcome variables and their means standard deviations σ y and intra subdistrict correlations ρ were taken from the tajikistan living standards measurement survey t lsms world bank 2003 15 15 the t lsms 2003 was preferred to the t lsms from 2007 and 2009 due to a larger sample of rural households in the agricultural provinces the coefficient of determination and the level of confidence were set at conventional rates of 0 8 and 0 95 respectively two outcome variables from the t lsms database were used as proxies for the range of indicators to be assessed these were proportion of farms that irrigated their agricultural plot and proportion of farms that believed their plot received adequate water supply a sensitivity analysis was subsequently carried out by varying the number of control and treatment subdistricts respectively a c and a t the number of member farms per subdistrict b c and b t and the sample size results using the proportion of farms that irrigated their agricultural plot are reported in figs 1 and 2 for a given sample size the mde is smaller as the number of clusters in the sample increases fig 2 and as the number of observations per cluster in the sample decreases fig 2 a study design of 40 treatment and 40 control subdistricts with 25 farms per subdistrict emerged suitable the mde for this study design is an increase of 10 in the proportion of households irrigating their plots and an increase of 6 in the proportion of households that felt that their plots had adequate water for the design of 40 treatment and 40 control clusters the mde falls as the sample size increases i e the number of observations per cluster increases but the change in the mde is rather small fig 3 16 16 results from using the proportion of households that believed their plot received adequate water supply are also similar 5 2 selecting the clusters since assignment to longer training was not random treatment and control subdistricts to be sampled in this assessment were selected by constructing propensity scores and then using a 1 1 matching process without replacement to select matched pairs of treatment and control subdistricts a pre sampling survey of all subdistricts where irrigated cultivation of wheat and cotton was practiced 164 of the 406 subdistricts was conducted of the164 subdistricts 116 were in khatlon province 21 in sughd province and 27 in drs province information on demographic attributes agricultural practices land use and farm attributes and irrigation infrastructure was collected propensity scores were constructed to calculate the probability of each subdistrict being treated i e where farm managers received longer training a complete list of attributes that were used to construct the propensity scores and the model of treatment can be found in table 2 17 17 the propensity score also takes into account ethnic composition of subdistricts the number of rural health centers and schools and the number of agricultural markets in the subdistrict it also takes into account whether land reforms have been completed and the number of years of tenure of the current subdistrict leader these could affect selection into treatment and hence were accounted for while selecting the treated and control groups using the propensity scores subdistricts with farms whose managers received longer training were matched using a caliper size of 0 12 to subdistricts with farms whose managers received shorter training without replacement to their nearest neighbor 1 1 match to select 40 subdistricts of each type the differences between the subdistrict attributes for unmatched and matched subdistricts is displayed in table 3 when unmatched treatment and control subdistricts displayed significant differences on a number of attributes these differences did not emerge for the matched pairs 5 3 selecting dehkan farms records of the population of dehkan farms were not available in any government office at the national level therefore a census of all dehkan farms in the 80 selected subdistricts was undertaken by the research team information on the name of the farm and the name of the manager of the farm was collected in addition farms were categorized on two key variables the type of canal from which the farm was irrigated primary secondary or tertiary and the farm s location on that canal head middle or tail these two variables affect water availability at the farm level and may influence participation for example managers of farms located on the tail of a tertiary canal may be more inclined to attend wua meetings because their access to water is deeply dependent on the actions of farmers at the head on the other hand these managers may be less likely to pay the irrigation fees if they perceive that they are unlikely to receive water anyway a stratified random sampling method using these two characteristics was used to select 25 dehkan farms from each of the 80 selected subdistricts totaling 2000 farms this process randomly selects the nine types of farms in proportion to their numbers in the population producing a representative sample of farms in each subdistrict 5 4 clustering the sample was selected by first selecting clusters subdistricts and then selecting farms within each cluster consequently the econometric analysis of the data in the paper has been conducted by clustering results at the sub district level to account for the fact than two farms within the same cluster are likely to be more similar than two farms in different clusters 6 data a panel data set was collected through surveys conducted with the 2000 farms the first survey was conducted in 2015 to collect information on the 2014 calendar year the second survey was conducted in 2017 to collect information about the 2016 calendar year 6 1 respondent both surveys were targeted at the farm managers since they are the operators of the farms and had received the training however this was often not possible due to overseas or rural to urban male migration for the first survey if the manager had not migrated and was in residence during 2014 2015 the manager was interviewed 18 18 we did not find any case where the manager who was trained was in residence but was not the operator of the farm if the manager was not in residence during 2014 2015 the listed worker of the farm who had taken on the operations of the farm was interviewed for the second survey if the respondent of the first survey was still in residence they were interviewed 19 19 we did not find any cases where the respondent of the first survey was still in residence and was not the prime operator of the farm if the respondent of the first survey had migrated then the person who had taken on the operations of the farm was interviewed interviews were scheduled in advance to check whether the person who had answered the first survey was available and to coordinate with the new operator when needed data were also collected on the gender of the respondent who was the operator of the farm for that calendar year 6 2 attrition between first and second survey in the first survey respondents from 1957 of the 2000 member farms agreed to participate in the study and were consequently interviewed the second survey was answered by 1855 of the 1957 member farms using data collected from the first survey no statistically significant differences were observed between farms in the treatment and control group within the subsample of 102 member farms that did not answer the second survey the primary reason that these member farms could not be surveyed again was because production on these dehkan farms had ceased after the first survey and before the implementation of the second survey most often due to male migration 6 3 final sample data pertaining to 1855 member farms are used in the analysis with 933 farms whose managers received longer training treatment group and 922 farms whose managers received shorter training control group 6 4 left hand side variables indicators pertaining to member farm participation were constructed to reflect the roles as delineated in the wua law of 2006 respondents were asked if the farm has paid its irrigation fees and its wua membership dues for the calendar year respondents were also asked to report on the number of listed workers of the farm who had participated in canal cleaning and the number of days of labor each of those workers had contributed in order to calculate person days of labor that the farm had contributed towards repair and maintenance finally respondents were asked if the farm had a signed a contract with the wua for the calendar year and if the farm had been represented at the wua planning meetings in the calendar year data on these indicators were collected in both surveys 6 5 right hand side variables data on farm membership size and demographics cotton acreage and cultivation of other crops were collected these data were also elicited in both surveys table 4 provides summary statistics for these key variables in 2014 a male who was not directly trained operated 30 of farms in the treatment group and 35 of farms in the control group in 2016 males who were not directly trained operated 29 of farms in the treatment group and 31 of farms in the control group regarding the gender of the farm operator females operated 10 of the treatment group farms and 11 of the control group farms in 2014 for 2016 these values changed to 16 and 19 for treatment group and control group respectively the number of listed workers of the farm did not change significantly within and between groups across years they fell from 7 workers to 6 workers for the treatment group and from 8 workers to 7 workers for the control group the gender composition of the workers of the farm listed on the farm title changed within and between groups while 46 and 48 of listed farm workers in the treatment and control groups during 2014 were female 53 and 51 of listed farm workers in the treatment and control groups during 2016 were female their difference in difference 53 46 51 48 is 4 and is significant at 5 the share of workers of the farm listed on the farm title spending the majority of their working time on the farm increased within both groups but not between groups while 79 of listed farm workers in the treatment group and 72 of listed farm workers in the control group worked a majority of their time on the farm during 2014 these increased later to 87 and 82 for the treatment and control groups respectively the number of households associated with the member farms did not change staying at around three households for both groups during both surveys the area of land covered by the title of the member farms also did not change much between the two surveys for both groups this is because rental markets for land are not well developed in tajikistan 20 20 in the first survey the per farm land rented was 0 14 ha for the treatment group and 0 13 ha for the control group in the second survey these numbers were 0 15 ha and 0 09 ha for the treatment and control group respectively the cultivated area of the member farms did not significantly change within and between the two groups over the two surveys in 2014 the treatment group cultivated 4 19 ha per member farm on average and the control group cultivated 4 43 ha these changed to 4 01 ha and 4 48 ha in 2016 for the treatment and control group respectively irrigated area of the member farms also did not significantly change within and between the two groups in 2014 the treated group irrigated 4 15 ha and the control group irrigated 4 05 ha on average these changed to 3 95 ha and 4 18 ha in 2016 the share of member farms cultivating cotton remained the same within each group in 2014 67 of treatment member farms and 47 of control member farms cultivated cotton and in 2016 these changed to 70 of treatment member farms and 49 of control member farms the area under cotton cultivation also remained the same between both within and between the groups in 2014 the treatment member farms cultivated 3 27 ha of cotton on average and the control member farms cultivated 3 95 ha of cotton on average in 2016 the treatment member farms were cultivating 3 18 ha of cotton while the control member farms were cultivating 3 81 ha of cotton on average the following variables were only measured during the first survey because they either changed at the same rate over time for both groups or were time invariant treatment and control member farms were of the similar age with treatment member farms 4 83 years old standard deviation sd 0 32 in 2015 and control member farms around 5 63 years old in 2015 sd 0 47 the average treatment member farm was 1 75 km away from the nearest road sd 0 27 while the average control member farm was 2 03 km away sd 0 33 the age of the member farm manager was similar for both groups with managers around 48 years of age in 2015 standard deviation of 0 43 and 0 48 for the treatment and control group respectively the treatment group had a slightly higher share of member farm managers who had completed secondary education with 29 as compared to 24 for the control group these variables were also included on the right hand side of the difference in difference estimating equations but the estimated coefficients are not reported in the paper because being time invariant they are eliminated by the difference in difference technique during estimation 7 results 7 1 causal effects of longer training on participation and cooperation member farms whose managers were provided with longer training were 8 more likely to pay their membership fees than member farms whose managers were provided with shorter training p 0 10 table 5 member farms receiving longer training contributed seven more person days of labor per member farm p 0 01 towards pre irrigation season cleaning of canals were 19 more likely to have signed a contract with their wuas p 0 01 and 9 more likely to attend the wua meetings p 0 05 the coefficients of determination r squared in these regressions are low because these are not ordinary least squares regressions with cross sectional data since these regressions are difference in differences fixed effects using panel data which is clustered at the subdistrict the f statistic is a more reliable indicator of explanatory power these values are below 0 1 for the regressions where the effect of training is positive and significant at the usual levels 7 2 effect on participation when farm was operated by non trained male worker the likelihood of a farm paying its irrigation fees wua membership fees signing a contract with the wua and being represented at wua planning meetings was not affected when the farm was operated by a non trained male worker table 5 however when the farm was operated by a male worker who had not been directly trained that farm contributed two fewer man days of labor than when the farm was operated by the manager who had been directly trained p 0 1 table 5 while shortages of labor may be an explanation a negative effect is not observed when farms are operated by females which usually happens when males migrated see section 7 3 below 21 21 all regressions including the one pertaining to contribution of man days of labor include the number of farm members the share of members that work permanently on the farm and the share of members that are female to control for changes in labor and gender composition none of these is significant in column 3 of table 5 7 3 effect on participation when farm was operated by non trained female worker the gender of the operator of the farm was significant in determining participation as seen in table 5 a farm operated by a female worker who were not trained because only managers were trained and almost all managers are male was 9 less likely to pay its membership fees p 0 01 11 less likely to sign a contract p 0 05 and 3 less likely to attend wua meetings p 0 1 22 22 the negative effect of female farm management on participation does not depend on the length of training interacting the female operator variable with longer training and including it in all regressions does not appear significant at 10 and the magnitude and significance on the longer training variable remains the same whether this interaction term is included or not 8 discussion in countries such as tajikistan formal participatory institutions for irrigation are being newly developed after the state control era of the soviet union participatory irrigation required members to participate so that irrigation services can be generated for all if an important share of members do not participate that compromises the delivery of irrigation services even for those who do participate a classic collective action problem while training in participation is usually provided to lead farmers who are often male managers in the case of tajikistan larger macroeconomic and labor market forces are changing gender based roles in agriculture understanding the role of the length of training in enhancing participation in wuas and examining whether participation is lower when farms are managed by non trained female workers is important to understand whether program design and policymaking can have a role to play in increasing participation so that the irrigation system can continue to function and deliver services for all members such evidence is often hard to generate due to methodological challenges quantitative assessments of participation in newly created community management institutions is challenging because control groups and baselines are often difficult to identify selection into participatory organizations is not random complicating the isolation of causal effects from observable and unobservable confounders further when participatory institutions are created for the first time all participation variables take values of zero at baseline because the intervention also created the notion of membership further complicating the elimination of unobservable confounders in this paper these methodological challenges were addressed using quasi experimental methods to construct a control group a modified baseline after the newly created institutions started functioning to control for time invariant unobservable confounders and a difference in difference approach with a range of right hand side indicators to also control for time varying confounders though there is a potential bias in the results due to measurement error the bias due to selection effects is controlled for and the results can provide evidence for programming and decision making the results demonstrate that farms that had longer training had a higher probability of paying their membership fees signing a water contract and attending wua meetings information on participation diffused from trained male managers to untrained male workers but not from trained male managers to female workers this is demonstrated by the absence of a significant effect on participation when farms were operated by male workers who were not directly trained and by the presence of a significantly lower effect on participation when farms were operated by female workers such evidence is useful for programming purposes since longer training produces greater participation supplemental or refresher training modules can be designed to provide targeted training in areas where shorter training was provided if more female workers are likely to operate farms then investing in the human capital of female workers by directly training them in participatory management may be needed rather than relying on traditional methods of training male lead farmers and expecting diffusion to other farmers across gender lines in addition in the current context where most migrants are males the functioning of young participatory organizations such as wuas may be enhanced if knowledge is housed with female workers these new trainees are economically less mobile and have to continue farming to feed their families even while males are absent training female farmers directly will require changing the design of training programs trainings may need to be conducted by bringing together a male and female representative from each farm and bringing together members of geographically proximate farms so that both sexes receive the same information in the event that only women are trained breaking the training into smaller modules grouping women who belong to the same social network e g extended family neighborhood and ensuring a mixed age of women are present in the group may help increase the probability of attendance from a cultural perspective female trainers will be required if women are to be trained but also if male female pairs from the farms are to be trained trainers would also be in male female pairs since the opportunity cost of women s time is high childcare services may need to be provided at the training location during training hours in order to encourage attendance keeping the training location at the village may also reduce barriers to female mobility these changes in the design of training programs are necessary but not sufficient conditions for building capacity of female farmers who now form 55 of the agricultural workforce

11098,sundarbans in west bengal india located in the eastern coast of the bay of bengal is one of the vulnerable zones subjected to abrupt climate change the region receives 2 7 times surplus rainfall as compared to crop evapotranspiration during monsoon months causing widespread waterlogging of the low lying agricultural fields and impedes the productivity the present study assessed the effects of different land shaping models namely farm pond fp deep furrow and high ridge rf and paddy cum fish pcf systems for rainwater harvesting in restoring the productivity of degraded coastal soils in sundarbans a water balance was run to estimate the soil moisture crop evapotranspiration runoff and water depth in the reservoir during normal excess and deficit rainfall years the average annual harvested runoff was 2709 1650 and 1169 m3 per hectare in fp rf and pcf systems respectively the runoff going out of the system was 19 5 29 1 and 27 75 of the annual rainfall in fp rf and pcf systems respectively whereas in monocrop rice fallow system it was 34 6 of the annual rainfall we estimated all the three components of water footprints wf i e blue wf wfblue green wf wfgreen and gray wf wfgray as an aggregative indicator to evaluate environmental impact the results indicated that total as well as the components of wf was higher in rice fallow and rice rice systems than in each of the land shaping system large scale adoption of different land shaping systems increased the cropping intensity and net farm income and there was reduction in salinity during summer and waterlogging during rainy season and overall improvement in soil quality the dominant soluble salts identified in the study region were nacl and mgso4 keywords climate change water footprint farm pond water balance coastal saline soil 1 introduction the sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove ecosystem in the world located in the southern part of west bengal india and bangladesh and lies on the delta of the ganges brahmaputra and meghna rivers in the bay of bengal renaud et al 2013 rahman et al 2011 owing to its unique geographical location this world heritage site is highly vulnerable to climate change ipcc 2007 principal degradation processes impacting these fragile ecosystems include coastal erosion seawater intrusion and inundation and salinization along with anthropogenic activities coastal impact in this region is more severe because of the low flat coastal terrain shallow coastal ocean topography in the bay of bengal high density of population low awareness of community inadequate response and preparedness and absence of hedging mechanism sadr 2007 thus productivity and ecosystem services vital to functioning and sustainability of these important biomes are severely jeopardized the lands in these islands are highly degraded due to phenomena like saline water flooding following storm and brackish groundwater table near the soil surface due to the influence of sea or saline river water burman et al 2013 in the indian sundarbans around 56 of land mass lies within the coastal low lying ecosystems with an elevation of 5 m above mean sea level some parts are even below the mean sea level the region receives high rainfall which is concentrated only over a few monsoon months june september due to this heavy concentrated rainfall in a short span flat topography low infiltration rate presence of groundwater at the surface and lack of proper drainage facility most of the cultivated fields are deeply waterlogged in kharif wet season farmers have no choice for alternate crops other than tall traditional landraces or old rice varieties in kharif sarangi et al 2015 during dry winter months acute shortage of irrigation water along with increase in soil and water salinity limits the agricultural production the coastal areas are behind many inland areas in terms of agricultural productivity and livelihood security of the farmers singh 2006 much of the coastal fringe is enclosed by bunds polders some of which experience post monsoon waterlogging that delays rabi winter season crop establishment resulting in suboptimal crop performance timothy et al 2017 the huge runoff losses of rainwater also enhance the soil erosion and wide scale land degradation of the region because of non remunerative agriculture in the region and steady growth in fishery sector many agricultural lands are getting converted to modern commercially oriented high output intensive brackish water farming which poses severe environmental threats to the region there is a need for appropriate water and land care system for coastal area to make this fragile ecosystem into climatically more resilient cyclone alia in 2009 further exposed the climatic vulnerability of agriculture in the sundarbans the area had experienced devastating floods as the ill maintained mud embankments gave way allowing the saline seawater to gush in for miles and remain stagnant for over months the saline water also intruded the sweet water ponds killing several varieties of fish and spoilt the source of irrigation during dry season thereby affecting the livelihood of large number of people living in the riverine area the stagnant water increased salinity so much that even two years after alia paddy could not be established in the region the hindu june 8 2011 therefore demand of food security economic development and climate change continue to pose diverging and often conflicting challenges for water resources management in the coastal zones of the delta le et al 2018 there are opportunities for intensification of cropping through efficient use and optimal management of water careful planning of the crop calendar and efficient agronomic practices most research efforts have consequently focused on closing yield gaps under relatively favourable irrigated conditions primarily on investigating the ways in which dry season fallowed or rainfed land use can be intensified groundwater irrigation facilities are lacking especially near the coast where shallow aquifers are mostly saline where environmental conditions are more permitting the cost of deep tube well drilling and installation is still beyond the reach of most resource poor farmers bernier et al 2016 cropping intensification of rice fallow or rainfed systems into intensified double cropping can be achieved by increasing the availability of rainwater for irrigation use particularly during winter and summer a comprehensive knowledge of climate fluctuations and corresponding adaptation strategies through rainwater harvesting is crucial for the progress towards sustainability increasing freshwater availability also pushes back oceanic saltwater intrusion during the dry season furthermore local food production is vital to an island ecosystem where majority of the people still live and depend on subsistence farming velmurugan et al 2015 icar central soil salinity research institute has developed few land shaping models for water harvesting to enhance the productivity of low lying degraded land of the region and to tackle the prolonged waterlogging during monsoon season and increasing water availability during rabi season different land forming techniques such as bunding broad bed and furrow system and rice fish culture in andaman and nicobar islands improved crop diversification by enabling multiple cropping while increasing the overall farm productivity ravisankar et al 2008 srinivasarao et al 2017 also reported that rainwater harvesting through farm pond has the potential to increase availability of water for supplemental irrigation and offers a solution to overcome the increased frequencies of drought under climate change scenario in the semiarid tropical region however it was viewed by some farmers as a waste of productive land if it was not properly intensified kumar et al 2016 therefore effectiveness of these technological interventions must be tested and fine tuned under site specific conditions prior to large scale adoption the present study was aimed to assess the effects of different land shaping models in restoring the productivity of degraded coastal soils in sundarbans the study was based on the hypothesis that improving soil drainage and maintaining water level within a specific depth would improve soil quality and agronomic productivity in coastal ecosystem we studied the hydrological impacts of rainwater harvesting in different land shaping models through water balance approach and used the water footprint as an aggregative indicator to evaluate environmental impact 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the coastal region of west bengal sundarbans the coastal region of west bengal sundarbans india is situated 21 32 22 40 n latitude and 88 05 89 00 e longitude in the district of north and south 24 parganas burman et al 2018 fig 1 the sundarbans is a unesco world heritage site two third of which is in bangladesh while rest one third is in india the region consists of 102 numbers of islands including parts of main land out of these 54 islands are inhabited and the rest are under mangrove forest the sundarbans along the bay of bengal has evolved over the millennia through natural deposition of upstream sediments accompanied by intertidal segregation the physiography is characteristically dominated by deltaic formations that include innumerable drainage lines associated with surface and subaqueous levees splays and tidal flats a large number of saline water rivers which criss cross the area influence the degree of salinity in the soil and water the climate of sundarbans is moist sub humid with hot summer and mild winter the mean maximum air temperature during summer march april and may ranges from 32 9 to 34 8 c the mean minimum temperature during winter december january and february ranges from 13 2 to 16 6 c long term climate data 1966 2015 collected at icar central soil salinity research institute regional research station canning town within indian sundarbans indicated that canning receives a mean annual rainfall of 1821 mm with a considerable variation coefficient of variation cv 18 8 annual report 2015 16 monsoon months june september contributed 74 4 1355 mm to the annual rainfall whereas pre monsoon march may and post monsoon october february months contributed 13 1 and 12 5 of the annual rainfall respectively pre and post monsoon rainfall meets up 45 and 51 of the evapotranspiration et0 whereas there was 2 7 times surplus rainfall than et0 during monsoon months 2 2 land shaping technology interventions different types of land shaping techniques for improving drainage facility rainwater harvesting salinity management and cultivation of crops and fishes for livelihood and environmental security have been developed to suit different land situations farm size and farmers need the details of three land shaping techniques viz farm pond fp deep furrow and high ridge rf and paddy cum fish pcf systems fig 2 which were implemented in farmers fields at basanti block of sundarbans are given in table 1 burman et al 2013 2 3 soil water balance a water balance model consisting of four sub model situations i e for non rice field rice field fallow land and on farm reservoir under each land shaping situation as well as rice monocrop and rice rice system was used to study the hydrological impact 2 3 1 soil water balance for non rice field a simple root zone soil water balance model is used for estimating the actual evapotranspiration aet of crops grown without any standing water here the soil reservoir is divided into two layers i an active layer of depth in which roots are present at any given time and from which both water extraction and drainage would occur and ii a passive layer of depth maximum root depth root depth attained any day after sowing das from which only drainage would occur the two layers are distinct in the initial phase of crop growth and their relative depths are governed by the rate of root growth however once the maximum root depth is attained the entire root zone becomes only one layer details of the model description have been described by mandal et al 2002 2007 daily rainfall data during the growing season of the crop is used as an input daily runoff is estimated from the daily rainfall data using the curve number cn technique of the soil conservation service usda 1972 and combined with the soil water accounting procedure suggested by sharpley and williams 1990 in the model evapotranspiration et occurs at a maximum rate called the potential evapotranspiration pet as long as soil water content in the root zone is more than a minimum threshold value dorrenbos and kassam 1979 when the water content falls below the threshold value the value of et i e aet becomes a decreasing function of the water content and pet to obtain pet the reference evapotranspiration et0 is multiplied by the corresponding value of the crop coefficient kc for the day et0 mm day 1 was determined using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 3 2 soil water balance of rice field rice is generally grown under continuous flooded condition with about 5 cm depth of standing water during the crop growing season for rice the inflow components in the water balance are irrigation and rainfall whereas evapotranspiration percolation and surface runoff are the outflow components the water balance equation for rice fields can be expressed as follows ambast et al 1998 1 wd r ir aet p q where wd is water depth in the field on a given day mm aet crop evapotranspiration on that day mm r amount of rainfall mm ir amount of irrigation mm p deep percolation mm q runoff mm the time period is considered as 1 day it is assumed that there is no capillary rise from groundwater in the present study rainfall in excess of bund height was considered as surface runoff in the rice field a bund height of 30 and 45 cm was considered under medium and low land situations respectively under land shaping systems whereas 55 cm bund height was considered under rice monocrop or rice rice system without land shaping during rabi season a minimum water depth of 5 cm was maintained and irrigation with 50 mm water was applied whenever the water depth goes down to 5 cm or less the daily percolation rate out of the root zone was computed for rice evapotranspiration was assumed to be equal to potential evapotranspiration as there was always standing water during the rice growing season the kc values for rice on weekly basis were obtained from tyagi et al 2000 2 3 3 soil water balance of fallow land in the absence of vegetation evaporation from fallow land occurs in two distinct stages the first stage is termed as the energy limited or constant rate stage during which evaporation proceeds at the potential rate until the water content in the surface 10 cm of soil reaches the permanent wilting point campbell and diaz 1988 the second stage is termed as the soil limited stage or falling rate stage where hydraulic transport of subsurface water to the soil surface is unable to supply water at the potential evaporation rate during this stage the soil appears partially dry and a portion of the evaporation occurs from below the soil surface the evaporation rate during this stage is equal to the square of the remaining evaporable water 2 3 4 water balance model of the on farm reservoir all inflows and outflows are considered for water budgeting of on farm reservoir ofr i e pond ditch and furrows in fp rf and pcf systems respectively the inflows are the direct rainfall in farm reservoir and surface runoff coming from the surrounding fields into it the outflows are evaporation seepage and percolation and irrigation given to the crops from the reservoir panigrahi et al 2005 evaporation loss of water depends on the water spread area in the ofr at any given storage depth the seepage and percolation loss of the ofr storage was considered at 2 mm day 1 normally farmers depending on the method of irrigation apply an irrigation depth of 20 50 mm as supplemental deficit irrigation in rainfed areas the objective of supplemental irrigation is to adequately recharge the upper dry soil profile and connect it with the moist profile prevailing in the deeper soil layers to provide continuity to the flow process sharma et al 2010 we considered irrigation depth of 25 mm as supplemental irrigation and conveyance losses zero since farmers apply irrigation through plastic pipes water balances for the four sub systems i e in fallow rice non rice and ofr were run simultaneously within each land shaping system and entire runoff was diverted towards ofr after filling up of the ofr in each land shaping system if there is any extra runoff it goes out of the system into natural drainage channels or estuary 2 4 sampling data collection for impact assessment soils were collected to a depth of 0 20 cm from high medium and low land of fp ridge and furrow areas of rf dike and low land of pcf systems as well as rice rice and rice fallow systems during december 2015 and march april 2016 each soil sample was a composite of three sub samples collected from each location rainfall data were obtained from the automatic weather station installed in the icar central soil salinity research institute regional research station canning town around 10 km away from the study area observed data of soil moisture and water depth in the field and ofr were monitored at regular intervals during 2012 to 2014 from different land shaping systems adopted by the farmers 2 5 soil analysis around 500 g from each soil sample was separately stored in refrigerator for microbiological study remaining samples were dried and sieved for the physical and chemical analyses for determining bulk density undisturbed samples were also collected in cores along with the original samples samples were analyzed for basic soil properties following the standard protocols viz ph 1 2 soil water ratio and organic carbon walkley black method jackson 1973 bulk density was measured by the core method blake and hartge 1986 soil texture was determined using the bouyoucos hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 soil water retention at both field capacity and the permanent wilting point was measured using a pressure plate apparatus at 0 033 and 1 5 mpa respectively cassel and nielsen 1986 available water capacity was determined by subtracting the permanent wilting point value from field capacity value and multiplying it with bulk density and soil depth available soil n was determined by the alkaline kmno4 method subbaiah and asija 1956 which measures easily oxidizable n available p olsen p was determined by nahco3 extraction and subsequent colorimetric analysis olsen et al 1954 soil salinity was determined using electrical conductivity from saturation extract of soil samples measured in the laboratory rhoades et al 1999 as well as using bulk soil electrical conductivity ec probe model c a 6460 eijkelkamp make in the field at 30 cm depth interval up to the depth of 90 cm mandal et al 2015 in addition to measurement of ec of saturation extract we analyzed na and k by emission spectrometry ca2 and mg2 by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta titration cl by titration with agno3 hco3 by alkalinity and so4 2 by turbidimetric procedure total soluble salt content was calculated by the summation of soluble na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 contents the sodium adsorption ratio sar was calculated as ratio of na concentration to square root of half of the total concentration of ca2 and mg2 expressed in me l 1 microbial biomass measurements were made using chloroform fumigation method jenkinson and powlson 1976 jenkinson and ladd 1981 2 6 productivity assessment productivity impact of technological interventions were assessed with regard to the cropping intensity fish productivity net income and employment generated from representative fp rf and pcf systems installed in waterlogged and acid saline soils the cropping intensity was calculated by using the following equation 2 cropping intensity gross cropped area net sown area 100 we collected additional data from farmers on sowing dates and the labour and monetary requirements for all major crop management operations these included costs for land preparation sowing pest management fertilizer and irrigation application as well as harvest activities prices for inputs and grain and straw outputs were assigned as the average of three observations from independent dealers and buyers in local markets these data were combined with farmers reported local wage rates to calculate labour costs we then conducted cost benefit analysis for each farmer and crop observation 2 7 water footprints wf water footprint is expressed as the volume of water consumed or evaporated and or polluted to grow a crop per unit mass of its economic yield usually the unit is expressed as m3 t 1 or l kg 1 hoekstra and chapagain 2008 the wf has three components the green water footprint wfgreen evaporation of profile stored soil moisture or water supplied from the rain in crop production blue water footprint wfblue evaporation of the irrigation water supplied from surface and renewable groundwater sources and the gray water footprint wfgray volume of fresh water polluted in production process which represents the amount of freshwater required to mix pollutants and maintain a water quality according to agreed water quality standards water footprints of the crop wftotal m3 t 1 were thus calculated by dividing the total volume of blue green or gray water used m3 ha 1 by the quantity of grain yield of the crop t ha 1 in this study water footprint wf for each crop refers to the total volume of water consumed by the crop in terms of actual evapotranspiration aet and the evaporation loss during land preparation for that crop we estimated all the three components of wf i e wfblue wfgreen and wfgray in the present study aet estimated through water balance for each crop and the evaporation loss during land preparation of that crop was considered as the total amount of green and blue water required for that crop wfgreen was calculated as wfgreen wfblue irrigation water supplied for that crop gray water was estimated as the amount of excess water needed to leach out the salt deposited due to capillary rise of sub surface groundwater singh and kundu 2003 estimated that leaching with 1 62 cm of water removed 100 of total salt and brought down ec below 4 ds m 1 in 0 40 cm soil layer of coastal saline soil we also used a leaching requirement of 1 62 cm of water met out from the early rainy season rain as grey water footprint to remove the excess salt from the field water used for fish production in pond and furrows is harvested rainwater and the evaporation at potential rate from this ofr was considered as water footprint for fish and it is green water footprint as no irrigation water was used for fish production since the water outflows like seepage percolation etc are not a loss to the catchment and again can be reused in the same area these types of water losses were not be included for water footprint or virtual water flow accounting kar et al 2016 fishes live in water and have no need for extra water except for the limited water it absorbs and releases for its maintenance which is considered negligible water footprint for each land shaping system was calculated on yearly basis based on the area weighted value of each crop et evaporation loss from ofr for fish water footprint the water required leaching out the salt and the area weighted value of evaporation loss during fallow period the constant 10 was used to convert mm into m3 ha 1 for kharif rice crop we considered that the entire et was met from rainfall i e aet etgreen for other crops irrigation was applied as and when required rabi winter season crop is an irrigated system and we allowed optimal timing of irrigation water productivity was expressed as physical productivity of water in kilogram of crop per m3 of water diverted or depleted kg m 3 i e sum of effective rainfall and irrigation yields were obtained from a minimum of 10 m2 and were moisture corrected 2 8 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was computed to compare the mean values of various parameters under different interventions significant difference was assessed at probability level of 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance study comparison between the observed and simulated values of the soil water content in the active root zone under rabi maize and water depth under kharif rice crop in farm pond system during 2012 showed a close similarity figs 3 and 4 the rainfall recorded annually was 1583 2164 and 1368 mm during 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively thus showing large variation among years the rainfall received during these three consecutive years was normal within long period average lpa cv excess lpa cv and deficit lpa cv respectively table 2 the numbers of rainy days were 72 83 and 73 during 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively the pattern of fluctuation of the soil water content values throughout the growing season revealed that during the periods when there was an absence of rainfall a gradual depletion of soil water content in the root zone was observed conversely whenever there was any rainfall during the crop growing season the soil water content in the root zone was observed to increase total rainfall received during maize crop was 130 9 mm and the crop was irrigated regularly with 7 irrigations each with 25 mm and aet 289 26 mm during entire crop growth period was almost equal to pet 289 93 mm kharif rice was grown as rainfed crop and received a rainfall of 984 8 mm out of which 441 93 mm was lost from the field as runoff during the year 2012 the kharif crop didn t suffer any water stress and aet 482 98 mm was equal to pet during entire crop growth period the same two layer water balance model was used to estimate the root zone soil moisture level within a topo sequence in semiarid alfisol soils of india mandal et al 2007 the model was easy to parameterize as it only required knowledge of soil water holding capacity rooting depth crop growth stages and weather data 3 1 1 runoff analysis the runoff generated was highest during 2013 among the three years studied period as rainfall and rainy days were the highest during this year table 2 out of the three land shaping systems maximum runoff harvested was under fp followed by rf and lowest under pcf system on an average the amount of harvested runoff was 2709 1650 and 1169 m3 of water in fp rf and pcf systems respectively as the region received a good amount of rainfall the harvested total rainwater harvested runoff rainfall at ofr per year was calculated as 4069 3970 and 2006 m3 in fp rf and pcf land shaping systems respectively though the year 2013 received excess annual rainfall maximum runoff was harvested during 2012 in case of fp system whereas it was during 2014 in case of rf and pcf when the year 2014 was a deficit rainfall year the amount of collected runoff in each land shaping system depend on the intra seasonal rainfall distribution rather than the total amount of annual rainfall around 42 26 and 39 of harvested rainwater in case of fp rf and pcf systems were used for irrigation under different land shaping systems 332 mm 496 mm of rainwater which accounts 19 29 of average annual rainfall goes out as runoff whereas under rice rice and rice fallow system around 29 35 of rainfall goes out as runoff and the field remain waterlogged for a long time even after harvest of kharif rice crop 3 1 2 water depth and soil moisture contents the depth of submergence recorded for both coastal low land as well as land under land shaping closely followed the rainfall pattern of the region fig 5 during the rainy season 24 39 smw smw standard meteorological week the depth of submergence ranged from 8 to 49 cm in coastal low land under rice monocrop system compared with 4 38 cm and 3 27 cm in low and medium land conditions under land shaping systems besides that the low land without land shaping remained inundated up to 19 cm till 48 smw whereas most of the water drained out after 45 smw under land shaping situation due to poor or non existence of drainage facilities flat topography low lying lands and heavy rainfall the fields under rice monocrop system remained waterlogged with a depth of more than 30 cm from july to october much of the coastal fringe is enclosed by embankments and experience post monsoon waterlogging that delays rabi season crop establishment resulting in suboptimal crop performance out of three land shaping systems under study the fp is perennial and holds water throughout the year for fish farming whereas the furrow and ditch of other two systems i e rf and pcf almost dry out as the water depth going down below 10 cm during the month of march after 12 smw fig 5 as soon as the monsoon breaks rainwater start accumulating from 24th smw in the on farm reservoir from september 2nd week to november 2nd week most of the ofrs remain full temporal variation in soil moisture content in the root zone layer was estimated for 52 smw in uplands of fp and ridge in rf and dike in pcf systems fig 6 on an average the upland soils under fp soils in ridge under rf and soils in dike under pcf system hold 26 6 24 6 and 23 6 soil moisture v v respectively throughout the year whereas dominant rice mono crop systems had only 14 2 soil moisture in the root zone during dry period of 1 27 smw high land under fp system had slightly 1 2 higher moisture than rf and pcf system up to february when water was available for irrigation in all the land shaping systems after february hardly any water was available for irrigation under rf and pcf systems during 9 15 smw in high land condition of the fp system the soil moisture was 6 15 higher than in other land shaping systems because of irrigation opportunity under the fp system in rice monocrop system there was 9 17 less soil moisture than in raised land of the other land shaping systems during dry period up to june after that as the monsoon breaks rice monocrop system had higher moisture and submergence took place from july onwards during rainy season from 28 to 49 smw the flat low land under rice monocrop system remained under saturation submergence in contrast during heavy rainfall raised beds remained above the saturation point only for few hours days before attaining the field moisture capacity in case of upland situation under vegetable cultivation though the monsoon rain was 2 3 times the pet requirement the crop sometimes suffered intermittent dry spells and one or two irrigation was applied to meet its et demand in coastal areas one of the primary concerns is the tackling of surface water congestion during the monsoon period as a major portion of the land becomes heavily waterlogged the main factors that contribute to waterlogging in these regions are heavy and intensive rainfall and impeded natural drainage because of their distinct physiography and relief rao and ambast 1996 the technology for the improvement of agricultural productivity in these areas primarily concerns with the tackling of surface water congestion in the monsoon season outlet availability for gravity drainage is limited due to flat and low lying topography field drainage systems are practically non existent which is partly due to low density of the main drainage network and partly to the small size of the holding about 0 3 ha or less land owners or share croppers are therefore not inclined to sacrifice land for a more intensive network of drainage canals the rice fields in the higher parts of the land are usually not bunded and runoff from these parts also contributes to the waterlogging problems in the lower reaches which along with in situ intense rain further aggravate the problem the drainage development is still at the stage of flood control rather than to meet agricultural requirements some improvement in crop production under land shaping systems was achieved by introducing improved crop planning based on rainfall patterns for different land situations and adapting relatively high yielding varieties our results confirmed that construction of ofr in farm area through land shaping reduced the water depth in rice field than the farmers practice and ultimately reduced drainage congestion in the surrounding areas fig 5 as farmers were getting excess rainwater as irrigation in the field to overcome intermittent drought assured availability of water in ofr encouraged farmers to maintain desirable water regime for high yielding crops and adopt modern agricultural practices the soil moisture regime in the raised bed under land shaping systems during 22 to 52 smw was within the available range of 18 32 which created great opportunity to raise vegetables and other arable crops even during the intense rainy season during the pre monsoon rains the rabi crops were less affected by excess moisture under land shaping systems than in level fields the salinity of the harvested rainwater in the different land shaping systems was monitored periodically fig 7 the highest salinity was observed during dry months and it decreased to lowest value during the monsoon months salinity of water indicated that it was suitable for irrigation as well as for the fish cultivation 3 2 assessing soil properties there was no statistically significant p 0 05 variation in soil ph between the seasons soils collected from different sites under different land configuration exhibited variation of ph between neutral to acidic range the ph during winter ranged between 5 23 and 6 33 with a mean value of 5 75 table 3 the ph was slightly higher during summer than in winter and it varied between 5 54 and 6 72 with a mean value of 6 18 in all the systems the salinity build up in soil under different land situations showed seasonal variability soil salinity of the saturation paste extract ece was 4 ds m 1 in all the systems just after kharif season during winter ece ranged from 2 1 ds m 1 under low land situation in fp system to 3 82 ds m 1 in rice fallow system salinity increased in all the land use systems as the summer progressed and it ranged between 2 62 and 9 77 ds m 1 with a mean value of 4 18 this was mainly due to upward capillary rise of saline groundwater present at shallow depth 2 m during dry season following evaporation from the soil surface which resulted in gradual accumulation of salts in the surface depth it was observed that the salinity build up in the soil of different land shaping area was relatively less compared to original salt affected coastal low land under monocrop rice system less soil salinity in the land shaping systems might be due to increased distance between the saline groundwater table and the surface soil resulting in decreased accumulation of salt through upward capillary flow and or due to the presence of harvested rainwater in ofr the soil at the base of ridges dikes raised beds remained almost saturated with fresh water as long as there was harvested water available in the ofr thereby lowering the soil water potential and less upward capillary movement of saline groundwater the irrigation during rabi season also kept the soil wet and not allowing it to dry immediately after kharif thereby preventing salinity build up under different land shaping models as well as rice rice system bulk soil salinity eca measured up to 90 cm depth varied between 1 06 1 96 ds m 1 during winter to 1 24 2 45 ds m 1 during summer bulk soil salinity increased with the increase in the depth during both the season fig 8 the results indicated that in land shaping systems not only the surface soils but also the soils at higher depth around 90 cm was less saline than rice monocrop system a calibration curve was developed between eca and ece for the studied soils the data showed a high degree of correlation r2 0 782 ece 2 659xeca 0 167 assessing in situ soil salinity in root depth using bulk soil ec probe is quick reliable and easy to take measurement to understand the spatio temporal variability of soil salinity for management decisions there was a seasonal effect on soluble ionic composition of soils the concentration of all cations and anions studied were comparatively more during the summer season than in winter season na accounted for the highest percentages of total soluble cations content ranging from 48 5 to 70 7 during winter and 46 1 to 63 5 during summer and it was highest in rice monocrop system after na mg2 was the dominant cation followed by ca2 and k among the anions cl was the dominant anion followed by so4 2 and hco3 the carbonate co3 2 content was negligible in most of the soil samples and data has not been presented the percentage of cl so4 2 and hco3 content to total soluble anions ranged from 32 3 to 57 7 36 2 to 58 0 and 6 to 10 4 respectively during winter and 34 2 to 53 7 38 2 to 55 5 and 7 2 to 13 6 respectively during summer soil total soluble salt content varied from 1 003 to 1 7 g l 1 during winter and increased to 1 49 to 5 19 g l 1 during summer fig 9 sar greatly differed under different land shaping systems which ranged from 4 02 to 10 28 during winter and increased to 4 59 to 13 56 during summer sar was significantly higher in rice monocrop system than in other land shaping systems these findings agree with previous reports on the soils of the studied region bandyopadhyay et al 2003 tripathi et al 2007 under land shaping systems increased cropping intensity reduced the ec indicating that it promoted the downward movement of salts and reduced the soil salinity in surface soil compared with rice monocrop system the sar in different land shaping situations reduced by 39 during winter and 54 3 during summer whereas in rice rice system the reduction was 13 6 during winter and 26 8 during summer salt affected soils can be influenced easily by land management practices than other soil types and selecting suitable land use to restore the degraded soils caused by soil salinization is the essential prerequisite of sustainable agriculture in a specific region yu et al 2018 the ratios of na cl so4 2 and hco3 cl so4 2 for the entire study area were 1 thus application of amendments e g gypsum was not required instead continuous natural leaching through rainwater impounding reclaimed the aila affected agricultural lands under land shaping situation improved drainage of the raised beds removed salts and toxic substances from the raised beds over time because raised beds provide better opportunities to leach salts from the soil bakker et al 2010 the regression analysis between ece with different soluble ions and sar showed highly significant linear regression relationships fig 10 the slope values of regression relationship indicated that cl so4 2 as anion and na followed by mg2 and ca2 as cation in soil solution are responsible for salinity the results indicated that nacl followed by mgso4 are the dominant soluble salts in studied regions subba rao et al 2011 mentioned that nacl and na2so4 are important soluble salts with abundance of soluble cations free from sodicity problems are in general characteristics in most of the coastal soils of india the ionic radius as well as charge density of na and cl are similar and same is the case for mg2 and so4 2 which leads to formation of salts like nacl and mgso4 in soil solution zhang and norton 2002 soil ec is highly correlated to different soluble salt content and thus was broadly used as the reliable and easily measured indicator of soil salinity herrero and castaneda 2013 the problems of soil salinity in raised land may be cured by surface drainage and disposal of water with dissolved salts via the basins such lands are less susceptible to resalinization during the dry season as evident from lower soluble salts in high land situation of different land shaping systems fig 9 during kharif season the raised beds under different land shaping situations remained below the saturation level while the surrounding areas were under varying levels of submergence because of low flat topography the bunds also prevented intrusion of seawater directly into the fresh water rainwater harvested in the furrows as was evidenced from relatively lower chloride and sulphate concentrations we also studied the soil fertility level and all land use systems had high 0 75 organic c contents table 4 the organic c levels in coastal soils were higher compared to other tropical indian soils rice is the dominant cropping system in coastal region during kharif season except in high land situation where farmers grow vegetables round the year in all other situations farmers were growing paddy during kharif the fields remain submerged for more than 6 months in the region that reduce the rate of organic matter decomposition and thus maintain high level of soil organic c available soil n was low 280 kg ha 1 across the land use systems farmers in the coastal region hardly apply any fertilizer or very low doses 100 kg ha 1 of urea of nitrogenous fertilizer during kharif season not only for rice but even for vegetables because of high risk of crop failure and poor economic condition obviously soil n level was low in all the land use systems table 4 available p was medium to high in all the land use systems and maybe because of continuous application of diammonium phosphate fertilizer dap which might have contributed to the build up of high level of available p in these soils all the soils were rich in available k the bulk density bd of the soil varied from 1 47 to 1 60 mg m 3 and it was lowest in rice rice system whereas highest bd was recorded under low land situation in pcf system bulk density of the soils was relatively high though the soils have higher organic matter as the regions have inceptisols with heavy textured soils the saline coastal soils are dominated by sodium salts and the exchange phase is dominated by na rengasamy 2016 the adsorption of na in the exchange phase from soil water depends on the proportion of divalent cations in soil solution usually indicated by sar water molecules react with the adsorbed cations on soil particles inducing a weakening of soil aggregates and as a consequence aggregates slake and clay particles disperse in addition to sodium the soils have high k and mg2 which can also increase soil swelling and dispersion of soil clays resulting in reduced water and air flow high soil strength and soil crusting the highest levels of microbial biomass carbon mbc were detected in soils of ridges in rf system the mbc of soils collected from different land use systems varied from 188 to 376 μg g 1 the leftover stubble and root masses of the crops under different land shaping models with higher cropping intensity increased the organic c status of the soil higher level of organic c dictated the trend of soil mbc due to higher substrate availability to microorganisms tripathi et al 2007 in soils under land shaping situations in addition the lowest mbc in rice monocrop system could be attributed to soil desiccation during summer under fallow van gestel et al 1992 as well as increase in salinity batra and manna 1997 rietz and haynes 2003 3 3 economics agronomic productivity of land shaping system installed in coastal waterlogged soils was significantly more than that of land without land modification table 5 the land shaping systems constructed from excavated soil facilitated the drainage of excess water and created better soil physical conditions for improved crop growth this was evidenced from the successful cultivation of different vegetables even during the rainy season and integration of fish culture in the production system vegetable grown in the raised bed accounted for 43 54 and 27 and fish contributed 24 22 and 14 of the total farm income under fp rf and pcf systems respectively the harvested rainwater in furrows trenches and ponds was used for providing 6 7 irrigations each of 25 mm depth for crops grown during the dry season the system also provided ample scope for crop diversification thereby increasing the cropping intensity up to 178 205 compared with that of only 100 cropping intensity under farmers practice without any interventions year round crop cultivation and fish culture enhanced employment generation of 218 227 man days under land shaping systems than control rice monocrop with 87 man days and rice rice with 162 man days thus integrated system had higher b c ratio and net farm income increased from inr indian rupee one us dollar 69 rupees 19 168 ha 1 in rice monocrop system to inr 0 87 1 43 lakhs ha 1 under land shaping systems therefore improvement in degraded land and diversification of agricultural systems because of different interventions increased productivity and livelihood security of population in coastal degraded lands of sundarbans 3 4 water footprint productivity water productivity based on grain yields were highest in rf followed by fp pcf and rice rice system and lowest in control under rice monocrop the lowest wf was recorded under fp system table 6 on the other hand the wf was higher under rice monocrop system without any intervention of land shaping techniques rice was grown during kharif as rainfed crop no blue water was used for its growth and the grey water was used to leach out excess salt that had accumulated during summer the computation of water productivity and wf was introduced in the present study as a metric to assess water use in the production of important commodities in a system perspective and was considered to be a comprehensive indicator from the standpoint of better water management green water is the infiltrated rainfall held in the root zone soil it rarely has competitive users whereas blue water has several e g industry and households the opportunity cost of green water is low compared with that of blue water liu et al 2009 thus sustainable water usage encourages the use of green water instead of blue water in land shaping system the entire blue water used is harvested rainwater accumulated in ofr whereas under rice rice irrigated system groundwater plays the central role in water supply there is necessary to distinguish groundwater in blue water component for better water use study wang et al 2015 this study established a relationship between crop wf and agricultural land use in a system perspective to give support to the development and implementation of policies on agricultural land use and water management the overall aim was to alleviate water stress and to ensure sustainable cropping system intensification in the vulnerable coastal regions of india in most cases water policies focused mainly on the management of blue water whereas green water management was often marginalized by water resource planners measures for green water utilization through rainwater harvesting should be emphasized for sustainable water management policies in sundarbans region in rainfed agriculture drought is a common phenomenon due to either a late onset or early withdrawal of monsoon or dry spells within the cropping season not only in semi arid and sub humid agroecosystems dry spells short periods of drought during critical growth stages occur in almost every rainy season even in the moist sub humid sundarbans region in many cases crop failures primarily due to drought might be prevented through better water management at the farm level during periods when rainfall is insufficient supplemental irrigation systems which are ex situ water harvesting systems ensure providing essential soil moisture to secure a good harvest supplemental irrigation a key strategy for unlocking rainfed yield potential and water productivity is however still underused rockstrom et al 2010 capturing runoff may also help prevent land degradation from water erosion improve water quality and allow use of harvested rainwater for supplemental irrigation as well as to control salt accumulation in the surface layer the land shaping models installed in the degraded areas not only favoured drainage but also lowered ec and improved soil quality while maintaining sufficient moisture in the surface soils therefore the system is suitable for crop diversification in low lying areas of coastal degraded lands of the islands about 279 ha of low productive salt affected land in sundarbans has been converted from mono cropped to multi cropped with integrated crop and fish cultivation through implementation of different land shaping techniques cssri naip 2014 most of the farmers in coastal region depend on their land for livelihood and thus in majority of the cases these farmers are hesitant to spare a portion of their land for the water harvesting structure considering it as uneconomical hence resource poor coastal farmers may not come forward to invest in land shaping techniques in case of successful land shaping models farmers must diversify their routine crops for maximizing profits periodic flooding and cyclonic storms in the region are anticipated to accelerate with climate change as the region does not have any potential storage sites the monsoon water would be a waste due to sea level rise and intrusion of saline water coastal fresh and groundwater sources would likely become polluted salinity has become a problem over a large part of the coastal area mainly due to reduced surface water flow in the coastal rivers large scale adoption of land shaping may be solution to tackle the climate change impact in the region seasonal migration of labour to nearby cities is very common in the region and land shaping techniques check the migration of farm family by creating year round employment opportunities which have a great social impact a feasible strategy for realizing the potential of degraded coastal land in india and elsewhere appears to be intensification of integrated farming systems by harvesting a portion of the huge available surplus runoff through land shaping and using it for supplemental irrigation at the critical crop growth stages integrated with soil and water conservation practices and balanced plant nutrition 4 conclusion land shaping significantly reduced the salinity level and improved agronomic productivity of land these technological interventions also enhanced farm income increased cropping intensity and promoted crop diversification raised beds under vegetable cultivation ensured continuous supply of vegetables even during the peak monsoon period in islands and enabled quick return of the initial investment as well as providing nutritional security to the family these technological interventions also generated higher employment opportunities in this impoverished region such interventions can be extended to similar coastal areas in other parts of the country and in similar tropical island systems elsewhere accurate quantification of the impact of agricultural land use change on crop water footprint values still remains a challenging task on account of important shortcomings in the availability of data and the complexity of agricultural activities and climate variability in the areas nonetheless this study has quantified explicitly the impact of land shaping on water footprint and has uncovered a potential for alleviating water availability problems from the perspectives of agricultural land use optimization and

11098,sundarbans in west bengal india located in the eastern coast of the bay of bengal is one of the vulnerable zones subjected to abrupt climate change the region receives 2 7 times surplus rainfall as compared to crop evapotranspiration during monsoon months causing widespread waterlogging of the low lying agricultural fields and impedes the productivity the present study assessed the effects of different land shaping models namely farm pond fp deep furrow and high ridge rf and paddy cum fish pcf systems for rainwater harvesting in restoring the productivity of degraded coastal soils in sundarbans a water balance was run to estimate the soil moisture crop evapotranspiration runoff and water depth in the reservoir during normal excess and deficit rainfall years the average annual harvested runoff was 2709 1650 and 1169 m3 per hectare in fp rf and pcf systems respectively the runoff going out of the system was 19 5 29 1 and 27 75 of the annual rainfall in fp rf and pcf systems respectively whereas in monocrop rice fallow system it was 34 6 of the annual rainfall we estimated all the three components of water footprints wf i e blue wf wfblue green wf wfgreen and gray wf wfgray as an aggregative indicator to evaluate environmental impact the results indicated that total as well as the components of wf was higher in rice fallow and rice rice systems than in each of the land shaping system large scale adoption of different land shaping systems increased the cropping intensity and net farm income and there was reduction in salinity during summer and waterlogging during rainy season and overall improvement in soil quality the dominant soluble salts identified in the study region were nacl and mgso4 keywords climate change water footprint farm pond water balance coastal saline soil 1 introduction the sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove ecosystem in the world located in the southern part of west bengal india and bangladesh and lies on the delta of the ganges brahmaputra and meghna rivers in the bay of bengal renaud et al 2013 rahman et al 2011 owing to its unique geographical location this world heritage site is highly vulnerable to climate change ipcc 2007 principal degradation processes impacting these fragile ecosystems include coastal erosion seawater intrusion and inundation and salinization along with anthropogenic activities coastal impact in this region is more severe because of the low flat coastal terrain shallow coastal ocean topography in the bay of bengal high density of population low awareness of community inadequate response and preparedness and absence of hedging mechanism sadr 2007 thus productivity and ecosystem services vital to functioning and sustainability of these important biomes are severely jeopardized the lands in these islands are highly degraded due to phenomena like saline water flooding following storm and brackish groundwater table near the soil surface due to the influence of sea or saline river water burman et al 2013 in the indian sundarbans around 56 of land mass lies within the coastal low lying ecosystems with an elevation of 5 m above mean sea level some parts are even below the mean sea level the region receives high rainfall which is concentrated only over a few monsoon months june september due to this heavy concentrated rainfall in a short span flat topography low infiltration rate presence of groundwater at the surface and lack of proper drainage facility most of the cultivated fields are deeply waterlogged in kharif wet season farmers have no choice for alternate crops other than tall traditional landraces or old rice varieties in kharif sarangi et al 2015 during dry winter months acute shortage of irrigation water along with increase in soil and water salinity limits the agricultural production the coastal areas are behind many inland areas in terms of agricultural productivity and livelihood security of the farmers singh 2006 much of the coastal fringe is enclosed by bunds polders some of which experience post monsoon waterlogging that delays rabi winter season crop establishment resulting in suboptimal crop performance timothy et al 2017 the huge runoff losses of rainwater also enhance the soil erosion and wide scale land degradation of the region because of non remunerative agriculture in the region and steady growth in fishery sector many agricultural lands are getting converted to modern commercially oriented high output intensive brackish water farming which poses severe environmental threats to the region there is a need for appropriate water and land care system for coastal area to make this fragile ecosystem into climatically more resilient cyclone alia in 2009 further exposed the climatic vulnerability of agriculture in the sundarbans the area had experienced devastating floods as the ill maintained mud embankments gave way allowing the saline seawater to gush in for miles and remain stagnant for over months the saline water also intruded the sweet water ponds killing several varieties of fish and spoilt the source of irrigation during dry season thereby affecting the livelihood of large number of people living in the riverine area the stagnant water increased salinity so much that even two years after alia paddy could not be established in the region the hindu june 8 2011 therefore demand of food security economic development and climate change continue to pose diverging and often conflicting challenges for water resources management in the coastal zones of the delta le et al 2018 there are opportunities for intensification of cropping through efficient use and optimal management of water careful planning of the crop calendar and efficient agronomic practices most research efforts have consequently focused on closing yield gaps under relatively favourable irrigated conditions primarily on investigating the ways in which dry season fallowed or rainfed land use can be intensified groundwater irrigation facilities are lacking especially near the coast where shallow aquifers are mostly saline where environmental conditions are more permitting the cost of deep tube well drilling and installation is still beyond the reach of most resource poor farmers bernier et al 2016 cropping intensification of rice fallow or rainfed systems into intensified double cropping can be achieved by increasing the availability of rainwater for irrigation use particularly during winter and summer a comprehensive knowledge of climate fluctuations and corresponding adaptation strategies through rainwater harvesting is crucial for the progress towards sustainability increasing freshwater availability also pushes back oceanic saltwater intrusion during the dry season furthermore local food production is vital to an island ecosystem where majority of the people still live and depend on subsistence farming velmurugan et al 2015 icar central soil salinity research institute has developed few land shaping models for water harvesting to enhance the productivity of low lying degraded land of the region and to tackle the prolonged waterlogging during monsoon season and increasing water availability during rabi season different land forming techniques such as bunding broad bed and furrow system and rice fish culture in andaman and nicobar islands improved crop diversification by enabling multiple cropping while increasing the overall farm productivity ravisankar et al 2008 srinivasarao et al 2017 also reported that rainwater harvesting through farm pond has the potential to increase availability of water for supplemental irrigation and offers a solution to overcome the increased frequencies of drought under climate change scenario in the semiarid tropical region however it was viewed by some farmers as a waste of productive land if it was not properly intensified kumar et al 2016 therefore effectiveness of these technological interventions must be tested and fine tuned under site specific conditions prior to large scale adoption the present study was aimed to assess the effects of different land shaping models in restoring the productivity of degraded coastal soils in sundarbans the study was based on the hypothesis that improving soil drainage and maintaining water level within a specific depth would improve soil quality and agronomic productivity in coastal ecosystem we studied the hydrological impacts of rainwater harvesting in different land shaping models through water balance approach and used the water footprint as an aggregative indicator to evaluate environmental impact 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the coastal region of west bengal sundarbans the coastal region of west bengal sundarbans india is situated 21 32 22 40 n latitude and 88 05 89 00 e longitude in the district of north and south 24 parganas burman et al 2018 fig 1 the sundarbans is a unesco world heritage site two third of which is in bangladesh while rest one third is in india the region consists of 102 numbers of islands including parts of main land out of these 54 islands are inhabited and the rest are under mangrove forest the sundarbans along the bay of bengal has evolved over the millennia through natural deposition of upstream sediments accompanied by intertidal segregation the physiography is characteristically dominated by deltaic formations that include innumerable drainage lines associated with surface and subaqueous levees splays and tidal flats a large number of saline water rivers which criss cross the area influence the degree of salinity in the soil and water the climate of sundarbans is moist sub humid with hot summer and mild winter the mean maximum air temperature during summer march april and may ranges from 32 9 to 34 8 c the mean minimum temperature during winter december january and february ranges from 13 2 to 16 6 c long term climate data 1966 2015 collected at

variation coefficient of variation cv 18 8 annual report 2015 16 monsoon months june september contributed 74 4 1355 mm to the annual rainfall whereas pre monsoon march may and post monsoon october february months contributed 13 1 and 12 5 of the annual rainfall respectively pre and post monsoon rainfall meets up 45 and 51 of the evapotranspiration et0 whereas there was 2 7 times surplus rainfall than et0 during monsoon months 2 2 land shaping technology interventions different types of land shaping techniques for improving drainage facility rainwater harvesting salinity management and cultivation of crops and fishes for livelihood and environmental security have been developed to suit different land situations farm size and farmers need the details of three land shaping techniques viz farm pond fp deep furrow and high ridge rf and paddy cum fish pcf systems fig 2 which were implemented in farmers fields at basanti block of sundarbans are given in table 1 burman et al 2013 2 3 soil water balance a water balance model consisting of four sub model situations i e for non rice field rice field fallow land and on farm reservoir under each land shaping situation as well as rice monocrop and rice rice system was used to study the hydrological impact 2 3 1 soil water balance for non rice field a simple root zone soil water balance model is used for estimating the actual evapotranspiration aet of crops grown without any standing water here the soil reservoir is divided into two layers i an active layer of depth in which roots are present at any given time and from which both water extraction and drainage would occur and ii a passive layer of depth maximum root depth root depth attained any day after sowing das from which only drainage would occur the two layers are distinct in the initial phase of crop growth and their relative depths are governed by the rate of root growth however once the maximum root depth is attained the entire root zone becomes only one layer details of the model description have been described by mandal et al 2002 2007 daily rainfall data during the growing season of the crop is used as an input daily runoff is estimated from the daily rainfall data using the curve number cn technique of the soil conservation service usda 1972 and combined with the soil water accounting procedure suggested by sharpley and williams 1990 in the model evapotranspiration et occurs at a maximum rate called the potential evapotranspiration pet as long as soil water content in the root zone is more than a minimum threshold value dorrenbos and kassam 1979 when the water content falls below the threshold value the value of et i e aet becomes a decreasing function of the water content and pet to obtain pet the reference evapotranspiration et0 is multiplied by the corresponding value of the crop coefficient kc for the day et0 mm day 1 was determined using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 3 2 soil water balance of rice field rice is generally grown under continuous flooded condition with about 5 cm depth of standing water during the crop growing season for rice the inflow components in the water balance are irrigation and rainfall whereas evapotranspiration percolation and surface runoff are the outflow components the water balance equation for rice fields can be expressed as follows ambast et al 1998 1 wd r ir aet p q where wd is water depth in the field on a given day mm aet crop evapotranspiration on that day mm r amount of rainfall mm ir amount of irrigation mm p deep percolation mm q runoff mm the time period is considered as 1 day it is assumed that there is no capillary rise from groundwater in the present study rainfall in excess of bund height was considered as surface runoff in the rice field a bund height of 30 and 45 cm was considered under medium and low land situations respectively under land shaping systems whereas 55 cm bund height was considered under rice monocrop or rice rice system without land shaping during rabi season a minimum water depth of 5 cm was maintained and irrigation with 50 mm water was applied whenever the water depth goes down to 5 cm or less the daily percolation rate out of the root zone was computed for rice evapotranspiration was assumed to be equal to potential evapotranspiration as there was always standing water during the rice growing season the kc values for rice on weekly basis were obtained from tyagi et al 2000 2 3 3 soil water balance of fallow land in the absence of vegetation evaporation from fallow land occurs in two distinct stages the first stage is termed as the energy limited or constant rate stage during which evaporation proceeds at the potential rate until the water content in the surface 10 cm of soil reaches the permanent wilting point campbell and diaz 1988 the second stage is termed as the soil limited stage or falling rate stage where hydraulic transport of subsurface water to the soil surface is unable to supply water at the potential evaporation rate during this stage the soil appears partially dry and a portion of the evaporation occurs from below the soil surface the evaporation rate during this stage is equal to the square of the remaining evaporable water 2 3 4 water balance model of the on farm reservoir all inflows and outflows are considered for water budgeting of on farm reservoir ofr i e pond ditch and furrows in fp rf and pcf systems respectively the inflows are the direct rainfall in farm reservoir and surface runoff coming from the surrounding fields into it the outflows are evaporation seepage and percolation and irrigation given to the crops from the reservoir panigrahi et al 2005 evaporation loss of water depends on the water spread area in the ofr at any given storage depth the seepage and percolation loss of the ofr storage was considered at 2 mm day 1 normally farmers depending on the method of irrigation apply an irrigation depth of 20 50 mm as supplemental deficit irrigation in rainfed areas the objective of supplemental irrigation is to adequately recharge the upper dry soil profile and connect it with the moist profile prevailing in the deeper soil layers to provide continuity to the flow process sharma et al 2010 we considered irrigation depth of 25 mm as supplemental irrigation and conveyance losses zero since farmers apply irrigation through plastic pipes water balances for the four sub systems i e in fallow rice non rice and ofr were run simultaneously within each land shaping system and entire runoff was diverted towards ofr after filling up of the ofr in each land shaping system if there is any extra runoff it goes out of the system into natural drainage channels or estuary 2 4 sampling data collection for impact assessment soils were collected to a depth of 0 20 cm from high medium and low land of fp ridge and furrow areas of rf dike and low land of pcf systems as well as rice rice and rice fallow systems during december 2015 and march april 2016 each soil sample was a composite of three sub samples collected from each location rainfall data were obtained from the automatic weather station installed in the icar central soil salinity research institute regional research station canning town around 10 km away from the study area observed data of soil moisture and water depth in the field and ofr were monitored at regular intervals during 2012 to 2014 from different land shaping systems adopted by the farmers 2 5 soil analysis around 500 g from each soil sample was separately stored in refrigerator for microbiological study remaining samples were dried and sieved for the physical and chemical analyses for determining bulk density undisturbed samples were also collected in cores along with the original samples samples were analyzed for basic soil properties following the standard protocols viz ph 1 2 soil water ratio and organic carbon walkley black method jackson 1973 bulk density was measured by the core method blake and hartge 1986 soil texture was determined using the bouyoucos hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 soil water retention at both field capacity and the permanent wilting point was measured using a pressure plate apparatus at 0 033 and 1 5 mpa respectively cassel and nielsen 1986 available water capacity was determined by subtracting the permanent wilting point value from field capacity value and multiplying it with bulk density and soil depth available soil n was determined by the alkaline kmno4 method subbaiah and asija 1956 which measures easily oxidizable n available p olsen p was determined by nahco3 extraction and subsequent colorimetric analysis olsen et al 1954 soil salinity was determined using electrical conductivity from saturation extract of soil samples measured in the laboratory rhoades et al 1999 as well as using bulk soil electrical conductivity ec probe model c a 6460 eijkelkamp make in the field at 30 cm depth interval up to the depth of 90 cm mandal et al 2015 in addition to measurement of ec of saturation extract we analyzed na and k by emission spectrometry ca2 and mg2 by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta titration cl by titration with agno3 hco3 by alkalinity and so4 2 by turbidimetric procedure total soluble salt content was calculated by the summation of soluble na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 contents the sodium adsorption ratio sar was calculated as ratio of na concentration to square root of half of the total concentration of ca2 and mg2 expressed in me l 1 microbial biomass measurements were made using chloroform fumigation method jenkinson and powlson 1976 jenkinson and ladd 1981 2 6 productivity assessment productivity impact of technological interventions were assessed with regard to the cropping intensity fish productivity net income and employment generated from representative fp rf and pcf systems installed in waterlogged and acid saline soils the cropping intensity was calculated by using the following equation 2 cropping intensity gross cropped area net sown area 100 we collected additional data from farmers on sowing dates and the labour and monetary requirements for all major crop management operations these included costs for land preparation sowing pest management fertilizer and irrigation application as well as harvest activities prices for inputs and grain and straw outputs were assigned as the average of three observations from independent dealers and buyers in local markets these data were combined with farmers reported local wage rates to calculate labour costs we then conducted cost benefit analysis for each farmer and crop observation 2 7 water footprints wf water footprint is expressed as the volume of water consumed or evaporated and or polluted to grow a crop per unit mass of its economic yield usually the unit is expressed as m3 t 1 or l kg 1 hoekstra and chapagain 2008 the wf has three components the green water footprint wfgreen evaporation of profile stored soil moisture or water supplied from the rain in crop production blue water footprint wfblue evaporation of the irrigation water supplied from surface and renewable groundwater sources and the gray water footprint wfgray volume of fresh water polluted in production process which represents the amount of freshwater required to mix pollutants and maintain a water quality according to agreed water quality standards water footprints of the crop wftotal m3 t 1 were thus calculated by dividing the total volume of blue green or gray water used m3 ha 1 by the quantity of grain yield of the crop t ha 1 in this study water footprint wf for each crop refers to the total volume of water consumed by the crop in terms of actual evapotranspiration aet and the evaporation loss during land preparation for that crop we estimated all the three components of wf i e wfblue wfgreen and wfgray in the present study aet estimated through water balance for each crop and the evaporation loss during land preparation of that crop was considered as the total amount of green and blue water required for that crop wfgreen was calculated as wfgreen wfblue irrigation water supplied for that crop gray water was estimated as the amount of excess water needed to leach out the salt deposited due to capillary rise of sub surface groundwater singh and kundu 2003 estimated that leaching with 1 62 cm of water removed 100 of total salt and brought down ec below 4 ds m 1 in 0 40 cm soil layer of coastal saline soil we also used a leaching requirement of 1 62 cm of water met out from the early rainy season rain as grey water footprint to remove the excess salt from the field water used for fish production in pond and furrows is harvested rainwater and the evaporation at potential rate from this ofr was considered as water footprint for fish and it is green water footprint as no irrigation water was used for fish production since the water outflows like seepage percolation etc are not a loss to the catchment and again can be reused in the same area these types of water losses were not be included for water footprint or virtual water flow accounting kar et al 2016 fishes live in water and have no need for extra water except for the limited water it absorbs and releases for its maintenance which is considered negligible water footprint for each land shaping system was calculated on yearly basis based on the area weighted value of each crop et evaporation loss from ofr for fish water footprint the water required leaching out the salt and the area weighted value of evaporation loss during fallow period the constant 10 was used to convert mm into m3 ha 1 for kharif rice crop we considered that the entire et was met from rainfall i e aet etgreen for other crops irrigation was applied as and when required rabi winter season crop is an irrigated system and we allowed optimal timing of irrigation water productivity was expressed as physical productivity of water in kilogram of crop per m3 of water diverted or depleted kg m 3 i e sum of effective rainfall and irrigation yields were obtained from a minimum of 10 m2 and were moisture corrected 2 8 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was computed to compare the mean values of various parameters under different interventions significant difference was assessed at probability level of 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance study comparison between the observed and simulated values of the soil water content in the active root zone under rabi maize and water depth under kharif rice crop in farm pond system during 2012 showed a close similarity figs 3 and 4 the rainfall recorded annually was 1583 2164 and 1368 mm during 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively thus showing large variation among years the rainfall received during these three consecutive years was normal within long period average lpa cv excess lpa cv and deficit lpa cv respectively table 2 the numbers of rainy days were 72 83 and 73 during 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively the pattern of fluctuation of the soil water content values throughout the growing season revealed that during the periods when there was an absence of rainfall a gradual depletion of soil water content in the root zone was observed conversely whenever there was any rainfall during the crop growing season the soil water content in the root zone was observed to increase total rainfall received during maize crop was 130 9 mm and the crop was irrigated regularly with 7 irrigations each with 25 mm and aet 289 26 mm during entire crop growth period was almost equal to pet 289 93 mm kharif rice was grown as rainfed crop and received a rainfall of 984 8 mm out of which 441 93 mm was lost from the field as runoff during the year 2012 the kharif crop didn t suffer any water stress and aet 482 98 mm was equal to pet during entire crop growth period the same two layer water balance model was used to estimate the root zone soil moisture level within a topo sequence in semiarid alfisol soils of india mandal et al 2007 the model was easy to parameterize as it only required knowledge of soil water holding capacity rooting depth crop growth stages and weather data 3 1 1 runoff analysis the runoff generated was highest during 2013 among the three years studied period as rainfall and rainy days were the highest during this year table 2 out of the three land shaping systems maximum runoff harvested was under fp followed by rf and lowest under pcf system on an average the amount of harvested runoff was 2709 1650 and 1169 m3 of water in fp rf and pcf systems respectively as the region received a good amount of rainfall the harvested total rainwater harvested runoff rainfall at ofr per year was calculated as 4069 3970 and 2006 m3 in fp rf and pcf land shaping systems respectively though the year 2013 received excess annual rainfall maximum runoff was harvested during 2012 in case of fp system whereas it was during 2014 in case of rf and pcf when the year 2014 was a deficit rainfall year the amount of collected runoff in each land shaping system depend on the intra seasonal rainfall distribution rather than the total amount of annual rainfall around 42 26 and 39 of harvested rainwater in case of fp rf and pcf systems were used for irrigation under different land shaping systems 332 mm 496 mm of rainwater which accounts 19 29 of average annual rainfall goes out as runoff whereas under rice rice and rice fallow system around 29 35 of rainfall goes out as runoff and the field remain waterlogged for a long time even after harvest of kharif rice crop 3 1 2 water depth and soil moisture contents the depth of submergence recorded for both coastal low land as well as land under land shaping closely followed the rainfall pattern of the region fig 5 during the rainy season 24 39 smw smw standard meteorological week the depth of submergence ranged from 8 to 49 cm in coastal low land under rice monocrop system compared with 4 38 cm and 3 27 cm in low and medium land conditions under land shaping systems besides that the low land without land shaping remained inundated up to 19 cm till 48 smw whereas most of the water drained out after 45 smw under land shaping situation due to poor or non existence of drainage facilities flat topography low lying lands and heavy rainfall the fields under rice monocrop system remained waterlogged with a depth of more than 30 cm from july to october much of the coastal fringe is enclosed by embankments and experience post monsoon waterlogging that delays rabi season crop establishment resulting in suboptimal crop performance out of three land shaping systems under study the fp is perennial and holds water throughout the year for fish farming whereas the furrow and ditch of other two systems i e rf and pcf almost dry out as the water depth going down below 10 cm during the month of march after 12 smw fig 5 as soon as the monsoon breaks rainwater start accumulating from 24th smw in the on farm reservoir from september 2nd week to november 2nd week most of the ofrs remain full temporal variation in soil moisture content in the root zone layer was estimated for 52 smw in uplands of fp and ridge in rf and dike in pcf systems fig 6 on an average the upland soils under fp soils in ridge under rf and soils in dike under pcf system hold 26 6 24 6 and 23 6 soil moisture v v respectively throughout the year whereas dominant rice mono crop systems had only 14 2 soil moisture in the root zone during dry period of 1 27 smw high land under fp system had slightly 1 2 higher moisture than rf and pcf system up to february when water was available for irrigation in all the land shaping systems after february hardly any water was available for irrigation under rf and pcf systems during 9 15 smw in high land condition of the fp system the soil moisture was 6 15 higher than in other land shaping systems because of irrigation opportunity under the fp system in rice monocrop system there was 9 17 less soil moisture than in raised land of the other land shaping systems during dry period up to june after that as the monsoon breaks rice monocrop system had higher moisture and submergence took place from july onwards during rainy season from 28 to 49 smw the flat low land under rice monocrop system remained under saturation submergence in contrast during heavy rainfall raised beds remained above the saturation point only for few hours days before attaining the field moisture capacity in case of upland situation under vegetable cultivation though the monsoon rain was 2 3 times the pet requirement the crop sometimes suffered intermittent dry spells and one or two irrigation was applied to meet its et demand in coastal areas one of the primary concerns is the tackling of surface water congestion during the monsoon period as a major portion of the land becomes heavily waterlogged the main factors that contribute to waterlogging in these regions are heavy and intensive rainfall and impeded natural drainage because of their distinct physiography and relief rao and ambast 1996 the technology for the improvement of agricultural productivity in these areas primarily concerns with the tackling of surface water congestion in the monsoon season outlet availability for gravity drainage is limited due to flat and low lying topography field drainage systems are practically non existent which is partly due to low density of the main drainage network and partly to the small size of the holding about 0 3 ha or less land owners or share croppers are therefore not inclined to sacrifice land for a more intensive network of drainage canals the rice fields in the higher parts of the land are usually not bunded and runoff from these parts also contributes to the waterlogging problems in the lower reaches which along with in situ intense rain further aggravate the problem the drainage development is still at the stage of flood control rather than to meet agricultural requirements some improvement in crop production under land shaping systems was achieved by introducing improved crop planning based on rainfall patterns for different land situations and adapting relatively high yielding varieties our results confirmed that construction of ofr in farm area through land shaping reduced the water depth in rice field than the farmers practice and ultimately reduced drainage congestion in the surrounding areas fig 5 as farmers were getting excess rainwater as irrigation in the field to overcome intermittent drought assured availability of water in ofr encouraged farmers to maintain desirable water regime for high yielding crops and adopt modern agricultural practices the soil moisture regime in the raised bed under land shaping systems during 22 to 52 smw was within the available range of 18 32 which created great opportunity to raise vegetables and other arable crops even during the intense rainy season during the pre monsoon rains the rabi crops were less affected by excess moisture under land shaping systems than in level fields the salinity of the harvested rainwater in the different land shaping systems was monitored periodically fig 7 the highest salinity was observed during dry months and it decreased to lowest value during the monsoon months salinity of water indicated that it was suitable for irrigation as well as for the fish cultivation 3 2 assessing soil properties there was no statistically significant p 0 05 variation in soil ph between the seasons soils collected from different sites under different land configuration exhibited variation of ph between neutral to acidic range the ph during winter ranged between 5 23 and 6 33 with a mean value of 5 75 table 3 the ph was slightly higher during summer than in winter and it varied between 5 54 and 6 72 with a mean value of 6 18 in all the systems the salinity build up in soil under different land situations showed seasonal variability soil salinity of the saturation paste extract ece was 4 ds m 1 in all the systems just after kharif season during winter ece ranged from 2 1 ds m 1 under low land situation in fp system to 3 82 ds m 1 in rice fallow system salinity increased in all the land use systems as the summer progressed and it ranged between 2 62 and 9 77 ds m 1 with a mean value of 4 18 this was mainly due to upward capillary rise of saline groundwater present at shallow depth 2 m during dry season following evaporation from the soil surface which resulted in gradual accumulation of salts in the surface depth it was observed that the salinity build up in the soil of different land shaping area was relatively less compared to original salt affected coastal low land under monocrop rice system less soil salinity in the land shaping systems might be due to increased distance between the saline groundwater table and the surface soil resulting in decreased accumulation of salt through upward capillary flow and or due to the presence of harvested rainwater in ofr the soil at the base of ridges dikes raised beds remained almost saturated with fresh water as long as there was harvested water available in the ofr thereby lowering the soil water potential and less upward capillary movement of saline groundwater the irrigation during rabi season also kept the soil wet and not allowing it to dry immediately after kharif thereby preventing salinity build up under different land shaping models as well as rice rice system bulk soil salinity eca measured up to 90 cm depth varied between 1 06 1 96 ds m 1 during winter to 1 24 2 45 ds m 1 during summer bulk soil salinity increased with the increase in the depth during both the season fig 8 the results indicated that in land shaping systems not only the surface soils but also the soils at higher depth around 90 cm was less saline than rice monocrop system a calibration curve was developed between eca and ece for the studied soils the data showed a high degree of correlation r2 0 782 ece 2 659xeca 0 167 assessing in situ soil salinity in root depth using bulk soil ec probe is quick reliable and easy to take measurement to understand the spatio temporal variability of soil salinity for management decisions there was a seasonal effect on soluble ionic composition of soils the concentration of all cations and anions studied were comparatively more during the summer season than in winter season na accounted for the highest percentages of total soluble cations content ranging from 48 5 to 70 7 during winter and 46 1 to 63 5 during summer and it was highest in rice monocrop system after na mg2 was the dominant cation followed by ca2 and k among the anions cl was the dominant anion followed by so4 2 and hco3 the carbonate co3 2 content was negligible in most of the soil samples and data has not been presented the percentage of cl so4 2 and hco3 content to total soluble anions ranged from 32 3 to 57 7 36 2 to 58 0 and 6 to 10 4 respectively during winter and 34 2 to 53 7 38 2 to 55 5 and 7 2 to 13 6 respectively during summer soil total soluble salt content varied from 1 003 to 1 7 g l 1 during winter and increased to 1 49 to 5 19 g l 1 during summer fig 9 sar greatly differed under different land shaping systems which ranged from 4 02 to 10 28 during winter and increased to 4 59 to 13 56 during summer sar was significantly higher in rice monocrop system than in other land shaping systems these findings agree with previous reports on the soils of the studied region bandyopadhyay et al 2003 tripathi et al 2007 under land shaping systems increased cropping intensity reduced the ec indicating that it promoted the downward movement of salts and reduced the soil salinity in surface soil compared with rice monocrop system the sar in different land shaping situations reduced by 39 during winter and 54 3 during summer whereas in rice rice system the reduction was 13 6 during winter and 26 8 during summer salt affected soils can be influenced easily by land management practices than other soil types and selecting suitable land use to restore the degraded soils caused by soil salinization is the essential prerequisite of sustainable agriculture in a specific region yu et al 2018 the ratios of na cl so4 2 and hco3 cl so4 2 for the entire study area were 1 thus application of amendments e g gypsum was not required instead continuous natural leaching through rainwater impounding reclaimed the aila affected agricultural lands under land shaping situation improved drainage of the raised beds removed salts and toxic substances from the raised beds over time because raised beds provide better opportunities to leach salts from the soil bakker et al 2010 the regression analysis between ece with different soluble ions and sar showed highly significant linear regression relationships fig 10 the slope values of regression relationship indicated that cl so4 2 as anion and na followed by mg2 and ca2 as cation in soil solution are responsible for salinity the results indicated that nacl followed by mgso4 are the dominant soluble salts in studied regions subba rao et al 2011 mentioned that nacl and na2so4 are important soluble salts with abundance of soluble cations free from sodicity problems are in general characteristics in most of the coastal soils of india the ionic radius as well as charge density of na and cl are similar and same is the case for mg2 and so4 2 which leads to formation of salts like nacl and mgso4 in soil solution zhang and norton 2002 soil ec is highly correlated to different soluble salt content and thus was broadly used as the reliable and easily measured indicator of soil salinity herrero and castaneda 2013 the problems of soil salinity in raised land may be cured by surface drainage and disposal of water with dissolved salts via the basins such lands are less susceptible to resalinization during the dry season as evident from lower soluble salts in high land situation of different land shaping systems fig 9 during kharif season the raised beds under different land shaping situations remained below the saturation level while the surrounding areas were under varying levels of submergence because of low flat topography the bunds also prevented intrusion of seawater directly into the fresh water rainwater harvested in the furrows as was evidenced from relatively lower chloride and sulphate concentrations we also studied the soil fertility level and all land use systems had high 0 75 organic c contents table 4 the organic c levels in coastal soils were higher compared to other tropical indian soils rice is the dominant cropping system in coastal region during kharif season except in high land situation where farmers grow vegetables round the year in all other situations farmers were growing paddy during kharif the fields remain submerged for more than 6 months in the region that reduce the rate of organic matter decomposition and thus maintain high level of soil organic c available soil n was low 280 kg ha 1 across the land use systems farmers in the coastal region hardly apply any fertilizer or very low doses 100 kg ha 1 of urea of nitrogenous fertilizer during kharif season not only for rice but even for vegetables because of high risk of crop failure and poor economic condition obviously soil n level was low in all the land use systems table 4 available p was medium to high in all the land use systems and maybe because of continuous application of diammonium phosphate fertilizer dap which might have contributed to the build up of high level of available p in these soils all the soils were rich in available k the bulk density bd of the soil varied from 1 47 to 1 60 mg m 3 and it was lowest in rice rice system whereas highest bd was recorded under low land situation in pcf system bulk density of the soils was relatively high though the soils have higher organic matter as the regions have inceptisols with heavy textured soils the saline coastal soils are dominated by sodium salts and the exchange phase is dominated by na rengasamy 2016 the adsorption of na in the exchange phase from soil water depends on the proportion of divalent cations in soil solution usually indicated by sar water molecules react with the adsorbed cations on soil particles inducing a weakening of soil aggregates and as a consequence aggregates slake and clay particles disperse in addition to sodium the soils have high k and mg2 which can also increase soil swelling and dispersion of soil clays resulting in reduced water and air flow high soil strength and soil crusting the highest levels of microbial biomass carbon mbc were detected in soils of ridges in rf system the mbc of soils collected from different land use systems varied from 188 to 376 μg g 1 the leftover stubble and root masses of the crops under different land shaping models with higher cropping intensity increased the organic c status of the soil higher level of organic c dictated the trend of soil mbc due to higher substrate availability to microorganisms tripathi et al 2007 in soils under land shaping situations in addition the lowest mbc in rice monocrop system could be attributed to soil desiccation during summer under fallow van gestel et al 1992 as well as increase in salinity batra and manna 1997 rietz and haynes 2003 3 3 economics agronomic productivity of land shaping system installed in coastal waterlogged soils was significantly more than that of land without land modification table 5 the land shaping systems constructed from excavated soil facilitated the drainage of excess water and created better soil physical conditions for improved crop growth this was evidenced from the successful cultivation of different vegetables even during the rainy season and integration of fish culture in the production system vegetable grown in the raised bed accounted for 43 54 and 27 and fish contributed 24 22 and 14 of the total farm income under fp rf and pcf systems respectively the harvested rainwater in furrows trenches and ponds was used for providing 6 7 irrigations each of 25 mm depth for crops grown during the dry season the system also provided ample scope for crop diversification thereby increasing the cropping intensity up to 178 205 compared with that of only 100 cropping intensity under farmers practice without any interventions year round crop cultivation and fish culture enhanced employment generation of 218 227 man days under land shaping systems than control rice monocrop with 87 man days and rice rice with 162 man days thus integrated system had higher b c ratio and net farm income increased from inr indian rupee one us dollar 69 rupees 19 168 ha 1 in rice monocrop system to inr 0 87 1 43 lakhs ha 1 under land shaping systems therefore improvement in degraded land and diversification of agricultural systems because of different interventions increased productivity and livelihood security of population in coastal degraded lands of sundarbans 3 4 water footprint productivity water productivity based on grain yields were highest in rf followed by fp pcf and rice rice system and lowest in control under rice monocrop the lowest wf was recorded under fp system table 6 on the other hand the wf was higher under rice monocrop system without any intervention of land shaping techniques rice was grown during kharif as rainfed crop no blue water was used for its growth and the grey water was used to leach out excess salt that had accumulated during summer the computation of water productivity and wf was introduced in the present study as a metric to assess water use in the production of important commodities in a system perspective and was considered to be a comprehensive indicator from the standpoint of better water management green water is the infiltrated rainfall held in the root zone soil it rarely has competitive users whereas blue water has several e g industry and households the opportunity cost of green water is low compared with that of blue water liu et al 2009 thus sustainable water usage encourages the use of green water instead of blue water in land shaping system the entire blue water used is harvested rainwater accumulated in ofr whereas under rice rice irrigated system groundwater plays the central role in water supply there is necessary to distinguish groundwater in blue water component for better water use study wang et al 2015 this study established a relationship between crop wf and agricultural land use in a system perspective to give support to the development and implementation of policies on agricultural land use and water management the overall aim was to alleviate water stress and to ensure sustainable cropping system intensification in the vulnerable coastal regions of india in most cases water policies focused mainly on the management of blue water whereas green water management was often marginalized by water resource planners measures for green water utilization through rainwater harvesting should be emphasized for sustainable water management policies in sundarbans region in rainfed agriculture drought is a common phenomenon due to either a late onset or early withdrawal of monsoon or dry spells within the cropping season not only in semi arid and sub humid agroecosystems dry spells short periods of drought during critical growth stages occur in almost every rainy season even in the moist sub humid sundarbans region in many cases crop failures primarily due to drought might be prevented through better water management at the farm level during periods when rainfall is insufficient supplemental irrigation systems which are ex situ water harvesting systems ensure providing essential soil moisture to secure a good harvest supplemental irrigation a key strategy for unlocking rainfed yield potential and water productivity is however still underused rockstrom et al 2010 capturing runoff may also help prevent land degradation from water erosion improve water quality and allow use of harvested rainwater for supplemental irrigation as well as to control salt accumulation in the surface layer the land shaping models installed in the degraded areas not only favoured drainage but also lowered ec and improved soil quality while maintaining sufficient moisture in the surface soils therefore the system is suitable for crop diversification in low lying areas of coastal degraded lands of the islands about 279 ha of low productive salt affected land in sundarbans has been converted from mono cropped to multi cropped with integrated crop and fish cultivation through implementation of different land shaping techniques cssri naip 2014 most of the farmers in coastal region depend on their land for livelihood and thus in majority of the cases these farmers are hesitant to spare a portion of their land for the water harvesting structure considering it as uneconomical hence resource poor coastal farmers may not come forward to invest in land shaping techniques in case of successful land shaping models farmers must diversify their routine crops for maximizing profits periodic flooding and cyclonic storms in the region are anticipated to accelerate with climate change as the region does not have any potential storage sites the monsoon water would be a waste due to sea level rise and intrusion of saline water coastal fresh and groundwater sources would likely become polluted salinity has become a problem over a large part of the coastal area mainly due to reduced surface water flow in the coastal rivers large scale adoption of land shaping may be solution to tackle the climate change impact in the region seasonal migration of labour to nearby cities is very common in the region and land shaping techniques check the migration of farm family by creating year round employment opportunities which have a great social impact a feasible strategy for realizing the potential of degraded coastal land in india and elsewhere appears to be intensification of integrated farming systems by harvesting a portion of the huge available surplus runoff through land shaping and using it for supplemental irrigation at the critical crop growth stages integrated with soil and water conservation practices and balanced plant nutrition 4 conclusion land shaping significantly reduced the salinity level and improved agronomic productivity of land these technological interventions also enhanced farm income increased cropping intensity and promoted crop diversification raised beds under vegetable cultivation ensured continuous supply of vegetables even during the peak monsoon period in islands and enabled quick return of the initial investment as well as providing nutritional security to the family these technological interventions also generated higher employment opportunities in this impoverished region such interventions can be extended to similar coastal areas in other parts of the country and in similar tropical island systems elsewhere accurate quantification of the impact of agricultural land use change on crop water footprint values still remains a challenging task on account of important shortcomings in the availability of data and the complexity of agricultural activities and climate variability in the areas nonetheless this study has quantified explicitly the impact of land shaping on water footprint and has uncovered a potential for alleviating water availability problems from the perspectives of agricultural land use optimization and

11099,the evolution of canopy traits related to maize yield increases has been well documented but the changes in the root system over decades and their relationships with the water use efficiency wue and nitrogen n use efficiency nue require further investigation in this study we analyzed the morphological and physiological characteristics of the roots as well as the water n uptake wue and nue under low water n lw ln and high water n hw hn supply levels in 11 elite inbred maize lines released in china during the 1960s 1980s and 2000s the results showed that yield improvement in the inbred lines from the 1960s to the 1980s 61 109 was greater than that in those from the 1980s to the 2000s 6 17 and the resistance to drought and low n also exhibited a significant linear increase over the decades the utilization of water and n by the inbred lines evolved efficiently and economically especially in stressful environments the improved wue of modern inbred lines was demonstrated by the higher yield and lower evapotranspiration the nue defined as the grain yield obtained per unit of n in plants increased in a linear manner over the three decades and it was accompanied by higher n accumulation in the grains and greater n translocation efficiency in the roots however the agronomic n use efficiency improved from the 1960s to the 1980s but then decreased from the 1980s to the 2000s the modern inbred lines tended to produce less redundant roots in the top 0 20 cm soil layer whereas root development was enhanced in the deeper soil layer the morphological properties of the roots dry weight length volume surface area weight density and length density tended to increase from the 1960s to the 1980s but then decreased from the 1980s to the 2000s and they had significant quadratic relationships with the yield wue and nue by contrast water n amount absorbed per unit root volume the physiological properties related to the root absorption area root activity improved over the decades where the physiological properties had positive linear relationships with the yield wue and nue thus we conclude that the maize roots evolved alongside higher yields and greater tolerance to drought and low n environments the improved wue and nue in the modern inbred lines were associated with the greater physiological absorption capacity of the roots rather than larger root size in normal or stressful environments keywords abiotic stress maize inbred line root nitrogen use efficiency water use efficiency 1 introduction maize is ranked first among the cereal crops grown throughout the world with a total planting area of 190 million hectares and production of more than 1 billion tons fao 2016 high maize yield requires large amounts of water and fertilizer however challenges due to water shortages as well as climate change wasted resources and environmental pollution caused by the excessive application of fertilizer are intensifying around the world thus enhancing the crop production pattern by greater investment in exchange for a high yield is not realistic and coordinating yield improvements with the more efficient use of water and fertilizer is essential for ensuring food security sustainably the utilization of heterosis has played an important role in improving crop yield and abiotic stress resistance in the usa the maize yield has increased by 50 60 due to breed improvement since the introduction of hybrids in 1930s duvick 2005 and genetic improvement has also improved the yield by 40 64 in china ci et al 2011 li 2009 the use of alternative hybrid varieties has enhanced the maize production related to the improvement in photosynthetic performance leaf antioxidant capacity grain filling characteristics and post silking matter transport efficiency dong et al 2000 li et al 2014 the abilities to access soil water and convert water into biomass differ greatly among maize varieties where the variations in the water use efficiency wue can be up to 30 100 shan 1994 ajani et al 2016 achieving a greater wue in maize requires the selection of genotypes in drought environments adebayo and menkir 2014 vulchinkova 2014 a recent study showed that drought tolerance traits related to plant height ear size empty ear rate and the anthesis silking interval should be decreased by selection to further improve the wue sun et al 2017 in addition to the maize yield increases over the years the tolerance of low n has been improved where the abilities to acquire mineralized soil n and utilize n are much better in the modern hybrids compared with the old hybrids and the n use efficiency nue has also been improved in low n environments chen et al 2011 ciampitti and vyn 2012 it has been demonstrated that the improved nue in modern maize hybrids is positively related to higher post silking n accumulation and the greater efficiency of n remobilization to the kernels in the usa and china haegele et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 the variations in root systems due to genetic differences greatly affect the uptake and utilization of soil water and fertilizer sattelmacher et al 1990 passioura 1983 changes in the root system architecture had greater direct impacts on the yield than changes in the canopy architecture according to a study of historical yield increases in the usa hammer et al 2009 the physiological activity of roots and the ability to resist senescence during the grain filling period have improved over time wang et al 2002 then the root distribution in maize tends to promote vertical extension and horizontal contraction to allow dense planting in the maize hybrids grown in the usa and china hammer et al 2009 wang et al 2001 however the root system is obviously larger and more developed in the maize hybrids grown in the usa compared with those in china especially in the top 60 cm soil layer yu et al 2015 comparing the changes in the yield and the tolerance of abiotic stresses in the genotypes released in different decades is useful for understanding the achievements of selective breeding the development of hybrids has been studied where the changes in the morphological and photosynthetic characteristics of the canopy related to maize productivity are well documented ci et al 2013 echarte et al 2006 wang et al 2011 thereby providing theoretical and technical guidance to facilitate breeding and cultivation improvements maize inbred lines are the basic materials used in genetic improvement and for the utilization of heterosis but few studies have investigated the changes in the physiological and ecological traits of maize inbred lines compared with the hybrids especially the changes in the roots of inbred lines that are associated with the utilization of water and n fertilizer in this study in order to understand the changes in the root systems of 11 elite inbred maize lines released during the 1960s 1980s and 2000s in china and their effects on water n uptake and utilization efficiency we analyzed the variations in the morphological and physiological characteristics of the roots wue nue and their relationships in response to different environments we hypothesized that the changes in the root parameters due to the indirect influence of selection for yield improvement may have significantly contributed to higher wue and nue levels we aimed to obtain evolution information about the morphological and physiological characteristics of the maize roots in order to facilitate the breeding and genetic improvement of highly efficient inbred lines 2

were carefully collected using the soil auger method within a root area of 25 cm 60 cm jia et al 2017 for further measurements the root samples were stored at 4 c as soon as possible after washing and removing the non root impurities the root morphological parameters comprising the root surface area root volume and root length were scanned with an epson perfection v700 scanner and analyzed with winrhizo regent instruments inc canada the root absorption area and root activity were measured using the methylene blue dyeing method and triphenyltetrazolium chloride reduction method respectively liu et al 2017a the maize samples including the root and aboveground parts were dried until constant weight in an oven at 65 c to calculate the dry weight rsr was the ratio of the root biomass relative to shoot biomass root length density or root weight density were calculated by dividing the root length or root dry weight by the sampling core volume in different soil layers ars trs was calculated as the ratio of root surface area relative to root absorption area the soil water wav or n nav amount absorbed by root were calculated by dividing the et value or n uptake in whole plant by

decade interaction and n decade interaction were not significant tables 4 and 5 yield improvement was greater in the inbred lines from the 1960s to the 1980s 61 01 108 63 compared with that from the 1980s to the 2000s 5 85 16 73 fig 2 tables 4 and 5 compared with the inbred lines from the 1960s and 1980s those from the 2000s had yield increases of 108 63 and 16 73 at lw 61 01 and 5 85 at hw 94 13 and 15 25 at ln and 74 16 and 10 08 at hn respectively these values also indicate that the yield increases in the modern inbred lines were greater in the stressful environments than the normal environment in agreement with the yield increases the resistance to drought and low n also increased significantly in a linear manner over the decades p 0 01 i e the resistances of inbred lines to drought drc were 0 33 0 40 and 0 44 in the 1960s 1980s and 2000s respectively and the resistances of inbred lines to low n lnc were 0 76 0 82 and 0 86 fig 2 3 2 root morphology and physiological properties the trends in the root morphology and physiological absorption properties were similar among the different water and n levels figs 3 and 4 drought and low n stress restrained root growth in the top 0 20 cm soil layer but promoted root growth in the 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers root size was significantly larger in the new lines than the old lines in the 0 100 cm soil layer the highest root dry weight root length root volume surface area root weight density and root length density were found in the top 0 20 cm soil layer in the inbred lines from the 1980s but in the middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers in the inbred lines from the 2000s the differences in the root morphology properties of the inbred lines released in different decades were greater in the middle and deep soil layers or and in the stressful environments the root physiological absorption properties i e root absorption area and ars trs improved over the decades in the 0 100 cm soil layer the improvements in the inbred lines from the 2000s were more evident in the 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers figs 3 and 4 the inbred lines from the 2000s maintained higher root activities compared with those from the 1960s and the 1980s after silking and the differences in the 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers increased with the number of days after silking fig 5 the modern inbred lines enhanced the root absorption ability more obviously in the stressful environments than the normal environments i e the average root absorption area ars trs and root activity in the inbred lines from the 2000s increased by 129 89 59 34 and 29 24 at lw by 73 10 52 45 and 28 65 at hw by 121 80 57 20 and 26 57 at ln and by 75 42 47 95 and 22 26 at hn respectively compared with those from the 1960s and these increases were 30 96 31 66 and 13 67 at lw 14 60 21 21 and 12 49 at hw 18 11 20 18 and 12 22 at ln and 12 33 19 69 and 10 29 at hn respectively compared with those from the 1980s drought and low n decreased the root morphological properties but increased rsr there was a significant quadratic relationship in terms of rsr for the inbred lines released in different decades p 0 001 fig 6 the water n amount absorbed per unit root volume wav nav increased in a linear manner over the three decades wav increased by 14 98 and 5 87 from the 1960s to the 2000s and from the 1980s to the 2000s at lw respectively by 11 95 and 4 30 at hw by 41 33 and 22 77 at ln and by 27 88 and 17 67 at hn fig 6 3 3 et and wue at lw or hw et increased in the inbred lines from the 1960s to the 1980s but decreased from the 1980s to the 2000s where there was a significant quadratic relationship at p 0 01 fig 7 by contrast wueb and wuey increased in a linear manner over the decades whereas wuc decreased in a linear manner compared with the inbred lines from the 1960s and 1980s wueb increased by 39 60 and 10 88 at lw in those from the 2000s respectively and by 31 78 and 8 48 at hw while wuey increased by 51 30 and 19 36 at lw and by 32 62 and 18 01 at hw and wuc decreased by 45 17 and 13 95 at lw and by 28 54 and 14 88 at hw thus a higher maize yield was obtained from the same amount of water by the new lines than the old lines and the wue changes especially in drought stress environments 3 4 n uptake translocation and nue the inbred lines from the 1980s and 2000s had much higher n uptake rates than those from the 1960s at both the ln and hn levels fig 8 the total n uptake rates by the inbred lines from the 1980s and 2000s increased by 50 00 and 69 50 compared with those from the 1960s at ln which were more significant than those at hn i e by 39 74 and 49 17 respectively the maize produced by the inbred lines from the1980s had a larger vegetative mass compared with those from the 2000s with increases in the n uptake rates by the roots stems and leaves by contrast the increases in the amount of n uptake by the inbred lines from the 2000s were mainly due to higher n accumulation in the grains compared with those from the 1980s the n translocation amount and translocation efficiency in the roots and aboveground parts increased significantly over the decades especially at ln the improvements in the translocation efficiency by the inbred lines from the 1980s and 2000s were more remarkable in the roots than the aboveground parts compared those from the 1960s fig 9 the nhi values were 15 36 and 10 49 higher in the inbred lines from the 2000s than those from the 1960s and 1980s at ln respectively and 14 79 and 10 05 higher at hn the nue values were 16 38 and 18 84 higher in the inbred lines from the 2000s compared with those from the 1960s p 0 05 at ln and hn respectively however nue did not improve significantly from the 1980s to the 2000s p 0 05 at ln and hn respectively fig 10 ae are and pe increased by 23 35 27 03 and 2 88 from the 1960s to the 1980s but decreased by 13 90 8 36 and 6 04 from the 1980s to the 2000s with a quadratic relationship pep increased in a linear manner where the pep values for the inbred lines from the 2000s were 74 16 and 10 08 higher compared with those from the 1960s and 1980s respectively p 0 01 3 5 root properties related to yield wue and nue the root properties had strong relationships with the maize yield soil water n uptake wue and nue however larger roots did not result in higher yields figs 11 and 12 wue fig 13 or nue fig 14 in the normal or stressful environments the yield wue and nue decreased in a linear manner with rsr but the r 2 was lower than 0 4 the root morphological properties i e root weight root length total surface area root volume and wav nav had significant quadratic relationships with the yield wue and nue p 0 01 the root physiological absorption properties i e absorption area ars trs root activity had positive linear relationships with the yield wue and nue and the correlations with the root physiological absorption properties r 0 6752 0 9779 p 0 01 were stronger than those with the morphological properties r 0 5875 0 9707 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 changes in yield and tolerance of stress over the decades the grain yield is an important criterion when assessing the tolerance of drought or low n it is acknowledged that the newer hybrids yield more than the older hybrids because of continual improvements in their ability to resist abiotic stresses ci et al 2013 duvick 2005 li et al 2015 the results of this study indicate that drc and lnc increased in a linear manner over the decades p 0 01 and the yield improvements in the inbred lines from the 1960s to the 1980s 61 01 108 63 were greater than those in the lines from the 1980s to the 2000s 5 85 16 73 furthermore we found that the modern inbred lines had higher yields than the older lines in the stressful and normal environments duvick 2005 and sun et al 2017 obtained similar results based on comparisons of hybrids released in different years in the usa and china respectively 4 2 changes in wue over the decades the wue is readily affected by various factors and it is not constant ritchie and basso 2008 regardless of the soil environment and cultivation pattern genetic differences greatly influence the uptake and utilization of water by plants from a physiological perspective crop varieties differ greatly in the sensitivity of their stomata to soil and air drying which directly impacts the co2 photosynthetic assimilation and transpiration rate the differences among varieties in terms of the wue can be increased under water deficit conditions compared with well watered conditions condon et al 2004 mei et al 2013 a previous study showed that the effective use of soil water during the reproductive growth stage is important for maintaining a higher yield and greater wue in modern hybrids which are associated with a higher kernel weight growth rate et and stomatal conductance nagore et al 2017 in the present study we found that the wue and wuc increased and decreased respectively in a linear manner over the decades thereby demonstrating that the modern inbred lines could obtain a greater yield from the same amount of water compared with the old inbred lines where the utilization of water has become more efficient and economic especially in drought stress environments the inbred lines released in the 1980s had significantly larger et values and much higher wue values with respect to the yield wuey and biomass wueb compared with those from the 1960s thereby showing that breeding programs with the aim of high yields also improved the wue indirectly by contrast from the 1980s to the 2000s the improvements in the wue were due to higher yields but lower et rates similar results were reported by zhao et al 2018 who found that drought tolerant hybrids always had the lowest seasonal et but the highest wue compared with the conventional hybrids 4 3 changes in nue over the decades given the remarkable effects of n fertilizer application on increasing the yield more studies have investigated the nue than the wue a high nue value indicates 1 a high n uptake efficiency nupe i e accumulating more n in plants under low nutrient stress and 2 a high n utilization efficiency nute i e producing more unit dry matter from less n nupe and nute vary with the crop varieties genotypes and environmental conditions achieving greater n accumulation during post silking but without decreasing the n content achieved at silking and the efficiency of plant n remobilization are essential for obtaining greater yields and nue in maize hirel et al 2011 ciampitti and vyn 2012 the new hybrids have optimized nue traits which are associated with maximizing the n uptake partitioning and remobilization in the canopy and grain due to the stronger grain filling capacity and larger grain yield response per unit of n applied hawkesford 2014 our results showed that the modern inbred lines exhibited significant increases in the n uptake amount n translocation amount n translocation efficiency and nhi where these improvements were more obvious in the low n environment the improvements in the n uptake amount by the vegetative organs roots stems and leaves mainly occurred in the inbred lines from the 1980s whereas the increases in the n uptake amount in the inbred lines from the 2000s were mainly due to greater n accumulation in the grain the n translocation efficiency increased significantly over the decades in the aboveground parts but more remarkably in the roots ae is the product of are and pe which reflect nupe and nute respectively a previous study demonstrated that ae was improved in the recent hybrids released in the usa and china and it was positively correlated with the improved are due to the greater post silking accumulation of n jason et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 we also found that ae are and pe improved from the 1960s to the 1980s due to the remarkable yield increases before decreasing from the 1980s to the 2000s which can be explained as follows 1 the inbred lines from the 2000s exhibited improved tolerance to the low n environment and the grain yield and n uptake responses of the inbred lines from the 1980s to high n were more sensitive than those of the inbred lines from the 2000s li et al 2014 2 the high n application employed in the present study may have masked the improvements in ae are and pe for the inbred lines from the 2000s and thus different n levels should be tested in future to examine the changes in nue for inbred maize lines or hybrids released in different years we defined nue as the grain yield obtained per unit n in plants in order to assess the efficiency of n consumption for grain yield formation in low n or normal n environments we also calculated the ratio of the grain yield relative to the fertilizer n rate pfp to determine the efficiency of the conversion of the n fertilizer into harvested products similar to edmeades et al 1997 chen et al 2013 and li et al 2016 we found that nue and pfp decreased at the high n level whereas nue and pfp increased in a linear manner over the decades the modern inbred lines had higher nue values at the low or high n levels thereby indicating that they could produce more grains with less n and the improvement from the 1960s to the 1980s was more significant compared with that from the 1980s to the 2000s 4 4 root properties related to yield wue and nue in the past 100 years maize breeding in the usa and china has focused on the yield relative to the aboveground plant parts chen et al 2014 york et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 therefore many studies have reported traits that promote tolerance of drought and low n stress which are associated with the plant height shoot biomass anthesis silking interval leaf area index photosynthesis chloroplast pigments grain filling properties and grain yield components however the roots are readily affected and modified by the soil environment which has important effects on soil water n uptake wue and nue in agreement with previous studies liu et al 2017a nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 yu et al 2015 we found decreases in the root morphological features dry weight root length root volume surface area root weight density root length density and physiological absorption properties absorption area ars trs and root activity whereas rsr increased in the drought and low n environments however drought and low n stress induced root extension into the deeper soil layers passioura 1983 gao et al 2015 which promoted root growth in the middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers recent studies of maize roots in the usa and china showed that the newest maize hybrids have marginally shallower angles and fewer nodal roots and they experience less competition and root growth redundancy which may negatively affect the aboveground plant performance increases in the cell size and more aerenchyma are optimal for water and nitrate uptake liu et al 2017b york et al 2015 we found that the root size tended to increase from the1960s to the 1980s in the maize inbred lines before decreasing from the 1980s to the 2000s which are similar to the changes found in maize hybrids by chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 and zhu et al 2015 the inbred lines from the 1980s exhibited significantly greater root growth in the top 0 20 cm soil layer whereas the inbred lines from the 2000s had significantly greater root growth in the middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers especially under lw and ln thereby indicating that the modern inbred lines tended to have less redundant roots in the top soil layer where the stress tolerance was improved by greater root elongation into the deeper soil layer furthermore the root physiological absorption properties improved continually over the decades and the inbred lines from the 2000s maintained high root activities after silking similar to the root morphological properties the root absorption capacity increased in the middle and deep soil layers compared with the top soil layer for the modern inbred lines and this was more obvious in the stressful environment compared with the normal environment the traditional view is that a larger root system improves the yield wue and nue nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 yu et al 2015 but the roots have a high respiratory rate and more c assimilation is required for per unit dry matter production compared with the aboveground parts and the root redundancy is accompanied by wasted resources as the plant density increases passioura 1983 york et al 2015 ciampitti and vyn 2012 zhang et al 2013 according to our results the yield wue and nue had significant quadratic relationships with the root weight root length total surface area root volume root length density and root weight density wav and nav where these traits decreased in a linear manner with rsr but increased in a linear manner with the absorption area ars trs and root activity the correlation coefficients for the yield wue and nue with respect to the root physiological absorption properties r 0 6752 0 9779 p 0 01 were higher than those with the morphological properties r 0 5875 0 9707 p 0 01 thus the results indicated that the root systems of the inbred maize lines had greater physiological absorption capacities rather than larger roots in order to facilitate higher efficiency and larger root systems did not obtain higher yield wue and nue values in the normal or stressful environments in spite of water and nitrogen environments planting density has vital effects on maize production however the breeding strategies and agronomic practices in china focused on individual plant performance rather than on yield per unit area for a long time li et al 2011 the yield gap between medium and high population densities was not significant under maize hybrids and their parental inbred lines released in different decades the breed improvement for high population density had been ignored completely in china before 1980s ru 2009 when the breeders realized the success of usa breeding under high density environment which is helpful to cope with kinds of adversity pressure problems such as lodging fecundity economic coefficient drought tolerance fertilizer utilization efficiency is now increasingly emphasized thus the interactions of genotype density water and fertilizer environments should be more focused in future study 5 conclusions in this study we used 11 elite maize inbred lines released during the 1960s 1980s and 2000s and demonstrated that the modern inbred lines exhibited higher tolerance of drought and low n stress the yield increase from the 1960s to the 1980s was greater than that from the 1980s to the 2000s the soil water n uptake nue and wue have changed to become more efficient and economical in the modern inbred lines especially in stressful environments the root systems of inbred maize lines have developed greater physiological absorption capacities rather than larger roots to facilitate higher efficiency and larger root systems did not obtain higher yield wue and nue values in the normal or stressful environments however the root absorption ability was closely related to the spatial distribution of the roots in the soil thus detailed studies of the root system architecture based on large genetic populations should be conducted in the future in order to understand the change in roots and resource use efficiency improvements acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key research and development

11099,the evolution of canopy traits related to maize yield increases has been well documented but the changes in the root system over decades and their relationships with the water use efficiency wue and nitrogen n use efficiency nue require further investigation in this study we analyzed the morphological and physiological characteristics of the roots as well as the water n uptake wue and nue under low water n lw ln and high water n hw hn supply levels in 11 elite inbred maize lines released in china during the 1960s 1980s and 2000s the results showed that yield improvement in the inbred lines from the 1960s to the 1980s 61 109 was greater than that in those from the 1980s to the 2000s 6 17 and the resistance to drought and low n also exhibited a significant linear increase over the decades the utilization of water and n by the inbred lines evolved efficiently and economically especially in stressful environments the improved wue of modern inbred lines was demonstrated by the higher yield and lower evapotranspiration the nue defined as the grain yield obtained per unit of n in plants increased in a linear manner over the three decades and it was accompanied by higher n accumulation in the grains and greater n translocation efficiency in the roots however the agronomic n use efficiency improved from the 1960s to the 1980s but then decreased from the 1980s to the 2000s the modern inbred lines tended to produce less redundant roots in the top 0 20 cm soil layer whereas root development was enhanced in the deeper soil layer the morphological properties of the roots dry weight length volume surface area weight density and length density tended to increase from the 1960s to the 1980s but then decreased from the 1980s to the 2000s and they had significant quadratic relationships with the yield wue and nue by contrast water n amount absorbed per unit root volume the physiological properties related to the root absorption area root activity improved over the decades where the physiological properties had positive linear relationships with the yield wue and nue thus we conclude that the maize roots evolved alongside higher yields and greater tolerance to drought and low n environments the improved wue and nue in the modern inbred lines were associated with the greater physiological absorption capacity of the roots rather than larger root size in normal or stressful environments keywords abiotic stress maize inbred line root nitrogen use efficiency water use efficiency 1 introduction maize is ranked first among the cereal crops grown throughout the world with a total planting area of 190 million hectares and production of more than 1 billion tons fao 2016 high maize yield requires large amounts of water and fertilizer however challenges due to water shortages as well as climate change wasted resources and environmental pollution caused by the excessive application of fertilizer are intensifying around the world thus enhancing the crop production pattern by greater investment in exchange for a high yield is not realistic and coordinating yield improvements with the more efficient use of water and fertilizer is essential for ensuring food security sustainably the utilization of heterosis has played an important role in improving crop yield and abiotic stress resistance in the usa the maize yield has increased by 50 60 due to breed improvement since the introduction of hybrids in 1930s duvick 2005 and genetic improvement has also improved the yield by 40 64 in china ci et al 2011 li 2009 the use of alternative hybrid varieties has enhanced the maize production related to the improvement in photosynthetic performance leaf antioxidant capacity grain filling characteristics and post silking matter transport efficiency dong et al 2000 li et al 2014 the abilities to access soil water and convert water into biomass differ greatly among maize varieties where the variations in the water use efficiency wue can be up to 30 100 shan 1994 ajani et al 2016 achieving a greater wue in maize requires the selection of genotypes in drought environments adebayo and menkir 2014 vulchinkova 2014 a recent study showed that drought tolerance traits related to plant height ear size empty ear rate and the anthesis silking interval should be decreased by selection to further improve the wue sun et al 2017 in addition to the maize yield increases over the years the tolerance of low n has been improved where the abilities to acquire mineralized soil n and utilize n are much better in the modern hybrids compared with the old hybrids and the n use efficiency nue has also been improved in low n environments chen et al 2011 ciampitti and vyn 2012 it has been demonstrated that the improved nue in modern maize hybrids is positively related to higher post silking n accumulation and the greater efficiency of n remobilization to the kernels in the usa and china haegele et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 the variations in root systems due to genetic differences greatly affect the uptake and utilization of soil water and fertilizer sattelmacher et al 1990 passioura 1983 changes in the root system architecture had greater direct impacts on the yield than changes in the canopy architecture according to a study of historical yield increases in the usa hammer et al 2009 the physiological activity of roots and the ability to resist senescence during the grain filling period have improved over time wang et al 2002 then the root distribution in maize tends to promote vertical extension and horizontal contraction to allow dense planting in the maize hybrids grown in the usa and china hammer et al 2009 wang et al 2001 however the root system is obviously larger and more developed in the maize hybrids grown in the usa compared with those in china especially in the top 60 cm soil layer yu et al 2015 comparing the changes in the yield and the tolerance of abiotic stresses in the genotypes released in different decades is useful for understanding the achievements of selective breeding the development of hybrids has been studied where the changes in the morphological and photosynthetic characteristics of the canopy related to maize productivity are well documented ci et al 2013 echarte et al 2006 wang et al 2011 thereby providing theoretical and technical guidance to facilitate breeding and cultivation improvements maize inbred lines are the basic materials used in genetic improvement and for the utilization of heterosis but few studies have investigated the changes in the physiological and ecological traits of maize inbred lines compared with the hybrids especially the changes in the roots of inbred lines that are associated with the utilization of water and n fertilizer in this study in order to understand the changes in the root systems of 11 elite inbred maize lines released during the 1960s 1980s and 2000s in china and their effects on water n uptake and utilization efficiency we analyzed the variations in the morphological and physiological characteristics of the roots wue nue and their relationships in response to different environments we hypothesized that the changes in the root parameters due to the indirect influence of selection for yield improvement may have significantly contributed to higher wue and nue levels we aimed to obtain evolution information about the morphological and physiological characteristics of the maize roots in order to facilitate the breeding and genetic improvement of highly efficient inbred lines 2

were carefully collected using the soil auger method within a root area of 25 cm 60 cm jia et al 2017 for further measurements the root samples were stored at 4 c as soon as possible after washing and removing the non root impurities the root morphological parameters comprising the root surface area root volume and root length were scanned with an epson perfection v700 scanner and analyzed with winrhizo regent instruments inc canada the root absorption area and root activity were measured using the methylene blue dyeing method and triphenyltetrazolium chloride reduction method respectively liu et al 2017a the maize samples including the root and aboveground parts were dried until constant weight in an oven at 65 c to calculate the dry weight rsr was the ratio of the root biomass relative to shoot biomass root length density or root weight density were calculated by dividing the root length or root dry weight by the sampling core volume in different soil layers ars trs was calculated as the ratio of root surface area relative to root absorption area the soil water wav or n nav amount absorbed by root were calculated by dividing the et value or n uptake in whole plant by

decade interaction and n decade interaction were not significant tables 4 and 5 yield improvement was greater in the inbred lines from the 1960s to the 1980s 61 01 108 63 compared with that from the 1980s to the 2000s 5 85 16 73 fig 2 tables 4 and 5 compared with the inbred lines from the 1960s and 1980s those from the 2000s had yield increases of 108 63 and 16 73 at lw 61 01 and 5 85 at hw 94 13 and 15 25 at ln and 74 16 and 10 08 at hn respectively these values also indicate that the yield increases in the modern inbred lines were greater in the stressful environments than the normal environment in agreement with the yield increases the resistance to drought and low n also increased significantly in a linear manner over the decades p 0 01 i e the resistances of inbred lines to drought drc were 0 33 0 40 and 0 44 in the 1960s 1980s and 2000s respectively and the resistances of inbred lines to low n lnc were 0 76 0 82 and 0 86 fig 2 3 2 root morphology and physiological properties the trends in the root morphology and physiological absorption properties were similar among the different water and n levels figs 3 and 4 drought and low n stress restrained root growth in the top 0 20 cm soil layer but promoted root growth in the 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers root size was significantly larger in the new lines than the old lines in the 0 100 cm soil layer the highest root dry weight root length root volume surface area root weight density and root length density were found in the top 0 20 cm soil layer in the inbred lines from the 1980s but in the middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers in the inbred lines from the 2000s the differences in the root morphology properties of the inbred lines released in different decades were greater in the middle and deep soil layers or and in the stressful environments the root physiological absorption properties i e root absorption area and ars trs improved over the decades in the 0 100 cm soil layer the improvements in the inbred lines from the 2000s were more evident in the 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers figs 3 and 4 the inbred lines from the 2000s maintained higher root activities compared with those from the 1960s and the 1980s after silking and the differences in the 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers increased with the number of days after silking fig 5 the modern inbred lines enhanced the root absorption ability more obviously in the stressful environments than the normal environments i e the average root absorption area ars trs and root activity in the inbred lines from the 2000s increased by 129 89 59 34 and 29 24 at lw by 73 10 52 45 and 28 65 at hw by 121 80 57 20 and 26 57 at ln and by 75 42 47 95 and 22 26 at hn respectively compared with those from the 1960s and these increases were 30 96 31 66 and 13 67 at lw 14 60 21 21 and 12 49 at hw 18 11 20 18 and 12 22 at ln and 12 33 19 69 and 10 29 at hn respectively compared with those from the 1980s drought and low n decreased the root morphological properties but increased rsr there was a significant quadratic relationship in terms of rsr for the inbred lines released in different decades p 0 001 fig 6 the water n amount absorbed per unit root volume wav nav increased in a linear manner over the three decades wav increased by 14 98 and 5 87 from the 1960s to the 2000s and from the 1980s to the 2000s at lw respectively by 11 95 and 4 30 at hw by 41 33 and 22 77 at ln and by 27 88 and 17 67 at hn fig 6 3 3 et and wue at lw or hw et increased in the inbred lines from the 1960s to the 1980s but decreased from the 1980s to the 2000s where there was a significant quadratic relationship at p 0 01 fig 7 by contrast wueb and wuey increased in a linear manner over the decades whereas wuc decreased in a linear manner compared with the inbred lines from the 1960s and 1980s wueb increased by 39 60 and 10 88 at lw in those from the 2000s respectively and by 31 78 and 8 48 at hw while wuey increased by 51 30 and 19 36 at lw and by 32 62 and 18 01 at hw and wuc decreased by 45 17 and 13 95 at lw and by 28 54 and 14 88 at hw thus a higher maize yield was obtained from the same amount of water by the new lines than the old lines and the wue changes especially in drought stress environments 3 4 n uptake translocation and nue the inbred lines from the 1980s and 2000s had much higher n uptake rates than those from the 1960s at both the ln and hn levels fig 8 the total n uptake rates by the inbred lines from the 1980s and 2000s increased by 50 00 and 69 50 compared with those from the 1960s at ln which were more significant than those at hn i e by 39 74 and 49 17 respectively the maize produced by the inbred lines from the1980s had a larger vegetative mass compared with those from the 2000s with increases in the n uptake rates by the roots stems and leaves by contrast the increases in the amount of n uptake by the inbred lines from the 2000s were mainly due to higher n accumulation in the grains compared with those from the 1980s the n translocation amount and translocation efficiency in the roots and aboveground parts increased significantly over the decades especially at ln the improvements in the translocation efficiency by the inbred lines from the 1980s and 2000s were more remarkable in the roots than the aboveground parts compared those from the 1960s fig 9 the nhi values were 15 36 and 10 49 higher in the inbred lines from the 2000s than those from the 1960s and 1980s at ln respectively and 14 79 and 10 05 higher at hn the nue values were 16 38 and 18 84 higher in the inbred lines from the 2000s compared with those from the 1960s p 0 05 at ln and hn respectively however nue did not improve significantly from the 1980s to the 2000s p 0 05 at ln and hn respectively fig 10 ae are and pe increased by 23 35 27 03 and 2 88 from the 1960s to the 1980s but decreased by 13 90 8 36 and 6 04 from the 1980s to the 2000s with a quadratic relationship pep increased in a linear manner where the pep values for the inbred lines from the 2000s were 74 16 and 10 08 higher compared with those from the 1960s and 1980s respectively p 0 01 3 5 root properties related to yield wue and nue the root properties had strong relationships with the maize yield soil water n uptake wue and nue however larger roots did not result in higher yields figs 11 and 12 wue fig 13 or nue fig 14 in the normal or stressful environments the yield wue and nue decreased in a linear manner with rsr but the r 2 was lower than 0 4 the root morphological properties i e root weight root length total surface area root volume and wav nav had significant quadratic relationships with the yield wue and nue p 0 01 the root physiological absorption properties i e absorption area ars trs root activity had positive linear relationships with the yield wue and nue and the correlations with the root physiological absorption properties r 0 6752 0 9779 p 0 01 were stronger than those with the morphological properties r 0 5875 0 9707 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 changes in yield and tolerance of stress over the decades the grain yield is an important criterion when assessing the tolerance of drought or low n it is acknowledged that the newer hybrids yield more than the older hybrids because of continual improvements in their ability to resist abiotic stresses ci et al 2013 duvick 2005 li et al 2015 the results of this study indicate that drc and lnc increased in a linear manner over the decades p 0 01 and the yield improvements in the inbred lines from the 1960s to the 1980s 61 01 108 63 were greater than those in the lines from the 1980s to the 2000s 5 85 16 73 furthermore we found that the modern inbred lines had higher yields than the older lines in the stressful and normal environments duvick 2005 and sun et al 2017 obtained similar results based on comparisons of hybrids released in different years in the usa and china respectively 4 2 changes in wue over the decades the wue is readily affected by various factors and it is not constant ritchie and basso 2008 regardless of the soil environment and cultivation pattern genetic differences greatly influence the uptake and utilization of water by plants from a physiological perspective crop varieties differ greatly in the sensitivity of their stomata to soil and air drying which directly impacts the co2 photosynthetic assimilation and transpiration rate the differences among varieties in terms of the wue can be increased under water deficit conditions compared with well watered conditions condon et al 2004 mei et al 2013 a previous study showed that the effective use of soil water during the reproductive growth stage is important for maintaining a higher yield and greater wue in modern hybrids which are associated with a higher kernel weight growth rate et and stomatal conductance nagore et al 2017 in the present study we found that the wue and wuc increased and decreased respectively in a linear manner over the decades thereby demonstrating that the modern inbred lines could obtain a greater yield from the same amount of water compared with the old inbred lines where the utilization of water has become more efficient and economic especially in drought stress environments the inbred lines released in the 1980s had significantly larger et values and much higher wue values with respect to the yield wuey and biomass wueb compared with those from the 1960s thereby showing that breeding programs with the aim of high yields also improved the wue indirectly by contrast from the 1980s to the 2000s the improvements in the wue were due to higher yields but lower et rates similar results were reported by zhao et al 2018 who found that drought tolerant hybrids always had the lowest seasonal et but the highest wue compared with the conventional hybrids 4 3 changes in nue over the decades given the remarkable effects of n fertilizer application on increasing the yield more studies have investigated the nue than the wue a high nue value indicates 1 a high n uptake efficiency nupe i e accumulating more n in plants under low nutrient stress and 2 a high n utilization efficiency nute i e producing more unit dry matter from less n nupe and nute vary with the crop varieties genotypes and environmental conditions achieving greater n accumulation during post silking but without decreasing the n content achieved at silking and the efficiency of plant n remobilization are essential for obtaining greater yields and nue in maize hirel et al 2011 ciampitti and vyn 2012 the new hybrids have optimized nue traits which are associated with maximizing the n uptake partitioning and remobilization in the canopy and grain due to the stronger grain filling capacity and larger grain yield response per unit of n applied hawkesford 2014 our results showed that the modern inbred lines exhibited significant increases in the n uptake amount n translocation amount n translocation efficiency and nhi where these improvements were more obvious in the low n environment the improvements in the n uptake amount by the vegetative organs roots stems and leaves mainly occurred in the inbred lines from the 1980s whereas the increases in the n uptake amount in the inbred lines from the 2000s were mainly due to greater n accumulation in the grain the n translocation efficiency increased significantly over the decades in the aboveground parts but more remarkably in the roots ae is the product of are and pe which reflect nupe and nute respectively a previous study demonstrated that ae was improved in the recent hybrids released in the usa and china and it was positively correlated with the improved are due to the greater post silking accumulation of n jason et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 we also found that ae are and pe improved from the 1960s to the 1980s due to the remarkable yield increases before decreasing from the 1980s to the 2000s which can be explained as follows 1 the inbred lines from the 2000s exhibited improved tolerance to the low n environment and the grain yield and n uptake responses of the inbred lines from the 1980s to high n were more sensitive than those of the inbred lines from the 2000s li et al 2014 2 the high n application employed in the present study may have masked the improvements in ae are and pe for the inbred lines from the 2000s and thus different n levels should be tested in future to examine the changes in nue for inbred maize lines or hybrids released in different years we defined nue as the grain yield obtained per unit n in plants in order to assess the efficiency of n consumption for grain yield formation in low n or normal n environments we also calculated the ratio of the grain yield relative to the fertilizer n rate pfp to determine the efficiency of the conversion of the n fertilizer into harvested products similar to edmeades et al 1997 chen et al 2013 and li et al 2016 we found that nue and pfp decreased at the high n level whereas nue and pfp increased in a linear manner over the decades the modern inbred lines had higher nue values at the low or high n levels thereby indicating that they could produce more grains with less n and the improvement from the 1960s to the 1980s was more significant compared with that from the 1980s to the 2000s 4 4 root properties related to yield wue and nue in the past 100 years maize breeding in the usa and china has focused on the yield relative to the aboveground plant parts chen et al 2014 york et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 therefore many studies have reported traits that promote tolerance of drought and low n stress which are associated with the plant height shoot biomass anthesis silking interval leaf area index photosynthesis chloroplast pigments grain filling properties and grain yield components however the roots are readily affected and modified by the soil environment which has important effects on soil water n uptake wue and nue in agreement with previous studies liu et al 2017a nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 yu et al 2015 we found decreases in the root morphological features dry weight root length root volume surface area root weight density root length density and physiological absorption properties absorption area ars trs and root activity whereas rsr increased in the drought and low n environments however drought and low n stress induced root extension into the deeper soil layers passioura 1983 gao et al 2015 which promoted root growth in the middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers recent studies of maize roots in the usa and china showed that the newest maize hybrids have marginally shallower angles and fewer nodal roots and they experience less competition and root growth redundancy which may negatively affect the aboveground plant performance increases in the cell size and more aerenchyma are optimal for water and nitrate uptake liu et al 2017b york et al 2015 we found that the root size tended to increase from the1960s to the 1980s in the maize inbred lines before decreasing from the 1980s to the 2000s which are similar to the changes found in maize hybrids by chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 and zhu et al 2015 the inbred lines from the 1980s exhibited significantly greater root growth in the top 0 20 cm soil layer whereas the inbred lines from the 2000s had significantly greater root growth in the middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers especially under lw and ln thereby indicating that the modern inbred lines tended to have less redundant roots in the top soil layer where the stress tolerance was improved by greater root elongation into the deeper soil layer furthermore the root physiological absorption properties improved continually over the decades and the inbred lines from the 2000s maintained high root activities after silking similar to the root morphological properties the root absorption capacity increased in the middle and deep soil layers compared with the top soil layer for the modern inbred lines and this was more obvious in the stressful environment compared with the normal environment the traditional view is that a larger root system improves the yield wue and nue nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 yu et al 2015 but the roots have a high respiratory rate and more c assimilation is required for per unit dry matter production compared with the aboveground parts and the root redundancy is accompanied by wasted resources as the plant density increases passioura 1983 york et al 2015 ciampitti and vyn 2012 zhang et al 2013 according to our results the yield wue and nue had significant quadratic relationships with the root weight root length total surface area root volume root length density and root weight density wav and nav where these traits decreased in a linear manner with rsr but increased in a linear manner with the absorption area ars trs and root activity the correlation coefficients for the yield wue and nue with respect to the root physiological absorption properties r 0 6752 0 9779 p 0 01 were higher than those with the morphological properties r 0 5875 0 9707 p 0 01 thus the results indicated that the root systems of the inbred maize lines had greater physiological absorption capacities rather than larger roots in order to facilitate higher efficiency and larger root systems did not obtain higher yield wue and nue values in the normal or stressful environments in spite of water and nitrogen environments planting density has vital effects on maize production however the breeding strategies and agronomic practices in china focused on individual plant performance rather than on yield per unit area for a long time li et al 2011 the yield gap between medium and high population densities was not significant under maize hybrids and their parental inbred lines released in different decades the breed improvement for high population density had been ignored completely in china before 1980s ru 2009 when the breeders realized the success of usa breeding under high density environment which is helpful to cope with kinds of adversity pressure problems such as lodging fecundity economic coefficient drought tolerance fertilizer utilization efficiency is now increasingly emphasized thus the interactions of genotype density water and fertilizer environments should be more focused in future study 5 conclusions in this study we used 11 elite maize inbred lines released during the 1960s 1980s and 2000s and demonstrated that the modern inbred lines exhibited higher tolerance of drought and low n stress the yield increase from the 1960s to the 1980s was greater than that from the 1980s to the 2000s the soil water n uptake nue and wue have changed to become more efficient and economical in the modern inbred lines especially in stressful environments the root systems of inbred maize lines have developed greater physiological absorption capacities rather than larger roots to facilitate higher efficiency and larger root systems did not obtain higher yield wue and nue values in the normal or stressful environments however the root absorption ability was closely related to the spatial distribution of the roots in the soil thus detailed studies of the root system architecture based on large genetic populations should be conducted in the future in order to understand the change in roots and resource use efficiency improvements acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key research and development
