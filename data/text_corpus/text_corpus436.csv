2180,the extreme rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves are used to design stormwater infrastructure in the urban areas and need to be developed keeping in view of the warming climate the current study develops the non stationary idf relationships for 11 class i urban cities of india under changing climate the total 11 528 generalized extreme value distribution gev models are developed to quantify non stationarity in extreme rainfall by introducing a clock hour correction factor chcf as a covariate the observed hourly rainfall data of the selected cities located in five different regions of india namely the western region mumbai ahmedabad jaipur northern region new delhi dehradun north eastern region imphal eastern region bhubaneswar kolkata and southern region madurai chennai bengaluru are collected and converted in the fixed and sliding interval annual maximum rainfall series of eight different durations the said data set is used in the computation of chcf evaluation of discretisation effect on extreme rainfall events trend analysis development of stationary and non stationary idf curves the chcf values of seven two cities are above below 1 15 respectively the other two cities show a value 1 15 the effect of temporal discretisation on the computation of extreme rainfall for 24 h fw and sw maximum rainfall depth was found to be highest in bhubaneswar 50 and imphal 44 the trend analysis revealed no statistically significant increasing decreasing trend in extreme rainfall for all durations for all cities under consideration except in the case of bengaluru for 2 3 and 6 h durations chennai for a 48 h duration the current study concluded that under a non stationarity climate the shorter 1 h and longer 24 h duration extreme rainfall is influenced by local and global processes respectively further the short duration extreme events are intensifying with the decrease in the return period the 1 h duration non stationary rainfall intensity for a 2 year return period and stationary rainfall intensity for a 5 year return period of 62 9 mm h and 57 mm h for bengaluru 77 7 mm h and 77 2 mm h for mumbai 60 8 mm h and 60 7 mm h for ahmedabad 47 8 mm h and 49 4 mm h for jaipur 59 8 mm h and 59 3 mm h for madurai 73 6 mm h and 73 mm h for bhubaneswar and 39 6 mm h and 40 1 mm h for imphal respectively the ready to use idf curves developed under stationary and non stationary climate can be useful to design engineers in designing stormwater drainage systems in the selected class i urban cities of india keywords chcf extreme rainfall gev idf curves non stationary stationary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global surface temperature has increased by approximately 1 09 c between 2011 and 2022 than that between 1850 and 1900 with a temperature increase of 1 59 c over the land and 0 88 c over oceans ipcc 2021 global warming is caused by anthropogenic activities that result in the emission of greenhouse gases ipcc 2007 min et al 2011 investigated that about two thirds of land in the northern hemisphere geographical areas have experienced a rise in heavy precipitation occurrences which has been attributed to human induced increases in greenhouse gases the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water increases by approximately 7 for every 1 c increase in global surface temperature trenberth 2011 tabari 2020 which directly increases the rainfall intensity giorgi et al 2011 the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events have increased over most land areas since 1950 with the outlook expected to worsen in the coming years ipcc 2021 recent studies have highlighted an increase in extreme rainfall events in the context of a warming climate along with an increase in rainfall intensity over time cheng and aghakouchak 2014 yilmaz and perera 2014 roxy et al 2017 rainfall in the urban region is affected by cloud condensation nuclei in polluted air the roughness of the underlying surface and modification of convective structures liu et al 2020 extreme rainfall events are increasing in urbanised regions of the eastern united states niyogi et al 2017 and the south asian subcontinent roxy et al 2017 the rate of increase in extreme rainfall events has increased in various parts of the world when compared with that in recent decades alexander et al 2006 vittal et al 2013 vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 however the exact cause of changes in extreme rainfall remains unknown and short duration extreme rainfall events present a key challenge to infrastructure planning several previous studies have analysed extreme rainfall by assuming stationarity sun and ao 2013 ghate and timbadiya 2021 ghate and timbadiya 2022 liu et al 2022 nevertheless recent research has suggested non stationarity may be a more applicable approach for the assessment of extreme rainfall in the face of a changing climate and increased urbanisation milly et al 2008 rosenberg et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 yilmaz and perera 2014 niyogi et al 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 the presence or absence of a significant trend in a rainfall time series does not indicate non stationarity or stationarity teegavarapu and sharma 2021 but the non stationarity of extreme rainfall magnitude duration and time plays an important role in designing stormwater related infrastructure hence the analysis of extreme rainfall using a non stationarity approach is important under the changing climate slater et al 2021 reviewed methods for detecting non stationarity in extreme precipitation events the non stationarity of extreme rainfall was modelled using a probability distribution function by incorporating a trend in location and scale parameters using a time as a covariate cheng and aghakouchak 2014 yilmaz and perera 2014 su and chen 2019 modelled non stationarity in daily rainfall data over the pearl river basin in china using global atmospheric circulation processes to identify the best covariates liu et al 2022 showed that extreme rainfall was significantly more affected by urbanisation than by climate change in the majority of the urban agglomerations 21 cities in the middle reaches of the yangtze river basin china these existing studies demonstrated that the development of non stationary intensity durationfrequency idf curves for urban regions is necessary in the context of climate change and urbanisation mondal and mujumdar 2015 showed a strong influence of local temperature global warming and el niño southern oscillation enso sea surface temperature sst on the non stationarity of extreme rainfall over india the enso cycle refers to fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and the

summer monsoon rainfall ismr ashok et al 2019 recently sardana et al 2022 investigated global circulation processes and the indian ocean dipole iod showing that these strongly influence over indian rainfall the iod has a strong influence on extreme rainfall events across india ajayamohan and rao 2008 sardana et al 2022 and has recently been used as a covariate in modelling non stationary rainfall frequency analysis agilan and umamahesh 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 ashok et al 2001 investigated the ismr intensification driven by a positive dipole index and ismr weakening driven by negative dipole index a positive dipole mode index dmi results in heavy rains and floods in east africa and droughts in indonesia agilan and umamahesh 2017 have adopted five physical processes namely urbanization and local temperature anomaly lta as local processes global temperature anomaly gta as indicator of global warming enso cycle iod as global processes and time for modelling the non stationary extreme rainfall over hyderabad city india vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 developed a time varying frequency analysis framework using climate informed covariates for seven urban cities in india using lta diurnal temperature range dtr enso modoki index emi gta iod and time as selected covariates however time does not qualify as a significant covariate in the indian context agilan and umamahesh 2017 except in the case of 12 h duration rainfall in mumbai vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 the dtr is the difference between the daily minimum and maximum temperatures and correlates with an increase in extreme rainfall intensity duration and frequency in the day and a decrease at night vinnarasi et al 2017 recent studies have shown that the ismr is affected by temperature based covariates such as lta gta dtr and sst agilan and umamahesh 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 the enso modoki cycle is a recently discovered phenomenon linked to severe anomalous warming in the central tropical pacific and cooling in the eastern and western tropical pacific enso modoki events significantly influence precipitation and temperature in many parts of the world ashok et al 2007 each indian monsoon season varies spatiotemporally and several studies have reported a strong influence of the iod and enso modoki on the ismr vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 sankar et al 2021 dandi et al 2020 the need for a systematic examination of global versus regional drivers of indian rainfall extremes has been highlighted by several studies rajeevan et al 2008 mani et al 2009 kishtawal et al 2010 ghosh et al 2012 overall studies in indian regions suggest that local processes lta dtr and urbanisation affect short duration extreme rainfall events in contrast global processes enso cycle iod gta are effective covariates in quantifying non stationarity in long duration extreme rainfall agilan and umamahesh 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 however previous studies have not considered temporal discretisation errors in the development of stationary and non stationary idf curves using true interval maximum rainfall over selected 11 urban cities of india hourly and daily rainfall data are the key inputs for idf analysis the rainfall data are often recorded at discrete time intervals which can lead to inaccurate estimates of the true accumulation of extreme rainfall papalexiou et al 2016 presented a mathematical framework for evaluating the temporal discretisation in a rainfall time series with maximum rainfall estimated in fixed and sliding windows an empirical relationship was developed for the umbria region central italy to overcome the error of temporal discretisation in estimates of rainfall depth and the associated rainfall depth duration frequency curve and concluded that the rainfall recorded at fixed time intervals can result in the underestimation of rainfall depth by up to 50 morbidelli et al 2017 a single multiplicative rainfall correction factor is commonly used typically without considering the local rainfall pattern regional variations or seasonal factors using fixed time intervals to measure rainfall can result in underestimation of the true maximum rainfall brustenga et al 2020 the maximum rainfall duration obtained from the analysis of clock hour based recorded data at fixed time intervals is less than the maximum rainfall for an unrestricted period of actual duration this is because the actual maximum duration of rainfall seldom coincides with the observed fixed time intervals rainfall depths used for flood design should therefore not consider fixed time intervals is 5542 2003 the clock hour correction factor chcf is the ratio of sliding window sw maxima to fixed window fw maxima rainfall the chcf at the maximum rainfall depth for a given return period has previously been applied using a probability distribution for rain gauge stations in mumbai dauji 2022 ahmedabad ghate and timbadiya 2021 and jaipur ghate and timbadiya 2022 because a single uniform value of chcf can lead to incorrect estimation of rainfall and inadequate flood design regional estimates of chcf are necessary in the context of a changing climate in this study we performed a frequency analysis for developing non stationary idf curves using sw maxima for 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h windows for 11 selected cities within india we also introduced a location based covariate chcf anomaly to develop the non stationary idf curve in light of the non stationarity of extreme rainfall the effect of local atmospheric processes on short duration extreme rainfall and the inadequacy of a single value of chcf we aim to fulfil the following objectives for 11 indian cities a computation of chcf for 11 cities in india namely mumbai jaipur ahmedabad dehradun new delhi imphal bhubaneswar kolkata madurai chennai and bengaluru b extreme rainfall trend analysis for hourly data and quantification of the effect of discretisation of fw and sw annual maximum rainfall series c identification of global and local processes influencing extreme rainfall in urban locations in india and d introduction of chcf as a location based covariate along with local and global circulation processes in the development of non stationary idf curves in 2019 the central public health and environmental engineering organisation cpheeo recommended a design rainfall return period of 1 in 5 years for stormwater drainage system design in india for class i cities with a population of 100 000 and above for airports and other critical infrastructure the rainfall return period for stormwater drainage system design is calculated to be 1 in 100 years here we provide stationarity and non stationarity idf curves which can be used in the planning and development of hydrological infrastructure in india 2 study area and data collection we analysed extreme rainfall and introduced a location based covariate in non stationary idf computation for 11 class i cities in india the details of the rainfall data used covariates selected climate regimes and monsoon patterns of all regions are discussed in this section population

located in five different regions of india namely the western region mumbai ahmedabad jaipur northern region new delhi dehradun north eastern region imphal eastern region bhubaneswar kolkata and southern region madurai chennai bengaluru as shown in fig 1 the selected cities fall under three distinct climate regimes as per the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 mumbai chennai bhubaneswar kolkata and imphal are classified as tropical climate regions whereas ahmedabad jaipur and new delhi have an arid climate dehradun madurai and bengaluru are classified as temperate humid subtropical climates of the 11 cities the highest average annual rainfalls were recorded in mumbai 2260 mm dehradun 2075 mm bhubaneswar 1628 mm and chennai 1355 mm followed by imphal 1095 mm bengaluru 970 mm and madurai 840 mm maximum rainfall was attributed to the southwest monsoon in all 11 cities except for chennai and madurai which are affected by the north east monsoon bengaluru experiences rainfall from both the southwest and northeast monsoons we used hourly rainfall data from self recording rain gauge srrg stations procured from the india meteorological department imd pune india the

stationary generalized extreme value gev models for extreme rainfall the location based covariates chcf lta dtr global processes like gta indian ocean dipole mode index enso sst emi and time are selected we computed the chcf for each station using 24 h ams fw and sw and introduced the chcf anomaly as a location based covariate local temperature is crucial for driving variations in rainfall

extreme rainfall 3 methodology rainfall records were analysed for missing values the missing values were replaced with the mode value for the entire record as suggested by papalexiou et al 2016 to compute the total annual rainfall storm frequency analysis is vital for designing stormwater related infrastructure in urban areas storm frequency analysis also helps reduce urban flooding and several studies have reported the development of rainfall conversion factors across the world e g hershfield 1961 weiss 1964 ayyar and tripathi 1973 young and mcenroe 2003 deshpande 2010 dauji 2022 yoo et al 2015 we computed the chcf using 24 h fw maxima and sw maxima to convert 1 day observed rainfall into true 24 h rainfall accumulation for 11 locations in india we introduced the chcf anomaly as a covariate in non stationary gev modelling we analysed the effect of discretisation on extreme rainfall events using a frequency histogram for the fw and sw maxima data series a flowchart of the methodology adopted in this study is shown in fig 2 and we briefly describe the key steps below we used the ismev package in r for non stationary extreme rainfall modelling gilleland and katz 2016 provided a complete list of the packages required for extreme value analysis 3 1 trend analysis trend analysis of hydrological variables is essential for managing water resources and evaluating risk planning and designing water related infrastructures saplıoğlu and güçlü 2022 it has been found that there is a chance of dependence among hydrometeorological data set and it must be removed from the time series before investigating the trend this effect of autocorrelation in the data records was overcome by using the modified mann kendall mmk test alashan 2020 extreme rainfall trends were then evaluated using the mmk test hamed and rao 1998 and sen s innovative trend analysis ita sen 2012 the increasing decreasing trend in the data was checked and the trend in the data was noted to assess

the non correlated data time series the z statistic is used as the measure of trend where z 0 z 0 and z 0 represents a decreasing increasing and no trend respectively 3 2 stationary and non stationary gev models the stationary gev model uses a constant location parameter μ scale parameter σ and shape parameter ξ whereas the nonstationary gev model introduces trends in μ and σ the gev model was fitted to the ams sw rainfall data series using the method of maximum likelihood coles 2001 chow et al 1988 the method of maximum likelihood estimation mle is the most theoretically accurate method for fitting probability distributions to the data as it produces the most efficient parameter estimators martins and stedinger 2000 in the mle method the optimal value of a probability distribution parameter is the value which maximises the likelihood or joint probability of occurrence of the observed sample estimate of the population parameters with the least average error chow et al 1988 in the current study the shape parameter was kept constant because its precise estimation is difficult agilan and umamahesh 2015 and long term observation is required to accurately model ξ cheng et al 2014 the gev incorporates type i ξ 0 type ii ξ 0 and type iii ξ 0 distributions of various families such as gumbel fréchet and weibull respectively coles 2001 we used the gev model to explore the stationary and non stationary behaviour of extreme rainfall as given in eq 6 and eq 7 defined on the set z 1 ξ z μ σ 0 the model parameters should satisfy μ σ 0 ξ coles 2001 6 f z μ σ ξ exp 1 ξ z μ σ

supplementary information table s2 the models that incorporate a trend in the location parameter μ 1 are shown in eq 8 as gev 2 whereas models with a trend in both the location μ 1 and scale σ 1

addition of covariates significantly increased the variance explained by the model the lr test model is defined in eq 10 where the negative log likelihood of g e v s and g e v n s approximately follows the χ 2 distribution with degrees of freedom d f coles 2001 su and chen 2019 after introducing the covariates into the gev model the significance of the effect of covariates in the modelling of extreme rainfall was evaluated using the p value of the lr test which was compared between g e v s and g e v n s the best non stationary model should be adopted over the stationary model where p

5 akaike information criterion the akaike information criterion aic for the fitted gev model m with parameter k is defined in eq 12 12 a i c m 2 log l m 2 k where the first term 2 log l m is twice the negative log likelihood corresponding to the fitted gev model m which is a measure of the lack of fit to the data smaller values indicate a better fit the second term 2 k indicates the penalty to penalize models having large dimension akaike 1973 narisetty 2020 models with lower aic values showed a better balance between these two terms the aic reflects the parity between model complexity and poor fit narisetty 2020 the aic is used to the select the model when the several models are involved katz 2013 a lower aic value indicates a better model fit su and chen 2019 the covariates of the best gev model are then selected as best covariates 4 results and discussion 4 1 computation of chcf to accurately perform storm frequency analysis in the context of a warming climate and intensifying extreme rainfall events in india the location specific study of chcf is inevitable the is 5542 2003 guide for storm analysis suggests a chcf of 1 15 across india to convert 1 day maximum rainfall into 24 h maximum rainfall however a region wise correction factor varies depending upon the climatology the temporal discretisation error in rainfall can lead to inadequate design of water related infrastructures we computed location specific chcfs to overcome the temporal discretisation error in the maximum rainfall over 24 h discrete time intervals fig 3 the deviation from the mean value i e the chcf value computed for each location was adopted as the chcf anomaly and used as a location based covariate for modelling non stationary extreme rainfall frequency curves the chcf value ranged from 1 093 for madurai to 1 218 for kolkata most chcf values were 1 15 with the exception of new delhi and dehradun with values 1 15 and madurai and ahmedabad with values 1 15 in this study the true interval maximum rainfall was adopted over a fixed maximum rainfall interval hence the chcf anomaly was introduced as a covariate however if one uses a fixed interval maximum rainfall for non stationary extreme rainfall modelling chcf can directly be used as a covariate 4 2 effect of temporal discretisation on extreme rainfall we produced histograms for rainfall recorded in discrete intervals and the calculated true interval rainfall accumulation for all selected rainfall durations 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h we calculated the percentage change in the 24 h fw sw extreme rainfall depth to evaluate the temporal discretisation error in the rainfall depth some extreme events were captured in our study for example the extreme rainfall event of 26 july 2005 in mumbai has shown the fw sw accumulation of rainfall as 808 mm 944 mm presented in fig 4 k and l the discretisation error in the 24 hr rainfall depth was 17 ahmedabad reported the highest 24 h rainfall in 1999 the fw sw extreme rainfall was 330 mm 363 mm is presented in fig s1 k and l the discretisation error in the rainfall depth was 10 jaipur reported the highest 24 h rainfall in 1981 with an fw sw extreme rainfall of 287 mm 349 mm as presented in fig s2 k and l the discretisation error was 22 chennai reported the highest 24 h rainfall in 2015 the fw sw extreme rainfall of 348 mm 375 mm as presented in fig s7 k and l the discretisation error in the rainfall depth was 8 bhubaneswar reported that a cyclone caused the highest 1 day rainfall on 29th october 1999 with an fw sw extreme rainfall of 304 mm 456 mm is presented in fig s8 k and l the discretisation error in the rainfall depth was 50 the highest 24 h rainfall for kolkata was reported in 1978 with an fw sw extreme rainfall of 360 mm 400 mm presented in fig s9 k and l the discretisation error was 11 imphal recorded its highest 24 h rainfall in 2003 with an fw sw extreme rainfall of 95 mm 137 mm as presented in fig s10 k and l the discretisation error was 44 the rainfall recorded in a fixed time interval might lead to underestimation of a single rainfall depth of up to 50 morbidelli et al 2017 the highest temporal discretisation error in the maximum rainfall depth was observed for bhubaneswar as 50 and lowest for chennai as 8 the remaining cities dehradun madurai new delhi and bengaluru showed a temporal discretisation error of 5 for the 24 h rainfall depth the effect of temporal discretisation on the extreme rainfall for ahmedabad jaipur new delhi dehradun madurai bengaluru chennai bhubaneswar kolkata and imphal for 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h fw and sw maxima are shown in the supplementary information figs s1 s10 we showed that extreme rainfall events not captured by the fw maxima were indeed recorded by the sw maxima the higher frequency value in ams sw is shown in fig 4 and indicates a lack of high rainfall in the ams fw in mumbai extreme rainfall frequencies recorded between 200 and 300 mm and 300 400 mm were lower in fw estimates than that in sw estimates results for other cities also showed the same pattern we infer therefore that a few extreme events were excluded due to the fixed interval record of rainfall hence we recommend use of the sw maxima series over the fw maxima series for analysing the frequency of extreme rainfall 4 3 trend analysis the increase or decrease in magnitude of a variable related to extreme rainfall does not always indicate non stationarity yilmaz and perera 2014 we evaluated the general trend in the data using the mmk test hamed and rao 1998 and ita şen 2012 we established annual series for eight selected rainfall durations of the fw and sw maxima the mmk test at the 5 significance level is presented in table 2 for each location and for all rainfall durations values greater than 1 96 and less than 1 96 represent statistically significant increasing and decreasing trends in rainfall extremes respectively hamed and rao 1998 extreme rainfall of 1 h duration shows a non significant increasing trend for all locations except dehradun new delhi and imphal which show a non significant decreasing trend the 24 h sw extreme rainfall time series indicates a non significant increasing trend in all locations except jaipur kolkata chennai and imphal which show a non significant decreasing trend we also performed ita on the extreme rainfall data for all durations and locations to ascertain the trends in extreme rainfall the ita plots for all eight durations are shown for mumbai in fig 5 the ita plots for ahmedabad jaipur new delhi dehradun madurai bengaluru chennai bhubaneswar kolkata and imphal are presented in the supplementary information figs s11 s20 we produced an ita plot for 1 h duration rainfall using only fw rainfall maxima as data for 1 h is not available to prepare the sw rainfall maxima series an illustration of possible trends was provided by dabanlı et al 2016 which provides a visual basis for distinguishing the types of trends the 1 1 45 straight line divides the diagram into two equal triangular parts where the upper triangular area indicates an increase in rainfall extremes and the lower indicates a decrease şen 2012 if the data plots on or close to the 1 1 45 straight line there is no significant trend in the hydrometeorological record şen 2012 the results of the ita support the observations of the mmk test for all durations and cities considered herein we found a lack of uniform trend for all rainfall durations in all cities this finding is in line with the observation of ghosh et al 2012 for indian monsoon extreme rainfall who explored 1 1 gridded observed rainfall data over india our finding contrasts with the study from goswami et al 2006 who used daily rainfall data at high grid resolution 4 4 stationary and non stationary extreme rainfall modelling the annual maximum extreme rainfall intensity series for 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h durations were computed using the stationary gev model the extreme rainfall time series was extracted for all durations except 1 h using the sw maxima the best non stationary gev models with an lr test p value 0 05 are shortlisted for all eight durations and 11 locations we performed and analysed a total of 11 528 131 models 11 cities 8 rainfall durations gev models and selected the best models using aic the gev models with an lr test p value 0 05 are listed in table 3 for 24 h duration rainfall with corresponding aic values for each of the 11 cities the optimal model for a 24 h duration rainfall is highlighted in yellow in table 3 models for other rainfall durations are listed with aic and p values 0 05 in the supplementary information tables s3 s11 the covariates of the optimal models table 3 tables s3 s11 for each duration and stationary model s are summarised in fig 6 the optimal covariates adopted in the development of non stationary idf curves for a given duration and city are presented in figs 7 and 8 we did not assess the quantitative importance of the selected covariates but this should be the focus of future studies we did however quantify the percentage change in stationary and non stationary extreme rainfall this is presented in section 4 5 of the 11 locations selected the highest 1 h stationary gev model rainfall intensities for a 2 year return period were observed in dehradun 60 5 mm h mumbai 55 1 mm h bhubaneswar 55 mm h and kolkata 53 6 mm h the non stationary gev models with varying location and scale parameters indicate the highest rainfall intensity in mumbai 77 7 mm h and bhubaneswar 73 6 mm h dehradun and kolkata have not shown any significant effect of covariates and remain stationary for 1 hr duration for 1 h duration rainfall in mumbai we found the gev 22 model to be the optimal non stationary model with chcf and dmi as covariates and a varying location parameter in the case of bhubaneswar however the gev 129 model was optimal and covariates included emi gta sst and dmi with varying location and scale parameters in addition to these covariates dtr was found to influence 1 h extreme rainfall intensity in jaipur additionally we found that rainfall intensity in madurai was significantly affected by chcf and in ahmedabad by dmi overall 1 h duration extreme rainfall was influenced by location based chcf and a combination of temperature processes such as sst lta dtr and gta the temperature based covariates had more influence on 1 h duration short duration rainfall than location based chcf these observations agree with previous findings by agilan and umamahesh 2017 and vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 we introduced a location specific chcf as a covariate and found that it influenced extreme rainfall intensity modelling we determined that chcf as one of the influencing covariates for 24 hr duration in the 8 out of the 11 cities mumbai ahmedabad new delhi dehradun bengaluru chennai kolkata and imphal this indicates that not considering chcf in the computation of idf in these cities underestimates the extreme rainfall at the given frequencies and therefore may lead to inadequate design of stormwater drainage systems however we did not investigate the discretisation factor ratio of sw maxima to fw maxima for extreme rainfall with durations shorter than 24 h future work will investigate the use of a location specific discretisation factor as a covariate for shorter durations of extreme rainfall in order to quantify non stationarity for the 24 h duration rainfall in addition to the location based covariates we determined an influence of global processes such as emi and dmi in non stationary modelling at all 11 locations this agrees with observations of some indian cities from vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 rainfall in kolkata has shown stationary behaviour for all durations except 24 h duration rainfall where gev 60 showed chcf lta and sst as influencing covariates as there is a large variation in regional climate within india the influence of covariates on non stationary rainfall extremes is different for each region we considered our study revealed the influence of lta in the western region whereas the northern region was influenced by sst iod and emi global circulation processes we found that lta sst and chcf influence rainfall in the north eastern region whereas the lta and gta influence rainfall in the eastern region extreme rainfall in the southern region is influenced by iod none of the non stationary models with time as a covariate qualified as the optimal model for any of the 11 cities considered here temperature based covariates contributed to almost all durations of extreme rainfall at all locations when a non stationary scenario was modelled these observations agree with previous studies where the clausius clapeyron relation states that an increase in temperature increases the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere which further influences the intensity of extreme rainfall giorgi et al 2011 ali and mishra 2017 pumo et al 2019 hourly rainfall intensity is more sensitive than daily rainfall to changes in local air temperature westra et al 2014 the stationary and best nonstationary gev model parameters are presented in table 4 for mumbai and the parameters for other cities are presented in the supplementary information tables s10 s19 we determined goodness of fit indicators model diagnostic plots such as standardised quantile qq plots and probability pp plots for all the selected best stationary and non stationary models to check the overall performance of the model fits the plots show points close to linearity among empirical and model quantiles and probabilities which indicates a reasonably good fit of the model coles 2001 the model diagnostics plot for mumbai is shown in fig 9 the qq and pp plots for all eight rainfall durations and the remaining ten locations are presented in the supplementary information figs s21 s30 for ahmedabad jaipur new delhi dehradun madurai bengaluru chennai bhubaneswar kolkata and imphal the empirical model quantiles and probabilities showed a relatively good fit for the selected models the selected best stationary and non stationary models for each duration were utilised in the development of the idf curves 4 5 non stationary idf curves we used the best selected models showing stationary and non stationary behaviour to develop the idf curves for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods for all eight rainfall durations and for each of the cities we calculated the highest non stationary 1 h 2 year return period rainfall for mumbai at 77 7 mm h and the stationary equivalent at 55 1 mm h the next highest 1 h 2 year return period rainfall estimates were for bhubaneswar with a non stationary estimate of 73 6 mm h and a stationary estimate of 55 mm h short duration extreme events increase in intensity with a decrease in the return period we calculated 1 h duration non stationary rainfall intensity for a 2 year return period and stationary rainfall intensity for a 5 year return period of 62 9 mm h and 57 mm h for bengaluru 77 7 mm h and 77 2 mm h for mumbai 60 8 mm h and 60 7 mm h for ahmedabad 47 8 mm h and 49 4 mm h for jaipur 59 8 mm h and 59 3 mm h for madurai 73 6 mm h and 73 mm h for bhubaneswar and 39 6 mm h and 40 1 mm h for imphal these results suggest that during the 5 year return period extreme rainfall events occurred at a 2 year return period under non stationary conditions consideration of stationary extreme rainfall over a given return period leads to underestimation of the peak discharge and can result in urban flooding the difference in rainfall intensity between stationary and non stationary conditions shows that stationary models resulted in underestimation of extreme rainfall in mumbai and bhubaneswar for a 2 year return period and 1 h duration the percentage increase in rainfall intensity is 41 in mumbai and 34 in bhubaneswar and for a 10 year return period rainfall intensity increases by 31 and 22 in each city respectively the other locations also showed variation in the non stationary and stationary extreme rainfall intensity for a 1 h duration and 2 year 10 year return period the percentage increase in the rainfall intensity for bengaluru 36 14 ahmedabad 35 31 jaipur 25 17 madurai 21 8 imphal 28 21 cpheeo 2019 updated their design recommendations to consider extreme rainfall for a 1 in a 5 year return period instead of a 1 in a 2 year return period for indian class i cities the results of the stationary and non stationary idf curves are shown in figs 10 and 11 for mumbai and bhubaneswar respectively the results for all other cities are included in the supplementary information figs s31 s39 the stationary and non stationary extreme rainfall intensities for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods are tabulated in the supplementary information tables s20 s30 for all cities the effect of discrete time intervals and stationarity modelling of rainfall influences the design of water related infrastructure such as storm drainage networks our results suggest that extreme rainfall idf curves developed using discrete time interval observations may not sufficiently reflect the increasing flooding of current stormwater networks due to changing climatic conditions in the urbanised regions of india an inadequate estimate of storms leads to an increased risk of flooding our findings were based on data from a single station in each selected city each region has local rainfall characteristics and we show that a regional mathematical model can be developed instead of extrapolating results over a large area this study considered the annual maxima series for all eight rainfall durations 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h except for 1 h rainfall durations we considered rainfall duration using the sw annual maximum series variation in the time series length may explain the difference in our results compared with that of previous studies for a few of the locations vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 found that the choice of a covariate cannot only be based on information criteria but requires a numerical model which will aid in understanding the physical phenomena behind these changes and reduce covariate uncertainty we did not address the direct impact of urbanisation on non stationary idf curves computation of 1 h duration extreme rainfall intensity or the discretisation factor for durations 24 h these limitations and possible future directions of research are briefly discussed below 1 the study was carried out using hourly rainfall data due to the unavailability of rainfall data for durations shorter than one hour extreme rainfall intensity was not computed for durations 1 h this could be a focus of future research 2 one hour rainfall intensity can be converted to corresponding sub hourly rainfall intensities 5 10 15 30 and 45 min by considering conversion factors recommended by the indian road congress irc sp 42 2014 however these conversion factors were derived for the lower gangetic basin the derivation of location specific conversion factors to convert 1 h extreme rainfall intensity to sub hourly extreme rainfall intensity should be determined in future research 3 we found that location specific chcf as a covariate influenced long duration extreme rainfall it would be interesting to evaluate the effect of the discretisation factor ratio of sw maxima to fw rainfall maxima as a covariate for shorter duration extreme rainfall using non stationary modelling furthermore we did not quantify the uncertainty in extreme rainfall due to the addition of covariates or determine the quantitative importance of the selected covariates 4 we did not directly consider the impact of urbanisation on extreme rainfall in this study urbanisation related data could be collected for all 11 class i cities to directly quantify the contribution of urbanisation to the non stationary rainfall extremes 5 conclusions we produced true interval non stationary idf curves in the context of changing climatic conditions and considered the effect of temporal discretisation on extreme rainfall for 11 class i cities in india mumbai ahmedabad jaipur new delhi dehradun imphal bhubaneswar kolkata madurai chennai and bengaluru using station based hourly rainfall data according to the 2011 census the city with the highest population in our study was mumbai with 12 442 373 inhabitants and the city with the lowest population was imphal with 268 243 inhabitants the highest and lowest chcf values were 1 218 and 1 093 for kolkata and madurai respectively we determined a significant effect of temporal discretisation on extreme rainfall estimates in certain locations the effect of temporal discretisation on the computation of extreme rainfall for 24 h fw and sw maximum rainfall depth was found to be highest in bhubaneswar 50 and imphal 44 we could not determine a uniform trend for all rainfall durations for the cities considered here there was a non significant increasing trend in 1 h duration ams for all locations except dehradun new delhi and imphal which exhibited a non significant decreasing trend however the 24 h duration sliding window ams exhibited a non significant decreasing trend in jaipur kolkata chennai and imphal with all other locations exhibiting a non significant increasing trend overall a uniform statistically significant trend in rainfall extremes was not observed for any of the cities the true interval non stationary idf curves developed for class i cities in india are useful in the design of stormwater drainage systems we calculated 1 h duration non stationary rainfall intensity for a 2 year return period and stationary rainfall intensity for a 5 year return period of 62 9 mm h and 57 mm h for bengaluru 77 7 mm h and 77 2 mm h for mumbai 60 8 mm h and 60 7 mm h for ahmedabad 47 8 mm h and 49 4 mm h for jaipur 59 8 mm h and 59 3 mm h for madurai 73 6 mm h and 73 mm h for bhubaneswar and 39 6 mm h and 40 1 mm h for imphal respectively non stationary rainfall modelling indicated the influence of temperature based covariates sst lta gta and dtr on short duration 1 h rainfall extremes while the location based chcf and global circulation process based covariates sst emi dmi influence long duration 24 h extreme rainfall time did not qualify as a covariate for short or long duration extreme rainfall modelling comparison of stationary and non stationary idf curves indicated that the stationary 5 year return period extreme rainfall for a given duration almost matched the corresponding 2 year non stationary return period values for bengaluru

2180,the extreme rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves are used to design stormwater infrastructure in the urban areas and need to be developed keeping in view of the warming climate the current study develops the non stationary idf relationships for 11 class i urban cities of india under changing climate the total 11 528 generalized extreme value distribution gev models are developed to quantify non stationarity in extreme rainfall by introducing a clock hour correction factor chcf as a covariate the observed hourly rainfall data of the selected cities located in five different regions of india namely the western region mumbai ahmedabad jaipur northern region new delhi dehradun north eastern region imphal eastern region bhubaneswar kolkata and southern region madurai chennai bengaluru are collected and converted in the fixed and sliding interval annual maximum rainfall series of eight different durations the said data set is used in the computation of chcf evaluation of discretisation effect on extreme rainfall events trend analysis development of stationary and non stationary idf curves the chcf values of seven two cities are above below 1 15 respectively the other two cities show a value 1 15 the effect of temporal discretisation on the computation of extreme rainfall for 24 h fw and sw maximum rainfall depth was found to be highest in bhubaneswar 50 and imphal 44 the trend analysis revealed no statistically significant increasing decreasing trend in extreme rainfall for all durations for all cities under consideration except in the case of bengaluru for 2 3 and 6 h durations chennai for a 48 h duration the current study concluded that under a non stationarity climate the shorter 1 h and longer 24 h duration extreme rainfall is influenced by local and global processes respectively further the short duration extreme events are intensifying with the decrease in the return period the 1 h duration non stationary rainfall intensity for a 2 year return period and stationary rainfall intensity for a 5 year return period of 62 9 mm h and 57 mm h for bengaluru 77 7 mm h and 77 2 mm h for mumbai 60 8 mm h and 60 7 mm h for ahmedabad 47 8 mm h and 49 4 mm h for jaipur 59 8 mm h and 59 3 mm h for madurai 73 6 mm h and 73 mm h for bhubaneswar and 39 6 mm h and 40 1 mm h for imphal respectively the ready to use idf curves developed under stationary and non stationary climate can be useful to design engineers in designing stormwater drainage systems in the selected class i urban cities of india keywords chcf extreme rainfall gev idf curves non stationary stationary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global surface temperature has increased by approximately 1 09 c between 2011 and 2022 than that between 1850 and 1900 with a temperature increase of 1 59 c over the land and 0 88 c over oceans ipcc 2021 global warming is caused by anthropogenic activities that result in the emission of greenhouse gases ipcc 2007 min et al 2011 investigated that about two thirds of land in the northern hemisphere geographical areas have experienced a rise in heavy precipitation occurrences which has been attributed to human induced increases in greenhouse gases the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water increases by approximately 7 for every 1 c increase in global surface temperature trenberth 2011 tabari 2020 which directly increases the rainfall intensity giorgi et al 2011 the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events have increased over most land areas since 1950 with the outlook expected to worsen in the coming years ipcc 2021 recent studies have highlighted an increase in extreme rainfall events in the context of a warming climate along with an increase in rainfall intensity over time cheng and aghakouchak 2014 yilmaz and perera 2014 roxy et al 2017 rainfall in the urban region is affected by cloud condensation nuclei in polluted air the roughness of the underlying surface and modification of convective structures liu et al 2020 extreme rainfall events are increasing in urbanised regions of the eastern united states niyogi et al 2017 and the south asian subcontinent roxy et al 2017 the rate of increase in extreme rainfall events has increased in various parts of the world when compared with that in recent decades alexander et al 2006 vittal et al 2013 vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 however the exact cause of changes in extreme rainfall remains unknown and short duration extreme rainfall events present a key challenge to infrastructure planning several previous studies have analysed extreme rainfall by assuming stationarity sun and ao 2013 ghate and timbadiya 2021 ghate and timbadiya 2022 liu et al 2022 nevertheless recent research has suggested non stationarity may be a more applicable approach for the assessment of extreme rainfall in the face of a changing climate and increased urbanisation milly et al 2008 rosenberg et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 yilmaz and perera 2014 niyogi et al 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 the presence or absence of a significant trend in a rainfall time series does not indicate non stationarity or stationarity teegavarapu and sharma 2021 but the non stationarity of extreme rainfall magnitude duration and time plays an important role in designing stormwater related infrastructure hence the analysis of extreme rainfall using a non stationarity approach is important under the changing climate slater et al 2021 reviewed methods for detecting non stationarity in extreme precipitation events the non stationarity of extreme rainfall was modelled using a probability distribution function by incorporating a trend in location and scale parameters using a time as a covariate cheng and aghakouchak 2014 yilmaz and perera 2014 su and chen 2019 modelled non stationarity in daily rainfall data over the pearl river basin in china using global atmospheric circulation processes to identify the best covariates liu et al 2022 showed that extreme rainfall was significantly more affected by urbanisation than by climate change in the majority of the urban agglomerations 21 cities in the middle reaches of the yangtze river basin china these existing studies demonstrated that the development of non stationary intensity durationfrequency idf curves for urban regions is necessary in the context of climate change and urbanisation mondal and mujumdar 2015 showed a strong influence of local temperature global warming and el niño southern oscillation enso sea surface temperature sst on the non stationarity of extreme rainfall over india the enso cycle refers to fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and the

summer monsoon rainfall ismr ashok et al 2019 recently sardana et al 2022 investigated global circulation processes and the indian ocean dipole iod showing that these strongly influence over indian rainfall the iod has a strong influence on extreme rainfall events across india ajayamohan and rao 2008 sardana et al 2022 and has recently been used as a covariate in modelling non stationary

negative dipole index a positive dipole mode index dmi results in heavy rains and floods in east africa and droughts in indonesia agilan and umamahesh 2017 have adopted five physical processes namely urbanization and local temperature anomaly lta as local processes global temperature anomaly gta as indicator of global warming enso cycle iod as global processes and time for modelling the non stationary extreme rainfall over hyderabad city india vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 developed a time varying frequency analysis framework using climate informed covariates for seven urban cities in india using lta diurnal temperature range dtr enso modoki index emi gta iod and time as selected covariates however time does not qualify as a significant covariate in the indian context agilan and umamahesh 2017 except in the case of 12 h duration rainfall in mumbai vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 the dtr is the difference between the daily minimum and maximum temperatures and correlates with an increase in extreme rainfall intensity duration and frequency in the day and a decrease at night vinnarasi et al 2017 recent studies have shown that the ismr is affected by temperature based covariates such as lta gta dtr and sst agilan and umamahesh 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 the enso modoki cycle is a recently discovered phenomenon linked to severe anomalous warming in the central tropical pacific and cooling in the eastern and western tropical pacific enso modoki events significantly influence precipitation and temperature in many parts of the world ashok et al 2007 each indian monsoon season varies spatiotemporally and several studies have reported a strong influence of the iod and enso modoki on the ismr vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 sankar et al 2021 dandi et al 2020 the need for a systematic examination of global versus regional drivers of indian rainfall extremes has been highlighted by several studies rajeevan et al 2008 mani et al 2009 kishtawal et al 2010 ghosh et al 2012 overall studies in indian regions suggest that local processes lta dtr and urbanisation affect short duration extreme rainfall events in contrast global processes enso cycle iod gta are effective covariates in quantifying non stationarity in long duration extreme rainfall agilan and umamahesh 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 however previous studies have not considered temporal discretisation errors in the development of stationary and non stationary idf curves using true interval maximum rainfall over selected 11 urban cities of india hourly and daily rainfall data are the key inputs for idf analysis the rainfall data are often recorded at discrete time intervals which can lead to inaccurate estimates of the true accumulation of extreme rainfall papalexiou et al 2016 presented a mathematical framework for evaluating the temporal discretisation in a rainfall time series with maximum rainfall estimated in fixed and sliding windows an empirical relationship was developed for the umbria region central italy to overcome the error of temporal discretisation in estimates of rainfall depth and the associated rainfall depth duration frequency curve and concluded that the rainfall recorded at fixed time intervals can result in the underestimation of rainfall depth by up to 50 morbidelli et al 2017 a single multiplicative rainfall correction factor is commonly used typically without considering the local rainfall pattern regional variations or seasonal factors using fixed time intervals to measure rainfall can result in underestimation of the true maximum rainfall brustenga et al 2020 the maximum rainfall duration obtained from the analysis of clock hour based recorded data at fixed time intervals is less than the maximum rainfall for an unrestricted period of actual duration this is because the actual maximum duration of rainfall seldom coincides with the observed fixed time intervals rainfall depths used for flood design should therefore not consider fixed time intervals is 5542 2003 the clock hour correction factor chcf is the ratio of sliding window sw maxima to fixed window fw maxima rainfall the chcf at the maximum rainfall depth for a given return period has previously been applied using a probability distribution for rain gauge stations in mumbai dauji 2022 ahmedabad ghate and timbadiya 2021 and jaipur ghate and timbadiya 2022 because a single uniform value of chcf can lead to incorrect estimation of rainfall and inadequate flood design regional estimates of chcf are necessary in the context of a changing climate in this study we performed a frequency analysis for developing non stationary idf curves using sw maxima for 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h windows for 11 selected cities within india we also introduced a location based covariate chcf anomaly to develop the non stationary idf curve in light of the non stationarity of extreme rainfall the effect of local atmospheric processes on short duration extreme rainfall and the inadequacy of a single value of chcf we aim to fulfil the following objectives for 11 indian cities a computation of chcf for 11 cities in india namely mumbai jaipur ahmedabad dehradun new delhi imphal bhubaneswar kolkata madurai chennai and bengaluru b extreme rainfall trend analysis for hourly data and quantification of the effect of discretisation of fw and sw annual maximum rainfall series c identification of global and local processes influencing extreme rainfall in urban locations in india and d introduction of chcf as a location based covariate along with local and global circulation processes in the development of non stationary idf curves in 2019 the central public health and environmental engineering organisation cpheeo recommended a design rainfall return period of 1 in 5 years for stormwater drainage system design in india for class i cities with a population of 100 000 and above for airports and other critical infrastructure the rainfall return period for stormwater drainage system design is calculated to be 1 in 100 years here we provide stationarity and non stationarity idf curves which can be used in the planning and development of hydrological infrastructure in india 2 study area and data collection we analysed extreme rainfall and introduced a location based covariate in non stationary idf computation for 11 class i cities in india the details of the rainfall data used covariates selected climate regimes and monsoon patterns of all regions are discussed in this section population elevation and average temperature for all 11 class i cities are tabulated in the supplementary information table s1 according to the 2011 census the city in our study with the highest population is mumbai with 12 442 373 inhabitants while the city with the lowest population is imphal with 268 243 inhabitants in the 2011 census all cities recorded a population of 1 lakh the selected cities are located in five different regions of india namely the western region mumbai ahmedabad jaipur northern region new delhi dehradun north eastern region imphal eastern region bhubaneswar kolkata and southern region madurai chennai bengaluru as shown in fig 1 the selected cities fall under three distinct climate regimes as per the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 mumbai chennai bhubaneswar kolkata and imphal are classified as tropical climate regions whereas ahmedabad jaipur and new delhi have an arid climate dehradun madurai and bengaluru are classified as temperate humid subtropical climates of the 11 cities the highest average annual rainfalls were recorded in mumbai 2260 mm dehradun 2075 mm bhubaneswar 1628 mm and chennai 1355 mm followed by imphal 1095 mm bengaluru 970 mm and madurai 840 mm maximum rainfall was attributed to the southwest monsoon in all 11 cities except for chennai and madurai which are affected by the north east monsoon bengaluru experiences rainfall from both the southwest and northeast monsoons we used hourly rainfall data from self recording rain gauge srrg stations procured from the india meteorological department imd pune india the

selected we computed the chcf for each station using 24 h ams fw and sw and introduced the chcf anomaly as a location based covariate local temperature is crucial for driving variations in rainfall

compute the total annual rainfall storm frequency analysis is vital for designing stormwater related infrastructure in urban areas storm frequency analysis also helps reduce urban flooding and several

2015 we computed the chcf using 24 h fw maxima and sw maxima to convert 1 day observed rainfall into true 24 h rainfall accumulation for 11 locations in india we introduced the chcf anomaly as a covariate in non stationary gev modelling we analysed the effect of discretisation on extreme rainfall events using a frequency histogram for the fw and sw maxima data series a flowchart of the methodology adopted in this study is shown in fig 2 and we briefly describe the key steps below we used the ismev package in r for non stationary extreme rainfall modelling gilleland and katz 2016 provided a complete list of the packages required for extreme value analysis 3 1 trend analysis trend analysis of hydrological variables is essential for managing water resources and evaluating risk planning and designing water related infrastructures saplıoğlu and güçlü 2022 it has been found that there is a chance of dependence among hydrometeorological data set and it must be removed from the time series before investigating the trend this effect of autocorrelation in the data records was overcome by using the modified mann kendall mmk test alashan 2020 extreme rainfall trends were then evaluated using the mmk test hamed and rao 1998 and sen s innovative trend analysis ita sen 2012 the increasing decreasing trend in the data was checked and the trend in the data was noted to assess

the non correlated data time series the z statistic is used as the measure of trend where z 0 z 0 and z 0 represents a decreasing increasing and no trend respectively 3 2 stationary and non stationary gev models the stationary gev model uses a constant location parameter μ scale parameter σ and shape parameter ξ whereas the nonstationary gev model introduces trends in μ and σ the gev model was fitted to the ams sw rainfall data series using the method of maximum likelihood coles 2001 chow et al 1988 the method of maximum likelihood estimation mle is the most theoretically accurate method for fitting probability distributions to the data as it produces the most efficient parameter estimators martins and stedinger 2000 in the mle method the optimal value of a probability distribution parameter is the value which maximises the likelihood or joint probability of occurrence of the observed sample estimate of the population parameters with the least average error chow et al 1988 in the current study the shape parameter was kept constant because its precise estimation is difficult agilan and umamahesh 2015 and long term observation is required to accurately model ξ cheng et al 2014 the gev incorporates type i ξ 0 type ii ξ 0 and type iii ξ 0 distributions of various families such as gumbel fréchet and weibull respectively coles 2001 we used the gev model to explore the

supplementary information table s2 the models that incorporate a trend in the location parameter μ 1 are shown in eq 8 as gev 2 whereas models with a trend in both the location μ 1 and scale σ 1

addition of covariates significantly increased the variance explained by the model the lr test model is defined in eq 10 where the negative log likelihood of g e v s and g e v n s approximately follows the χ 2 distribution with degrees of freedom d f coles 2001 su and chen 2019 after introducing the covariates into the gev model the significance of the effect of covariates in the modelling of extreme rainfall was evaluated using the p value of the lr test which was compared between g e v s and g e v n s the best non stationary model should be adopted over the stationary model where p

5 akaike information criterion the akaike information criterion aic for the fitted gev model m with parameter k is defined in eq 12 12 a i c m 2 log l m 2 k where the first term 2 log l m is twice the negative log likelihood corresponding to the fitted gev model m which is a measure of the lack of fit to the data smaller values indicate a better fit the second term 2 k indicates the penalty to penalize models having large dimension akaike 1973 narisetty 2020 models with lower aic values showed a better balance between these two terms the aic reflects the parity between model complexity and poor fit narisetty 2020 the aic is used to the select the model when the several models are involved katz 2013 a lower aic value indicates a better model fit su and chen 2019 the covariates of the best gev model are then selected as best covariates 4 results and discussion 4 1 computation of chcf to accurately perform storm frequency analysis in the context of a warming climate and intensifying extreme rainfall events in india the location specific study of chcf is inevitable the is 5542 2003 guide for storm analysis suggests a chcf of 1 15 across india to convert 1 day maximum rainfall into 24 h maximum rainfall however a region wise correction factor varies depending upon the climatology the temporal discretisation error in rainfall can lead to inadequate design of water related infrastructures we computed location specific chcfs to overcome the temporal discretisation error in the maximum rainfall over 24 h discrete time intervals fig 3 the deviation from the mean value i e the chcf value computed for each location was adopted as the chcf anomaly and used as a location based covariate for modelling non stationary extreme rainfall frequency curves the chcf value ranged from 1 093 for madurai to 1 218 for kolkata most chcf values were 1 15 with the exception of new delhi and dehradun with values 1 15 and madurai and ahmedabad with values 1 15 in this study the true interval maximum rainfall was adopted over a fixed maximum rainfall interval hence the chcf anomaly was introduced as a covariate however if one uses a fixed interval maximum rainfall for non stationary extreme rainfall modelling chcf can directly be used as a covariate 4 2 effect of temporal discretisation on extreme rainfall we produced histograms for rainfall recorded in discrete intervals and the calculated true interval rainfall accumulation for all selected rainfall durations 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h we calculated the percentage change in the 24 h fw sw extreme rainfall depth to evaluate the temporal discretisation error in the rainfall depth some extreme events were captured in our study for example the extreme rainfall event of 26 july 2005 in mumbai has shown the fw sw accumulation of rainfall as 808 mm 944 mm presented in fig 4 k and l the discretisation error in the 24 hr rainfall depth was 17 ahmedabad reported the highest 24 h rainfall in 1999 the fw sw extreme rainfall was 330 mm 363 mm is presented in fig s1 k and l the discretisation error in the rainfall depth was 10 jaipur reported the highest 24 h rainfall in 1981 with an fw sw extreme rainfall of 287 mm 349 mm as presented in fig s2 k and l the discretisation error was 22 chennai reported the highest 24 h rainfall in 2015 the fw sw extreme rainfall of 348 mm 375 mm as presented in fig s7 k and l the discretisation error in the rainfall depth was 8 bhubaneswar reported that a cyclone caused the highest 1 day rainfall on 29th october 1999 with an fw sw extreme rainfall of 304 mm 456 mm is presented in fig s8 k and l the discretisation error in the rainfall depth was 50 the highest 24 h rainfall for kolkata was reported in 1978 with an fw sw extreme rainfall of 360 mm 400 mm presented in fig s9 k and l the discretisation error was 11 imphal recorded its highest 24 h rainfall in 2003 with an fw sw extreme rainfall of 95 mm 137 mm as presented in fig s10 k and l the discretisation error was 44 the rainfall recorded in a fixed time interval might lead to underestimation of a single rainfall depth of up to 50 morbidelli et al 2017 the highest temporal discretisation error in the maximum rainfall depth was observed for bhubaneswar as 50 and lowest for chennai as 8 the remaining cities dehradun madurai new delhi and bengaluru showed a temporal discretisation error of 5 for the 24 h rainfall depth the effect of temporal discretisation on the extreme rainfall for ahmedabad jaipur new delhi dehradun madurai bengaluru chennai bhubaneswar kolkata and imphal for 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h fw and sw maxima are shown in the supplementary information figs s1 s10 we showed that extreme rainfall events not captured by the fw maxima were indeed recorded by the sw maxima the higher frequency value in ams sw is shown in fig 4 and indicates a lack of high rainfall in the ams fw in mumbai extreme rainfall frequencies recorded between 200 and 300 mm and 300 400 mm were lower in fw estimates than that in sw estimates results for other cities also showed the same pattern we infer therefore that a few extreme events were excluded due to the fixed interval record of rainfall hence we recommend use of the sw maxima series over the fw maxima series for analysing the frequency of extreme rainfall 4 3 trend analysis the increase or decrease in magnitude of a variable related to extreme rainfall does not always indicate non stationarity yilmaz and perera 2014 we evaluated the general trend in the data using the mmk test hamed and rao 1998 and ita şen 2012 we established annual series for eight selected rainfall durations of the fw and sw maxima the mmk test at the 5 significance level is presented in table 2 for each location and for all rainfall durations values greater than 1 96 and less than 1 96 represent statistically significant increasing and decreasing trends in rainfall extremes respectively hamed and rao 1998 extreme rainfall of 1 h duration shows a non significant increasing trend for all locations except dehradun new delhi and imphal which show a non significant decreasing trend the 24 h sw extreme rainfall time series indicates a non significant increasing trend in all locations except jaipur kolkata chennai and imphal which show a non significant decreasing trend we also performed ita on the extreme rainfall data for all durations and locations to ascertain the trends in extreme rainfall the ita plots for all eight durations are shown for mumbai in fig 5 the ita plots for ahmedabad jaipur new delhi dehradun madurai bengaluru chennai bhubaneswar kolkata and imphal are presented in the supplementary information figs s11 s20 we produced an ita plot for 1 h duration rainfall using only fw rainfall maxima as data for 1 h is not available to prepare the sw rainfall maxima series an illustration of possible trends was provided by dabanlı et al 2016 which provides a visual basis for distinguishing the types of trends the 1 1 45 straight line divides the diagram into two equal triangular parts where the upper triangular area indicates an increase in rainfall extremes and the lower indicates a decrease şen 2012 if the data plots on or close to the 1 1 45 straight line there is no significant trend in the hydrometeorological record şen 2012 the results of the ita support the observations of the mmk test for all durations and cities considered herein we found a lack of uniform trend for all rainfall durations in all cities this finding is in line with the observation of ghosh et al 2012 for indian monsoon extreme rainfall who explored 1 1 gridded observed rainfall data over india our finding contrasts with the study from goswami et al 2006 who used daily rainfall data at high grid resolution 4 4 stationary and non stationary extreme rainfall modelling the annual maximum extreme rainfall intensity series for 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h durations were computed using the stationary gev model the extreme rainfall time series was extracted for all durations except 1 h using the sw maxima the best non stationary gev models with an lr test p value 0 05 are shortlisted for all eight durations and 11 locations we performed and analysed a total of 11 528 131 models 11 cities 8 rainfall durations gev models and selected the best models using aic the gev models with an lr test p value 0 05 are listed in table 3 for 24 h duration rainfall with corresponding aic values for each of the 11 cities the optimal model for a 24 h duration rainfall is highlighted in yellow in table 3 models for other rainfall durations are listed with aic and p values 0 05 in the supplementary information tables s3 s11 the covariates of the optimal models table 3 tables s3 s11 for each duration and stationary model s are summarised in fig 6 the optimal covariates adopted in the development of non stationary idf curves for a given duration and city are presented in figs 7 and 8 we did not assess the quantitative importance of the selected covariates but this should be the focus of future studies we did however quantify the percentage change in stationary and non stationary extreme rainfall this is presented in section 4 5 of the 11 locations selected the highest 1 h stationary gev model rainfall intensities for a 2 year return period were observed in dehradun 60 5 mm h mumbai 55 1 mm h bhubaneswar 55 mm h and kolkata 53 6 mm h the non stationary gev models with varying location and scale parameters indicate the highest rainfall intensity in mumbai 77 7 mm h and bhubaneswar 73 6 mm h dehradun and kolkata have not shown any significant effect of covariates and remain stationary for 1 hr duration for 1 h duration rainfall in mumbai we found the gev 22 model to be the optimal non stationary model with chcf and dmi as covariates and a varying location parameter in the case of bhubaneswar however the gev 129 model was optimal and covariates included emi gta sst and dmi with varying location and scale parameters in addition to these covariates dtr was found to influence 1 h extreme rainfall intensity in jaipur additionally we found that rainfall intensity in madurai was significantly affected by chcf and in ahmedabad by dmi overall 1 h duration extreme rainfall was influenced by location based chcf and a combination of temperature processes such as sst lta dtr and gta the temperature based covariates had more influence on 1 h duration short duration rainfall than location based chcf these observations agree with previous findings by agilan and umamahesh 2017 and vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 we introduced a location specific chcf as a covariate and found that it influenced extreme rainfall intensity modelling we determined that chcf as one of the influencing covariates for 24 hr duration in the 8 out of the 11 cities mumbai ahmedabad new delhi dehradun bengaluru chennai kolkata and imphal this indicates that not considering chcf in the computation of idf in these cities underestimates the extreme rainfall at the given frequencies and therefore may lead to inadequate design of stormwater drainage systems however we did not investigate the discretisation factor ratio of sw maxima to fw maxima for extreme rainfall with durations shorter than 24 h future work will investigate the use of a location specific discretisation factor as a covariate for shorter durations of extreme rainfall in order to quantify non stationarity for the 24 h duration rainfall in addition to the location based covariates we determined an influence of global processes such as emi and dmi in non stationary modelling at all 11 locations this agrees with observations of some indian cities from vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 rainfall in kolkata has shown stationary behaviour for all durations except 24 h duration rainfall where gev 60 showed chcf lta and sst as influencing covariates as there is a large variation in regional climate within india the influence of covariates on non stationary rainfall extremes is different for each region we considered our study revealed the influence of lta in the western region whereas the northern region was influenced by sst iod and emi global circulation processes we found that lta sst and chcf influence rainfall in the north eastern region whereas the lta and gta influence rainfall in the eastern region extreme rainfall in the southern region is influenced by iod none of the non stationary models with time as a covariate qualified as the optimal model for any of the 11 cities considered here temperature based covariates contributed to almost all durations of extreme rainfall at all locations when a non stationary scenario was modelled these observations agree with previous studies where the clausius clapeyron relation states that an increase in temperature increases the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere which further influences the intensity of extreme rainfall giorgi et al 2011 ali and mishra 2017 pumo et al 2019 hourly rainfall intensity is more sensitive than daily rainfall to changes in local air temperature westra et al 2014 the stationary and best nonstationary gev model parameters are presented in table 4 for mumbai and the parameters for other cities are presented in the supplementary information tables s10 s19 we determined goodness of fit indicators model diagnostic plots such as standardised quantile qq plots and probability pp plots for all the selected best stationary and non stationary models to check the overall performance of the model fits the plots show points close to linearity among empirical and model quantiles and probabilities which indicates a reasonably good fit of the model coles 2001 the model diagnostics plot for mumbai is shown in fig 9 the qq and pp plots for all eight rainfall durations and the remaining ten locations are presented in the supplementary information figs s21 s30 for ahmedabad jaipur new delhi dehradun madurai bengaluru chennai bhubaneswar kolkata and imphal the empirical model quantiles and probabilities showed a relatively good fit for the selected models the selected best stationary and non stationary models for each duration were utilised in the development of the idf curves 4 5 non stationary idf curves we used the best selected models showing stationary and non stationary behaviour to develop the idf curves for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods for all eight rainfall durations and for each of the cities we calculated the highest non stationary 1 h 2 year return period rainfall for mumbai at 77 7 mm h and the stationary equivalent at 55 1 mm h the next highest 1 h 2 year return period rainfall estimates were for bhubaneswar with a non stationary estimate of 73 6 mm h and a stationary estimate of 55 mm h short duration extreme events increase in intensity with a decrease in the return period we calculated 1 h duration non stationary rainfall intensity for a 2 year return period and stationary rainfall intensity for a 5 year return period of 62 9 mm h and 57 mm h for bengaluru 77 7 mm h and 77 2 mm h for mumbai 60 8 mm h and 60 7 mm h for ahmedabad 47 8 mm h and 49 4 mm h for jaipur 59 8 mm h and 59 3 mm h for madurai 73 6 mm h and 73 mm h for bhubaneswar and 39 6 mm h and 40 1 mm h for imphal these results suggest that during the 5 year return period extreme rainfall events occurred at a 2 year return period under non stationary conditions consideration of stationary extreme rainfall over a given return period leads to underestimation of the peak discharge and can result in urban flooding the difference in rainfall intensity between stationary and non stationary conditions shows that stationary models resulted in underestimation of extreme rainfall in mumbai and bhubaneswar for a 2 year return period and 1 h duration the percentage increase in rainfall intensity is 41 in mumbai and 34 in bhubaneswar and for a 10 year return period rainfall intensity increases by 31 and 22 in each city respectively the other locations also showed variation in the non stationary and stationary extreme rainfall intensity for a 1 h duration and 2 year 10 year return period the percentage increase in the rainfall intensity for bengaluru 36 14 ahmedabad 35 31 jaipur 25 17 madurai 21 8 imphal 28 21 cpheeo 2019 updated their design recommendations to consider extreme rainfall for a 1 in a 5 year return period instead of a 1 in a 2 year return period for indian class i cities the results of the stationary and non stationary idf curves are shown in figs 10 and 11 for mumbai and bhubaneswar respectively the results for all other cities are included in the supplementary information figs s31 s39 the stationary and non stationary extreme rainfall intensities for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods are tabulated in the supplementary information tables s20 s30 for all cities the effect of discrete time intervals and stationarity modelling of rainfall influences the design of water related infrastructure such as storm drainage networks our results suggest that extreme rainfall idf curves developed using discrete time interval observations may not sufficiently reflect the increasing flooding of current stormwater networks due to changing climatic conditions in the urbanised regions of india an inadequate estimate of storms leads to an increased risk of flooding our findings were based on data from a single station in each selected city each region has local rainfall characteristics and we show that a regional mathematical model can be developed instead of extrapolating results over a large area this study considered the annual maxima series for all eight rainfall durations 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h and 48 h except for 1 h rainfall durations we considered rainfall duration using the sw annual maximum series variation in the time series length may explain the difference in our results compared with that of previous studies for a few of the locations vinnarasi and dhanya 2022 found that the choice of a covariate cannot only be based on information criteria but requires a numerical model which will aid in understanding the physical phenomena behind these changes and reduce covariate uncertainty we did not address the direct impact of urbanisation on non stationary idf curves computation of 1 h duration extreme rainfall intensity or the discretisation factor for durations 24 h these limitations and possible future directions of research are briefly discussed below 1 the study was carried out using hourly rainfall data due to the unavailability of rainfall data for durations shorter than one hour extreme rainfall intensity was not computed for durations 1 h this could be a focus of future research 2 one hour rainfall intensity can be converted to corresponding sub hourly rainfall intensities 5 10 15 30 and 45 min by considering conversion factors recommended by the indian road congress irc sp 42 2014 however these conversion factors were derived for the lower gangetic basin the derivation of location specific conversion factors to convert 1 h extreme rainfall intensity to sub hourly extreme rainfall intensity should be determined in future research 3 we found that location specific chcf as a covariate influenced long duration extreme rainfall it would be interesting to evaluate the effect of the discretisation factor ratio of sw maxima to fw rainfall maxima as a covariate for shorter duration extreme rainfall using non stationary modelling furthermore we did not quantify the uncertainty in extreme rainfall due to the addition of covariates or determine the quantitative importance of the selected covariates 4 we did not directly consider the impact of urbanisation on extreme rainfall in this study urbanisation related data could be collected for all 11 class i cities to directly quantify the contribution of urbanisation to the non stationary rainfall extremes 5 conclusions we produced true interval non stationary idf curves in the context of changing climatic conditions and considered the effect of temporal discretisation on extreme rainfall for 11 class i cities in india mumbai ahmedabad jaipur new delhi dehradun imphal bhubaneswar kolkata madurai chennai and bengaluru using station based hourly rainfall data according to the 2011 census the city with the highest population in our study was mumbai with 12 442 373 inhabitants and the city with the lowest population was imphal with 268 243 inhabitants the highest and lowest chcf values were 1 218 and 1 093 for kolkata and madurai respectively we determined a significant effect of temporal discretisation on extreme rainfall estimates in certain locations the effect of temporal discretisation on the computation of extreme rainfall for 24 h fw and sw maximum rainfall depth was found to be highest in bhubaneswar 50 and imphal 44 we could not determine a uniform trend for all rainfall durations for the cities considered here there was a non significant increasing trend in 1 h duration ams for all locations except dehradun new delhi and imphal which exhibited a non significant decreasing trend however the 24 h duration sliding window ams exhibited a non significant decreasing trend in jaipur kolkata chennai and imphal with all other locations exhibiting a non significant increasing trend overall a uniform statistically significant trend in rainfall extremes was not observed for any of the cities the true interval non stationary idf curves developed for class i cities in india are useful in the design of stormwater drainage systems we calculated 1 h duration non stationary rainfall intensity for a 2 year return period and stationary rainfall intensity for a 5 year return period of 62 9 mm h and 57 mm h for bengaluru 77 7 mm h and 77 2 mm h for mumbai 60 8 mm h and 60 7 mm h for ahmedabad 47 8 mm h and 49 4 mm h for jaipur 59 8 mm h and 59 3 mm h for madurai 73 6 mm h and 73 mm h for bhubaneswar and 39 6 mm h and 40 1 mm h for imphal respectively non stationary rainfall modelling indicated the influence of temperature based covariates sst lta gta and dtr on short duration 1 h rainfall extremes while the location based chcf and global circulation process based covariates sst emi dmi influence long duration 24 h extreme rainfall time did not qualify as a covariate for short or long duration extreme rainfall modelling comparison of stationary and non stationary idf curves indicated that the stationary 5 year return period extreme rainfall for a given duration almost matched the corresponding 2 year non stationary return period values for bengaluru mumbai ahmedabad jaipur madurai bhubaneswar and imphal this implies an intensification of shorter duration extreme rainfall events with a decrease in the return period declaration of competing

2181,sulfide oxidation coupled with carbonate weathering is thought to be a source of co2 over geological timescales to offset co2 drawdown from silicate weathering its impact on the carbon budget of weathering at the catchment scale is generally constrained by utilizing riverine water chemistry and the isotope value δ34s of sulfate however the multiple origins of riverine sulfate and the high variability of sulfide derived δ34s certainly limit the determination of sulfate sources and thus our understanding of the role of sulfuric acid induced weathering in the carbon budget in this study to quantify the carbon budget between weathering by carbonic and sulfuric acids in mountainous catchments the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river in southwest china a monte carlo inversion model is employed for major element concentrations and sulfate δ34s δ34sso4 this inversion quantitatively partitions the cations and sulfate between different sources and further identifies the pyrite derived δ34s and the flux ratios of alkalinity to dissolved inorganic carbon δalk δdic inversion results reveal that the majority of major cations 90 is derived from carbonate calcite and dolomite dissolution and that riverine sulfate budget is predominately contributed by pyrite oxidation and precipitation in the yinjiang river the average δ34sso4 is 8 4 in the upper and middle reaches but declines significantly to 0 4 in the lower reaches in the shiqian river and yuqing river δ34sso4 mainly cluster around 3 6 5 7 and 5 5 8 5 respectively inversion results suggest that the primary controls on δ34sso4 are the variability of lithology and the variation in the proportional contribution of pyrite oxidation to riverine sulfate in the yinjiang river the fraction of h2so4 driven weathering is highly variable and higher in the lower reaches than in the upper reaches attributing to distinct underlying lithology in the catchment a widespread distribution of coal bearing strata the weathering fluxes with 1 δalk δdic 2 evidenced that the negative alkalinity flux from carbonate weathering driven by sulfuric acid from both pyrite oxidation and acid deposition counteracts much of the alkalinity flux from silicate weathering this is implicated on the timescale between marine carbonate precipitation and sulfate reduction 5 10 kyr and 10 myr indicating that weathering in these catchments acts as short term sinks of atmospheric co2 but long term sources of it moreover reanalysis of prior datasets of karst dominated catchments in china also highlight the important role of pyrite oxidation and acid precipitation in the carbon budget keywords chemical weathering sulfur isotope pyrite oxidation acid precipitation karst region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction silicate weathering by carbonic acid h2co3 consumes carbon dioxide co2 in the ocean atmosphere system and synchronously generates the cations and alkalinity alk necessary for the burial of carbonate minerals beaulieu et al 2012 ma et al 2020 raymo and ruddiman 1992 in contrast carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid h2so4 formed by sulfide oxidation generates dissolved inorganic carbon dic and releases co2 into the ocean atmosphere system calmels et al 2007 lerman et al 2007 torres et al 2014 which is thought to compensate for the co2 drawdown from silicate weathering calmels et al 2007 hilton and west 2020 li et al 2008 torres et al 2017 carbonate weathering coupled with sulfide oxidation regulates atmospheric pco2 a transient source of co2 in the atmosphere instead of co2 sequestration on timescales longer than carbonate precipitation but shorter than that of marine sulfate reduction 105 years while 107 years calmels et al 2007 lerman et al 2007 liu et al 2022b torres et al 2016 as an agent of weathering h2so4 can be produced both by the oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals mainly pyrite fes2 enriched in minerals eq 1 and or by acid deposition e g through the oxidation of atmospheric so2 emitted from coal combustion eq 2 1 fes 2 15 4 o 2 7 2 h 2 o fe oh 3 2 so 4 2 4 h 2 so 2 2 oh h 2 so 4 so 4 2 2 h carbonate weathering has traditionally been thought to have no implications for atmospheric co2 over timescales longer than the time of marine carbonate compensation 5 10 kyr archer et al 2000 berner et al 1983 zhong et al 2018 the alk and dic from carbonate weathering are consumed during marine carbonate burial 1 2 caco3 h 1 2 ca2 1 2 h2co3 this canonical weathering framework neglects sources of h other than dic yet the strong acids such as h2so4 naturally formed by sulfide oxidation can provide the h required to consume alk acid deposition can also provide h2so4 which may be formed as a result of coal combustion acid deposition derived h2so4 is therefore the result of anthropogenically driven oxidation of sulfide minerals and or organic sulfur impacting chemical weathering and carbon cycling in the anthropocene based on the above the effect of chemical weathering on atmospheric pco2 depends upon the balance between 1 alk generation by carbonate and silicate mineral dissolution and 2 h2so4 generation by the oxidation of sulfide minerals and acid deposition torres et al 2016 ascertaining the role of h2so4 weathering in the total chemical weathering budget of catchment is thus essential for quantifying the carbon budget of catchment weathering although karst landscapes occupy only 15 of the earth s land surface ford and williams 2007 carbonate weathering and sulfide oxidation in karst regions make a huge contribution of alk and sulfate export to the river systems and thus affect carbon cycle li et al 2008 this is mainly due to the three orders of magnitude in the dissolution rates of carbonate and sulfide minerals faster than silicate minerals morse and arvidson 2002 williamson and rimstidt 1994 moreover by increasing those acid emissions from human activities atmospheric deposition increases its influence on chemical weathering jiang et al 2018 lerman et al 2007 li et al 2008 liu et al 2016 prior research estimated that co2 consumption by weathering has decreased by approximately 13 on a global scale due to h2so4 deposition amiotte suchet et al 1995 liu et al 2016 given the wide distribution of coal containing strata southwestern china was once severely affected by sulfuric acid rain which is a product of high sulfur content coal combustion larssen et al 1999 therefore the regulation of naturally and anthropogenically driven sulfuric acid weathering on atmospheric pco2 in a karst dominated region cannot be ignored and thus need to be further evaluated riverine so4 2 is mainly sourced from pyrite oxidation sedimentary sulfate mineral dissolution e g gypsum caso4 2h2o and atmospheric and anthropogenic inputs burke et al 2018 calmels et al 2007 krouse and mayer 2000 of these sources pyrite oxidation and atmospheric deposition can provide h2so4 as the h donor for carbonate and silicate weathering hence quantifying riverine sulfate sources is prerequisite for understanding the natural silicate weathering climate feedback and predicting the impact of additional atmospheric sourced sulfuric acid most of previous studies distinguished sulfide derived sulfate and sedimentary derived sulfate by using sulfur isotopes δ34sso4 and hydrochemistry calmels et al 2007 li et al 2014 liu and han 2020b zhang et al 2020 sulfur isotopes provide a useful tracer for investigating sulfuric acid driven weathering because of the distinct sulfur isotope values found between sedimentary sulfate and sulfide minerals krouse and mayer 2000 torres et al 2016 and the minimal s isotope fractionation between the sulfur mineral sources and so4 2 balci et al 2007 claypool et al 1980 heidel and tichomirowa 2011 thode 1991 the δ34s of sedimentary sulfate such as gypsum range from 10 to 30 kampschulte and strauss 2004 claypool et al 1980 while the δ34s of pyrite and other sulfide bearing minerals vary from 50 to 10 relph et al 2021 the effect of sulfuric acid weathering on the global carbon cycle depends on the outcrop of lithology minerals in the weathering zone lithology controls the abundance of available sulfide minerals and thus the ability of those lithologies to generate sulfuric acid prior studies suggest that riverine δ34sso4 are mainly influenced by lithology kemeny et al 2021 liu et al 2022a although prior research e g jiang et al 2007 had investigated δ34sso4 in the wujiang river catchment large catchments have complex lithologies which result in greater uncertainty for deciphering the origin of riverine δ34sso4 variation in space in addition carbonate minerals are characterized by fast kinetics of dissolution kump et al 2000 and thus chemical weathering is more sensitive to climate changes in a karst region than in a non karst region gaillardet et al 1999 zhong et al 2020 therefore chemical weathering processes in karst regions needs to be investigated in addition prior works in the wujiang river catchment and other karst regions also lack an accurate quantification of the carbon budget between weathering by carbonic and sulfuric acids and a comprehensive assessment of sulfuric acid weathering considering the impact of atmospherically sourced h2so4 huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2007 lang et al 2011 li et al 2008 to assess the effects of sulfuric acid weathering on atmospheric pco2 we present the data of δ34sso4 and major ion concentrations of river water samples from mountainous catchments in southwest china the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river this study aims to 1 decipher the sources of dissolved loads 2 identify the controls of riverine δ34sso4 3 evaluate the effect of pyrite and precipitation derived h2so4 weathering on atmospheric pco2 in karst areas 2 geological setting the yinjiang river the yuqing river and the shiqian river draining the northeast of guizhou province china 27 n 29 n and 107 e 109 e are the main tributaries of the wujiang river fig 1 which is one of the largest tributaries of the changjiang yangtze river the yinjiang river drains an area of 1231 km2 with a mainstream length of about 96 km and covers an altitude difference from around 2024 m at its upper reaches to around 340 m at its lower reaches chen et al 2021 the shiqian river and the yuqing river are 114 and 111 km in length and have drainage areas of 2101 and 1561 km2 respectively the climate in these catchments is dominated by a monsoon system with most of the annual precipitation occurring between april and october the annual precipitation and air temperature range from 1119 to 1409 mm and from 14 c to 22 c respectively chen et al 2021 zhong et al 2020 the annual discharges are 14 4 15 6 and 10 0 m3 s for the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river respectively chen et al 2021 the exposed strata in these catchments are mainly pre jurassic strata carbonate rocks include permian and triassic limestone dolomitic limestone dolomites and low grade metamorphic rocks fig 1 additionally igneous rocks only account for a small fraction of the bedrock in the shiqian river catchment the bedrock of the yinjiang river catchment is mainly composed of carbonate rocks and clastic rocks such as shale sand shale and siltstone han and liu 2004 and a small proportion of igneous rocks and low grade metamorphic rocks e g slates and phyllites fig 1 lithological information was modified from pang et al 2017 karstification is well developed in this study area silicate minerals are widely distributed in the upper reaches while carbonate rocks are distributed in the lower reaches of the yinjiang river 3 sampling and analytical methods during the high flow season in september 2018 water samples were collected from the river surface of three catchments i e the yinjiang river shiqian river and yuqing river catchments the sampling locations are shown in fig 1 water temperature t ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ by a multi parameter water quality analyser wtw ph 3630 cond 3630 germany the alk was titrated with 0 02 mol l hydrochloric acid within 24 h of sampling surface water samples were filtered in the field through 0 45 µm millipore nitrocellulose membrane filters and then stored in pre washed low density polyethylene bottles at below 4 c for further analyses for cationic analysis samples were immediately acidified to ph 2 with thermally distilled hno3 and then stored major cations k na ca2 and mg2 and dissolved silica sio2 were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes vista mpx usa with an analytical precision better than 5 major anions so4 2 and cl were determined by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 90 usa with an uncertainty of 5 the data on major cation and anion concentrations of samples in this study were originally published in the study by chen et al 2021 to measure δ34sso4 the filtered samples were acidified using hcl and then the so4 2 was precipitated as baso4 by adding a bacl2 solution after the procedures of purifying and drying the precipitate the δ34sso4 was determined by an elemental analyzer ea coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms the δ34sso4 were reported relative to the vienna canyon diablo troilite v cdt with an accuracy better than 0 2 all of the experiments above were carried out in the school of earth system sciences tianjin university 4 results the major ion concentrations and δ34sso4 of the samples in this study are listed in table 1 the concentration of so4 2 in the yinjiang river varied over a wide range from 95 µmol l to 1167 µmol l which was considerably higher than that of the changjiang river 94 467 µmol l chetelat et al 2008 and the average value of world s large rivers 390 µmol l gaillardet et al 1999 in the yinjiang river catchment the concentration of so4 2 showed low values in the upper and middle reaches 95 352 µmol l and relatively higher values in the lower reaches 619 1167 µmol l fig 2 a the so4 2 concentration in the shiqian river and yuqing river had narrow ranges from 161 µmol l to 266 µmol l and from 234 µmol l to 296 µmol l respectively fig 2b and table 1 these values were comparable with that of the wujiang river 120 980 µmol l han and liu 2004 and the changjiang river 94 467 µmol l chetelat et al 2008 but slightly lower than that of the world s large rivers average at 390 µmol l gaillardet et al 1999 the δ34sso4 in the yinjiang river ranged from 0 3 to 9 7 table 1 the δ34sso4 in the shiqian river ranged from 0 6 to 5 8 and slightly decreased downstream fig 2b the yuqing river had a narrow δ34sso4 range from 5 5 to 8 5 table 1 overall the range of δ34sso4 was largely consistent with the prior values from the wujiang river 11 5 to 8 3 jiang et al 2007 in the yinjiang river catchment the δ34sso4 was negatively correlated with so4 2 concentration fig 2c r2 0 43 the non linear decrease in δ34sso4 was accompanied by increasing so4 2 concentration from the upper reaches to the lower reaches 5 discussion 5 1 sources of riverine major cations and sulfate identifying the sources of riverine dissolved loads is prerequisite for deducing the chemical weathering fluxes of the catchment and understanding the role of chemical weathering on in regulating atmospheric co2 atmospheric input carbonate weathering silicate weathering evaporite dissolution and anthropogenic input are the major potential sources of major ions in river water in the study catchments chetelat et al 2008 fan et al 2014 millot et al 2003 moon et al 2007 xiao et al 2022 the concentrations of major cations and anions of samples in this study were expressed as the ratio of one cation concentration to the total cation concentration ʃ 2ca2 2 mg2 na k in units of charge equivalents the high ca2 σ and low na σ ratios indicate that the majority of positive charge in the solution derives from precipitation and or carbonate weathering fig 3 a the concentration of cl varied between 29 µmol l and 150 µmol l slightly higher than that in local precipitation 0 6 µmol l to 54 5 µmol l wu et al 2011 yan et al 2019 given the limitation of the relative abundance of cl the contribution of precipitation to the dissolved cation budgets is low fig 3b suggesting that the majority of cation charge is derived from calcite and or dolomite weathering there is no geological record of evaporite strata exposed in the study catchment thus the contribution of evaporite dissolution to riverine dissolved cation charge is thought to be negligible han and liu 2004 after precipitation correction the remaining cl in river water can be considered to be entirely derived from an evaporite source a forward model method was previously used by chen et al 2021 to constrain the sources of cations and the results showed that the contributions of anthropogenic input to dissolved total cation charge are extremely low 1 4 to 7 8 indicating that the anthropogenic contribution in this study is negligible the so4 2 concentration in the water sample 95 μmol l to 1167 μmol l was higher than that in local precipitation 6 4 µmol l to 542 5 µmol l yan et al 2019 indicating that oxidative weathering of pyrite may be another source of riverine so4 2 in addition to precipitation fig s1a shows that the water samples lie far from the line of 2 ca2 mg2 hco3 1 1 and the charges of ca2 and mg2 are balanced with those of hco3 and so4 2 fig s1b chen et al 2021 these observations suggest that atmospheric input acid deposition and oxidative weathering of pyrite are important potential sources of riverine so4 2 burke et al 2018 calmels et al 2007 jiang et al 2018 kemeny et al 2021 torres et al 2016 following the method proposed by kemeny et al 2021 and kemeny and torres 2021 we used a monte carlo inversion model to estimate the sources of major cations and sulfate ca2 mg2 na k and so4 2 precipitation evaporite silicate and two carbonate end members i e calcite and dolomite were considered in the inversion see end members in table 2 on a given iteration the ca2 ʃ na ʃ k ʃ and cl ʃ of each end member were pulled randomly from normal distributions with end member specific means and standard deviations and then the ratios of mg2 ʃ for each end member were calculated to ensure mass balance based on the other cation ratios table 2 for each of the ions x of interest ca2 mg2 na k cl and so4 2 we can write a set of mass balance equations 3 x σ river x σ precipitation f precipitation x σ evaporite f evaporite x σ silicate f silicate x σ calcite f calcite x σ dolomite f dolomite 4 f precipitation f evaporite f silicate f calcite f dolomite 1 where f precipitation f evaporite f silicate f calcite and f dolomite are the proportion of dissolved ions x derived from precipitation evaporite silicate calcite and dolomite respectively pyrite oxidation evaporite dissolution and precipitation inputs are three potential sources for so4 2 in the study catchments following the studies by torres et al 2016 and kemeny et al 2021 we took the so4 2 ʃ ratio of the non precipitation and non evaporite end members to reflect the weathering driven by h2so4 from pyrite oxidation we then calculated the proportion of so4 2 sourced from the calcite dolomite and silicate end members which we took as the proportion sourced from pyrite oxidation on a given iteration the ca2 mg2 na k cl and so4 2 were altered by values pulled randomly from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation corresponding to analytical precision the matlab function fmincon was used to solve the resulting set of end member chemistry and river observations the optimization cost function was the sum of squared proportional offsets between observations and the model estimate constrained to deliver positive solutions and used as an initial condition from standard least squares inversion simulation results were only accepted when all variables were not 15 discrepant from observations in all accepted inversion instances the sum of fractional contributions from end members was between 85 and 115 of each observation we attempted 100 000 simulations for each sample which were successfully inverted 1000 times we used the median of accepted simulation results and took the 25th and 75th percentiles of accepted simulation results as the inversion error fig 4 and table s1 show the calculated proportions of major cations and sulfate from different end members using the monte carlo inversion model the result shows that 1 the majority of ca2 in rivers 72 to 90 were from calcite and dolomite and mg2 from dolomite consistent with the result of forward model estimation by chen et al 2021 2 the proportional contribution of precipitation and pyrite oxidation to riverine so4 2 was between 82 and 100 consistent with the results of the wujiang river and its tributaries in the previous study which found that approximately 95 of so4 2 was derived from pyrite oxidation and precipitation jiang et al 2007 in detail in the shiqian river and yuqing river catchments contributions of precipitation and pyrite oxidation to the dissolved so4 2 showed insignificant spatial variations and clustered around 31 to 59 and 30 to 57 respectively in contrast the yinjiang river catchment showed large spatial variations in the proportion of so4 2 from precipitation 15 to 78 and pyrite oxidation 15 to 82 the fractions of precipitation derived so4 2 decreased but the fractions of pyrite derived so4 2 increased from the upstream to the downstream fig 5 c and table s1 a high proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation in the lower reaches of the yinjiang river is likely to be attributable to the widespread distribution of coal bearing strata and a coal mine in the catchment han and liu 2004 han et al 2010 5 2 controls on riverine δ34sso4 as discussed in section 5 1 precipitation and pyrite oxidation are the two main sources of so4 2 in these study catchments given the conservative transport of so4 2 burt et al 2021 and the negligible δ34s difference between the parent pyritic rock and the dissolved sulphate by product taylor et al 1984 the δ34s value of riverine so4 2 should depend on the δ34s values of precipitation and pyrite and the proportion of their contributions to the river burke et al 2018 kemeny et al 2021 the precipitation and pyrite oxidation make high contributions to riverine so4 2 the contributions of precipitation to the riverine so4 2 are spatially constant 69 µmol l to 249 µmol l table s1 because precipitation is uniform at the same sampling time in the study catchments with small drainage areas in contrast the fractions of pyrite derived so4 2 were low in the upper and middle reaches 15 to 42 but high in the lower reaches 77 of the yinjiang river fig 5a and b this can be attributed to variation in the lithology in the catchment from the upper to the lower reaches i e the mixture of carbonate and clastic rocks was distributed in the upper and middle reaches but carbonate rocks and coal bearing strata in the lower reaches fig 1 furthermore carbonate and sulfide minerals dissolve up to three orders of magnitude faster than silicates lasaga 1984 morse and arvidson 2002 so they frequently dominate weathering fluxes pyrite δ34s δ34sfes2 depends on the lithology in the catchments relph et al 2021 we attempted to constrain δ34sfes2 based on the inversion model for the sulfur isotopic composition in the river the mixing equation can be written as 5 δ 34 s river δ 34 s precipitation f s precipitation δ 34 s evaporite f s evaporite δ 34 s f e s 2 f s f e s 2 6 f s precipitation f s evaporite f s f e s 2 1 where fsprecipitation fsevaporite and fsfes2 are the proportion of so4 2 derived from precipitation evaporite and pyrite oxidation respectively δ34sriver δ34sprecipitation and δ34sevaporite correspond to the δ34s value of the river precipitation and evaporites here we used the weighted average δ34sso4 of precipitation in the karstic agricultural area of guizhou province 1 3 6 2 yan et al 2020 as δ34sprecipitation in this study area δ34sevaporite was taken from the values of marine evaporites in the wujiang river catchment 23 7 29 6 han and jin 1996 therefore based on the above mixing equations 5 and 6 each river sample thus constrained a distribution of possible δ34sfes2 note that these inversion constrained δ34sfes2 reflect the net δ34s of so4 2 delivered without conservative cations that is δ34sfes2 formally reflect the δ34s values of so4 2 sourced both from pyrite oxidation and or other potential sources such as organic sulfur oxidation rather than δ34s of fes2 mineral specifically the calculated results are presented in table s1 and fig 5c in the yinjiang river catchment the inversion constrained δ34sfes2 displayed a large variation from 4 2 to 11 6 samples in the upper reaches y3 y8 with a low pyrite derived proportion of so4 2 displayed high δ34sfes2 values 6 4 to 11 6 whereas samples in the lower reaches y13 y16 with a high pyrite derived proportion of so4 2 showed low δ34sfes2 0 7 to 1 1 table s1 and fig 5c thus low δ34sso4 in the lower reaches of the yinjiang river resulted from the higher contribution proportion of pyrite oxidation and lower δ34sfes2 than those in the upper reaches however samples in the shiqian river yuqing river and middle reaches of the yinjiang river with equivalent pyrite derived proportion of so4 2 differed significantly in δ34sso4 which is likely due to the varying δ34sfes2 fig 5d this is consistent with the distribution of complex and heterogeneous lithology carbonates clastic rocks metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks in the corresponding catchments fig 1 moreover for the yinjiang river catchment samples in the lower reaches y13 y16 also have similar proportions of pyrite derived so4 2 but different δ34sso4 y13 y16 0 3 to 1 6 from the headwater y1 8 4 this indicates the dominant control of δ34sfes2 on δ34sso4 which is supported by the distinct inversion constrained δ34sfes2 fig 5d from distinct lithology in the catchments y1 dolomite dissolution and y13 y16 calcite dissolution fig 3a and c in sum the variations of δ34sso4 values of river waters in the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river are controlled by both the proportional contribution of pyrite oxidation and δ34sfes2 in the catchments 5 3 effects of sulfuric acid weathering on atmospheric pco2 in the catchments the main sources of h2so4 in this study area are precipitation and pyrite oxidation as indicated by section 5 1 the h2so4 generated from pyrite oxidation can boost carbonate solubility and produce dic thus acting as a carbon source to atmospheric co2 bufe et al 2021 moreover the study catchments are located in the northeast of guizhou province southwest china where the so4 2 concentrations of precipitation are generally higher than that in other regions due to the large amount of coal combustion in local area yan et al 2020 h2so4 from precipitation can enhance carbonate weathering and thus influence atmospheric co2 therefore the effect of carbonate weathering driven by h2so4 on atmospheric pco2 in the catchments should be assessed weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals by h2so4 or h2co3 displays distinct influences on the fluxes of alk and dic following the method in torres et al 2016 and kemeny et al 2021 δalk δdic can be estimated to assess the effect of chemical weathering on atmospheric pco2 based on the dissolved cations from carbonate and silicate weathering and h2so4 from sulfide oxidation the calculation method of δalk δdic is described as follows we describe the chemical weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals as titration reactions eqs 7 to 10 where the source of h can be either h2co3 or h2so4 eq 10 α and β represent the production of alk through carbonate eqs 7 and 8 and silicate weathering respectively and γ is the consumption of alk through pyrite oxidation by reduction of o2 eq 9 the net reaction eq 10 indicates that δdic α 2 and δalk α β γ 7 α 2 c a c o 3 α h α 2 c a 2 α 2 h 2 c o 3 8 β 2 c a s i o 3 β h β 2 c a 2 β 2 s i o 2 β 2 h 2 o 9 γ 4 f e s 2 15 γ 16 o 2 γ 2 h

the corresponding cation from silicate and carbonate the parameter z is defined as the fraction of silicate and carbonate weathering reacted by h2so4 eq 11 the parameter r is defined as the ratio of carbonate weathering to total weathering eq 12 thus the net δalk δdic due to a weathering system can then be calculated as a simple function of r and z eq 13 alk dic in the modern marine is close to 1 zeebe and wolf gladrow 2001 when viewed instantaneously any flux with δalk δdic 1 will sequester co2 into the ocean while fluxes with δalk δdic 1 will release co2 to the atmosphere kemeny et al 2021 given the two timescales of marine so4 2 residence time srt 10 myr and carbonate compensation time cpt 5 10kyr and both alk and dic removal by carbonate mineral burial in a 2 1 ratio rennie et al 2018 torres et al 2014 fluxes with δalk δdic 1 can be divided into two cases 1 fluxes with 1 δalk δdic 2 mean a source of atmospheric co2 on the weathering timescale longer than the cpt but shorter than the srt and a sink of atmospheric co2 on the weathering timescale shorter than the cpt 2 fluxes with δalk δdic 2 represent a sink of atmospheric co2 on any weathering timescale torres et al 2016 lastly fluxes with δalk δdic 1 are a source of atmospheric co2 on a timescale shorter than the srt in this study area nearly all the samples had high r values 0 9 fig 6 b consistent with the massive distribution of carbonate rocks in the study catchments fig 1 and the higher dissolution rate of carbonates than silicates lasaga 1984 morse and arvidson 2002 when only considering the effect of the h2so4 driven weathering contributed by pyrite oxidation z1 values the fraction of acid from pyrite oxidation in the shiqian river and yuqing river show a narrow range between 0 04 and 0 11 while z1 values in the yinjiang river show a wide range between 0 02 and 0 38 furthermore we observe a strong positive correlation between proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation and z1 in the yinjiang river r2 0 72 fig 6d indicating that the spatial variation of z1 is induced by the proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation high z1 values in downstream samples y13 y16 are caused by the high proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation in this case downstream samples y13 y16 fall in the range of 1 δalk δdic 2 fig 6a implying co2 release on a long term timescale t 5 10kyr t 10 myr and co2 consumption on a short term timescale 5 10kyr whereas the majority of samples in the shiqian river and the yuqing river and samples in the upper and middle reaches of the yinjiang river fall near or on the line of δalk δdic 2 fig 6a indicating neither co2 release nor co2 consumption when considering the joint effect of h2so4 driven weathering from both pyrite oxidation and precipitation z2 values fraction of weathering acid from pyrite oxidation and precipitation of most water samples in shiqian river and yuqing river and the upper and middle reaches of the yinjiang are elevated above 0 1 compared to the case of ignoring the h2so4 driven weathering from precipitation z1 0 1 fig 6c it is worth noting that coal burning is the main contributor of sulfate in the precipitation in the karstic agricultural area of guizhou province yan et al 2020 therefore the sulfate in precipitation was taken as h2so4 during calculation of z2 values the results show all sample points to be within the range of 1 δalk δdic 2 suggesting co2 release on a long term timescale t 5 10kyr t 10 myr and co2 consumption on a short term timescale 5 10kyr in this study area this study highlights that carbonate weathering driven by h2so4 from both pyrite oxidation and precipitation counteracts co2 drawdown from silicate weathering over long term timescales t 5 10kyr t 10 myr in this study area 5 4 implication for earth s carbon cycle spatial samples in the yinjiang river display a positive correlation between the proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation so4 2 pyrite so4 2 ratio and z1 value r2 0 72 fig 6d this is attributed to the different lithological variation in the catchment and widespread coal bearing strata and a coal mine are likely causes for the high so4 2 pyrite so4 2 ratio and z1 value in the lower reaches of the yinjiang river han et al 2010 jiang et al 2007 based on the monte carlo inversion model we conduct a reanalysis of prior datasets of karst dominated catchments in china table s2 including the wujiang river han and liu 2004 han et al 2010 huang et al 2017 the yuanjiang river qingshuijiang wuyanghe han and liu 2004 han et al 2010 the lijiang river sanshu river shu river baishui river geji river pu et al 2013 and the zhujiang river nanpanjiang beipanjiang hongshuihe qianjiang river xunjiang river xijiang river liu and han 2020a and liujiang river liu et al 2020 these calculated results show a strong polynomial correlation between so4 2 pyrite so4 2 ratio and z1 value r2 0 8 fig 7 a most samples in the wujiang river have characteristics for a high so4 2 pyrite so4 2 ratio 60 to 91 and z1 value 0 1 to 0 45 fig 7a indicating substantial impact from pyrite oxidation sourced h2so4 on the weathering this is consistent with the reported widespread coal bearing strata and a coal mine in the wujiang river catchment han and liu 2004 han et al 2010 the zhujiang river the yuanjiang river and the lijiang river show a large range of so4 2 pyrite so4 2 but have low z1 values fig 7a suggesting the weak impact of pyrite oxidation derived h2so4 on weathering in karst dominated catchments without the distribution of coal bearing strata jiang et al 2018 reported that acid precipitation and sulfide oxidation derived h2so4 inducing carbonate weathering would exceed the co2 drawdown from silicate weathering making the karst dominated river catchments xijiang river liujiang river yujiang river zuojiang river youjiang river and qingshuihe in guangxi net co2 sources on geological timescales given the coal combustion and acid precipitation effect in the southwest of china yan et al 2020 h2so4 from atmospheric input on the weathering in these regions could have a significant effect on climate regulation we observe significant increase in the fraction of weathering driven by h2so4 z2 relative to z1 when considering the impact of acid precipitation derived h2so4 on weathering fig 7a thus making most of the sample points move from the area of δalk δdic 2 to the area of 1 δalk δdic 2 table s2 fig 8 such as the wujiang river the liujiang river and the xijiang river this indicates pyrite oxidation and acid precipitation derived h2so4 inducing carbonate weathering counteracts much of the alk flux from silicate weathering on the time scale between marine carbonate precipitation and sulfate reduction 5 10 kyr and 10 myr thus making net co2 sources in most karst dominated catchments over geological timescales this study highlights the influence of lithology as well as acid deposition on h2so4 weathering in karst dominated catchments and co2 budget although efforts have been made in recent years to improve knowledge about acid rain and related effects in china a great need still exists for better monitoring of the environmental situation in china to support policy development and follow up on sulfur emission reduction measures to avoid the climate effects from acid deposition 6 conclusions we investigated the spatial variation of δ34sso4 and water chemical compositions in mountainous river catchments the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river from southwest china carbonate i e calcite and dolomite weathering dominates the water chemistry which contributes 72 90 of the total cationic loads of the river waters the riverine so4 2 are mainly derived from sulfide oxidation and acid precipitation the yinjiang river displays a downstream increase in contributing proportion of sulfide oxidation to dissolved so4 2 from 15 to 82 and a decrease in δ34sso4 from 9 7 to 0 3 the downstream decrease of δ34sso4 is controlled by the increase of contributing proportion of pyrite oxidation and a decrease of δ34sfes2 in the catchments this high contributing proportion of sulfide oxidation in the lower reaches is due to the widespread distribution of coal bearing strata in these karst dominated catchments pyrite oxidation and acid precipitation derived h2so4 inducing carbonate weathering counteracts co2 drawdown from silicate weathering on the timescale between marine carbonate precipitation and sulfate reduction 5 10 kyr and 10 myr thus making this area act as net co2 sources over geological timescales the observation of high contribution of pyrite oxidation to riverine so4 2 and high z2 values in most karst dominated catchments of china supports the view that pyrite oxidation and acid precipitation derived h2so4 inducing weathering in the karst dominated region have a significant impact on climate regulation credit authorship contribution statement tingting ma formal analysis

2181,sulfide oxidation coupled with carbonate weathering is thought to be a source of co2 over geological timescales to offset co2 drawdown from silicate weathering its impact on the carbon budget of weathering at the catchment scale is generally constrained by utilizing riverine water chemistry and the isotope value δ34s of sulfate however the multiple origins of riverine sulfate and the high variability of sulfide derived δ34s certainly limit the determination of sulfate sources and thus our understanding of the role of sulfuric acid induced weathering in the carbon budget in this study to quantify the carbon budget between weathering by carbonic and sulfuric acids in mountainous catchments the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river in southwest china a monte carlo inversion model is employed for major element concentrations and sulfate δ34s δ34sso4 this inversion quantitatively partitions the cations and sulfate between different sources and further identifies the pyrite derived δ34s and the flux ratios of alkalinity to dissolved inorganic carbon δalk δdic inversion results reveal that the majority of major cations 90 is derived from carbonate calcite and dolomite dissolution and that riverine sulfate budget is predominately contributed by pyrite oxidation and precipitation in the yinjiang river the average δ34sso4 is 8 4 in the upper and middle reaches but declines significantly to 0 4 in the lower reaches in the shiqian river and yuqing river δ34sso4 mainly cluster around 3 6 5 7 and 5 5 8 5 respectively inversion results suggest that the primary controls on δ34sso4 are the variability of lithology and the variation in the proportional contribution of pyrite oxidation to riverine sulfate in the yinjiang river the fraction of h2so4 driven weathering is highly variable and higher in the lower reaches than in the upper reaches attributing to distinct underlying lithology in the catchment a widespread distribution of coal bearing strata the weathering fluxes with 1 δalk δdic 2 evidenced that the negative alkalinity flux from carbonate weathering driven by sulfuric acid from both pyrite oxidation and acid deposition counteracts much of the alkalinity flux from silicate weathering this is implicated on the timescale between marine carbonate precipitation and sulfate reduction 5 10 kyr and 10 myr indicating that weathering in these catchments acts as short term sinks of atmospheric co2 but long term sources of it moreover reanalysis of prior datasets of karst dominated catchments in china also highlight the important role of pyrite oxidation and acid precipitation in the carbon budget keywords chemical weathering sulfur isotope pyrite oxidation acid precipitation karst region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction silicate weathering by carbonic acid h2co3 consumes carbon dioxide co2 in the ocean atmosphere system and synchronously generates the cations and alkalinity alk necessary for the burial of carbonate minerals beaulieu et al 2012 ma et al 2020 raymo and ruddiman 1992 in contrast carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid h2so4 formed by sulfide oxidation generates dissolved inorganic carbon dic and releases co2 into the ocean atmosphere system calmels et al 2007 lerman et al 2007 torres et al 2014 which is thought to compensate for the co2 drawdown from silicate weathering calmels et al 2007 hilton and west 2020 li et al 2008 torres et al 2017 carbonate weathering coupled with sulfide oxidation regulates atmospheric pco2 a transient source of co2 in the atmosphere instead of co2 sequestration on timescales longer than carbonate precipitation but shorter than that of marine sulfate reduction 105 years while 107 years calmels et al 2007 lerman et al 2007 liu et al 2022b torres et al 2016 as an agent of weathering h2so4 can be produced both by the oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals mainly pyrite fes2 enriched in minerals eq 1 and or by acid deposition e g through the oxidation of atmospheric so2 emitted from coal combustion eq 2 1 fes 2 15 4 o 2 7 2 h 2 o fe oh 3 2 so 4 2 4 h 2 so 2 2 oh h 2 so 4 so 4 2 2 h carbonate weathering has traditionally been thought to have no implications for atmospheric co2 over timescales longer than the time of marine carbonate compensation 5 10 kyr archer et al 2000 berner et al 1983 zhong et al 2018 the alk and dic from carbonate weathering are consumed during marine carbonate burial 1 2 caco3 h 1 2 ca2 1 2 h2co3 this canonical weathering framework neglects sources of h other than dic yet the strong acids such as h2so4 naturally formed by sulfide oxidation can provide the h required to consume alk acid deposition can also provide h2so4 which may be formed as a result of coal combustion acid deposition derived h2so4 is therefore the result of anthropogenically driven oxidation of sulfide minerals and or organic sulfur impacting chemical weathering and carbon cycling in the anthropocene based on the above the effect of chemical weathering on atmospheric pco2 depends upon the balance between 1 alk generation by carbonate and silicate mineral dissolution and 2 h2so4 generation by the oxidation of sulfide minerals and acid deposition torres et al 2016 ascertaining the role of h2so4 weathering in the total chemical weathering budget of catchment is thus essential for quantifying the carbon budget of catchment weathering although karst landscapes occupy only 15 of the earth s land surface ford and williams 2007 carbonate weathering and sulfide oxidation in karst regions make a huge contribution of alk and sulfate export to the river systems and thus affect carbon cycle li et al 2008 this is mainly due to the three orders of magnitude in the dissolution rates of carbonate and sulfide minerals faster than silicate minerals morse and arvidson 2002 williamson and rimstidt 1994 moreover by increasing those acid emissions from human activities atmospheric deposition increases its influence on chemical weathering jiang et al 2018 lerman et al 2007 li et al 2008 liu et al 2016 prior research estimated that co2 consumption by weathering has decreased by approximately 13 on a global scale due to h2so4 deposition amiotte suchet et al 1995 liu et al 2016 given the wide distribution of coal containing strata southwestern china was once severely affected by sulfuric acid rain which is a product of high sulfur content coal combustion larssen et al 1999 therefore the regulation of naturally and anthropogenically driven sulfuric acid weathering on atmospheric pco2 in a karst dominated region cannot be ignored and thus need to be further evaluated riverine so4 2 is mainly sourced from pyrite oxidation sedimentary sulfate mineral dissolution e g gypsum caso4 2h2o and atmospheric and anthropogenic inputs burke et al 2018 calmels et al 2007 krouse and mayer 2000 of these sources pyrite oxidation and atmospheric deposition can provide h2so4 as the h donor for carbonate and silicate weathering hence quantifying riverine sulfate sources is prerequisite for understanding the natural silicate weathering climate feedback and predicting the impact of additional atmospheric sourced sulfuric acid most of previous studies distinguished sulfide derived sulfate and sedimentary derived sulfate by using sulfur isotopes δ34sso4 and hydrochemistry calmels et al 2007 li et al 2014 liu and han 2020b zhang et al 2020 sulfur isotopes provide a useful tracer for investigating sulfuric acid driven weathering because of the distinct sulfur isotope values found between sedimentary sulfate and sulfide minerals krouse and mayer 2000 torres et al 2016 and the minimal s isotope fractionation between the sulfur mineral sources and so4 2 balci et al 2007 claypool et al 1980 heidel and tichomirowa 2011 thode 1991 the δ34s of sedimentary sulfate such as gypsum range from 10 to 30 kampschulte and strauss 2004 claypool et al 1980 while the δ34s of pyrite and other sulfide bearing minerals vary from 50 to 10 relph et al 2021 the effect of sulfuric acid weathering on the global carbon cycle depends on the outcrop of lithology minerals in the weathering zone lithology controls the abundance of available sulfide minerals and thus the ability of those lithologies to generate sulfuric acid prior studies suggest that riverine δ34sso4 are mainly influenced by lithology kemeny et al 2021 liu et al 2022a although prior research e g jiang et al 2007 had investigated δ34sso4 in the wujiang river catchment large catchments have complex lithologies which result in greater uncertainty for deciphering the origin of riverine δ34sso4 variation in space in addition carbonate minerals are characterized by fast kinetics of dissolution kump et al 2000 and thus chemical weathering is more sensitive to climate changes in a karst region than in a non karst region gaillardet et al 1999 zhong et al 2020 therefore chemical weathering processes in karst regions needs to be investigated in addition prior works in the wujiang river catchment and other karst regions also lack an accurate quantification of the carbon budget between weathering by carbonic and sulfuric acids and a comprehensive assessment of sulfuric acid weathering considering the impact of atmospherically sourced h2so4 huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2007 lang et al 2011 li et al 2008 to assess the effects of sulfuric acid weathering on atmospheric pco2 we present the data of δ34sso4 and major ion concentrations of river water samples from mountainous catchments in southwest china the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river this study aims to 1 decipher the sources of dissolved loads 2 identify the controls of riverine δ34sso4 3 evaluate the effect of pyrite and precipitation derived h2so4 weathering on atmospheric pco2 in karst areas 2 geological setting the yinjiang river the yuqing river and the shiqian river draining the northeast of guizhou province china 27 n 29 n and 107 e 109 e are the main tributaries of the wujiang river fig 1 which is one of the largest tributaries of the changjiang yangtze river the yinjiang river drains an area of 1231 km2 with a mainstream length of about 96 km and covers an altitude difference from around 2024 m at its upper reaches to around 340 m at its lower reaches chen et al 2021 the shiqian river and the yuqing river are 114 and 111 km in length and have drainage areas of 2101 and 1561 km2 respectively the climate in these catchments is dominated by a monsoon system with most of the annual precipitation occurring between april and october the annual precipitation and air temperature range from 1119 to 1409 mm and from 14 c to 22 c respectively chen et al 2021 zhong et al 2020 the annual discharges are 14 4 15 6 and 10 0 m3 s for the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river respectively chen et al 2021 the exposed strata in these catchments are mainly pre jurassic strata carbonate rocks include permian and triassic limestone dolomitic limestone dolomites and low grade metamorphic rocks fig 1 additionally igneous rocks only account for a small fraction of the bedrock in the shiqian river catchment the bedrock of the yinjiang river catchment is mainly composed of carbonate rocks and clastic rocks such as shale sand shale and siltstone han and liu 2004 and a small proportion of igneous rocks and low grade metamorphic rocks e g slates and phyllites fig 1 lithological information was modified from pang et al 2017 karstification is well developed in this study area silicate minerals are widely distributed in the upper reaches while carbonate rocks are distributed in the lower reaches of the yinjiang river 3 sampling and analytical methods during the high flow season in september 2018 water samples were collected from the river surface of three catchments i e the yinjiang river shiqian river and yuqing river catchments the sampling locations are shown in fig 1 water temperature t ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ by a multi parameter water quality analyser wtw ph 3630 cond 3630 germany the alk was titrated with 0 02 mol l hydrochloric acid within 24 h of sampling surface water samples were filtered in the field through 0 45 µm millipore nitrocellulose membrane filters and then stored in pre washed low density polyethylene bottles at below 4 c for further analyses for cationic analysis samples were immediately acidified to ph 2 with thermally distilled hno3 and then stored major cations k na ca2 and mg2 and dissolved silica sio2 were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes vista mpx usa with an analytical precision better than 5 major anions so4 2 and cl were determined by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 90 usa with an uncertainty of 5 the data on major cation and anion concentrations of samples in this study were originally published in the study by chen et al 2021 to measure δ34sso4 the filtered samples were acidified using hcl and then the so4 2 was precipitated as baso4 by adding a bacl2 solution after the procedures of purifying and drying the precipitate the δ34sso4 was determined by an elemental analyzer ea coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms the δ34sso4 were reported relative to the vienna canyon diablo troilite v cdt with an accuracy better than 0 2 all of the experiments above were carried out in the school of earth system sciences tianjin university 4 results the major ion concentrations and δ34sso4 of the samples in this study are listed in table 1 the concentration of so4 2 in the yinjiang river varied over a wide range from 95 µmol l to 1167 µmol l which was considerably higher than that of the changjiang river 94 467 µmol l chetelat et al 2008 and the average value of world s large rivers 390 µmol l gaillardet et al 1999 in the yinjiang river catchment the concentration of so4 2 showed low values in the upper and middle reaches 95 352 µmol l and relatively higher values in the lower reaches 619 1167 µmol l fig 2 a the so4 2 concentration in the shiqian river and yuqing river had narrow ranges from 161 µmol l to 266 µmol l and from 234 µmol l to 296 µmol l respectively fig 2b and table 1 these values were comparable with that of the wujiang river 120 980 µmol l han and liu 2004 and the changjiang river 94 467 µmol l chetelat et al 2008 but slightly lower than that of the world s large rivers average at 390 µmol l gaillardet et al 1999 the δ34sso4 in the yinjiang river ranged from 0 3 to 9 7 table 1 the δ34sso4 in the shiqian river ranged from 0 6 to 5 8 and slightly decreased downstream fig 2b the yuqing river had a narrow δ34sso4 range from 5 5 to 8 5 table 1 overall the range of δ34sso4 was largely consistent with the prior values from the wujiang river 11 5 to 8 3 jiang et al 2007 in the yinjiang river catchment the δ34sso4 was negatively correlated with so4 2 concentration fig 2c r2 0 43 the non linear decrease in δ34sso4 was accompanied by increasing so4 2 concentration from the upper reaches to the lower reaches 5 discussion 5 1 sources of riverine major cations and sulfate identifying the sources of riverine dissolved loads is prerequisite for deducing the chemical weathering fluxes of the catchment and understanding the role of chemical weathering on in regulating atmospheric co2 atmospheric input carbonate weathering silicate weathering evaporite dissolution and anthropogenic input are the major potential sources of major ions in river water in the study catchments chetelat et al 2008 fan et al 2014 millot et al 2003 moon et al 2007 xiao et al 2022 the concentrations of major cations and anions of samples in this study were expressed as the ratio of one cation concentration to the total cation concentration ʃ 2ca2 2 mg2 na k in units of charge equivalents the high ca2 σ and low na σ ratios indicate that the majority of positive charge in the solution derives from precipitation and or carbonate weathering fig 3 a the concentration of cl varied between 29 µmol l and 150 µmol l slightly higher than that in local precipitation 0 6 µmol l to 54 5 µmol l wu et al 2011 yan et al 2019 given the limitation of the relative abundance of cl the contribution of precipitation to the dissolved cation budgets is low fig 3b suggesting that the majority of cation charge is derived from calcite and or dolomite weathering there is no geological record of evaporite strata exposed in the study catchment thus the contribution of evaporite dissolution to riverine dissolved cation charge is thought to be negligible han and liu 2004 after precipitation correction the remaining cl in river water can be considered to be entirely derived from an evaporite source a forward model method was previously used by chen et al 2021 to constrain the sources of cations and the results showed that the contributions of anthropogenic input to dissolved total cation charge are extremely low 1 4 to 7 8 indicating that the anthropogenic contribution in this study is negligible the so4 2 concentration in the water sample 95 μmol l to 1167 μmol l was higher than that in local precipitation 6 4 µmol l to 542 5 µmol l yan et al 2019 indicating that oxidative weathering of pyrite may be another source of riverine so4 2 in addition to precipitation fig s1a shows that the water samples lie far from the line of 2 ca2 mg2 hco3 1 1 and the charges of ca2 and mg2 are balanced with those of hco3 and so4 2 fig s1b chen et al 2021 these observations suggest that atmospheric input acid deposition and oxidative weathering of pyrite are important potential sources of riverine so4 2 burke et al 2018 calmels et al 2007 jiang et al 2018 kemeny et al 2021 torres et al 2016 following the method proposed by kemeny et al 2021 and kemeny and torres 2021 we used a monte carlo inversion model to estimate the sources of major cations and sulfate ca2 mg2 na k and so4 2 precipitation evaporite silicate and two carbonate end members i e calcite and dolomite were considered in the inversion see end members in table 2 on a given iteration the ca2 ʃ na ʃ k ʃ and cl ʃ of each end member were pulled randomly from normal distributions with end member specific means and standard deviations and then the ratios of mg2 ʃ for each end member were calculated to ensure mass balance based on the other cation ratios table 2 for each of the ions x of interest ca2 mg2 na k cl and so4 2 we can write a set of mass balance equations 3 x σ river x σ precipitation f precipitation x σ evaporite f evaporite x σ silicate f silicate x σ calcite f calcite x σ dolomite f dolomite 4 f precipitation f evaporite f silicate f calcite f dolomite 1 where f precipitation f evaporite f silicate f calcite and f dolomite are the proportion of dissolved ions x derived from precipitation evaporite silicate calcite and dolomite respectively pyrite oxidation evaporite dissolution and precipitation inputs are three potential sources for so4 2 in the study catchments following the studies by torres et al 2016 and kemeny et al 2021 we took the so4 2 ʃ ratio of the non precipitation and non evaporite end members to reflect the weathering driven by h2so4 from pyrite oxidation we then calculated the proportion of so4 2 sourced from the calcite dolomite and silicate end members which we took as the proportion sourced from pyrite oxidation on a given iteration the ca2 mg2 na k cl and so4 2 were altered by values pulled randomly from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation corresponding to analytical precision the matlab function fmincon was used to solve the resulting set of end member chemistry and river observations the optimization cost function was the sum of squared proportional offsets between observations and the model estimate constrained to deliver positive solutions and used as an initial condition from standard least squares inversion simulation results were only accepted when all variables were not 15 discrepant from observations in all accepted inversion instances the sum of fractional contributions from end members was between 85 and 115 of each observation we attempted 100 000 simulations for each sample which were successfully inverted 1000 times we used the median of accepted simulation results and took the 25th and 75th percentiles of accepted simulation results as the inversion error fig 4 and table s1 show the calculated proportions of major cations and sulfate from different end members using the monte carlo inversion model the result shows that 1 the majority of ca2 in rivers 72 to 90 were from calcite and dolomite and mg2 from dolomite consistent with the result of forward model estimation by chen et al 2021 2 the proportional contribution of precipitation and pyrite oxidation to riverine so4 2 was between 82 and 100 consistent with the results of the wujiang river and its tributaries in the previous study which found that approximately 95 of so4 2 was derived from pyrite oxidation and precipitation jiang et al 2007 in detail in the shiqian river and yuqing river catchments contributions of precipitation and pyrite oxidation to the dissolved so4 2 showed insignificant spatial variations and clustered around 31 to 59 and 30 to 57 respectively in contrast the yinjiang river catchment showed large spatial variations in the proportion of so4 2 from precipitation 15 to 78 and pyrite oxidation 15 to 82 the fractions of precipitation derived so4 2 decreased but the fractions of pyrite derived so4 2 increased from the upstream to the downstream fig 5 c and table s1 a high proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation in the lower reaches of the yinjiang river is likely to be attributable to the widespread distribution of coal bearing strata and a coal mine in the catchment han and liu 2004 han et al 2010 5 2 controls on riverine δ34sso4 as discussed in section 5 1 precipitation and pyrite oxidation are the two main sources of so4 2 in these study catchments given the conservative transport of so4 2 burt et al 2021 and the negligible δ34s difference between the parent pyritic rock and the dissolved sulphate by product taylor et al 1984 the δ34s value of riverine so4 2 should depend on the δ34s values of precipitation and pyrite and the proportion of their contributions to the river burke et al 2018 kemeny et al 2021 the precipitation and pyrite oxidation make high contributions to riverine so4 2 the contributions of precipitation to the riverine so4 2 are spatially constant 69 µmol l to 249 µmol l table s1 because precipitation is uniform at the same sampling time in the study catchments with small drainage areas in contrast the fractions of pyrite derived so4 2 were low in the upper and middle reaches 15 to 42 but high in the lower reaches 77 of the yinjiang river fig 5a and b this can be attributed to variation in the lithology in the catchment from the upper to the lower reaches i e the mixture of carbonate and clastic rocks was distributed in the upper and middle reaches but carbonate rocks and coal bearing strata in the lower reaches fig 1 furthermore carbonate and sulfide minerals dissolve up to three orders of magnitude faster than silicates lasaga 1984 morse and arvidson 2002 so they frequently dominate weathering fluxes pyrite δ34s δ34sfes2 depends on the lithology in the catchments relph et al 2021 we attempted to constrain δ34sfes2 based on the inversion model for the sulfur isotopic composition in the river the mixing equation can be written as 5 δ 34 s river δ 34 s precipitation f s precipitation δ 34 s evaporite f s evaporite δ 34 s f e s 2 f s f e s 2 6 f s precipitation f s evaporite f s f e s 2 1 where fsprecipitation fsevaporite and fsfes2 are the proportion of so4 2 derived from precipitation evaporite and pyrite oxidation respectively δ34sriver δ34sprecipitation and δ34sevaporite correspond to the δ34s value of the river precipitation and evaporites here we used the weighted average δ34sso4 of precipitation in the karstic agricultural area of guizhou province 1 3 6 2 yan et al 2020 as δ34sprecipitation in this study area δ34sevaporite was taken from the values of marine evaporites in the wujiang river catchment 23 7 29 6 han and jin 1996 therefore based on the above mixing equations 5 and 6 each river sample thus constrained a distribution of possible δ34sfes2 note that these inversion constrained δ34sfes2 reflect the net δ34s of so4 2 delivered without conservative cations that is δ34sfes2 formally reflect the δ34s values of so4 2 sourced both from pyrite oxidation and or other potential sources such as organic sulfur oxidation rather than δ34s of fes2 mineral specifically the calculated results are presented in table s1 and fig 5c in the yinjiang river catchment the inversion constrained δ34sfes2 displayed a large variation from 4 2 to 11 6 samples in the upper reaches y3 y8 with a low pyrite derived proportion of so4 2 displayed high δ34sfes2 values 6 4 to 11 6 whereas samples in the lower reaches y13 y16 with a high pyrite derived proportion of so4 2 showed low δ34sfes2 0 7 to 1 1 table s1 and fig 5c thus low δ34sso4 in the lower reaches of the yinjiang river resulted from the higher contribution proportion of pyrite oxidation and lower δ34sfes2 than those in the upper reaches however samples in the shiqian river yuqing river and middle reaches of the yinjiang river with equivalent pyrite derived proportion of so4 2 differed significantly in δ34sso4 which is likely due to the varying δ34sfes2 fig 5d this is consistent with the distribution of complex and heterogeneous lithology carbonates clastic rocks metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks in the corresponding catchments fig 1 moreover for the yinjiang river catchment samples in the lower reaches y13 y16 also have similar proportions of pyrite derived so4 2 but different δ34sso4 y13 y16 0 3 to 1 6 from the headwater y1 8 4 this indicates the dominant control of δ34sfes2 on δ34sso4 which is supported by the distinct inversion constrained δ34sfes2 fig 5d from distinct lithology in the catchments y1 dolomite dissolution and y13 y16 calcite dissolution fig 3a and c in sum the variations of δ34sso4 values of river waters in the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river are controlled by both the proportional contribution of pyrite oxidation and δ34sfes2 in the catchments 5 3 effects of sulfuric acid weathering on atmospheric pco2 in the catchments the main sources of h2so4 in this study area are precipitation and pyrite oxidation as indicated by section 5 1 the h2so4 generated from pyrite oxidation can boost carbonate solubility and produce dic thus acting as a carbon source to atmospheric co2 bufe et al 2021 moreover the study catchments are located in the northeast of guizhou province southwest china where the so4 2 concentrations of precipitation are generally higher than that in other regions due to the large amount of coal combustion in local area yan et al 2020 h2so4 from precipitation can enhance carbonate weathering and thus influence atmospheric co2 therefore the effect of carbonate weathering driven by h2so4 on atmospheric pco2 in the catchments should be assessed weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals by h2so4 or h2co3 displays distinct influences on the fluxes of alk and dic following the method in torres et al 2016 and kemeny et al 2021 δalk δdic can be estimated to assess the effect of chemical weathering on atmospheric pco2 based on the dissolved cations from carbonate and silicate weathering and h2so4 from sulfide oxidation the calculation method of δalk δdic is described as follows we describe the chemical weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals as titration reactions eqs 7 to 10 where the source of h can be either h2co3 or h2so4 eq 10 α and β represent the production of alk through carbonate eqs 7 and 8 and silicate weathering respectively and γ is the consumption of alk through pyrite oxidation by reduction of o2 eq 9 the net reaction eq 10 indicates that δdic α 2 and δalk α β γ 7 α 2 c a c o 3 α h α 2 c a 2 α 2 h 2 c o 3 8 β 2 c a s i o 3 β h β 2 c a 2 β 2 s i o 2 β 2 h 2 o 9 γ 4 f e s 2 15 γ 16 o 2 γ 2 h

the corresponding cation from silicate and carbonate the parameter z is defined as the fraction of silicate and carbonate weathering reacted by h2so4 eq 11 the parameter r is defined as the ratio of carbonate weathering to total weathering eq 12 thus the net δalk δdic due to a weathering system can then be calculated as a simple function of r and z eq 13 alk dic in the modern marine is close to 1 zeebe and wolf gladrow 2001 when viewed instantaneously any flux with δalk δdic 1 will sequester co2 into the ocean while fluxes with δalk δdic 1 will release co2 to the atmosphere kemeny et al 2021 given the two timescales of marine so4 2 residence time srt 10 myr and carbonate compensation time cpt 5 10kyr and both alk and dic removal by carbonate mineral burial in a 2 1 ratio rennie et al 2018 torres et al 2014 fluxes with δalk δdic 1 can be divided into two cases 1 fluxes with 1 δalk δdic 2 mean a source of atmospheric co2 on the weathering timescale longer than the cpt but shorter than the srt and a sink of atmospheric co2 on the weathering timescale shorter than the cpt 2 fluxes with δalk δdic 2 represent a sink of atmospheric co2 on any weathering timescale torres et al 2016 lastly fluxes with δalk δdic 1 are a source of atmospheric co2 on a timescale shorter than the srt in this study area nearly all the samples had high r values 0 9 fig 6 b consistent with the massive distribution of carbonate rocks in the study catchments fig 1 and the higher dissolution rate of carbonates than silicates lasaga 1984 morse and arvidson 2002 when only considering the effect of the h2so4 driven weathering contributed by pyrite oxidation z1 values the fraction of acid from pyrite oxidation in the shiqian river and yuqing river show a narrow range between 0 04 and 0 11 while z1 values in the yinjiang river show a wide range between 0 02 and 0 38 furthermore we observe a strong positive correlation between proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation and z1 in the yinjiang river r2 0 72 fig 6d indicating that the spatial variation of z1 is induced by the proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation high z1 values in downstream samples y13 y16 are caused by the high proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation in this case downstream samples y13 y16 fall in the range of 1 δalk δdic 2 fig 6a implying co2 release on a long term timescale t 5 10kyr t 10 myr and co2 consumption on a short term timescale 5 10kyr whereas the majority of samples in the shiqian river and the yuqing river and samples in the upper and middle reaches of the yinjiang river fall near or on the line of δalk δdic 2 fig 6a indicating neither co2 release nor co2 consumption when considering the joint effect of h2so4 driven weathering from both pyrite oxidation and precipitation z2 values fraction of weathering acid from pyrite oxidation and precipitation of most water samples in shiqian river and yuqing river and the upper and middle reaches of the yinjiang are elevated above 0 1 compared to the case of ignoring the h2so4 driven weathering from precipitation z1 0 1 fig 6c it is worth noting that coal burning is the main contributor of sulfate in the precipitation in the karstic agricultural area of guizhou province yan et al 2020 therefore the sulfate in precipitation was taken as h2so4 during calculation of z2 values the results show all sample points to be within the range of 1 δalk δdic 2 suggesting co2 release on a long term timescale t 5 10kyr t 10 myr and co2 consumption on a short term timescale 5 10kyr in this study area this study highlights that carbonate weathering driven by h2so4 from both pyrite oxidation and precipitation counteracts co2 drawdown from silicate weathering over long term timescales t 5 10kyr t 10 myr in this study area 5 4 implication for earth s carbon cycle spatial samples in the yinjiang river display a positive correlation between the proportion of so4 2 from pyrite oxidation so4 2 pyrite so4 2 ratio and z1 value r2 0 72 fig 6d this is attributed to the different lithological variation in the catchment and widespread coal bearing strata and a coal mine are likely causes for the high so4 2 pyrite so4 2 ratio and z1 value in the lower reaches of the yinjiang river han et al 2010 jiang et al 2007 based on the monte carlo inversion model we conduct a reanalysis of prior datasets of karst dominated catchments in china table s2 including the wujiang river han and liu 2004 han et al 2010 huang et al 2017 the yuanjiang river qingshuijiang wuyanghe han and liu 2004 han et al 2010 the lijiang river sanshu river shu river baishui river geji river pu et al 2013 and the zhujiang river nanpanjiang beipanjiang hongshuihe qianjiang river xunjiang river xijiang river liu and han 2020a and liujiang river liu et al 2020 these calculated results show a strong polynomial correlation between so4 2 pyrite so4 2 ratio and z1 value r2 0 8 fig 7 a most samples in the wujiang river have characteristics for a high so4 2 pyrite so4 2 ratio 60 to 91 and z1 value 0 1 to 0 45 fig 7a indicating substantial impact from pyrite oxidation sourced h2so4 on the weathering this is consistent with the reported widespread coal bearing strata and a coal mine in the wujiang river catchment han and liu 2004 han et al 2010 the zhujiang river the yuanjiang river and the lijiang river show a large range of so4 2 pyrite so4 2 but have low z1 values fig 7a suggesting the weak impact of pyrite oxidation derived h2so4 on weathering in karst dominated catchments without the distribution of coal bearing strata jiang et al 2018 reported that acid precipitation and sulfide oxidation derived h2so4 inducing carbonate weathering would exceed the co2 drawdown from silicate weathering making the karst dominated river catchments xijiang river liujiang river yujiang river zuojiang river youjiang river and qingshuihe in guangxi net co2 sources on geological timescales given the coal combustion and acid precipitation effect in the southwest of china yan et al 2020 h2so4 from atmospheric input on the weathering in these regions could have a significant effect on climate regulation we observe significant increase in the fraction of weathering driven by h2so4 z2 relative to z1 when considering the impact of acid precipitation derived h2so4 on weathering fig 7a thus making most of the sample points move from the area of δalk δdic 2 to the area of 1 δalk δdic 2 table s2 fig 8 such as the wujiang river the liujiang river and the xijiang river this indicates pyrite oxidation and acid precipitation derived h2so4 inducing carbonate weathering counteracts much of the alk flux from silicate weathering on the time scale between marine carbonate precipitation and sulfate reduction 5 10 kyr and 10 myr thus making net co2 sources in most karst dominated catchments over geological timescales this study highlights the influence of lithology as well as acid deposition on h2so4 weathering in karst dominated catchments and co2 budget although efforts have been made in recent years to improve knowledge about acid rain and related effects in china a great need still exists for better monitoring of the environmental situation in china to support policy development and follow up on sulfur emission reduction measures to avoid the climate effects from acid deposition 6 conclusions we investigated the spatial variation of δ34sso4 and water chemical compositions in mountainous river catchments the yinjiang river the shiqian river and the yuqing river from southwest china carbonate i e calcite and dolomite weathering dominates the water chemistry which contributes 72 90 of the total cationic loads of the river waters the riverine so4 2 are mainly derived from sulfide oxidation and acid precipitation the yinjiang river displays a downstream increase in contributing proportion of sulfide oxidation to dissolved so4 2 from 15 to 82 and a decrease in δ34sso4 from 9 7 to 0 3 the downstream decrease of δ34sso4 is controlled by the increase of contributing proportion of pyrite oxidation and a decrease of δ34sfes2 in the catchments this high contributing proportion of sulfide oxidation in the lower reaches is due to the widespread distribution of coal bearing strata in these karst dominated catchments pyrite oxidation and acid precipitation derived h2so4 inducing carbonate weathering counteracts co2 drawdown from silicate weathering on the timescale between marine carbonate precipitation and sulfate reduction 5 10 kyr and 10 myr thus making this area act as net co2 sources over geological timescales the observation of high contribution of pyrite oxidation to riverine so4 2 and high z2 values in most karst dominated catchments of china supports the view that pyrite oxidation and acid precipitation derived h2so4 inducing weathering in the karst dominated region have a significant impact on climate regulation credit authorship contribution statement tingting ma formal analysis

2182,accelerated degradation of aquatic ecosystems caused by excessive nitrogen input has focused more attention on denitrification which can permanently convert reactive nitrogen n into dinitrogen n2 while denitrification has been extensively studied information is limited concerning the specifics of its changing nature on a daily scale this article presents our development of a simple model to quantify hourly denitrification at the reach scale which was applied to a flow through river wetland in southeast china by measuring the concentration of dissolved n2 at the inlet and outlet of the wetland and accounting for the air water physical exchange the model can obtain a complete picture of the diel variability during denitrification our results showed that denitrification rates varied significantly and exhibited obvious day and night differences the mean denitrification rate during the night reached 12 34 mmol m 2h 1 which was three times greater than the daytime rate changes in dissolved oxygen and redox conditions were found to be responsible for the observed denitrification dynamics of the wetland the apparent diel pattern of denitrification as exhibited in the riverine wetland provides a strong rationale for further recognition of denitrification s instant responses to changes in various environmental factors future efforts should also consider taking advantage of the whole system method as proposed here and conducting more in situ measurements with wider spatio temporal coverages to better elucidate time immediate denitrification processes and also to facilitate effective management strategies keywords wetlands nitrogen pollution denitrification environmental factors nitrogen removal membrane inlet mass spectrometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive n loading to surface water as a result of intensified human activities is an issue of increasing global concern because it can accelerate the growth of microbes that can deplete oxygen destroy aquatic ecosystems and result in eutrophication and hypoxia galloway et al 2002 stevens 2019 swaney et al 2012 denitrification counterbalances this problem by converting reactive nitrogen e g nitrate to dinitrogen n2 an inert gas not available for the majority of living organisms loeks johnson and cotner 2020 denitrification is thus thought to be the main mechanism of permanent n removal cheng et al 2020 ward 2013 therefore discerning the process of denitrification has both scientific and management significance loeks johnson and cotner 2020 nizzoli et al 2017 since it not only advances our knowledge of the complex n cycle in aquatic systems but also facilitates effective management strategies denitrification requires reducing conditions it is temperature dependent herrman et al 2008 zheng et al 2016 and sensitive to ph and do baeseman et al 2006 denitrification is also limited by the availability of organic carbon ashby et al 1998 eyre and ferguson 2009 and no3 böhlke et al 2009 mulholland et al 2008 these traits increase the complexity of assessing denitrification effects on streams and rivers since they are typically variable systems that can be characterized by significant fluctuations in temperature flow nutrient supplies do ph and other environmental conditions peterson et al 2001 wollheim et al 2006 which can sometimes change on an hourly scale greiwe et al 2021 nimick et al 2011 they are also often interrupted by natural or artificial wetlands which are hotspots in need of n removal cheng et al 2020 and are known to further alter riverine environmental conditions fisher and acreman 2004 pueppke et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 thus denitrification would be expected to tightly respond to these variable features herrman et al 2008 and may show strong temporal variations previous studies have well documented temporal variabilities of denitrification in various systems but mostly on seasonal and monthly scales martinez espinosa et al 2021 piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 research to date however has not specifically determined the hourly variations of denitrification in rivers particularly for those with wetlands denitrification is a difficult process to quantify groffman et al 2006 in principle direct measurement of denitrification is preferentially done by determining the main end product n2 in the water column but this is challenging due to the high background concentration of the gas kana et al 1998 more common approaches for quantifying denitrification such as acetylene inhibition application of isotope pairing technique and mass balance analysis either suffer from artificial conditions or are prohibitive both in terms of time and cost groffman et al 2006 reisinger et al 2016 the acetylene block technique for example changes the substrate concentrations disturbs the physical or chemical conditions zhou et al 2018 and most critically tends to underestimate denitrification because acetylene inhibits nitrification and does not completely block the reduction of n2o to n2 mccutchan et al 2003 the isotope pairing technique which traces 15n no3 to n2 böhlke et al 2004 nielsen 1992 is well suited to the requirement for high precision measurements of denitrification but its applications have been limited for in situ measurements due to the high cost of isotopes in most cases these two techniques were only applied to closed incubation systems e g sediment cores and chambers groffman et al 2006 kana et al 2006 which is challenging to expand to a river reach or different ecosystem levels laursen and seitzinger 2002 the mass balance analysis is usually applied in reach or ecosystem levels but it is a typical black box approach that usually ignores the internal processes in lake and river systems pribyl et al 2005 this method is considered to have insufficient sensitivity or offsetting sources and sinks and is also subject to large errors böhlke et al 2004 when considered as a whole although these traditional approaches are used widely they are also subject to obvious limitations and more importantly they are not suitable to determine denitrification rates on a finer temporal scale and under in situ conditions the emergence of the membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims technique makes it possible to directly measure n2 concentrations kana et al 1994 because the method is simple rapid and highly accurate it has gained widespread use in studying denitrification in various systems including rivers ritz et al 2017 xia et al 2018 yan et al 2004 groundwater popp et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 and estuaries kana et al 2006 wu et al 2013 mims also enabled us to reveal in situ denitrification with much finer temporal resolutions this type of detail not only closes the knowledge gaps left by instant responses to denitrification based on the dynamics of environmental conditions but mims also puts forward a more credible assessment of the denitrification potential in systems of interest the purpose of this study is to describe an integrated whole system model to quantify denitrification in a flow through system the model described here depends on the measurement of dissolved n2 concentrations by mims and was applied to a flow through riverine which was located at the midstream of a headwater river in southeast china to reveal the diel pattern of denitrification we continuously measured dissolved n2 concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the wetland for 24 h following the lagrangian sampling scheme in addition to examining the usefulness of the whole system model in portraying denitrification dynamics our tentative use of the model was also sought to i unravel diel variability of denitrification in the riverine wetland and ii ascertain which environmental factors are more important in governing such variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our research area is located at the zhongtian catchment fig 1 which lies within the headwater regions of taihu lake the third largest lake in china in the middle to lower mainstem of the zhongtian river there is a total area of 1 5 km2 cascade wetlands which can be characterized by mudflats open water and marshes with dominant emergent vegetation zhang et al 2020 the cascade wetlands were constructed in 2009 as an important means to buffer nutrient pollution from agricultural hillslopes mostly tea plantations before discharging into tianmu lake which serves as an important drinking source zhang et al 2020 ten years of monthly based water quality monitoring along the zhongtian river indicates that the presence of the cascade wetlands has greatly enhanced in stream n removal zhang et al 2019 as a primary permanent pathway of n removal from water bodies however hourly dynamics of denitrification in the wetlands have not been investigated in this study we selected one exemplary section of these cascade wetlands in the zhongtian river as our research area see fig 1c the monitored wetland reach covers a surface area of 1 5 ha with a length of 430 m the mean depth is 0 6 m based on averaged multi site measurements on the wetland reach 2 2 field sampling all samples for dissolved gas analyses were collected according to the two station approach based on a lagrangian sampling scheme laursen and seitzinger 2002 namely we collected a sample at the wetland s inlet and collected another water sample at the outlet when the same parcel of water arrived thus we compare the n2 changes in the same water parcel as it travels in the wetland and quantify the reach scale denitrification rate using the model as described in section 2 4 the measured in situ flow velocity was used to determine the time of the water parcel traveling from the wetland s inlet to the outlet the lagrangian samplings were continuously done 24 times during the studied period with evenly hourly intervals which enabled us to obtain complete samples for diel estimates to reduce the climatic and hydrological disturbances we chose july 30 31 2018 as our monitoring period which was characterized by a sunny breezy and stable streamflow and water level during this period the mean flow speed was stable at 0 08 m s 1 suggesting that the water parcel moving 430 m from the inlet to the outlet site in 1 5 h at the inlet sampling began at 20 00 8 00p m china standard time cst on july 30 2018 and was completed at 19 00 7 00p m cst on july 31 2018 with an hourly interval the samples at the outlet were obtained in a similar manner but were started at 21 30 9 30p m cst july 30 2018 and terminated at 20 30 8 30p m cst july 31 2018 with a 1 5 h residence time for the water parcel in the wetland in total 24 lagrangian sampling campaigns were conducted wherein gauges were embedded in fluid parcels to get current and flow data all samples for gas analysis were collected at the thalweg below the water surface 20 cm using niskin bottles and carefully avoiding the creation of bubbles samples were then transferred into 12 ml labco exetainer vials with rubber septa labco ltd lampeter uk several volumes were allowed to overflow thereby minimizing the exchange of gases with the atmosphere samples were preserved by pipetting a small volume of saturated zncl2 solution into each vial to stop microbial metabolism which was sealed immediately with a rubber septum with no headspace or bubble three repeated samples were collected then the samples were stored underwater at 4 c during the transportation and analyzed within 7 days to evaluate whether the water in the river sections studied was well mixed we also took two additional cross sectional water samples from areas like the left and right banks of the river in addition to their thalweg our measurements suggested that the monitored wetland samples were well mixed without statistically significant differences in gas concentrations among the sampling locations p 0 05 therefore the data obtained from the thalweg was used for the following analysis for water quality measurements 600 ml water samples were simultaneously collected for each of the sampling events for gas analysis in situ physical chemical indicators such as water temperature barometric pressure dissolved oxygen do specific conductance spc and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured at the time of sampling with a ysi 6000 multiprobe field meter yellow springs instruments ysi yellow springs ohio usa water depth flow speed and flow rates were derived from the hydrological gauge which was located at the outlet of the wetland we also adopted a ysi flowtracker2 to measure water depth and flow speed at multiple points on the sampling transects of the wetland s inlet for each of the sampling visits these measurements further confirmed that flow speed and water level were stable during the monitoring period the water depth and flow speed averaged from the two stations were used for the following analysis all of the measured data can be found in the spreadsheet of supporting information 2 3 analytical techniques in the laboratory dissolved gas concentrations were determined using a high precision mims instrument bay instruments easton md usa following the procedure described by kana et al 1994 and zhou et al 2018 this instrument consists of a membrane sampling system and a pfeiffer vacuum prismaplus quadrupole mass spectrometer the membrane sampling system can extract the dissolved gases under a high vacuum 10 6 mm hg when samples are pumped through a gas permeable silicon membrane the instrument was fitted with a liquid n2 trap and furnace accessory to minimize interference of co2 o2 and other dissolved gases with n2 measurements dissolved gas concentrations were calibrated with standard water deionized water which was prepared 24 h before the measurements to ensure that the water was fully equilibrated with air replicate samples had a lower standard deviation among dinitrogen argon n2 ar measurements 0 03 than among dinitrogen n2 measurements 0 10 kana et al 1994 dissolved n2 concentrations in the water samples were thus determined conservatively by multiplying the n2 ar concentration ratios by the expected ar concentrations more details about n2 measurements and the data calibration can be found in kana et al 1994 the water quality indicators such as total dissolved nitrogen tdn nitrate no3 n ammonium ammonia nh4 n total organic carbon toc and total phosphorus tp were analyzed following the standard protocols released by the ministry of ecology and environment of china mep 2002 2 4 a model for estimating hourly denitrification rate in open channel systems denitrification can increase n2 enrichment in the water column whereas such enrichment in turn promotes n2 loss from water through re equilibration with the atmosphere in this sense the change of n2 in water through time can be expressed as a function of atmospheric exchange and denitrification production laursen and seitzinger 2002 we proposed a numerical model framework to estimate whole system denitrification in a way much similar to the two station approach proposed by laursen and seitzinger 2002 the model is based on a mass balance analysis of dissolved n2 in the water column which not only can rule out the interference of longitudinal transports of dissolved n2 from upstream but also can quantify the vertical air water n2 exchanges as influenced by time varying environmental conditions by defining a water parcel an arbitrary volume that was passing through a river reach see fig 2 the mass of n2 in the water parcel m i at any time point ti can be expressed as 1 m i m i 1 p a δ t f i a δ t where mi 1 refers to total dissolved n2 mass in the water parcel for the time point ti 1 the term p a δ t denotes n2 mass derived from denitrification at time point ti and f i a δ t is the mass of n2 lost to the air p is the integrated whole system averaged denitrification rate fi is the rate of air water exchange in the water parcel at time point t i a is the surface area of the water parcel and δ t is the time interval between ti and ti 1 to simplify the model we assume that the channel morphology i e river width and depth was uniform along the watercourse under steady state conditions the volume of the water parcel was unchanged during its transportation thus dividing by the volume of the water parcel causes eq 1 to become 2 c i c i 1 p d δ t f i d δ t where ci and ci 1 refer to dissolved n2 concentrations expressed in mmol m 3 in the same water parcel at time point ti and ti 1 respectively p d δ t denotes the concentration contributions from denitrification which are calculated using the mean denitrification rate p expressed in mmol m 2h 1 the mean depth of the water parcel d m and the corresponding reaction time δ t h finally f i d δ t denotes n2 concentration loss due to air water exchange the rates of water air exchange f i mmol m 2h 1 at the time point ti can be characterized by the widely used air water exchange model as presented wanninkhof 1992 3 f i 1 24 k i c c eq i where k i m d 1 is the first order gas transfer coefficient at the time point ti the term c c eq i denotes the concentration difference of n2 between the water column c and the atmospheric equilibrium concentration c eq i the constant value 1 24 is used to convert units from mmol m 2 d 1 to mmol m 2h 1 here c refers to the total concentration of n2 that is subject to air water exchange which is identical to c i 1 plus the n2 concentrations contributed by denitrification i e p d δ t the c eq i refers to equilibrium concentrations of n2 which can be computed using in situ water temperature and pressure at the time point t i according to the solubility equation weiss 1970 the first order gas transfer coefficient of n2 k i determines how rapidly dissolved n2 in the water parcel will re equilibrate with the atmosphere when the concentration is out of equilibrium laursen and seitzinger 2005 a common approach when reporting k i values is to normalize ki to a piston velocity k600 with a schmidt number of 600 which can be expressed as 4 k i s c n 2 i 600 1 2 k 600 where sc n 2 i is the schmidt number of n2 at the in situ temperature of time point ti which can be computed according to wanninkhof 1992 k600 m d 1 is the piston velocity of a gas with a schmidt number of 600 the equation for k600 calculation is termed ray01 which is calculated as 5 r a y 01 k 6 00 5037 u s 0 89 d 0 54 where u s and d refer to the river speed m s 1 slope unitless and water depth m respectively raymond et al 2012 ray01 was chosen because it has been widely documented as one of the most accurate methods and is particularly suitable for low order rivers whitmore et al 2021 such as the zhongtian river as presented here notably there are other empirical equations for predicting the k600 as exhibited in raymond et al 2012 and ritz et al 2017 to document the potential errors caused by different choices of equations two additional equations of k600 i e ray04 and ray05 as summarized by raymond et al 2012 were also adopted 6 r a y 04 k 6 00 951 5 u s 0 76 7 ray 05 k 600 2841 u s 2 02 ultimately by substituting all variables into eq 2 dissolved n2 concentrations in the water parcel at any time point ti can be expressed as 8 c i c i 1 p d δ t k 600 24 s c n 2 i 600 1 2 c i 1 p d δ t c eqi δ t the n2 concentrations in the water parcel when it flowed into cin and moved out cout of the channel were known since we followed a lagrangian sampling scheme to obtain samples water temperature and pressure at the wetland s inlet and outlet were also measured at any intermediate time point water temperature and pressure can be estimated by linearly interpolating from the corresponding measured data at the wetland s inlet and outlet these data are then used to calculate the variables sc n 2 i and c eqi at time point ti as described in eqs 4 and 3 respectively in this way except for the denitrification rate p all of the variables in eq 8 can be directly or indirectly obtained the whole stream estimates of the denitrification rate p in the wetland can be solved by iterative calculation briefly the denitrification rate was first assigned to a random number between 0 and 100 mmol n m 2h 1 with an accuracy of 0 1 using the measured in situ n2 concentration at the wetland s inlet cin as a starting point n2 concentrations in the parcel of water at subsequent time points can be calculated by substituting the random values of p into the equation i e eq 8 an important parameter in the model calculation is the time step δt which determines how many times dissolved n2 concentrations were calculated during the water parcel transporting from the wetland s inlet to the outlet theoretically the shorter the time step δt the more accurate estimations will be achieved since the influences of time varying environmental conditions such as water temperature and pressure on the air water n2 exchange can be more adequately considered but this significantly reduces the model efficiency and increases the unnecessary cost of time our tentative model runs by setting different time steps as shown in fig s1 have confirmed that when the time step of the model calculations is set to 1 min the predicted denitrification rates become stable suggesting that the effects of varying environmental conditions during the water parcel movement are adequately considered in the model calculations therefore we set the time step δt at one minute thus the n2 concentrations in the water parcel were calculated for each minute during its movement in the wetland in total 90 calculations of n2 concentrations in the water parcel for each random value of p were required for obtaining the simulated n2 concentration at the wetland s outlet when the modeled n2 concentration was identical to the measured n2 concentration cout at the wetland s outlet the model iteration was terminated and the corresponding random value of p was given as the mean denitrification rate of the wetland twenty four pairwise measurements at the wetland s inlet and outlet were collected thus 24 individual model runs were conducted to facilitate the estimates we provided the scripts of parallel computing on the r which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics https www r project org the scripts which have been explained line by line as shown in the supporting information can load the measured data from a prepared spreadsheet see supporting information and directly export the model results to a spreadsheet the scripts support parameter modifications the sensitivity test of parameters and the setting of the simulation time step importantly the model can serve as a starting point for further modifications and refinements which are expected to have more extensive applications in various flow through systems 3 results 3 1 hourly dynamics hourly dynamics of the environmental factors and dissolved n2 concentrations at the wetland s inlet and outlet were obtained by the lagrangian sampling campaigns considering each of these variables at both sites in a pairwise fashion we found that five environmental variables and dissolved n2 concentrations exhibited different diel patterns between the two sites fig 3 for example the water temperature at the wetland s outlet was slightly lower than that at the inlet throughout the night but was higher during the daytime do saturation at the outlet was only half that at the inlet showing a strong oxygen depleting environment in the wetland its levels at the outlet were generally below 20 except for the time between 12 00 noon and 16 00 4p m when photosynthetic oxygen evolution by plants in the wetland was most active total dissolved nitrogen tdn levels at the outlet were lower than at the inlet most of the time but in the afternoon this indicator became higher than at the inlet other nutrient related variables such as tdn toc no3 n nh4 n and tp are also characterized by significant hourly fluctuations as shown in figure s2 exemplifying the variabilities of nutrient supplies and complicated biogeochemical processes in the wetland as affected by the upper water flows different from nutrient related indicators dissolved nitrogen dioxide n2 concentrations exhibited explicit diurnal patterns which have commonly shown that the concentrations of n2 at both sites rose overnight i e from 20 00 to 7 00 and then continually decreased until sunset e g 17 00 19 00 the divergence in n2 levels at the wetland s inlet and outlet is substantial the mean n2 concentration reached 457 mmol m 3 which was 3 higher than that at the inlet site showing considerable n2 enrichment as the movement of water parcels in the wetland the hourly differences between the two sites were most evident during the night implying that the nighttime is associated with higher n2 production conversely the differences in n2 concentrations between the sites were minor during the daytime 3 2 denitrification rates the 24 pairwise measurements of dissolved n2 at any time point of the inlet and the subsequent 1 5 h later at the outlet support the determination of denitrification rates using our model as described in section 2 4 in total 24 independent iterative model calculations for the corresponding pairwise measurements were conducted resulting in time varying rates as shown in fig 4 overall the rates using different empirical equations of air water exchange led to similar results the mean coefficient of variation among the three sets of hourly estimations was 4 the daily scale denitrification rates summarized from the 24 estimations using ray01 ray04 and ray05 were 194 6 184 8 and 191 8 mmol n m 2 d 1 respectively these rates further show that choosing different empirical equations of gas exchange can only lead to minor discrepancies in the estimates our estimation also allowed us to discern the diel dynamics of denitrification overall denitrification rates varied significantly and exhibited obvious day and night differences the highest rate was reported in the pairwise observation when the water parcel entered the wetland at 2 00 and moved on at 3 30 it should be noted that this value was close to those observed from midnight to the early morning hours e g 23 00 to 5 00 for the inlet observations or 00 30 to 6 30 for the outlet observations which were narrowly ranged from 14 75 to 15 77 mmol m 2h 1 as the sun rises the denitrification rates then rapidly became two to 10 times lower the lowest rate 1 37 mmol m 2h 1 was reported in the late afternoon when the flowing water parcel entered the wetland at 16 00 and moved out at 17 30 afterward denitrification surged to 7 15 mmol m 2h 1 before night fell which was almost half that of the nighttime average 4 discussion 4 1 method evaluation few established methods exist for estimating denitrification in streams and rivers that can reliably integrate spatial variation and resolve denitrification e g böhlke et al 2004 laursen and seitzinger 2002 mccutchan et al 2003 this study has constructed a simple numerical model based on lagrangian samplings to discern the diel pattern of denitrification on the reach scale by directly measuring the denitrification end product n2 in running water and accounting for the physical processes during its movement our approach has obvious advantages for example it does not manipulate substrate concentrations or disturb the physical setting of the process and it is cost effective in terms of time and expense groffman et al 2006 wang et al 2018 particularly in comparison with the traditional techniques such as laboratory microcosms with core incubation and or 15n isotope tracer audet et al 2021 nielsen 1992 importantly this method utilizes the measured in situ n2 concentration in the inlet as a starting point for the iterative calculation which can readily rule out the influence of longitudinal transports of dissolved n2 from upstream this is particularly useful for estimating denitrification in a given river reach providing a clearer picture of n processing in systems of interest however the method could be limited if the river is not well mixed and or sluggish specifically for the cases when the water was not running or there are limited contributions of dissolved n2 from upstream direct estimations based on the air water exchange models could be more suitable e g chen et al 2014 wang et al 2021 although such a direct method is consequently thought to have high accuracy reliability and broad application prospects groffman et al 2006 kana et al 2006 ritz et al 2017 uncertainties and errors are also embedded in such an analysis one of the main uncertainties was related to dissolved n2 measurements here dissolved n2 was determined by the n2 ar method the premise of this method is that ar is fully in equilibrium with the atmosphere in open channel systems however the assumption that ar is always at saturation could be challenging to verify groffman et al 2006 kana et al 2006 this is because the water temperature and pressure that affects its saturation are always time variant nimick et al 2011 the ambient ar concentration in water will track such time varying conditions through exchange with the atmosphere laursen and seitzinger 2005 but may rarely equal its theoretical equilibrium concentrations from this perspective there is always a time lag between changes in theoretical saturation and changes in gas concentration mccutchan et al 2003 such a time lag in turn could lead to considerable uncertainties on the amount of dissolved n2 and subsequent estimates on the amount of denitrification our model expression has mitigated such errors this is related to the model framework eq 8 which mainly accounts for the differences in n2 concentrations between both sites since the errors embedded in the n2 ar analysis are somewhat systematic and coexist at both sites a certain portion of the errors could be offset in the model iterations nevertheless such uncertainty can hardly be avoided in the estimates to evaluate such uncertainty we assume that the in situ ar concentrations are identical to their theoretical equilibrium concentrations at 0 5 h 1 h 2 h and 4 h before sampling thus a series of new datasets on dissolved n2 concentrations for both sites of the wetland were obtained by multiplying the measured n2 ar concentration ratios by the assumed in situ ar concentrations using the new datasets as model inputs the corresponding estimated denitrification rates are shown in fig 5 evidently different time lags of ar equilibrium under certain atmospheric conditions would cause different errors in denitrification estimates on average the relative deviations of the hourly denitrification rates from our current estimates i e 0 h were 1 96 14 62 3 94 29 32 3 43 50 17 and 10 41 79 61 mean and standard deviation mean s d for the time lags of 0 5 h 1 h 2 h and 4 h respectively this suggests that if the dissolved ar was in equilibrium within 4 h the corresponding mean errors of the estimates would be lower than 11 this is considered to be acceptable given the high challenge of determining denitrification under in situ conditions groffman et al 2006 another source of uncertainties is related to the calculation of gas specific transfer velocity k here we adopted the ray01 equation as proposed by raymond et al 2012 and expressed in this paper as eq 5 ray01 was chosen because it has been widely documented as one of the most accurate methods and it is also suitable for hydrometeorological and geomorphic settings in our studied wetland whitmore et al 2021 xia et al 2021 the comparisons as shown in fig 4 indicate that different equation choices may only lead to minor differences 4 in the estimated denitrification rates it is worth noting that there are also several alternatives to calculate gas specific transfer velocities e g ritz et al 2017 wanninkhof 1992 to date however there is no universal agreement on the best method to estimate gas transfer velocity given the complexity of the air water exchange on a local scale botter et al 2021 ulseth et al 2019 in this sense quantifying in situ gas transfer velocities is expected to minimize uncertainties laursen and seitzinger 2002 raymond et al 2012 direct measurement of n2 in the water column only characterizes the net production of n2 in the water column however the presence of n fixation in the river can offset or capture some of the dissolved n2 from the water column which can downplay the potential of denitrification kunza and hall 2014 loeks johnson and cotner 2020 in reviewing recent studies we found that high n2 fixation is usually reported in oceans where n is usually limiting lin et al 2013 zehr and capone 2020 many freshwater systems such as rivers and lakes are not subject to n limiting thus their n fixation rates are fairly low natwora and sheik 2021 the highest n fixation rates 0 5 mmol m 2h 1 were reported in a river system from northern california bratt 2011 even though such high n fixation rates occurred in our studied wetland the amounts were still minor compared with our interpreted n2 fluxes see fig 4 in reality high rates of n fixation are unlikely to occur in our wetland because the activity of nitrogenase can be largely limited when the no3 n is higher than 0 02 mg l kunza and hall 2014 during our sampling period the n levels in the wetland were comparatively high 0 8 mg l underscoring that n fixation could be very minor in addition previous studies have demonstrated that water with tn tp ratios below 29 are frequently dominated by n fixing cyanobacteria that can access the abundant supply of atmospheric n2 smith 1983 wang et al 2021 our water quality monitoring at the sampling wetland confirmed that the tn tp ratios across time were generally higher than 29 see fig s3 for details this further suggests that biological n fixation could be very weak in the wetland to obtain clear cut estimates for denitrification however future quantification of the potential of n fixation in the wetland is still necessary another area of concern this study did not cover is groundwater recharge and its effects groundwater is usually highly enriched with dissolved n2 laursen and seitzinger 2005 zhou et al 2018 however our hydrological measurements showed that water flows at the wetland s inlet and outlet were almost the same suggesting that the short wetland reach is unlikely to receive significant groundwater recharge however for some rivers receiving substantial groundwater it is necessary to add groundwater n2 intrusion into the model which was done by mccutchan et al 2003 4 2 factors regulating diel denitrification this investigation s 24 independent estimates provide a complete picture of denitrification on a daily scale our estimates as shown in fig 4 underscore the fact that denitrification can be highly time varying and the rates are higher at night such a diel pattern suggests that the environmental conditions during the night are more conducive to denitrification to discern which factors are responsible for the diel variation in denitrification we examined the relationships between various environmental factors and the denitrification rates at both the inlet and outlet of the wetland featured in this study interestingly none of the factors measured in the wetland s inlet correlated with our recorded denitrification rates data not shown this differs from the denitrification rates reported for the outlet where several factors were identified as explanatory variables as shown in fig 6 the absence of correlation in results showing a lack of relationships between the inlet and outlet indicates that the wetland can have greatly mediated environmental conditions which favor denitrification dissolved oxygen was one factor that can be readily mediated by the presence of a river s wetland for example at night the do saturation levels can be as low as 5 showing favorable anaerobic conditions for denitrification this may be related to vigorous ecosystem respiration in the wetland which can largely consume dissolved oxygen in the water column fabre et al 2020 martinez espinosa et al 2021 however during the daytime do levels surge to 30 when photosynthetic oxygen evolution by aquatic plants in the wetland is most active as expected such changes in do levels consequently lead to diel variability in denitrification especially since do has been intensively documented as one of the most important controls of denitrifiers nimick et al 2011 song et al 2014 similarly the oxidation reduction potential is highly affected by do levels nimick et al 2011 which is also documented as correlated with denitrification seo and delaune 2010 it is not surprising that this factor is negatively related to the denitrification rate water temperature affects denitrification in general this indicator usually exhibits clear diel patterns owing to incident solar radiation heat exchange with the atmosphere and interaction with the hyporheic zone nimick et al 2011 although the mean water temperature at the outlet was not significantly different p 0 05 from that at the inlet it is clear that the wetland can greatly alter water temperature mostly by enhanced thermal exchange due to a larger water surface and corresponding shallower water depths zhang et al 2021 such effects possibly affect denitrification since temperature is one of the main controls of microbial metabolism deng et al 2020 piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 in this case the water temperature fluctuated around 30 c with a narrow diel change 2 c as shown in figure s2 such a magnitude of change will most likely be incapable of driving strong day and night denitrification variations since the current temperature was almost suitable for denitrification elefsiniotis and li 2006 stanford et al 1975 notably we found that water temperature was significantly related to do thus the negative correlation between water temperature and denitrification rates only indicates that when stronger denitrification occurs it mainly occurs at night when both do levels and temperatures are low the ph values at the outlet were always lower than at the inlet showing that ph was also vulnerable to alterations in the wetland this is likely due to the vigorous generalized metabolism that is characteristic of wetlands in the summer and can deplete do releasing co2 to neutralize ph in the water column reddy et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 given that the standard deviation of the observed ph was very minor s d 6 and that its values are generally close to optimal for microbial denitrifiers baeseman et al 2006 šimek et al 2002 it is thus not surprising that the correlations between denitrification and ph were absent in this sense ph is unlikely to stimulate diel variability of denitrification the nutrient related indicator variations at both inlet and outlet sites were strong but failed to show any relationship with denitrification this is not surprising because the dynamics of nutrients can be also mediated by other processes such as nitrification photoautotrophic and heterotrophic assimilation greiwe et al 2021 in addition the n process responds to changes in nutrient supplies could be also largely constrained or promoted by other changing environmental factors such as do and orp levels as outlined above given the additional capability of denitrifiers uptaking nutrients from internal nutrient pools e g sediments as noted by deng et al 2020 and wu et al 2021 the denitrification responses to the dynamics of nutrient levels in the water column are sometimes difficult to determine on a daily scale riverine wetlands are biologically productive and physically dynamic systems supported by mudflats open water marshes and various organisms thereby hosting a myriad of biogeochemical interfaces deng et al 2020 nimick et al 2011 theoretically all environmental factors from the atmosphere groundwater water column sediments and organisms can potentially affect the diel dynamics of denitrification as these systems can tightly interact with each other fisher and acreman 2004 xia et al 2017 given the complexity of denitrification in wetlands future work should consider more environmental factors e g those in sediments to better reveal the mechanisms behind the denitrification dynamics 4 3 denitrification in wetlands on a daily basis denitrification usually does not appear to remove a major fraction of the n load in most rivers smith et al 2006 this is because riverine denitrification can be highly limited by various factors including a limited reactive area known for inadequate carbon sources and unfavorable environmental conditions such as flashy hydrological regimes and high do levels herrman et al 2008 however this was not the case for rivers with wetlands as wetlands usually have a much larger submerged area an attenuated flow rate shallower water depths and highly bio available carbon sources due to a vigorous ecosystem metabolism cheng et al 2020 fisher and acreman 2004 these advantages can be readily utilized by denitrifying microbes thereby reducing more n loads even on a daily scale our snapshot quantification has shown that the denitrification rate can reach 194 62 mmol n m 2 d 1 given the surface area of the river wetland 1 5 ha the wetland can almost remove 41 kg n per day demonstrating the great efficacy of riverine wetlands in buffering n pollution the high efficacy of the wetland in removing n has increased interest in whether the n levels were significantly attenuated in the wetland our measurements suggested that tn levels at the wetland s inlet and outlet were 0 81 0 13 and 0 70 0 09 mg l respectively see figure s2 given the mean streamflow of 1 68 m3 s the corresponding amounts of tn flowing into and moving out of the wetland were 118 kg d 1 and 102 kg d 1 respectively indicating that 16 kg n d 1 were retained or removed in the wetland this corresponds to the rate of 76 mmol m 2 d 1 which is only 40 of the model estimate the apparent lower rates estimated by the mass balance analysis could be due to an incomplete consideration of the nitrogen budget inventory as we only considered the n flows at the wetland s inlet and outlet but ignored the effects of sediment n pools it is plausible that substantial n was released from the sediments which may overwhelm the portion of n assimilated by aquatic biota in the wetland and thus elevate n levels observed at the outlet this can be exemplified in higher total dissolved nitrogen tdn levels at the outlet during the afternoon when photosynthesis and various aerobic metabolisms were strong high n releasing from the sediments and also plant debris along with constrained denitrification due to the high do levels in the water column may have consistently led to the increased tdn levels in the water column in addition we found that tdn levels during this study period were almost two to three times lower than the annual average 2 mg l zhang et al 2020 such low n concentrations in the water column can lead to unsteady conditions for nutrient exchange between the water and sediments which in turn may favor n release from sediments thornton et al 2007 further evidence can be obtained for total phosphorous tp which is mainly subject to physicochemical processes withers and jarvie 2008 parallel to tn the tp level 0 03 mg l during our studied period also lied within the low boundary of ranges reported at the wetland site 0 01 0 17 mg l mean 0 05 mg l zhang et al 2020 we observed a 30 increase in tp levels as the water moved through the wetland 0 029 vs 0 022 mg l as shown in figure s2 obvious nutrient release indicates that until we can quantify all fluxes accurately the mass balance analysis could remain unable to constrain the estimation using the direct method as presented here nonetheless both methods at least pinpoint the practical significance of constructed riverine wetlands as an environmentally helpful means to mitigate the increasing issue of n pollution our parsimonious estimates generally lie within the ranges reported from other river systems across the world the complied data as shown in chen et al 2014 indicated that the annual mean denitrification rate although it varied greatly across rivers and through time seitzinger 1988 was within 0 105 mmol n m 2 d 1 however for some specific days or seasons the denitrification rates were expected to be much higher piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 for example laursen and seitzinger 2002 quantified the denitrification rate for several days across the year and concluded that the rate could be as low as 6 5 mmol n m 2 d 1 but also can surge to 379 mmol n m 2 d 1 similarly mccutchan et al 2003 documented that the denitrification rates in the south platte river of the us can reach as much as 380 mmol n m 2 d 1 which is almost double our reported rate in the taihu lake basin where the studied wetland is located the estimates derived from sediment core incubation showed that the denitrification rates in 21 high order rivers of the basin typically ranged within 0 7 15 6 mmol n m 2 d 1 which is much lower than our snapshot estimate irrespective of different uncertainties and errors among methods significant gaps in reported denitrification rates across and within systems are possible because the environmental conditions that the systems can offer for metabolisms could highly differ across space and time for example the 21 rivers in taihu lake basin are much larger and had no wetlands which could be inferior in denitrification denitrification rates in riverine wetlands have also been investigated batson et al 2012 mander et al 2021 however most of them utilized the acetylene inhibition technique to measure denitrification which has been well documented to downplay the denitrification potentials groffman et al 2006 the reported rates were even lower than in most of the rivers as outlined above lowrance et al 1995 smith et al 2000 song et al 2014 up to now as far as we know direct determination of denitrification using the n2 ar method has not been extended to riverine wetlands this calls for more applications of such direct and sensitive methods as have been presented here to better reveal the diel n processes in wetlands a type of ecosystem that is widely characterized as biogeochemical hotspots reddy et al 2009 5 conclusions the purpose of the current study was to determine the hourly variability of denitrification in a flow through riverine wetland and to discern its main controls we have developed a simple model to quantify denitrification rates based on pairwise measurements of dissolved n2 concentrations at the wetland s inlet and outlet our results confirmed that denitrification is time varying exhibiting obvious day and night differences the highest rate occurred at midnight while the lowest rate was reported in the late afternoon the mean denitrification rate during the night reached 12 34 mmol m 2h 1 which is 3 times greater than during the daytime such a variation can be explained by diel cycles in do and redox conditions it should be acknowledged that our snapshot quantification of hourly denitrification is somewhat incomplete and should only serve as a starting point for further investigations of the changing natures of n removal in wetlands it remains unclear whether denitrification also varies across hours during other periods such as when aquatic plants were absent and or when hydrological conditions were different thus more estimations that can take advantage of the whole system method as proposed here or other advanced methods during different periods would help us to establish a complete picture of the changing nature of denitrification in riverine wetlands further efforts should also focus on the control mechanisms behind the time immediate denitrification process to better expand our understanding of n cycling in wetland ecosystems and to form

2182,accelerated degradation of aquatic ecosystems caused by excessive nitrogen input has focused more attention on denitrification which can permanently convert reactive nitrogen n into dinitrogen n2 while denitrification has been extensively studied information is limited concerning the specifics of its changing nature on a daily scale this article presents our development of a simple model to quantify hourly denitrification at the reach scale which was applied to a flow through river wetland in southeast china by measuring the concentration of dissolved n2 at the inlet and outlet of the wetland and accounting for the air water physical exchange the model can obtain a complete picture of the diel variability during denitrification our results showed that denitrification rates varied significantly and exhibited obvious day and night differences the mean denitrification rate during the night reached 12 34 mmol m 2h 1 which was three times greater than the daytime rate changes in dissolved oxygen and redox conditions were found to be responsible for the observed denitrification dynamics of the wetland the apparent diel pattern of denitrification as exhibited in the riverine wetland provides a strong rationale for further recognition of denitrification s instant responses to changes in various environmental factors future efforts should also consider taking advantage of the whole system method as proposed here and conducting more in situ measurements with wider spatio temporal coverages to better elucidate time immediate denitrification processes and also to facilitate effective management strategies keywords wetlands nitrogen pollution denitrification environmental factors nitrogen removal membrane inlet mass spectrometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive n loading to surface water as a result of intensified human activities is an issue of increasing global concern because it can accelerate the growth of microbes that can deplete oxygen destroy aquatic ecosystems and result in eutrophication and hypoxia galloway et al 2002 stevens 2019 swaney et al 2012 denitrification counterbalances this problem by converting reactive nitrogen e g nitrate to dinitrogen n2 an inert gas not available for the majority of living organisms loeks johnson and cotner 2020 denitrification is thus thought to be the main mechanism of permanent n removal cheng et al 2020 ward 2013 therefore discerning the process of denitrification has both scientific and management significance loeks johnson and cotner 2020 nizzoli et al 2017 since it not only advances our knowledge of the complex n cycle in aquatic systems but also facilitates effective management strategies denitrification requires reducing conditions it is temperature dependent herrman et al 2008 zheng et al 2016 and sensitive to ph and do baeseman et al 2006 denitrification is also limited by the availability of organic carbon ashby et al 1998 eyre and ferguson 2009 and no3 böhlke et al 2009 mulholland et al 2008 these traits increase the complexity of assessing denitrification effects on streams and rivers since they are typically variable systems that can be characterized by significant fluctuations in temperature flow nutrient supplies do ph and other environmental conditions peterson et al 2001 wollheim et al 2006 which can sometimes change on an hourly scale greiwe et al 2021 nimick et al 2011 they are also often interrupted by natural or artificial wetlands which are hotspots in need of n removal cheng et al 2020 and are known to further alter riverine environmental conditions fisher and acreman 2004 pueppke et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 thus denitrification would be expected to tightly respond to these variable features herrman et al 2008 and may show strong temporal variations previous studies have well documented temporal variabilities of denitrification in various systems but mostly on seasonal and monthly scales martinez espinosa et al 2021 piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 research to date however has not specifically determined the hourly variations of denitrification in rivers particularly for those with wetlands denitrification is a difficult process to quantify groffman et al 2006 in principle direct measurement of denitrification is preferentially done by determining the main end product n2 in the water column but this is challenging due to the high background concentration of the gas kana et al 1998 more common approaches for quantifying denitrification such as acetylene inhibition application of isotope pairing technique and mass balance analysis either suffer from artificial conditions or are prohibitive both in terms of time and cost groffman et al 2006 reisinger et al 2016 the acetylene block technique for example changes the substrate concentrations disturbs the physical or chemical conditions zhou et al 2018 and most critically tends to underestimate denitrification because acetylene inhibits nitrification and does not completely block the reduction of n2o to n2 mccutchan et al 2003 the isotope pairing technique which traces 15n no3 to n2 böhlke et al 2004 nielsen 1992 is well suited to the requirement for high precision measurements of denitrification but its applications have been limited for in situ measurements due to the high cost of isotopes in most cases these two techniques were only applied to closed incubation systems e g sediment cores and chambers groffman et al 2006 kana et al 2006 which is challenging to expand to a river reach or different ecosystem levels laursen and seitzinger 2002 the mass balance analysis is usually applied in reach or ecosystem levels but it is a typical black box approach that usually ignores the internal processes in lake and river systems pribyl et al 2005 this method is considered to have insufficient sensitivity or offsetting sources and sinks and is also subject to large errors böhlke et al 2004 when considered as a whole although these traditional approaches are used widely they are also subject to obvious limitations and more importantly they are not suitable to determine denitrification rates on a finer temporal scale and under in situ conditions the emergence of the membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims technique makes it possible to directly measure n2 concentrations kana et al 1994 because the method is simple rapid and highly accurate it has gained widespread use in studying denitrification in various systems including rivers ritz et al 2017 xia et al 2018 yan et al 2004 groundwater popp et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 and estuaries kana et al 2006 wu et al 2013 mims also enabled us to reveal in situ denitrification with much finer temporal resolutions this type of detail not only closes the knowledge gaps left by instant responses to denitrification based on the dynamics of environmental conditions but mims also puts forward a more credible assessment of the denitrification potential in systems of interest the purpose of this study is to describe an integrated whole system model to quantify denitrification in a flow through system the model described here depends on the measurement of dissolved n2 concentrations by mims and was applied to a flow through riverine which was located at the midstream of a headwater river in southeast china to reveal the diel pattern of denitrification we continuously measured dissolved n2 concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the wetland for 24 h following the lagrangian sampling scheme in addition to examining the usefulness of the whole system model in portraying denitrification dynamics our tentative use of the model was also sought to i unravel diel variability of denitrification in the riverine wetland and ii ascertain which environmental factors are more important in governing such variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our research area is located at the zhongtian catchment fig 1 which lies within the headwater regions of taihu lake the third largest lake in china in the middle to lower mainstem of the zhongtian river there is a total area of 1 5 km2 cascade wetlands which can be characterized by mudflats open water and marshes with dominant emergent vegetation zhang et al 2020 the cascade wetlands were constructed in 2009 as an important means to buffer nutrient pollution from agricultural hillslopes mostly tea plantations before discharging into tianmu lake which serves as an important drinking source zhang et al 2020 ten years of monthly based water quality monitoring along the zhongtian river indicates that the presence of the cascade wetlands has greatly enhanced in stream n removal zhang et al 2019 as a primary permanent pathway of n removal from water bodies however hourly dynamics of denitrification in the wetlands have not been investigated in this study we selected one exemplary section of these cascade wetlands in the zhongtian river as our research area see fig 1c the monitored wetland reach covers a surface area of 1 5 ha with a length of 430 m the mean depth is 0 6 m based on averaged multi site measurements on the wetland reach 2 2 field sampling all samples for dissolved gas analyses were collected according to the two station approach based on a lagrangian sampling scheme laursen and seitzinger 2002 namely we collected a sample at the wetland s inlet and collected another water sample at the outlet when the same parcel of water arrived thus we compare the n2 changes in the same water parcel as it travels in the wetland and quantify the reach scale denitrification rate using the model as described in section 2 4 the measured in situ flow velocity was used to determine the time of the water parcel traveling from the wetland s inlet to the outlet the lagrangian samplings were continuously done 24 times during the studied period with evenly hourly intervals which enabled us to obtain complete samples for diel estimates to reduce the climatic and hydrological disturbances we chose july 30 31 2018 as our monitoring period which was characterized by a sunny breezy and stable streamflow and water level during this period the mean flow speed was stable at 0 08 m s 1 suggesting that the water parcel moving 430 m from the inlet to the outlet site in 1 5 h at the inlet sampling began at 20 00 8 00p m china standard time cst on july 30 2018 and was completed at 19 00 7 00p m cst on july 31 2018 with an hourly interval the samples at the outlet were obtained in a similar manner but were started at 21 30 9 30p m cst july 30 2018 and terminated at 20 30 8 30p m cst july 31 2018 with a 1 5 h residence time for the water parcel in the wetland in total 24 lagrangian sampling campaigns were conducted wherein gauges were embedded in fluid parcels to get current and flow data all samples for gas analysis were collected at the thalweg below the water surface 20 cm using niskin bottles and carefully avoiding the creation of bubbles samples were then transferred into 12 ml labco exetainer vials with rubber septa labco ltd lampeter uk several volumes were allowed to overflow thereby minimizing the exchange of gases with the atmosphere samples were preserved by pipetting a small volume of saturated zncl2 solution into each vial to stop microbial metabolism which was sealed immediately with a rubber septum with no headspace or bubble three repeated samples were collected then the samples were stored underwater at 4 c during the transportation and analyzed within 7 days to evaluate whether the water in the river sections studied was well mixed we also took two additional cross sectional water samples from areas like the left and right banks of the river in addition to their thalweg our measurements suggested that the monitored wetland samples were well mixed without statistically significant differences in gas concentrations among the sampling locations p 0 05 therefore the data obtained from the thalweg was used for the following analysis for water quality measurements 600 ml water samples were simultaneously collected for each of the sampling events for gas analysis in situ physical chemical indicators such as water temperature barometric pressure dissolved oxygen do specific conductance spc and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured at the time of sampling with a ysi 6000 multiprobe field meter yellow springs instruments ysi yellow springs ohio usa water depth flow speed and flow rates were derived from the hydrological gauge which was located at the outlet of the wetland we also adopted a ysi flowtracker2 to measure water depth and flow speed at multiple points on the sampling transects of the wetland s inlet for each of the sampling visits these measurements further confirmed that flow speed and water level were stable during the monitoring period the water depth and flow speed averaged from the two stations were used for the following analysis all of the measured data can be found in the spreadsheet of supporting information 2 3 analytical techniques in the laboratory dissolved gas concentrations were determined using a high precision mims instrument bay instruments easton md usa following the procedure described by kana et al 1994 and zhou et al 2018 this instrument consists of a membrane sampling system and a pfeiffer vacuum prismaplus quadrupole mass spectrometer the membrane sampling system can extract the dissolved gases under a high vacuum 10 6 mm hg when samples are pumped through a gas permeable silicon membrane the instrument was fitted with a liquid n2 trap and furnace accessory to minimize interference of co2 o2 and other dissolved gases with n2 measurements dissolved gas concentrations were calibrated with standard water deionized water which was prepared 24 h before the measurements to ensure that the water was fully equilibrated with air replicate samples had a lower standard deviation among dinitrogen argon n2 ar measurements 0 03 than among dinitrogen n2 measurements 0 10 kana et al 1994 dissolved n2 concentrations in the water samples were thus determined conservatively by multiplying the n2 ar concentration ratios by the expected ar concentrations more details about n2 measurements and the data calibration can be found in kana et al 1994 the water quality indicators such as total dissolved nitrogen tdn nitrate no3 n ammonium ammonia nh4 n total organic carbon toc and total phosphorus tp were analyzed following the standard protocols released by the ministry of ecology and environment of china mep 2002 2 4 a model for estimating hourly denitrification rate in open channel systems denitrification can increase n2 enrichment in the water column whereas such enrichment in turn promotes n2 loss from water through re equilibration with the atmosphere in this sense the change of n2 in water through time can be expressed as a function of atmospheric exchange and denitrification production laursen and seitzinger 2002 we proposed a numerical model framework to estimate whole system denitrification in a way much similar to the two station approach proposed by laursen and seitzinger 2002 the model is based on a mass balance analysis of dissolved n2 in the water column which not only can rule out the interference of longitudinal transports of dissolved n2 from upstream but also can quantify the vertical air water n2 exchanges as influenced by time varying environmental conditions by defining a water parcel an arbitrary volume that was passing through a river reach see fig 2 the mass of n2 in the water parcel m i at any time point ti can be expressed as 1 m i m i 1 p a δ t f i a δ t where mi 1 refers to total dissolved n2 mass in the water parcel for the time point ti 1 the term p a δ t denotes n2 mass derived from denitrification at time point ti and f i a δ t is the mass of n2 lost to the air p is the integrated whole system averaged denitrification rate fi is the rate of air water exchange in the water parcel at time point t i a is the surface area of the water parcel and δ t is the time interval between ti and ti 1 to simplify the model we assume that the channel morphology i e river width and depth was uniform along the watercourse under steady state conditions the volume of the water parcel was unchanged during its transportation thus dividing by the volume of the water parcel causes eq 1 to become 2 c i c i 1 p d δ t f i d δ t where ci and ci 1 refer to dissolved n2 concentrations expressed in mmol m 3 in the same water parcel at time point ti and ti 1 respectively p d δ t denotes the concentration contributions from denitrification which are calculated using the mean denitrification rate p expressed in mmol m 2h 1 the mean depth of the water parcel d m and the corresponding reaction time δ t h finally f i d δ t denotes n2 concentration loss due to air water exchange the rates of water air exchange f i mmol m 2h 1 at the time point ti can be characterized by the widely used air water exchange model as presented wanninkhof 1992 3 f i 1 24 k i c c eq i where k i m d 1 is the first order gas transfer coefficient at the time point ti the term c c eq i denotes the concentration difference of n2 between the water column c and the atmospheric equilibrium concentration c eq i the constant value 1 24 is used to convert units from mmol m 2 d 1 to mmol m 2h 1 here c refers to the total concentration of n2 that is subject to air water exchange which is identical to c i 1 plus the n2 concentrations contributed by denitrification i e p d δ t the c eq i refers to equilibrium concentrations of n2 which can be computed using in situ water temperature and pressure at the time point t i according to the solubility equation weiss 1970 the first order gas transfer coefficient of n2 k i determines how rapidly dissolved n2 in the water parcel will re equilibrate with the atmosphere when the concentration is out of equilibrium laursen and seitzinger 2005 a common approach when reporting k i values is to normalize ki to a piston velocity k600 with a schmidt number of 600 which can be expressed as 4 k i s c n 2 i 600 1 2 k 600 where sc n 2 i is the schmidt number of n2 at the in situ temperature of time point ti which can be computed according to wanninkhof 1992 k600 m d 1 is the piston velocity of a gas with a schmidt number of 600 the equation for k600 calculation is termed ray01 which is calculated as 5 r a y 01 k 6 00 5037 u s 0 89 d 0 54 where u s and d refer to the river speed m s 1 slope unitless and water depth m respectively raymond et al 2012 ray01 was chosen because it has been widely documented as one of the most accurate methods and is particularly suitable for low order rivers whitmore et al 2021 such as the zhongtian river as presented here notably there are other empirical equations for predicting the k600 as exhibited in raymond et al 2012 and ritz et al 2017 to document the potential errors caused by different choices of equations two additional equations of k600 i e ray04 and ray05 as summarized by raymond et al 2012 were also adopted 6 r a y 04 k 6 00 951 5 u s 0 76 7 ray 05 k 600 2841 u s 2 02 ultimately by substituting all variables into eq 2 dissolved n2 concentrations in the water parcel at any time point ti can be expressed as 8 c i c i 1 p d δ t k 600 24 s c n 2 i 600 1 2 c i 1 p d δ t c eqi δ t the n2 concentrations in the water parcel when it flowed into cin and moved out cout of the channel were known since we followed a lagrangian sampling scheme to obtain samples water temperature and pressure at the wetland s inlet and outlet were also measured at any intermediate time point water temperature and pressure can be estimated by linearly interpolating from the corresponding measured data at the wetland s inlet and outlet these data are then used to calculate the variables sc n 2 i and c eqi at time point ti as described in eqs 4 and 3 respectively in this way except for the denitrification rate p all of the variables in eq 8 can be directly or indirectly obtained the whole stream estimates of the denitrification rate p in the wetland can be solved by iterative calculation briefly the denitrification rate was first assigned to a random number between 0 and 100 mmol n m 2h 1 with an accuracy of 0 1 using the measured in situ n2 concentration at the wetland s inlet cin as a starting point n2 concentrations in the parcel of water at subsequent time points can be calculated by substituting the random values of p into the equation i e eq 8 an important parameter in the model calculation is the time step δt which determines how many times dissolved n2 concentrations were calculated during the water parcel transporting from the wetland s inlet to the outlet theoretically the shorter the time step δt the more accurate estimations will be achieved since the influences of time varying environmental conditions such as water temperature and pressure on the air water n2 exchange can be more adequately considered but this significantly reduces the model efficiency and increases the unnecessary cost of time our tentative model runs by setting different time steps as shown in fig s1 have confirmed that when the time step of the model calculations is set to 1 min the predicted denitrification rates become stable suggesting that the effects of varying environmental conditions during the water parcel movement are adequately considered in the model calculations therefore we set the time step δt at one minute thus the n2 concentrations in the water parcel were calculated for each minute during its movement in the wetland in total 90 calculations of n2 concentrations in the water parcel for each random value of p were required for obtaining the simulated n2 concentration at the wetland s outlet when the modeled n2 concentration was identical to the measured n2 concentration cout at the wetland s outlet the model iteration was terminated and the corresponding random value of p was given as the mean denitrification rate of the wetland twenty four pairwise measurements at the wetland s inlet and outlet were collected thus 24 individual model runs were conducted to facilitate the estimates we provided the scripts of parallel computing on the r which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics https www r project org the scripts which have been explained line by line as shown in the supporting information can load the measured data from a prepared spreadsheet see supporting information and directly export the model results to a spreadsheet the scripts support parameter modifications the sensitivity test of parameters and the setting of the simulation time step importantly the model can serve as a starting point for further modifications and refinements which are expected to have more extensive applications in various flow through systems 3 results 3 1 hourly dynamics hourly dynamics of the environmental factors and dissolved n2 concentrations at the wetland s inlet and outlet were obtained by the lagrangian sampling campaigns considering each of these variables at both sites in a pairwise fashion we found that five environmental variables and dissolved n2 concentrations exhibited different diel patterns between the two sites fig 3 for example the water temperature at the wetland s outlet was slightly lower than that at the inlet throughout the night but was higher during the daytime do saturation at the outlet was only half that at the inlet showing a strong oxygen depleting environment in the wetland its levels at the outlet were generally below 20 except for the time between 12 00 noon and 16 00 4p m when photosynthetic oxygen evolution by plants in the wetland was most active total dissolved nitrogen tdn levels at the outlet were lower than at the inlet most of the time but in the afternoon this indicator became higher than at the inlet other nutrient related variables such as tdn toc no3 n nh4 n and tp are also characterized by significant hourly fluctuations as shown in figure s2 exemplifying the variabilities of nutrient supplies and complicated biogeochemical processes in the wetland as affected by the upper water flows different from nutrient related indicators dissolved nitrogen dioxide n2 concentrations exhibited explicit diurnal patterns which have commonly shown that the concentrations of n2 at both sites rose overnight i e from 20 00 to 7 00 and then continually decreased until sunset e g 17 00 19 00 the divergence in n2 levels at the wetland s inlet and outlet is substantial the mean n2 concentration reached 457 mmol m 3 which was 3 higher than that at the inlet site showing considerable n2 enrichment as the movement of water parcels in the wetland the hourly differences between the two sites were most evident during the night implying that the nighttime is associated with higher n2 production conversely the differences in n2 concentrations between the sites were minor during the daytime 3 2 denitrification rates the 24 pairwise measurements of dissolved n2 at any time point of the inlet and the subsequent 1 5 h later at the outlet support the determination of denitrification rates using our model as described in section 2 4 in total 24 independent iterative model calculations for the corresponding pairwise measurements were conducted resulting in time varying rates as shown in fig 4 overall the rates using different empirical equations of air water exchange led to similar results the mean coefficient of variation among the three sets of hourly estimations was 4 the daily scale denitrification rates summarized from the 24 estimations using ray01 ray04 and ray05 were 194 6 184 8 and 191 8 mmol n m 2 d 1 respectively these rates further show that choosing different empirical equations of gas exchange can only lead to minor discrepancies in the estimates our estimation also allowed us to discern the diel dynamics of denitrification overall denitrification rates varied significantly and exhibited obvious day and night differences the highest rate was reported in the pairwise observation when the water parcel entered the wetland at 2 00 and moved on at 3 30 it should be noted that this value was close to those observed from midnight to the early morning hours e g 23 00 to 5 00 for the inlet observations or 00 30 to 6 30 for the outlet observations which were narrowly ranged from 14 75 to 15 77 mmol m 2h 1 as the sun rises the denitrification rates then rapidly became two to 10 times lower the lowest rate 1 37 mmol m 2h 1 was reported in the late afternoon when the flowing water parcel entered the wetland at 16 00 and moved out at 17 30 afterward denitrification surged to 7 15 mmol m 2h 1 before night fell which was almost half that of the nighttime average 4 discussion 4 1 method evaluation few established methods exist for estimating denitrification in streams and rivers that can reliably integrate spatial variation and resolve denitrification e g böhlke et al 2004 laursen and seitzinger 2002 mccutchan et al 2003 this study has constructed a simple numerical model based on lagrangian samplings to discern the diel pattern of denitrification on the reach scale by directly measuring the denitrification end product n2 in running water and accounting for the physical processes during its movement our approach has obvious advantages for example it does not manipulate substrate concentrations or disturb the physical setting of the process and it is cost effective in terms of time and expense groffman et al 2006 wang et al 2018 particularly in comparison with the traditional techniques such as laboratory microcosms with core incubation and or 15n isotope tracer audet et al 2021 nielsen 1992 importantly this method utilizes the measured in situ n2 concentration in the inlet as a starting point for the iterative calculation which can readily rule out the influence of longitudinal transports of dissolved n2 from upstream this is particularly useful for estimating denitrification in a given river reach providing a clearer picture of n processing in systems of interest however the method could be limited if the river is not well mixed and or sluggish specifically for the cases when the water was not running or there are limited contributions of dissolved n2 from upstream direct estimations based on the air water exchange models could be more suitable e g chen et al 2014 wang et al 2021 although such a direct method is consequently thought to have high accuracy reliability and broad application prospects groffman et al 2006 kana et al 2006 ritz et al 2017 uncertainties and errors are also embedded in such an analysis one of the main uncertainties was related to dissolved n2 measurements here dissolved n2 was determined by the n2 ar method the premise of this method is that ar is fully in equilibrium with the atmosphere in open channel systems however the assumption that ar is always at saturation could be challenging to verify groffman et al 2006 kana et al 2006 this is because the water temperature and pressure that affects its saturation are always time variant nimick et al 2011 the ambient ar concentration in water will track such time varying conditions through exchange with the atmosphere laursen and seitzinger 2005 but may rarely equal its theoretical equilibrium concentrations from this perspective there is always a time lag between changes in theoretical saturation and changes in gas concentration mccutchan et al 2003 such a time lag in turn could lead to considerable uncertainties on the amount of dissolved n2 and subsequent estimates on the amount of denitrification our model expression has mitigated such errors this is related to the model framework eq 8 which mainly accounts for the differences in n2 concentrations between both sites since the errors embedded in the n2 ar analysis are somewhat systematic and coexist at both sites a certain portion of the errors could be offset in the model iterations nevertheless such uncertainty can hardly be avoided in the estimates to evaluate such uncertainty we assume that the in situ ar concentrations are identical to their theoretical equilibrium concentrations at 0 5 h 1 h 2 h and 4 h before sampling thus a series of new datasets on dissolved n2 concentrations for both sites of the wetland were obtained by multiplying the measured n2 ar concentration ratios by the assumed in situ ar concentrations using the new datasets as model inputs the corresponding estimated denitrification rates are shown in fig 5 evidently different time lags of ar equilibrium under certain atmospheric conditions would cause different errors in denitrification estimates on average the relative deviations of the hourly denitrification rates from our current estimates i e 0 h were 1 96 14 62 3 94 29 32 3 43 50 17 and 10 41 79 61 mean and standard deviation mean s d for the time lags of 0 5 h 1 h 2 h and 4 h respectively this suggests that if the dissolved ar was in equilibrium within 4 h the corresponding mean errors of the estimates would be lower than 11 this is considered to be acceptable given the high challenge of determining denitrification under in situ conditions groffman et al 2006 another source of uncertainties is related to the calculation of gas specific transfer velocity k here we adopted the ray01 equation as proposed by raymond et al 2012 and expressed in this paper as eq 5 ray01 was chosen because it has been widely documented as one of the most accurate methods and it is also suitable for hydrometeorological and geomorphic settings in our studied wetland whitmore et al 2021 xia et al 2021 the comparisons as shown in fig 4 indicate that different equation choices may only lead to minor differences 4 in the estimated denitrification rates it is worth noting that there are also several alternatives to calculate gas specific transfer velocities e g ritz et al 2017 wanninkhof 1992 to date however there is no universal agreement on the best method to estimate gas transfer velocity given the complexity of the air water exchange on a local scale botter et al 2021 ulseth et al 2019 in this sense quantifying in situ gas transfer velocities is expected to minimize uncertainties laursen and seitzinger 2002 raymond et al 2012 direct measurement of n2 in the water column only characterizes the net production of n2 in the water column however the presence of n fixation in the river can offset or capture some of the dissolved n2 from the water column which can downplay the potential of denitrification kunza and hall 2014 loeks johnson and cotner 2020 in reviewing recent studies we found that high n2 fixation is usually reported in oceans where n is usually limiting lin et al 2013 zehr and capone 2020 many freshwater systems such as rivers and lakes are not subject to n limiting thus their n fixation rates are fairly low natwora and sheik 2021 the highest n fixation rates 0 5 mmol m 2h 1 were reported in a river system from northern california bratt 2011 even though such high n fixation rates occurred in our studied wetland the amounts were still minor compared with our interpreted n2 fluxes see fig 4 in reality high rates of n fixation are unlikely to occur in our wetland because the activity of nitrogenase can be largely limited when the no3 n is higher than 0 02 mg l kunza and hall 2014 during our sampling period the n levels in the wetland were comparatively high 0 8 mg l underscoring that n fixation could be very minor in addition previous studies have demonstrated that water with tn tp ratios below 29 are frequently dominated by n fixing cyanobacteria that can access the abundant supply of atmospheric n2 smith 1983 wang et al 2021 our water quality monitoring at the sampling wetland confirmed that the tn tp ratios across time were generally higher than 29 see fig s3 for details this further suggests that biological n fixation could be very weak in the wetland to obtain clear cut estimates for denitrification however future quantification of the potential of n fixation in the wetland is still necessary another area of concern this study did not cover is groundwater recharge and its effects groundwater is usually highly enriched with dissolved n2 laursen and seitzinger 2005 zhou et al 2018 however our hydrological measurements showed that water flows at the wetland s inlet and outlet were almost the same suggesting that the short wetland reach is unlikely to receive significant groundwater recharge however for some rivers receiving substantial groundwater it is necessary to add groundwater n2 intrusion into the model which was done by mccutchan et al 2003 4 2 factors regulating diel denitrification this investigation s 24 independent estimates provide a complete picture of denitrification on a daily scale our estimates as shown in fig 4 underscore the fact that denitrification can be highly time varying and the rates are higher at night such a diel pattern suggests that the environmental conditions during the night are more conducive to denitrification to discern which factors are responsible for the diel variation in denitrification we examined the relationships between various environmental factors and the denitrification rates at both the inlet and outlet of the wetland featured in this study interestingly none of the factors measured in the wetland s inlet correlated with our recorded denitrification rates data not shown this differs from the denitrification rates reported for the outlet where several factors were identified as explanatory variables as shown in fig 6 the absence of correlation in results showing a lack of relationships between the inlet and outlet indicates that the wetland can have greatly mediated environmental conditions which favor denitrification dissolved oxygen was one factor that can be readily mediated by the presence of a river s wetland for example at night the do saturation levels can be as low as 5 showing favorable anaerobic conditions for denitrification this may be related to vigorous ecosystem respiration in the wetland which can largely consume dissolved oxygen in the water column fabre et al 2020 martinez espinosa et al 2021 however during the daytime do levels surge to 30 when photosynthetic oxygen evolution by aquatic plants in the wetland is most active as expected such changes in do levels consequently lead to diel variability in denitrification especially since do has been intensively documented as one of the most important controls of denitrifiers nimick et al 2011 song et al 2014 similarly the oxidation reduction potential is highly affected by do levels nimick et al 2011 which is also documented as correlated with denitrification seo and delaune 2010 it is not surprising that this factor is negatively related to the denitrification rate water temperature affects denitrification in general this indicator usually exhibits clear diel patterns owing to incident solar radiation heat exchange with the atmosphere and interaction with the hyporheic zone nimick et al 2011 although the mean water temperature at the outlet was not significantly different p 0 05 from that at the inlet it is clear that the wetland can greatly alter water temperature mostly by enhanced thermal exchange due to a larger water surface and corresponding shallower water depths zhang et al 2021 such effects possibly affect denitrification since temperature is one of the main controls of microbial metabolism deng et al 2020 piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 in this case the water temperature fluctuated around 30 c with a narrow diel change 2 c as shown in figure s2 such a magnitude of change will most likely be incapable of driving strong day and night denitrification variations since the current temperature was almost suitable for denitrification elefsiniotis and li 2006 stanford et al 1975 notably we found that water temperature was significantly related to do thus the negative correlation between water temperature and denitrification rates only indicates that when stronger denitrification occurs it mainly occurs at night when both do levels and temperatures are low the ph values at the outlet were always lower than at the inlet showing that ph was also vulnerable to alterations in the wetland this is likely due to the vigorous generalized metabolism that is characteristic of wetlands in the summer and can deplete do releasing co2 to neutralize ph in the water column reddy et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 given that the standard deviation of the observed ph was very minor s d 6 and that its values are generally close to optimal for microbial denitrifiers baeseman et al 2006 šimek et al 2002 it is thus not surprising that the correlations between denitrification and ph were absent in this sense ph is unlikely to stimulate diel variability of denitrification the nutrient related indicator variations at both inlet and outlet sites were strong but failed to show any relationship with denitrification this is not surprising because the dynamics of nutrients can be also mediated by other processes such as nitrification photoautotrophic and heterotrophic assimilation greiwe et al 2021 in addition the n process responds to changes in nutrient supplies could be also largely constrained or promoted by other changing environmental factors such as do and orp levels as outlined above given the additional capability of denitrifiers uptaking nutrients from internal nutrient pools e g sediments as noted by deng et al 2020 and wu et al 2021 the denitrification responses to the dynamics of nutrient levels in the water column are sometimes difficult to determine on a daily scale riverine wetlands are biologically productive and physically dynamic systems supported by mudflats open water marshes and various organisms thereby hosting a myriad of biogeochemical interfaces deng et al 2020 nimick et al 2011 theoretically all environmental factors from the atmosphere groundwater water column sediments and organisms can potentially affect the diel dynamics of denitrification as these systems can tightly interact with each other fisher and acreman 2004 xia et al 2017 given the complexity of denitrification in wetlands future work should consider more environmental factors e g those in sediments to better reveal the mechanisms behind the denitrification dynamics 4 3 denitrification in wetlands on a daily basis denitrification usually does not appear to remove a major fraction of the n load in most rivers smith et al 2006 this is because riverine denitrification can be highly limited by various factors including a limited reactive area known for inadequate carbon sources and unfavorable environmental conditions such as flashy hydrological regimes and high do levels herrman et al 2008 however this was not the case for rivers with wetlands as wetlands usually have a much larger submerged area an attenuated flow rate shallower water depths and highly bio available carbon sources due to a vigorous ecosystem metabolism cheng et al 2020 fisher and acreman 2004 these advantages can be readily utilized by denitrifying microbes thereby reducing more n loads even on a daily scale our snapshot quantification has shown that the denitrification rate can reach 194 62 mmol n m 2 d 1 given the surface area of the river wetland 1 5 ha the wetland can almost remove 41 kg n per day demonstrating the great efficacy of riverine wetlands in buffering n pollution the high efficacy of the wetland in removing n has increased interest in whether the n levels were significantly attenuated in the wetland our measurements suggested that tn levels at the wetland s inlet and outlet were 0 81 0 13 and 0 70 0 09 mg l respectively see figure s2 given the mean streamflow of 1 68 m3 s the corresponding amounts of tn flowing into and moving out of the wetland were 118 kg d 1 and 102 kg d 1 respectively indicating that 16 kg n d 1 were retained or removed in the wetland this corresponds to the rate of 76 mmol m 2 d 1 which is only 40 of the model estimate the apparent lower rates estimated by the mass balance analysis could be due to an incomplete consideration of the nitrogen budget inventory as we only considered the n flows at the wetland s inlet and outlet but ignored the effects of sediment n pools it is plausible that substantial n was released from the sediments which may overwhelm the portion of n assimilated by aquatic biota in the wetland and thus elevate n levels observed at the outlet this can be exemplified in higher total dissolved nitrogen tdn levels at the outlet during the afternoon when photosynthesis and various aerobic metabolisms were strong high n releasing from the sediments and also plant debris along with constrained denitrification due to the high do levels in the water column may have consistently led to the increased tdn levels in the water column in addition we found that tdn levels during this study period were almost two to three times lower than the annual average 2 mg l zhang et al 2020 such low n concentrations in the water column can lead to unsteady conditions for nutrient exchange between the water and sediments which in turn may favor n release from sediments thornton et al 2007 further evidence can be obtained for total phosphorous tp which is mainly subject to physicochemical processes withers and jarvie 2008 parallel to tn the tp level 0 03 mg l during our studied period also lied within the low boundary of ranges reported at the wetland site 0 01 0 17 mg l mean 0 05 mg l zhang et al 2020 we observed a 30 increase in tp levels as the water moved through the wetland 0 029 vs 0 022 mg l as shown in figure s2 obvious nutrient release indicates that until we can quantify all fluxes accurately the mass balance analysis could remain unable to constrain the estimation using the direct method as presented here nonetheless both methods at least pinpoint the practical significance of constructed riverine wetlands as an environmentally helpful means to mitigate the increasing issue of n pollution our parsimonious estimates generally lie within the ranges reported from other river systems across the world the complied data as shown in chen et al 2014 indicated that the annual mean denitrification rate although it varied greatly across rivers and through time seitzinger 1988 was within 0 105 mmol n m 2 d 1 however for some specific days or seasons the denitrification rates were expected to be much higher piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 for example laursen and seitzinger 2002 quantified the denitrification rate for several days across the year and concluded that the rate could be as low as 6 5 mmol n m 2 d 1 but also can surge to 379 mmol n m 2 d 1 similarly mccutchan et al 2003 documented that the denitrification rates in the south platte river of the us can reach as much as 380 mmol n m 2 d 1 which is almost double our reported rate in the taihu lake basin where the studied wetland is located the estimates derived from sediment core incubation showed that the denitrification rates in 21 high order rivers of the basin typically ranged within 0 7 15 6 mmol n m 2 d 1 which is much lower than our snapshot estimate irrespective of different uncertainties and errors among methods significant gaps in reported denitrification rates across and within systems are possible because the environmental conditions that the systems can offer for metabolisms could highly differ across space and time for example the 21 rivers in taihu lake basin are much larger and had no wetlands which could be inferior in denitrification denitrification rates in riverine wetlands have also been investigated batson et al 2012 mander et al 2021 however most of them utilized the acetylene inhibition technique to measure denitrification which has been well documented to downplay the denitrification potentials groffman et al 2006 the reported rates were even lower than in most of the rivers as outlined above lowrance et al 1995 smith et al 2000 song et al 2014 up to now as far as we know direct determination of denitrification using the n2 ar method has not been extended to riverine wetlands this calls for more applications of such direct and sensitive methods as have been presented here to better reveal the diel n processes in wetlands a type of ecosystem that is widely characterized as biogeochemical hotspots reddy et al 2009 5 conclusions the purpose of the current study was to determine the hourly variability of denitrification in a flow through riverine wetland and to discern its main controls we have developed a simple model to quantify denitrification rates based on pairwise measurements of dissolved n2 concentrations at the wetland s inlet and outlet our results confirmed that denitrification is time varying exhibiting obvious day and night differences the highest rate occurred at midnight while the lowest rate was reported in the late afternoon the mean denitrification rate during the night reached 12 34 mmol m 2h 1 which is 3 times greater than during the daytime such a variation can be explained by diel cycles in do and redox conditions it should be acknowledged that our snapshot quantification of hourly denitrification is somewhat incomplete and should only serve as a starting point for further investigations of the changing natures of n removal in wetlands it remains unclear whether denitrification also varies across hours during other periods such as when aquatic plants were absent and or when hydrological conditions were different thus more estimations that can take advantage of the whole system method as proposed here or other advanced methods during different periods would help us to establish a complete picture of the changing nature of denitrification in riverine wetlands further efforts should also focus on the control mechanisms behind the time immediate denitrification process to better expand our understanding of n cycling in wetland ecosystems and to form

2183,hysteresis loop models are one of the most common and effective tools for quantifying time scale dynamics of sediment discharge relationships these models can successfully characterize sediment dynamics in watersheds and facilitate developing effective measures to manage sediment discharge resources considering the characteristics of a proportional hysteresis index an improved differential hysteresis index was developed the improved model was used to quantify typical patterns of monthly sediment discharge relationships in six karst watersheds in southwest china during 2003 2019 partial least squares structural equation modeling was conducted to decouple the effects of climatic factors and vegetation extent on the hysteresis index the results indicate that clockwise hysteresis accounted for 74 of the total hysteresis occurring in the watersheds whereas counterclockwise and 8 shaped hysteresis accounted for only 22 and 3 9 respectively the improved hysteresis index varied from 10 to 10 effectively reflecting the degree of hysteresis occurring in the watersheds partial least squares structural equation modeling shows that climatic factors e g temperature and precipitation and vegetation extent in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang watersheds explained 50 75 of the hysteresis between sediment concentration and water discharge the combined effect of temperature and precipitation on the hysteresis index was larger than that of vegetation extent the improved differential hysteresis index proposed in this study effectively extended the applicability of differential hysteresis indices and facilitated comparing the degree of hysteresis among watersheds with different sediment concentrations this study can improve the understanding of sediment sources and transport pathways and provide valuable information for decision making on soil erosion control in karst watersheds keywords soil erosion sediment discharge relationship improved differential hysteresis index karst watersheds data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction variations in the relationships between sediment concentration qs and water

water discharge and sediment concentration variations in the characteristics of the qs q relationship are commonly and effectively analyzed using hysteresis loops lenzi and marchi 2000 an improved understanding of hysteresis loop types and their quantification can provide a valuable approach to deducing possible contributing source areas and flow paths contributing to sediment transport in watersheds hartmann et al 2014 smith et al 2017 this can also provide a scientific basis for sustainable development of watershed ecology and macro decision making on discharge and sediment regulation gutiérrez et al 2014 de girolamo et al 2015 brandt et al 2018 generally there are four main types of hysteresis loops clockwise counterclockwise 8 shaped and non hysteretic loops seeger et al 2004 clockwise hysteresis loops tend to occur during heavy rainfall or flooding events and generally change with seasons xu 2004 de girolamo et al 2015 when sediment supply is limited to areas near watershed outlets a clockwise hysteresis may only occur under heavier rainfall seeger et al 2004 counterclockwise hysteresis loops generally occur in areas with uneven rainfall distribution and erodible soils are transported by heavy rain for long periods buendia et al 2016 8 shaped hysteresis loops occur much less frequently than clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis loops 8 shaped

hysteresis loop into the rising and falling limbs with a line from the point of the maximum discharge to the point of the end of the discharge at right angles to this line they measured the maximum

a more effective method i e a normalized index hinew hinew can better describe the hysteresis loop in some cases however although hinew can improve the accuracy of describing the degree of hysteresis there are still some limitations for watersheds with different sediment concentrations qs q relationships are influenced by various factors such as soil properties topography and geomorphology climatic environment and human activities wei et al 2007 in a given watershed soil properties and topography are typically considered relatively constant in the short term whereas climatic factors vegetation extent and human activities are the main drivers of variations in the qs q relationship marques et al 2007 shi et al 2014 feng et al 2016b wang et al 2016 similarly klein 1984 found that hysteresis is influenced by factors besides sediment sources including watershed size rainfall and soil moisture in reality climatic factors and vegetation extent have complex effects on the qs q relationship pruski and nearing 2002 changes in precipitation and vegetation can directly affect discharge and sediment nearing et al 2005 furthermore precipitation can indirectly affect discharge generation and sediment concentration through its ability to improve plant growth seeger et al 2004 ran et al 2013 additionally karst watersheds are featured by shallow soil layers overlying highly irregular epikarst surfaces and having a high infiltration capacity gutiérrez et al 2014 brandt et al 2018 a part of the precipitation can rapidly drain to recharge groundwater via numerous conduits fissures and fractures thus greatly influencing the hydrological and sediment transport process hartmann et al 2014 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b in karst areas landscapes are highly heterogeneous due to fragmented ecological spaces and discontinuously distributed soil suitable for vegetation ye et al 2022 these highly heterogeneous landscapes can affect the hydrological and sediment connectivity and thus greatly influence sediment yield li et al 2019 therefore the effect of climatic factors and vegetation extent on sediment yield in karst areas may be significantly different from those in non karst areas furthermore previous studies have explored the effects of climatic factors precipitation and temperature and vegetation on water discharge or sediment concentration however the extent of their effects on hysteresis loops has rarely been studied therefore it is crucial to understand the influence of environmental factors on the qs q relationship this can help decision makers to make better choices regarding water resource management and sediment transport regulation in karst watersheds to address the above shortcomings an improved differential hysteresis index hik was proposed in this study this index was used to evaluate the hysteresis degree of qs q in karst watersheds the effects of climatic factors and vegetation extent on this improved index were decoupled using partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is located in the wujiang and xijiang river watersheds in southwest china with typical karst widely distributed landscapes fig 1 a the exposed karst coverage in the wujiang and xijiang watersheds was approximately 77 and 44 respectively fig 2 the wujiang river originates from xiang mountain in weining county at the eastern foot of wumeng mountain in western guizhou province from upstream to downstream the elevation of the wujiang watershed decreases from 2888 m in the west to 113 m in the east most of the wujiang river watershed has a mid subtropical monsoon climate with distinct seasonality the annual average temperature and rainfall range between 13 and 18 c and 1061 1300 mm

stations draining these watersheds 3 methods 3 1 hysteresis loops the hysteretic characteristics of the qs q relationship can be used to explain sediment transport in a clockwise hysteresis loop sediment concentration peaks occur earlier than discharge peaks williams 1989 rovira and batalla 2006 in a counterclockwise hysteresis loop sediment concentration peaks occur later than discharge peaks klein 1984 an 8 shaped hysteresis loop is a combination of clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis seeger et al 2004 non hysteretic indicates that sediment concentration and discharge reach their peaks almost simultaneously and change in the same proportion before and after their peaks 3 2 proportional hysteresis index hila to evaluate the degree of hysteresis lawler et al 2006 initially quantified the degree of qs q hysteresis and proposed a hysteresis index himid himid was derived from the sediment concentration corresponding to the median discharge in the rising and falling sections of discharge for clockwise hysteresis 1 hi mid c rmid c fmid 1 for counterclockwise hysteresis 2 hi mid 1 c rmid c fmid 1 where crmid and cfmid denote the sediment concentration corresponding to the median point of discharge i e the 50 position in the rising and falling stages respectively due to the limitations of using only data corresponding to median discharge points to quantify the degree of hysteresis lawler et al 2006 improved himid they proposed that hi should be calculated by finding the average hysteresis indices corresponding to 10 interval discharge values in multiple increments of discharge intervals over the range of discharge variations following the 10 increment requirement the proportional hysteresis index is calculated as 3 hi la i 1 9 hi lai 9 i 1 9 where i denotes the 10 rising and falling interval discharges i 1 9 3 3 differential hysteresis index hinew the proportional hysteresis index hila can accurately reflect hysteresis characteristics but it also has certain drawbacks the proportional hysteresis index calculated from the same shape hysteresis loop can also produce different results at different sediment concentrations to prevent inaccurate description of hysteresis characteristics by hila due to differences in sediment concentration lloyd et al 2016a proposed the differential hysteresis index hinew by determining the difference between sediment concentration in the rising and falling sections of discharge 4 hi newi c ri c fi i 1 9 5 hi new i 1 9 hi newi 9 where cri and cfi are sediment concentrations relating to the rising and falling stages respectively when hysteresis occurs in different watersheds or because of different events the loops show similar shapes but sediment concentrations vary the differential hysteresis index can better quantify the hysteresis degree than the proportional hysteresis index as shown in fig 3 a hysteresis loops a and b were identically shaped we compared the quantification methods of these two hysteresis loops using data from the median point of discharge the comparison shows that hysteresis loop a was quantified as hilamida 0 6 and hinewmida 3 using the proportional and differential hysteresis index algorithms respectively similarly hysteresis loop b was quantified as hilamidb 3 and hinewmidb 3 the differential hysteresis index outperformed the proportional hysteresis index in describing the shape of the hysteresis loop fig 3b shows a standard hysteresis loop diagram where data points at 25 and 75 discharge were used to compare the differences between the two methods of quantifying the hysteresis index at the 25 point of discharge hila25 3 5 and hinew25 0 35 at the 75 point of discharge hila75 0 875 and hinewc75 0 35 the proportional hysteresis index varied widely across different discharge points whereas the differential hysteresis index was relatively stable this indicates that hi new was more consistent and stable in describing the characteristics of the hysteresis loop 3 4 improved differential hysteresis index hik although the differential hysteresis index can describe the characteristics of hysteresis loops more accurately it still has some limitations when the shapes of hysteresis loops are similar and the orders of magnitude of sediment concentration are different this index shows larger variations than the proportional hysteresis index the proportional hysteresis index eliminates the influence of the original data unit and the orders of magnitude through proportional transformation making the data of different orders of magnitude comparable we develop an improved differential hysteresis index hik by combining the features of the proportional hysteresis index with the optimization of the differential hysteresis index hik is based on the differential hysteresis index divided by the orders of magnitude of sediment concentrations 6 hi ki c ri c fi k i 1 9 7 hi k i 1 9 hi k 9 where k is the orders of magnitude of sediment concentrations k 0 001 0 01 0 1 1 10 in fig 3 hysteresis loops c and d were similar in shape but different in orders of magnitude of sediment concentrations the two quantification methods hi new and hi k were compared using data on the median points of discharge the quantification results were for hysteresis loop c hinewmidc 3 and hikmidc 3 for hysteresis loop d hinewmidd 0 3 and hikmidd 3 the improved differential hysteresis index extended the application of the differential hysteresis index hence it was used to quantify the degree of hysteresis in each watershed in this study 3 5 pls sem the advantage of pls sem over the single equation technique pls is that sem enables the simultaneous estimation of the relationship between multiple independent and dependent variables venturini and mehmetoglu 2019 therefore in a broad sense we can refer to sem as a simultaneous multi equation estimation model in this research the degree of interaction effects between hysteresis indices and environmental factors was determined via pls sem pls sem is based on sample covariance matrices and can decouple the complex relationships between response and explanatory variables using iterative solutions of one or multiple linear regressions esposito vinzi et al 2010 the path coefficient β and the coefficient of determination r 2 in this model enable the assessment of the explanatory power of a structural model β represents the degree of a response variable relative to that of an explanatory variable equivalent to the standardized regression coefficient facilitating testing the direction and strength of a causal link grace et al 2012 in a linear system direct effects are fully determined by corresponding path coefficients indirect paths between variables involve intermediate variables the total effect describes the net relationship between variables and is the sum of direct and indirect effects r 2 represents the goodness of fit of pls sem r 2 reflects its predictive accuracy and ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 10 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 denoting insignificant weak moderate and high fit respectively leguina 2015 climatic factors precipitation temperature and pet and vegetation evi and ndvi variables were selected to test their effects on hik we formulated the following hypothetical pathways the amount of precipitation can directly influence the magnitude of sediment concentration and discharge it also indirectly affects the qs q relationship and the hysteresis index through its effect on vegetation cover seeger et al 2004 zhu 2013 temperature and pet affect the magnitude of discharge and sediment concentration and indirectly affect the qs q relationship through their effects on vegetation cover xu et al 2013 ye et al 2022 huang et al 2019 vegetation cover affects rainfall distribution and the mechanisms of discharge and sediment yield through surface cover and subsurface roots thereby influencing the qs q relationship in a watershed and thus the hysteresis index fu et al 2009 4 results 4 1 variations in monthly stream discharge and sediment concentration fig 4 shows the temporal variations in discharge levels and sediment concentrations in the six watersheds xunjiang hongshui yujiang liujiang nanpan and wujiang from 2003 to 2019 the temporal patterns of monthly sediment concentration were similar during 2003 2019 discharge peaks occurred primarily from june to august whereas the lowest discharge tended to occur from november to february the three months with the highest sediment concentration were june july and august during which rainfall was abundant sediment concentrations in the spring march may and the winter december february of each year were relatively low 4 2 hysteresis patterns and indices the hysteresis loops corresponding to the qs q relationship for certain periods in the xunjiang watershed were used as an example fig 5 table s1 shows the years with hysteresis occurring in the other watersheds and the corresponding types of hysteresis loops the degree of hysteresis was quantified and analyzed using the improved differential hysteresis index in most cases 74 the qs q relationship was characterized by clockwise hysteresis on a monthly scale counterclockwise and 8 shaped hysteresis accounted for only 22 and 3 9 of the total hysteresis respectively table s1 the hysteresis index and the sediment concentration of the nanpan watershed were relatively higher a higher degree of hysteresis only occurred in 2008 and 2009 for the liujiang watershed and in 2011 2015 and 2016 for the yujiang watershed the hysteresis indices of the xunjiang hongshui and wujiang watersheds were relatively lower ranging from 1 to 1 4 3 factors influencing hysteresis to quantify the influence of climatic factors and vegetation extent on the hysteresis index pls sem was constructed fig 6 the analysis results show that climatic factors can affect the hysteresis index directly and indirectly through vegetation coefficients therefore the total effects of climatic factors on the hysteresis index is a combination of direct and indirect effects for example in the xunjiang watershed climatic factors had a significant direct impact on vegetation coefficients β 0 735 and the total impact of climatic factors on the hysteresis index was 0 37 ndvi 0 7 and evi 0 68 were the most influential variables followed by temperature 0 36 and precipitation 0 31 table 2 shows the path coefficients of the total influence of climatic and vegetation factors on the hysteresis index of each watershed the total influence was extensive in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang watersheds particularly vegetation significantly affected the hysteresis index in the xunjiang hongshui and nanpan watersheds the coefficients of correlation between the hysteresis index and the climatic and vegetation factors in hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang were greater than 50 indicating that the climatic and vegetation conditions in these watersheds significantly explained the hysteresis variability in these areas in these watersheds the influence of climatic factors on the hysteresis index also considerably exceeded that of vegetation temperature and precipitation posed relatively large total effects on the hysteresis index in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang watersheds in addition the index in the liujiang river watershed was also strongly influenced by pet the core factors affecting the hysteresis index in the wujiang watershed were temperature 0 66 and precipitation 0 62 the coefficients of correlation between the hysteresis index and the climatic factors were relatively low in the xunjiang and nanpan watersheds 5 discussion 5 1 hysteresis types this study analyzed the qs q hysteresis in the six karst watersheds in southwest china and decoupled the effects of climatic factors and vegetation extent on the proposed hysteresis index from 2003 to 2019 the qs q relationship was primarily represented by clockwise hysteresis loops clockwise hysteresis loops accounted for 74 of the total hysteresis occurring in the study areas followed by counterclockwise hysteresis 22 and 8 shaped hysteresis loops 3 9 these results suggest that the qs q relationship in karst watersheds was dominated by clockwise hysteresis with a sediment storage release cycle occurring on a monthly time scale duncan et al 2017 the xunjiang hongshui yujiang liujiang and nanpanjiang watersheds were all dominated by clockwise hysteresis in winter and spring after alternating activities e g human activities material weathering and freeze thaw most of the sediments may come from adjacent areas close to the gauging stations fortesa et al 2020 in summer and early autumn when precipitation is relatively high a large amount of sediment deposited on the slopes and bed of the river begins to be released and transported downstream leading to a clockwise hysteresis loop zabaleta et al 2007 the proportion of counterclockwise hysteresis loops in the liujiang and wujiang watersheds was high this may be related to abundant rainfall high humidity many tributaries and considerable sediment sources away from the main discharge generating areas in these areas when the entire watershed generates discharge these sediments are likely scattered in the tributaries or sedimentation areas near the river channels that converge into the watershed outlet thus counterclockwise hysteresis tends to occur pietroń et al 2015 the concentrated arable land and dense population in the liujiang and wujiang watersheds may also considerably influence the sediment concentration capacity of the watersheds thus producing a counterclockwise hysteresis in the qs q relationship the yujiang and nanpan watersheds exhibited more clockwise hysteresis loops due to more sediment near the observation sites and relatively high water discharge in summer in these two watersheds 5 2 factors influencing hysteresis index pls sem indicates that the climatic variables in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang watersheds explained 50 75 of the degree of the qs q hysteresis the climatic factors also posed a more pronounced effect on the hysteresis degree than the vegetation index in these watersheds the hongshui and yujiang watersheds were dominated by clockwise hysteresis with most sediment likely strongly attached to the area near the watershed outlet during fall and winter at the onset of summer as rainfall and temperature changed nearby sediment converged into the watershed outlet sediment concentration changed more significantly relative to discharge in early summer thus causing clockwise hysteresis the liujiang river the second largest tributary of the xijiang river and the wujiang river the largest river in guizhou are sizable in area and volume sediment is spread throughout the surrounding rivers connected to the watershed during the storage period in fall and winter because of the high regional humidity and continuous sediment sinking relatively far from the watershed outlet thus counterclockwise hysteresis occurs however the hysteresis index generally showed insignificant correlations with the climatic factors and vegetation extent in the xunjiang and nanpan watersheds in these two watersheds some human activities also had a crucial influence on the sediment storage and release processes wang and hejazi 2011 xu et al 2013 hartmann et al 2014 specifically developing arable land and implementing water conservancy projects in the xunjiang and nanpan watersheds greatly affected sediment distribution and the sediment concentration rate and intensity feng et al 2016a li et al 2019 furthermore the dams built in nanpan and xunjiang karst watersheds in recent years have caused a significant reduction in sediment concentration dai et al 2008 li et al 2019 this may also reduce the effect of climatic factors and vegetation extent on the hysteresis index however this study has some limitations generally the grain size distribution variation may also significantly influence the qs q relationship skolasinska 2014 pietroń et al 2015 the hysteretic effect decreases with an increase in grain size the effects of grainsize distribution on hysteretic sediment transport depend on time varying rainfall cheraghi et al 2016 further studies are needed to investigate the effect of grain size distribution on the qs q relationship in karst watersheds this will facilitate a more in depth understanding of sediment transport 6 conclusions we proposed an improved hysteresis loop model to investigate the monthly qs q hysteresis characteristics of the six karst watersheds from 2003 to 2019 the results indicate that the monthly qs q relationship was mainly characterized by clockwise hysteresis accounting for 74 of the total hysteresis counterclockwise and 8 shaped hysteresis accounted for 22 and 3 9 respectively the improved index combined the advantages of the differential and proportional hysteresis indices and extended the applicability of the differential hysteresis index to compare the degree of hysteresis between watersheds with different sediment concentrations pls sem shows that climatic factors explained more than 50 of the changes in the hysteresis index and posed larger effects than vegetation on the index in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang karst watersheds the hysteresis index was insignificantly correlated with climatic factors and vegetation indices in the xunjiang and nanpan karst watersheds the improved differential hysteresis index may serve as a useful and effective approach to evaluating the degree of hysteresis and can advance a more in depth understanding of sediment transport processes in karst watersheds pls sem can also decompose the coupled relationship between predictors and hysteresis indices in different watersheds credit authorship contribution statement

2183,hysteresis loop models are one of the most common and effective tools for quantifying time scale dynamics of sediment discharge relationships these models can successfully characterize sediment dynamics in watersheds and facilitate developing effective measures to manage sediment discharge resources considering the characteristics of a proportional hysteresis index an improved differential hysteresis index was developed the improved model was used to quantify typical patterns of monthly sediment discharge relationships in six karst watersheds in southwest china during 2003 2019 partial least squares structural equation modeling was conducted to decouple the effects of climatic factors and vegetation extent on the hysteresis index the results indicate that clockwise hysteresis accounted for 74 of the total hysteresis occurring in the watersheds whereas counterclockwise and 8 shaped hysteresis accounted for only 22 and 3 9 respectively the improved hysteresis index varied from 10 to 10 effectively reflecting the degree of hysteresis occurring in the watersheds partial least squares structural equation modeling shows that climatic factors e g temperature and precipitation and vegetation extent in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang watersheds explained 50 75 of the hysteresis between sediment concentration and water discharge the combined effect of temperature and precipitation on the hysteresis index was larger than that of vegetation extent the improved differential hysteresis index proposed in this study effectively extended the applicability of differential hysteresis indices and facilitated comparing the degree of hysteresis among watersheds with different sediment concentrations this study can improve the understanding of sediment sources and transport pathways and provide valuable information for decision making on soil erosion control in karst watersheds keywords soil erosion sediment discharge relationship improved

water discharge and sediment concentration variations in the characteristics of the qs q relationship are commonly and effectively analyzed using hysteresis loops lenzi and marchi 2000 an improved understanding of hysteresis loop types and their quantification can provide a valuable approach to deducing possible contributing source areas and flow paths contributing to sediment transport in watersheds hartmann et al 2014 smith et al 2017 this can also provide a scientific basis for sustainable development of watershed ecology and macro decision making on discharge and sediment regulation

sediment concentration peaks occur earlier than discharge peaks williams 1989 rovira and batalla 2006 in a counterclockwise hysteresis loop sediment concentration peaks occur later than discharge peaks klein 1984 an 8 shaped hysteresis loop is a combination of clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis seeger et al 2004 non hysteretic indicates that sediment concentration and discharge reach their peaks almost simultaneously and change in the same proportion before and after their peaks 3 2 proportional hysteresis index hila to evaluate the degree of hysteresis lawler et al 2006 initially quantified the degree of qs q hysteresis and proposed a hysteresis index himid himid was derived from the sediment concentration corresponding to the median discharge in the rising and falling sections of discharge for clockwise hysteresis 1 hi mid c rmid c fmid 1 for counterclockwise hysteresis 2 hi mid 1 c rmid c fmid 1 where crmid and cfmid denote the sediment concentration corresponding to the median point of discharge i e the 50 position in the rising and falling stages respectively due to the limitations of using only data corresponding to median discharge points to quantify the degree of hysteresis lawler et al 2006 improved himid they proposed that hi should be calculated by finding the average hysteresis indices corresponding to 10 interval discharge values in multiple increments of discharge intervals over the range of discharge variations following the 10 increment requirement the proportional hysteresis index is calculated as 3 hi la i 1 9 hi lai 9 i 1 9 where i denotes the 10 rising and falling interval discharges i 1 9 3 3 differential hysteresis index hinew the proportional hysteresis index hila can accurately reflect hysteresis characteristics but it also has certain drawbacks the proportional hysteresis index calculated from the same shape hysteresis loop can also produce different results at different sediment concentrations to prevent inaccurate description of hysteresis characteristics by hila due to differences in sediment concentration lloyd et al 2016a proposed the differential hysteresis index hinew by determining the difference between sediment concentration in the rising and falling sections of discharge 4 hi newi c ri c fi i 1 9 5 hi new i 1 9 hi newi 9 where cri and cfi are sediment concentrations relating to the rising and falling stages respectively when hysteresis occurs in different watersheds or because of different events the loops show similar shapes but sediment concentrations vary the differential hysteresis index can better quantify the hysteresis degree than the proportional hysteresis index as shown in fig 3 a hysteresis loops a and b were identically shaped we compared the quantification methods of these two hysteresis loops using data from the median point of discharge the comparison shows that hysteresis loop a was quantified as hilamida 0 6 and hinewmida 3 using the proportional and differential hysteresis index algorithms respectively similarly hysteresis loop b was quantified as hilamidb 3 and hinewmidb 3 the differential hysteresis index outperformed the proportional hysteresis index in describing the shape of the hysteresis loop fig 3b shows a standard hysteresis loop diagram where data points at 25 and 75 discharge were used to compare the differences between the two methods of quantifying the hysteresis index at the 25 point of discharge hila25 3 5 and hinew25 0 35 at the 75 point of discharge hila75 0 875 and hinewc75 0 35 the proportional hysteresis index varied widely across different discharge points whereas the differential hysteresis index was relatively stable this indicates that hi new was more consistent and stable in describing the characteristics of the hysteresis loop 3 4 improved differential hysteresis index hik although the differential hysteresis index can describe the characteristics of hysteresis loops more accurately it still has some limitations when the shapes of hysteresis loops are similar and the orders of magnitude of sediment concentration are different this index shows larger variations than the proportional hysteresis index the proportional hysteresis index eliminates the influence of the original data unit and the orders of magnitude through proportional transformation making the data of different orders of magnitude comparable we develop an improved differential hysteresis index hik by combining the features of the proportional hysteresis index with the optimization of the differential hysteresis index hik is based on the differential hysteresis index divided by the orders of magnitude of sediment concentrations 6 hi ki c ri c fi k i 1 9 7 hi k i 1 9 hi k 9 where k is the orders of magnitude of sediment concentrations k 0 001 0 01 0 1 1 10 in fig 3 hysteresis loops c and d were similar in shape but different in orders of magnitude of sediment concentrations the two quantification methods hi new and hi k were compared using data on the median points of discharge the quantification results were for hysteresis loop c hinewmidc 3 and hikmidc 3 for hysteresis loop d hinewmidd 0 3 and hikmidd 3 the improved differential hysteresis index extended the application of the differential hysteresis index hence it was used to quantify the degree of hysteresis in each watershed in this study 3 5 pls sem the advantage of pls sem over the single equation technique pls is that sem enables the simultaneous estimation of the relationship between multiple independent and dependent variables venturini and mehmetoglu 2019 therefore in a broad sense we can refer to sem as a simultaneous multi equation estimation model in this research the degree of interaction effects between hysteresis indices and environmental factors was determined via pls sem pls sem is based on sample covariance matrices and can decouple the complex relationships between response and explanatory variables using iterative solutions of one or multiple linear regressions esposito vinzi et al 2010 the path coefficient β and the coefficient of determination r 2 in this model enable the assessment of the explanatory power of a structural model β represents the degree of a response variable relative to that of an explanatory variable equivalent to the standardized regression coefficient facilitating testing the direction and strength of a causal link grace et al 2012 in a linear system direct effects are fully determined by corresponding path coefficients indirect paths between variables involve intermediate variables the total effect describes the net relationship between variables and is the sum of direct and indirect effects r 2 represents the goodness of fit of pls sem r 2 reflects its predictive accuracy and ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 10 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 denoting insignificant weak moderate and high fit respectively leguina 2015 climatic factors precipitation temperature and pet and vegetation evi and ndvi variables were selected to test their effects on hik we formulated the following hypothetical pathways the amount of precipitation can directly influence the magnitude of sediment concentration and discharge it also indirectly affects the qs q relationship and the hysteresis index through its effect on vegetation cover seeger et al 2004 zhu 2013 temperature and pet affect the magnitude of discharge and sediment concentration and indirectly affect the qs q relationship through their effects on vegetation cover xu et al 2013 ye et al 2022 huang et al 2019 vegetation cover affects rainfall distribution and the mechanisms of discharge and sediment yield through surface cover and subsurface roots thereby influencing the qs q relationship in a watershed and thus the hysteresis index fu et al 2009 4 results 4 1 variations in monthly stream discharge and sediment concentration fig 4 shows the temporal variations in discharge levels and sediment concentrations in the six watersheds xunjiang hongshui yujiang liujiang nanpan and wujiang from 2003 to 2019 the temporal patterns of monthly sediment concentration were similar during 2003 2019 discharge peaks occurred primarily from june to august whereas the lowest discharge tended to occur from november to february the three months with the highest sediment concentration were june july and august during which rainfall was abundant sediment concentrations in the spring march may and the winter december february of each year were relatively low 4 2 hysteresis patterns and indices the hysteresis loops corresponding to the qs q relationship for certain periods in the xunjiang watershed were used as an example fig 5 table s1 shows the years with hysteresis occurring in the other watersheds and the corresponding types of hysteresis loops the degree of hysteresis was quantified and analyzed using the improved differential hysteresis index in most cases 74 the qs q relationship was characterized by clockwise hysteresis on a monthly scale counterclockwise and 8 shaped hysteresis accounted for only 22 and 3 9 of the total hysteresis respectively table s1 the hysteresis index and the sediment concentration of the nanpan watershed were relatively higher a higher degree of hysteresis only occurred in 2008 and 2009 for the liujiang watershed and in 2011 2015 and 2016 for the yujiang watershed the hysteresis indices of the xunjiang hongshui and wujiang watersheds were relatively lower ranging from 1 to 1 4 3 factors influencing hysteresis to quantify the influence of climatic factors and vegetation extent on the hysteresis index pls sem was constructed fig 6 the analysis results show that climatic factors can affect the hysteresis index directly and indirectly through vegetation coefficients therefore the total effects of climatic factors on the hysteresis index is a combination of direct and indirect effects for example in the xunjiang watershed climatic factors had a significant direct impact on vegetation coefficients β 0 735 and the total impact of climatic factors on the hysteresis index was 0 37 ndvi 0 7 and evi 0 68 were the most influential variables followed by temperature 0 36 and precipitation 0 31 table 2 shows the path coefficients of the total influence of climatic and vegetation factors on the hysteresis index of each watershed the total influence was extensive in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang watersheds particularly vegetation significantly affected the hysteresis index in the xunjiang hongshui and nanpan watersheds the coefficients of correlation between the hysteresis index and the climatic and vegetation factors in hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang were greater than 50 indicating that the climatic and vegetation conditions in these watersheds significantly explained the hysteresis variability in these areas in these watersheds the influence of climatic factors on the hysteresis index also considerably exceeded that of vegetation temperature and precipitation posed relatively large total effects on the hysteresis index in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang watersheds in addition the index in the liujiang river watershed was also strongly influenced by pet the core factors affecting the hysteresis index in the wujiang watershed were temperature 0 66 and precipitation 0 62 the coefficients of correlation between the hysteresis index and the climatic factors were relatively low in the xunjiang and nanpan watersheds 5 discussion 5 1 hysteresis types this study analyzed the qs q hysteresis in the six karst watersheds in southwest china and decoupled the effects of climatic factors and vegetation extent on the proposed hysteresis index from 2003 to 2019 the qs q relationship was primarily represented by clockwise hysteresis loops clockwise hysteresis loops accounted for 74 of the total hysteresis occurring in the study areas followed by counterclockwise hysteresis 22 and 8 shaped hysteresis loops 3 9 these results suggest that the qs q relationship in karst watersheds was dominated by clockwise hysteresis with a sediment storage release cycle occurring on a monthly time scale duncan et al 2017 the xunjiang hongshui yujiang liujiang and nanpanjiang watersheds were all dominated by clockwise hysteresis in winter and spring after alternating activities e g human activities material weathering and freeze thaw most of the sediments may come from adjacent areas close to the gauging stations fortesa et al 2020 in summer and early autumn when precipitation is relatively high a large amount of sediment deposited on the slopes and bed of the river begins to be released and transported downstream leading to a clockwise hysteresis loop zabaleta et al 2007 the proportion of counterclockwise hysteresis loops in the liujiang and wujiang watersheds was high this may be related to abundant rainfall high humidity many tributaries and considerable sediment sources away from the main discharge generating areas in these areas when the entire watershed generates discharge these sediments are likely scattered in the tributaries or sedimentation areas near the river channels that converge into the watershed outlet thus counterclockwise hysteresis tends to occur pietroń et al 2015 the concentrated arable land and dense population in the liujiang and wujiang watersheds may also considerably influence the sediment concentration capacity of the watersheds thus producing a counterclockwise hysteresis in the qs q relationship the yujiang and nanpan watersheds exhibited more clockwise hysteresis loops due to more sediment near the observation sites and relatively high water discharge in summer in these two watersheds 5 2 factors influencing hysteresis index pls sem indicates that the climatic variables in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang watersheds explained 50 75 of the degree of the qs q hysteresis the climatic factors also posed a more pronounced effect on the hysteresis degree than the vegetation index in these watersheds the hongshui and yujiang watersheds were dominated by clockwise hysteresis with most sediment likely strongly attached to the area near the watershed outlet during fall and winter at the onset of summer as rainfall and temperature changed nearby sediment converged into the watershed outlet sediment concentration changed more significantly relative to discharge in early summer thus causing clockwise hysteresis the liujiang river the second largest tributary of the xijiang river and the wujiang river the largest river in guizhou are sizable in area and volume sediment is spread throughout the surrounding rivers connected to the watershed during the storage period in fall and winter because of the high regional humidity and continuous sediment sinking relatively far from the watershed outlet thus counterclockwise hysteresis occurs however the hysteresis index generally showed insignificant correlations with the climatic factors and vegetation extent in the xunjiang and nanpan watersheds in these two watersheds some human activities also had a crucial influence on the sediment storage and release processes wang and hejazi 2011 xu et al 2013 hartmann et al 2014 specifically developing arable land and implementing water conservancy projects in the xunjiang and nanpan watersheds greatly affected sediment distribution and the sediment concentration rate and intensity feng et al 2016a li et al 2019 furthermore the dams built in nanpan and xunjiang karst watersheds in recent years have caused a significant reduction in sediment concentration dai et al 2008 li et al 2019 this may also reduce the effect of climatic factors and vegetation extent on the hysteresis index however this study has some limitations generally the grain size distribution variation may also significantly influence the qs q relationship skolasinska 2014 pietroń et al 2015 the hysteretic effect decreases with an increase in grain size the effects of grainsize distribution on hysteretic sediment transport depend on time varying rainfall cheraghi et al 2016 further studies are needed to investigate the effect of grain size distribution on the qs q relationship in karst watersheds this will facilitate a more in depth understanding of sediment transport 6 conclusions we proposed an improved hysteresis loop model to investigate the monthly qs q hysteresis characteristics of the six karst watersheds from 2003 to 2019 the results indicate that the monthly qs q relationship was mainly characterized by clockwise hysteresis accounting for 74 of the total hysteresis counterclockwise and 8 shaped hysteresis accounted for 22 and 3 9 respectively the improved index combined the advantages of the differential and proportional hysteresis indices and extended the applicability of the differential hysteresis index to compare the degree of hysteresis between watersheds with different sediment concentrations pls sem shows that climatic factors explained more than 50 of the changes in the hysteresis index and posed larger effects than vegetation on the index in the hongshui yujiang liujiang and wujiang karst watersheds the hysteresis index was insignificantly correlated with climatic factors and vegetation indices in the xunjiang and nanpan karst watersheds the improved differential hysteresis index may serve as a useful and effective approach to evaluating the degree of hysteresis and can advance a more in depth understanding of sediment transport processes in karst watersheds pls sem can also decompose the coupled relationship between predictors and hysteresis indices in different watersheds credit authorship contribution statement

2184,the firm output usually determined in the design stage of a hydroplant to serve as a threshold to measure system reliability can be regarded as an unknown parameter to be explored to its maximum in long term hydropower reservoir operation lhro an unknown firm output to be ensured at certain reliability however will make the problem much more nonlinear and then complicate the modeling this work presents a stochastic linear programming slp 1 model that can explicitly incorporate reliability in ensuring an unknown firm output to be maximized by using a probability variable to represent a decision at a state and introducing binary variables to decide whether the decision will ensure the unknown firm output the present slp 1 is improved on 1 another previous slp model slp 0 that must have a firm output prespecified at certain reliability and compared with 2 the stochastic dynamic programming sdp model that can only manage to estimate the firm output at a reliability with trial and

generation 1 introduction as one of the most sustainable and clean sources hydropower plays an essential role in achieving low carbon emissions for environmental and ecological benefits kuriqi et al 2019 suwal et al 2020 obviously reliability vulnerability and resilience are the three criteria most commonly used to evaluate the influence of hydropower production on the environment economy and society jaramillo et al 2018 simonovic and arunkumar 2016 among them reliability is one of the critical criteria to evaluate the functional quality of a system and so it is in hydropower reservoir systems where the long term hydropower reservoir operation lhro plays a vital role in reservoir management providing not only an overall view of hydropower operation in a long term perspective but also offering a water consumption target and boundary conditions for short term hydropower operation tan et al 2020 the reliability defined as the probability of not violating the required operation state by loucks and van beek 2017c can be measured as the frequency of a system in a satisfactory state during an extended period in this context the reliability can be estimated with a series of samples generated by monte carlo simulation koutsoyiannis 2005 or to relieve the computational burden with the first order reliability method based on physical interpretations ganji and jowkarshorijeh 2012 maier et al 2001 however it is very challenging if not impossible for an optimization model to incorporate these procedures when seeking the optimal operational policy the reliability is sometimes simplified as the firm output to be achieved whenever possible in the lhro the firm output estimated as the average output in critical adverse hydrological periods was used by liu et al 2018 as a criterion to evaluate the reliability and the failure of a cascade hydropower system by utilizing the lagrangian duality theory and penalty function paudyal et al 1990 adopted incremental dynamic programming idp to maximize the expected annual energy production subject to a prespecified monthly firm power output mujumdar and nirmala 2007 developed a bayesian stochastic dynamic programming bsdp model to derive operational policies for minimizing the performance measurement represented by the expected value of the squared deviation of the total power generated from the total yield committed to all these works treated the firm output as a given target usually determined in the design stage of hydropower stations to be achieved in operation the firm output should be achieved at a certain reliability allowing failures in meeting the target handling the constraints of meeting the firm output at a specific reliability however has never been an easy task in the lhro due to the complexity of randomness and the nonlinearity of hydropower systems the nonlinearity mainly comes from the power output that is a nonlinear function of storage and release and the randomness of inflow can be represented by a sample of inflow scenarios escudero et al 1996 or by a stochastic process model the markov chain scarcelli et al 2017 for instance stochastic dynamic programming sdp has long been applied in the lhro thanks to the objective and constraints in many cases being stage by stage separable which makes it much easier to handle the nonlinearity the randomness with the stream flows usually represented with a stochastic process model can also be effectively dealt with by including hydrological state variables into the sdp as illustrated by tejada guibert et al 1995 and kim and palmer richard 1997 who concluded the more hydrologic state variables the more complex model is and the more accurate an operating policy could be derived but the more computational time is required the reliability that is the probability of failure free during an extended period however cannot be explicitly formulated into the model and enforced stage by stage as required in the sdp the randomness with the stream flows can also be well handled by stochastic linear programming slp dantzig 2010 presented the theoretical basis of the slp which has since been widely applied in many engineering fields included with no exception in the lhro however nonlinearity as a typical feature in the lhro comes from the power output which is the water head and release function that needs to be linearized before applying the linear programming lp kang et al 2018 presented a piecewise linearization method to convert the nonlinear output function into a series of planes such that the original problem was transformed into an lp problem yoo 2009 showed the practicability of the taylor expansion in linearizing the nonlinear terms in the lhro seifi and hipel keith 2001 employed a two stage slp with simple recourse to address the lhro with stochastic inflows also li et al 2006 applied an interval parameter multi stage slp method in water resources stochastic management by using a set of multi stage scenarios tree so as to solve deterministic lp problems all these lp models did not have the proper structure and variables to precisely represent the nonlinearity and the firm output at a certain reliability there were very few works huock and cohon 1978 loucks and van beek 2017a that employed a new variable to represent the probability of a decision at s state of the initial storage and the inflow making it possible to precisely define the nonlinearity with linear constraints since the power output associated with a probability decision is actually a constant our previous work chen et al 2018 presented an slp model that also employing probability variables was verified as having the capability to yield consistent results with those derived by the well known sdp when considering only traditional constraints but also to go beyond by explicitly including more complex constraints particularly tested on reliability and vulnerability from a conceptual and methodological perspective the slp has strength over the sdp in dealing with probabilistic constraints since the sdp requires all the constraints to be expressed in a particular format this work will demonstrate the superiority of the slp to the sdp not only theoretically but also practically with a new slp model in which the firm output at a certain reliability is unknown and yet to be maximized this work will improve the previous slp model to consider an unknown firm output which along with the annual expected hydropower generation will be maximized simultaneously given a reliability in the lhro by introducing 0 1 decision and probability variables considering whether a given initial storage an inflow state and a final storage state together can achieve an unknown firm output the slp model can be reformulated and solved with a ready made mathematical programming solver as a comparison an sdp model with a penalty function is also formulated to maximize the annual expected hydropower generation while implicitly trying to ensure a prespecified firm output at a given reliability the major contributions of this work include 1 an slp model that can explicitly incorporate the reliability in ensuring an unknown firm output to be maximized methodologically superior to the sdp that can only manage to estimate the firm output at a reliability with trial and error and 2 case studies that numerically show the superiority of the present slp to the sdp that can hardly make the reliability any closer to what the slp can achieve especially in ensuring a high firm output the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the fundamental slp model that maximizes the annual expected hydropower generation when firm output at a reliability is specified then in detail a new slp model that maximizes both the firm output at a reliability and the annual expected hydropower generation section 3 provides an sdp model to maximize the annual expected hydropower generation with the firm output and reliability prespecified for comparison then section 4 introduces data acquisition section 5 presents case studies and results section 6 discusses briefly and section 7 concludes the work 2 slp model following the standard practice in discrete stochastic dynamic programming dsdp the two states and decision variables are represented by the initial storage inflow and final storage which are all discretized into intervals indexed by i k and l respectively an operating rule defines the decision as a function of the states 1 l ℓ i k t which permits the calculation of the decision probability p iklt which can in turn determine the operating rule 2 ℓ i k t l p iklt 0 where p iklt is the probability of making decision l at state i k in time period t formula implies that the decision is not only determined by the function of the state but also by the decision probability greater than zero when the decision probability is introduced into the model apparently the sdp seeks the optimal operating rule ℓ i k t directly by the recursive evolution that encounters significant challenges to explicitly incorporate complex probabilistic constraints since it requires all the constraints to be expressed in a particular format while the present slp optimizes the decision probabilities that determine the operating rules and allows explicitly including complex constraints the following will briefly introduce our previous slp model referred to as slp 0 hereafter as a foundation before introducing the new slp model referred to as slp 1 hereafter that maximizes the annual expected hydropower generation and the firm output at a given reliability 2 1 slp model maximizing the annual expected hydropower generation with given

transition probabilities p kj t p kj t is the transition probability of q t 1 j given q t k 8 i k ω t p iklt p kj t m ω t 1 p l j m t 1 l j ω t 1 this constraint implies that multiplying the

firm output y 12 g iklt y β is a prespecified reliability here the reliability is defined as the average probability that all combinations s t i q t k s t 1 l that meets the firm output y in t time periods during the time horizon the modeling of inflow with markov transition probabilities reflects the randomness states transition between adjacent time periods is coupled with inflow state transition probabilities which are demonstrated with the eq 8 more details about the procedure to obtain inflow state and transition probabilities are demonstrated in section 4 it is worth noting that the power output giklt accompanied by the decision probability piklt is actually a constant making it possible to formulate the problem into an lp problem 2 2 slp model maximizing unknown firm output with reliability slp 1 a function f x y for instance is linear when x is known as a parameter but f x y is nonlinear when x is also an unknown decision variable an unknown firm output makes the problem much more nonlinear and complicates the modeling the above mentioned slp 0 model describes how to express the reliability linearly given the specified firm output by introducing probability variables p iklt and 0 1 binary variables u iklt most of the previous studies regard the firm output as a given value to evaluate the operational performance of the lhro in this context as a pre specified parameter the firm output is applied to divide the feasible combinations ω t into two subsets facilitating the possibility expressing the reliability linearly as shown in the eq 11 and eq 12 however the firm output of a hydropower reservoir specified in the design stage is somewhat conservative meanwhile our previous work chen et al 2018 explicitly integrated reliability constraints into the slp model theoretically the sdp model only can implicitly incorporate reliability constraints while the comparison hasn t been made thus exploring the firm output to its full extent will be very helpful in improving the performance of the hydropower reservoir operation and show the superiority of the slp model when the firm output is not known yet to be optimized however there is no boundary to distinguish which parts of the combinations ω t can fulfil the firm output to address this issue a new slp model is formulated to maximize both the firm output and the annual expected hydropower generation with required reliability under the framework adopted by the above model slp 0 to overcome difficulties in determining whether the combination meet the firm output or not the combinations with the unknown firm output satisfied are extracted and separated correspondingly the probability variable m iklt and 0 1 binary variable n iklt are introduced m iklt is the probability of combination s t i q t k s t 1 l fulfilling the unknown firm output n iklt is the 0 1 binary variable whether combination s t i q t k s t 1 l fulfilling the unknown firm output if fulfilled m iklt is equivalent to p iklt n iklt is 1 otherwise m iklt and n iklt are both 0 2 2 1 model reformulation the objective is to maximize the firm output with top priority and the annual expected hydropower generation secondly expressed as 13 max w 1 y w 2 t 1 t i k l ω t p iklt g iklt δ t where w 1 and w 2 are the positive weights of priority with w 1 w 2 y is the unknown firm output to be optimized besides the constraints for p iklt and u iklt in the eq 7 eq 10 two cases are applicable to the new variables m iklt and n iklt case 1 combinations s t i q t k s t 1 l can meet the unknown firm output y with n iklt assigned to 1 with 1 probability variables miklt in the range 0 1 14 0 m iklt 1 where m iklt is the probability variable that combination s t i q t k s t 1 l can fulfil y which is unknown and will be maximized 2 sub probability variables miklt and feasible probability variables piklt are equivalent to each other due to having the same meaning 15 0 m iklt p iklt 0 3 combinations providing a hydropower output greater than the firm output y 16 0 y g iklt case 2 combinations s t i q t k s t 1 l are unable to fulfil the unknown firm output y with n iklt set to 0 with 1 probability variable miklt is equal to 0 17 m iklt 0 2 the probability variable piklt for all the feasible combinations subject to 0 piklt 1 then the relationship between miklt and piklt being 18 1 m

variable equal to 1 if the combination s t i q t k s t 1 l fulfils y and 0 if not and p iklt t β are the same as mentioned above 2 2 2 merging constraints combining the eq 14 and eq 17 with n iklt being either 0 or 1 gives 21 0 m iklt n iklt and combining the eq 15 and eq 18 produces 22 1 m iklt p iklt 0 similarly merging the eq 16 with eq 19 we have 23 1 n iklt g iklt y n iklt g iklt m 1 n iklt where m is a constant set to be much greater than y thus the slp 1 model that maximizes the firm output and the annual expected hydropower generation at a given reliability has the objective 13 and constraints 7 10 21 23 and 20 due to the multi dimensional variable discretization and the binary variables introduced to ensure only one of the optional decisions at a state can be applied the slp 0 model has thousands of binary variables making the problem a mixed integer linear programming and is quite challenging to solve the slp 1 model using a similar strategy to the slp 0 leads to greater solution difficulties by introducing additional variables m iklt and n iklt into the model fortunately two powerful mathematical programming solvers cplex and gurobi make it possible to solve large scale mixed integer linear programming problems benefiting from its efficient performance and convenient interface gurobi is adopted in this work 3 sdp model maximizing annual expected hydropower generation with specified reliability when firm output is given sdp formulating an optimization problem into dynamic programming dp is a very skillful task requiring all the constraints to be expressed in the following format 24 f s t x t s t 1 o r 0 which involves only the decision variables xt in and states at the beginning st and end st 1 of the current stage t this requirement prevents the sdp from including a complex constraint that involves variables over more than two stages in the dp as the reliability constraint does as discussed above the new slp 1 model can explicitly take into account the reliability while the sdp model can only handle indirectly by penalty function askew 1974 wu et al 2018 or lagrange theory rossman 1977 here for convenience the sdp model with a penalty function to maximize the annual expected hydropower generation while trying to meet specified reliability is introduced as follows taking the storage volume s t at the beginning of time period t and the inflow q t during time period t as state variables the storage volume s t 1 at the end of time period t as a decision variable the sdp recursive equation is expressed as 25 f t s t q t max s t 1 g t s t q t s t 1 e q t 1 q t f t 1 s t 1 q t 1 where g t is the output function in time period t with respect to characteristic storage volume s t at the beginning of time period t representative inflow q t during time period t and characteristic storage volume s t 1 at the end of time period t determined by the eq 5 f t is the benefit to go function e q t 1 q t is the expected value similarly take the required firm output y as a criterion to evaluate whether the hydropower station operate normally by including the penalty term sdp recursive equation is extended to 26 f t s t q t max s t 1 g t s t q t s t 1 μ h t e q t 1 q t f t 1 s t 1 q t 1 where μ is a penalty factor adjusted by trial and error to derive the operational policy that meets the specified reliability and the penalty gap h t is defined as 27 h t 0 g t y g t y g t y 4 data acquisition to make the calculation practicable reservoir storages must be represented by characteristic values and inflows need to be discretized into several representative values to deduce inflow state transition probability further let k and l be the numbers of representative inflow and characteristics storage for each time period t respectively for inflow different methods in deriving the transition probability including counting ordinary least squares regression robust linear model regression multivariate conditional distribution haguma et al 2018 and copula function lei et al 2018 were proposed to improve the performance of sdp applied in hydropower reservoir operation in this research counting is adopted the k representative values and state transition probabilities can be derived from historical inflow data suppose that there are n years of historical seasonal inflows observed 28 q t y t 1 t y 1 n the procedure to derive the inflow representative values for each time period t and the transition probability of inflow states between two adjacent time periods is as follows 1 sorting for each time period t sort the n year historical inflow q t y in increasing order since the n year historical inflows will be represented by k numbers of characteristics values there are n k numbers of historical inflow for each representative value calculate the mean value of every n k inflow with the sorted data sequence successively and regard them as i th i 1 k representative inflow q t i for each time period t 2 mapping for the sorted historical inflow sequence the range representing the i th representative value q t i can be settled to q t min i q t max i map the original historical inflow to the corresponding range and replace it with state number i 3 counting after replacing the historical inflow q t y t 1 t y 1 n with state number counting the number of years being state i in time period t meanwhile the number of years being state j in the following time period t 1when being state i in time period t should be counted thereupon the probability of inflow state j in time period t 1 given inflow state i in time period t p t ij is derived by division 4 representing l characteristic values with a uniform distribution between minimum and maximum storage capacity for each time period t represent the storage states 5 case study the lancang river is an international river known outside china as the upper mekong river where there are several hydropower stations with considerable storage capacity among them xiaowan and nuozhadu hydropower stations are chosen as case studies for their preferable operability with their geographical location shown in fig 1 the operational horizon and time period are set to year and month respectively most of the inflow into two reservoirs mainly occurs from may to november the main parameters of these two hydropower stations are listed in table 1 discretization schemes for storage characteristic values and inflow representative values follow the method described in section 4 the number of storage characteristic values for every month is set to 21 for convenience of the calculation referred to karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 and 10 for inflow representative values determined with 50 years of historical inflows during 1953 2002 to verify the feasibility of the slp 1 model proposed in this work to maximize an unknown firm output and annual expected hydropower generation the reliability β is set to 87 90 92 95 and 97 respectively table 2 gives the maximum firm output obtained by solving the slp 1 model at different reliability levels for xiaowan and nuozhadu hydropower stations with the required reliability increasing from 87 to 97 the maximum firm output declines from 2 57gw to 2 16gw for xiaowan and 2 89gw to 2 41gw for nuozhadu with the firm outputs at different reliability levels determined with the slp 1 the slp 0 are then applicable to derive the operational policies when setting the firm output and reliability to 2 57gw 87 2 45gw 90 2 39gw 92 2 26gw 95 and 2 15gw 97 for xiaowan as well as 2 89gw 87 2 78gw 90 2 68gw 92 2 52gw 95 and 2 41gw 97 for nuozhadu for consistency the firm output at a certain reliability must be prespecified before solving the slp 0 table 3 compares the slp 0 with slp 1 on the expected annual hydropower production to be achieved at maximum which is almost the same when the slp 0 is assigned with the firm output derived with the slp 1 at certain reliability the consistency in deriving similar results enhance our confidence in the slp 1 to produce reliable results when the firm output is unknown to be maximized solving the slp 1 model gives the expected monthly hydropower generations at different reliabilities as shown in fig 2 for xiaowan and nuozhadu the within year hydropower generations from june to november are greater than in other months making it more likely to meet the firm output with higher reliabilities obviously the reliabilities to meet the firm output are much higher from june to november when the inflows mainly occur with two dimensional interpolation the operational policies derived from the slp 1 model are applied to simulate the operation of the reservoir with historical monthly inflows into xiaowan during years 1953 2014 and nuozhadu during 1953 2010 fig 3 gives the within year average storage processes derived from the simulation which tells that the storage usually rises to peaks in october then descends to the lowest until may fig 4 demonstrates the simulation results from 2003 to 2008 for xiaowan and nuozhadu with operational policies derived by the slp 1 model when the reliability is set to 97 spillage only occurs in september 2003 for both xiaowan and nuozhadu immediately before the storage reaches to its capacity the reliability of meeting a firm output can also be estimated by simulating the reservoir operation for years when historical inflows are available the procedure is straightforward when the power yield and operational policy have already been derived by solving the models simply dividing the number of months when the power yield is met in the simulation by the total number of months gives the reliability estimated with the simulation the slp 0 cannot deal with an unknown firm output which however can be assigned to the one derived with the slp 1 and then help itself obtain an optimal operation policy that is expected to perform in the simulation as well as the policy obtained with the slp 1 table 4 shows that the statistical reliability estimated in the simulation is less than the required reliability in solving the model usually due to the small sample size of historical data however the statistical reliabilities from the simulation of operational policies derived by slp 0 and slp 1 are almost the same as mentioned above the sdp model can also be applied by changing the penalty coefficient until a required reliability is achieved in the simulating operation process fig 5 shows the change process of reliability along with different penalty coefficients with regard to five different firm outputs derived by the slp 1 for xiaowan and nuozhadu respectively as shown in fig 5 for different firm outputs the reliability stops increasing with the increasing of penalty coefficients to a certain extent actually it is hard to make the reliability any closer to the required reliability when the firm output is set to be a higher value which can be seen from a and b in fig 5 when the prespecified firm output is set to be 87 2 57gw 90 2 45gw 92 2 39gw for xiaowan and 87 2 89gw 90 2 78gw 92 2 68gw for nuozhadu in slp 0 model respectively the statistical reliabilities can reach or exceed 80 which can be seen in table 4 at the same time the statistical reliabilities of the sdp model all fail to exceed 70 when the prespecified firm output is set to be in accordance with the slp 0 model the statistical reliabilities of sdp gradually increase to more than 85 when the firm output is set to 2 15gw for xiaowan and more than 90 when the firm output is set to 2 41gw for nuozhadu yet it is still lower than statistical reliabilities derived by the slp 0 model the differences in statistical reliability between the slp 0 and the sdp are from 6 4 92 1 85 7 to 42 33 78 5 36 17 for xiaowan and from 1 7 92 90 3 to 31 8 79 3 47 5 for nuozhadu respectively the comparison of reliabilities between the slp and sdp models shows that the slp can derive operational policy with higher reliabilities than the sdp model 6 discussion the framework of the slp models in lhro discussed above is based on markov processes and transition probabilities loucks and van beek 2017b which also lays the foundation of the sdp model in lhro we have advanced the research by combining with performance criteria reliability and vulnerability and the results applying to xiaowan and nuozhadu show the equivalence of the slp and sdp model without reliability and vulnerability constraints and the feasibility of the slp model in addressing reliability and vulnerability constraints chen et al 2018 when firm output is given theoretically the sdp model can only implicitly address the reliability issue with prespecified firm output but cannot deal with an unknown firm output yet to be maximized the feasibility and superiority of the slp in addressing unknown firm output given reliability have been demonstrated in the case studies on the long term operation of two hydropower reservoirs however the slp model presented in this work needs to discretize the reservoir storage and inflow causing a massive number of variables and making it quite hard to solve the number of decision variables almost doubles when an unknown firm output at certain reliability needs to be explicitly formulated into the model making the solution even more challenging this work attempts to make the model and solution more applicable for industrial power companies in which using super computers is usually not a common practice and taking too long is intolerable especially when the model needs to be evaluated by simulation under many engineering scenarios nonetheless this study has shown that the slp model we developed has superiority over the sdp model therefore solution efficiency is also of great concern and it deserves further efforts to rise to the much more significant challenges when applying the slp to a hydropower system with multiple cascaded reservoirs 7 conclusions this work improves the previous slp 0 with the present slp 1 to explicitly and precisely represent the reliability with firm output unknown yet to be maximized by introducing probability and binary variables to indicate whether or not the firm output is met the present model discretizes the initial storage inflow and final storage and assigning a probability variable to a decision at a state represented by an initial storage and an inflow makes it possible to precisely represent the nonlinear with linear constraints the case studies on two reservoirs on the lancang river demonstrate that the present slp 1 is efficient in exploring the firm output to its full extent at certain reliability while our previous slp 0 can manage to obtain nearly identical results to those derived by the slp 1 if the firm output is set as a parameter equal to what is derived by the slp 1 the results also show that the sdp using penalty function with the firm output set to what is derived by the slp 1 cannot achieve the expected same good reliabilities compared with the slp 0 model suggesting the superiority of the present slp model to the sdp not only theoretically but also

2184,the firm output usually determined in the design stage of a hydroplant to serve as a threshold to measure system reliability can be regarded as an unknown parameter to be explored to its maximum in long term hydropower reservoir operation lhro an unknown firm output to be ensured at certain reliability however will make the problem much more nonlinear and then complicate the modeling this work presents a stochastic linear programming slp 1 model that can explicitly incorporate reliability in ensuring an unknown firm output to be maximized by using a probability variable to represent a decision at a state and introducing binary variables to decide whether the decision will ensure the unknown firm output the present slp 1 is improved on 1 another previous slp model slp 0 that must have a firm output prespecified at certain reliability and compared with 2 the stochastic dynamic programming sdp model that can only manage to estimate the firm output at a reliability with trial and error case studies show the superiority of the present slp to the sdp that can hardly make the reliability any closer to what the slp can achieve especially in ensuring a high firm output with gaps to desired reliability ranging up to 42 33 for xiaowan and 31 8 for nuozhadu indeed the slp 1 will encounter the dimensional difficulty that needs further efforts to overcome when applied to cascaded

generation 1 introduction as one of the most sustainable and clean sources hydropower plays an essential role in achieving low carbon emissions for environmental and ecological benefits kuriqi et al 2019 suwal et al 2020 obviously reliability vulnerability and resilience are the three criteria most commonly used to evaluate the influence of hydropower production on the environment economy and society jaramillo et al 2018 simonovic and arunkumar 2016 among them reliability is one of the critical criteria to evaluate the functional quality of a system and so it is in hydropower reservoir systems where the long term hydropower reservoir operation lhro plays a vital role in reservoir management providing not only an overall view of hydropower operation in a long term perspective but also offering a water consumption target and boundary conditions for short term hydropower operation tan et al 2020 the reliability defined as the probability of not violating the required operation state by loucks and van beek 2017c can be measured as the frequency of a system in a satisfactory state during an extended period in this context the reliability can be estimated with a series of samples generated by monte carlo simulation koutsoyiannis 2005 or to relieve the computational burden with the first order reliability method based on physical interpretations ganji and jowkarshorijeh 2012 maier et al 2001 however it is very challenging if not impossible for an optimization model to incorporate these procedures when seeking the optimal operational policy the reliability is sometimes simplified as the firm output to be achieved whenever possible in the lhro the firm output estimated as the average output in critical adverse hydrological periods was used by liu et al 2018 as a criterion to evaluate the reliability and the failure of a cascade hydropower system by utilizing the lagrangian duality theory and penalty function paudyal et al 1990 adopted incremental dynamic programming idp to maximize the expected annual energy production subject to a prespecified monthly firm power output mujumdar and nirmala 2007 developed a bayesian stochastic dynamic programming bsdp model to derive operational policies for minimizing the performance measurement represented by the expected value of the squared deviation of the total power generated from the total yield committed to all these works treated the firm output as a given target usually determined in the design stage of hydropower stations to be achieved in operation the firm output should be achieved at a certain reliability allowing failures in meeting the target handling the constraints of meeting the firm output at a specific reliability however has never been an easy task in the lhro due to the complexity of randomness and the nonlinearity of hydropower systems the nonlinearity mainly comes from the power output that is a nonlinear function of storage and release and the randomness of inflow can be represented by a sample of inflow scenarios escudero et al 1996 or by a stochastic process model the markov chain scarcelli et al 2017 for instance stochastic dynamic programming sdp has long been applied in the lhro thanks to the objective and constraints in many cases being stage by stage separable which makes it much easier to handle the nonlinearity the randomness with the stream flows usually represented with a stochastic process model can also be effectively dealt with by including hydrological state variables into the sdp as illustrated by tejada guibert et al 1995 and kim and palmer richard 1997 who concluded the more hydrologic state variables the more complex model is and the more accurate an operating policy could be derived but the more computational time is required the reliability that is the probability of failure free during an extended period however cannot be explicitly formulated into the model and enforced stage by stage as required in the sdp the randomness with the stream flows can also be well handled by stochastic linear programming slp dantzig 2010 presented the theoretical basis of the slp which has since been widely applied in many engineering fields included with no exception in the lhro however nonlinearity as a typical feature in the lhro comes from the power output which is the water head and release function that needs to be linearized before applying the linear programming lp kang et al 2018 presented a piecewise linearization method to convert the nonlinear output function into a series of planes such that the original problem was transformed into an lp problem yoo 2009 showed the practicability of the taylor expansion in linearizing the nonlinear terms in the lhro seifi and hipel keith 2001 employed a two stage slp with simple recourse to address the lhro with stochastic inflows also li et al 2006 applied an interval parameter multi stage slp method in water resources stochastic management by using a set of multi stage scenarios tree so as to solve deterministic lp problems all these lp models did not have the proper structure and variables to precisely represent the nonlinearity and the firm output at a certain reliability there were very few works huock and cohon 1978 loucks and van beek 2017a that employed a new variable to represent the probability of a decision at s state of the initial storage and the inflow making it possible to precisely define the nonlinearity with linear constraints since the power output associated with a probability decision is actually a constant our previous work chen et al 2018 presented an slp model that also employing probability variables was verified as having the capability to yield consistent results with those derived by the well known sdp when considering only traditional constraints but also to go beyond by explicitly including more complex constraints particularly tested on reliability and vulnerability from a conceptual and methodological perspective the slp has strength over the sdp in dealing with probabilistic constraints since the sdp requires all the constraints to be expressed in a particular format this work will demonstrate the superiority of the slp to the sdp not only theoretically but also practically with a new slp model in which the firm output at a certain reliability is unknown and yet to be maximized this work will improve the previous slp model to consider an unknown firm output which along with the annual expected hydropower generation will be maximized simultaneously given a reliability in the lhro by introducing 0 1 decision and probability variables considering whether a given initial storage an inflow state and a final storage state together can achieve an unknown firm output the slp model can be reformulated and solved with a ready made mathematical programming solver as a comparison an sdp model with a penalty function is also formulated to maximize the annual expected hydropower generation while implicitly trying to ensure a prespecified firm output at a given reliability the major contributions of this work include 1 an slp model that can explicitly incorporate the reliability in ensuring an unknown firm output to be maximized methodologically superior to the sdp that can only manage to estimate the firm output at a reliability with trial and error and 2 case studies that numerically show the superiority of the present slp to the sdp that can hardly make the reliability any closer to what the slp can achieve especially in ensuring a high firm output the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the fundamental slp model that maximizes the annual expected hydropower generation when firm output at a reliability is specified then in detail a new slp model that maximizes both the firm output at a reliability and the annual expected hydropower generation section 3 provides an sdp model to maximize the annual expected hydropower generation with the firm output and reliability prespecified for comparison then section 4 introduces data acquisition section 5 presents case studies and results section 6 discusses briefly and section 7 concludes the work 2 slp model following the standard practice in discrete stochastic dynamic programming dsdp the two states and decision variables are represented by the initial storage inflow and final storage which are all discretized into intervals indexed by i k and l respectively an operating rule defines the decision as a function of the states 1 l ℓ i k t which permits the calculation of the decision probability p iklt which can in turn determine the operating rule 2 ℓ i k t l p iklt 0 where p iklt is the probability of making decision l at state i k in time period t formula implies that the decision is not only determined by the function of the state but also by the decision probability greater than zero when the decision probability is introduced into the model apparently the sdp seeks the optimal operating rule ℓ i k t directly by the recursive evolution that encounters significant challenges to explicitly incorporate complex probabilistic constraints since it requires all the constraints to be expressed in a particular format while the present slp optimizes the decision probabilities that determine the operating rules and allows explicitly including complex constraints the following will briefly introduce our previous slp model referred to as slp 0 hereafter as a foundation before introducing the new slp model referred to as slp 1 hereafter that maximizes the annual expected hydropower generation and the firm output at a given reliability 2 1 slp model maximizing the annual expected hydropower generation with given

transition probabilities p kj t p kj t is the transition probability of q t 1 j given q t k 8 i k ω t p iklt p kj t m ω t 1 p l j m t 1 l j ω t 1 this constraint implies that multiplying the probability p iklt times the inflow transition probability p kj t then summing over all i and k that results in decision state storage in s t 1 l time period t should be equal to the sum over all m that is feasible to the same l and j in time period t 1 3 only one decision is chosen at a given initial storage state and inflow state at each time period t 9 l ω t u iklt 1 i k ω t in which u iklt is the 0 1 binary variable representing whether a decision state s t 1 l is made given initial states s t i and q t k 4 the relationship between the probability and decision variables 10 p iklt u iklt

firm output y 12 g iklt y β is a prespecified reliability here the reliability is defined as the average probability that all combinations s t i q t k s t 1 l that meets the firm output y in t time periods during the time horizon the modeling of inflow with markov transition probabilities reflects the randomness states transition between adjacent time periods is coupled with inflow state transition probabilities which are demonstrated with the eq 8 more details about the procedure to obtain inflow state and transition probabilities are demonstrated in section 4 it is worth noting that the power output giklt accompanied by the decision probability piklt is actually a constant making it possible to formulate the problem into an lp problem 2 2 slp model maximizing unknown firm output with reliability slp 1 a function f x y for instance is linear when x is known as a parameter but f x y is nonlinear when x is also an unknown decision variable an unknown firm output makes the problem much more nonlinear and complicates the modeling the above mentioned slp 0 model describes how to express the reliability linearly given the specified firm output by introducing probability variables p iklt and 0 1 binary variables u iklt most of the previous studies regard the firm output as a given value to evaluate the operational performance of the lhro in this context as a pre specified parameter the firm output is applied to divide the feasible combinations ω t into two subsets facilitating the possibility expressing the reliability linearly as shown in the eq 11 and eq 12 however the firm output of a hydropower reservoir specified in the design stage is somewhat conservative meanwhile our previous work chen et al 2018 explicitly integrated reliability constraints into the slp model theoretically the sdp model only can implicitly incorporate reliability constraints while the comparison hasn t been made thus exploring the firm output to its full extent will be very helpful in improving the performance of the hydropower reservoir operation and show the superiority of the slp model when the firm output is not known yet to be optimized however there is no boundary to distinguish which parts of the combinations ω t can fulfil the firm output to address this issue a new slp model is formulated to maximize both the firm output and the annual expected hydropower generation with required reliability under the framework adopted by the above model slp 0 to overcome difficulties in determining whether the combination meet the firm output or not the combinations with the unknown firm output satisfied are extracted and separated correspondingly the probability variable m iklt and 0 1 binary variable n iklt are introduced m iklt is the probability of combination s t i q t k s t 1 l fulfilling the unknown firm output n iklt is the 0 1 binary variable whether combination s t i q t k s t 1 l fulfilling the unknown firm output if fulfilled m iklt is equivalent to p iklt n iklt is 1 otherwise m iklt and n iklt are both 0 2 2 1 model reformulation the objective is to maximize the firm output with top priority and the annual expected hydropower generation secondly expressed as 13 max w 1 y w 2 t 1 t i k l ω t p iklt g iklt δ t where w 1 and w 2 are the positive weights of priority with w 1 w 2 y is the unknown firm output to be optimized besides the constraints for p iklt and u iklt in the eq 7 eq 10 two cases are applicable to the new variables m iklt and n iklt case 1 combinations s t i q t k s t 1 l can meet the unknown firm output y with n iklt assigned to 1 with 1 probability variables miklt in the range 0 1 14 0 m iklt 1 where m iklt is the probability variable that combination s t i q t k s t 1 l can fulfil y which is unknown and will be maximized 2 sub probability variables miklt and feasible probability variables piklt are equivalent to each other due to having the same meaning 15 0 m iklt p iklt 0 3 combinations providing a hydropower output greater than the firm output y 16 0 y g iklt case 2 combinations s t i q t k s t 1 l are unable to fulfil the unknown firm output y with n iklt set to 0 with 1 probability variable miklt is equal to 0 17 m iklt 0 2 the probability variable piklt for all the feasible combinations subject to 0 piklt 1 then the relationship between miklt and piklt being 18 1 m iklt p iklt 0 3 combinations of provides an output less than the firm output 19 g iklt y the reliability constraints will then be replaced with 20 1 t t 1 t i k l m iklt β here n iklt is a 0 1 binary variable equal to 1 if the combination s t i q t k s t 1 l fulfils y and 0 if not and p iklt t β are the same as mentioned above 2 2 2 merging constraints combining the eq 14 and eq 17 with n iklt being either 0 or 1 gives 21 0 m iklt n iklt and combining the eq 15 and eq 18 produces 22 1 m iklt p iklt 0 similarly merging the eq 16 with eq 19 we have 23 1 n iklt g iklt y n iklt g iklt m 1 n iklt where m is a constant set to be much greater than y thus the slp 1 model that maximizes the firm output and the annual expected hydropower generation at a given reliability has the objective 13 and constraints 7 10 21 23 and 20 due to the multi dimensional variable discretization and the binary variables introduced to ensure only one of the optional decisions at a state can be applied the slp 0 model has thousands of binary variables making the problem a mixed integer linear programming and is quite challenging to solve the slp 1 model using a similar strategy to the slp 0 leads to greater solution difficulties by introducing additional variables m iklt and n iklt into the model fortunately two powerful mathematical programming solvers cplex and gurobi make it possible to solve large scale mixed integer linear programming problems benefiting from its efficient performance and convenient interface gurobi is adopted in this work 3 sdp model maximizing annual expected hydropower generation with specified reliability when firm output is given sdp formulating an optimization problem into dynamic programming dp is a very skillful task requiring all the constraints to be expressed in the following format 24 f s t x t s t 1 o r 0 which involves only the decision variables xt in and states at the beginning st and end st 1 of the current stage t this requirement prevents the sdp from including a complex constraint that involves variables over more than two stages in the dp as the reliability constraint does as discussed above the new slp 1 model can explicitly take into account the reliability while the sdp model can only handle indirectly by penalty function askew 1974 wu et al 2018 or lagrange theory rossman 1977 here for convenience the sdp model with a penalty function to maximize the annual expected hydropower generation while trying to meet specified reliability is introduced as follows taking the storage volume s t at the beginning of time period t and the inflow q t during time period t as state variables the storage volume s t 1 at the end of time period t as a decision variable the sdp recursive equation is expressed as 25 f t s t q t max s t 1 g t s t q t s t 1 e q t 1 q t f t 1 s t 1 q t 1 where g t is the output function in time period t with respect to characteristic storage volume s t at the beginning of time period t representative inflow q t during time period t and characteristic storage volume s t 1 at the end of time period t determined by the eq 5 f t is the benefit to go function e q t 1 q t is the expected value similarly take the required firm output y as a criterion to evaluate whether the hydropower station operate normally by including the penalty term sdp recursive equation is extended to 26 f t s t q t max s t 1 g t s t q t s t 1 μ h t e q t 1 q t f t 1 s t 1 q t 1 where μ is a penalty factor adjusted by trial and error to derive the operational policy that meets the specified reliability and the penalty gap h t is defined as 27 h t 0 g t y g t y g t y 4 data acquisition to make the calculation practicable reservoir storages must be represented by characteristic values and inflows need to be discretized into several representative values to deduce inflow state transition probability further let k and l be the numbers of representative inflow and characteristics storage for each time period t respectively for inflow different methods in deriving the transition probability including counting ordinary least squares regression robust linear model regression multivariate conditional distribution haguma et al 2018 and copula function lei et al 2018 were proposed to improve the performance of sdp applied in hydropower reservoir operation in this research counting is adopted the k representative values and state transition probabilities can be derived from historical inflow data suppose that there are n years of historical seasonal inflows observed 28 q t y t 1 t y 1 n the procedure to derive the inflow representative values for each time period t and the transition probability of inflow states between two adjacent time periods is as follows 1 sorting for each time period t sort the n year historical inflow q t y in increasing order since the n year historical inflows will be represented by k numbers of characteristics values there are n k numbers of historical inflow for each representative value calculate the mean value of every n k inflow with the sorted data sequence successively and regard them as i th i 1 k representative inflow q t i for each time period t 2 mapping for the sorted historical inflow sequence the range representing the i th representative value q t i can be settled to q t min i q t max i map the original historical inflow to the corresponding range and replace it with state number i 3 counting after replacing the historical inflow q t y t 1 t y 1 n with state number counting the number of years being state i in time period t meanwhile the number of years being state j in the following time period t 1when being state i in time period t should be counted thereupon the probability of inflow state j in time period t 1 given inflow state i in time period t p t ij is derived by division 4 representing l characteristic values with a uniform distribution between minimum and maximum storage capacity for each time period t represent the storage states 5 case study the lancang river is an international river known outside china as the upper mekong river where there are several hydropower stations with considerable storage capacity among them xiaowan and nuozhadu hydropower stations are chosen as case studies for their preferable operability with their geographical location shown in fig 1 the operational horizon and time period are set to year and month respectively most of the inflow into two reservoirs mainly occurs from may to november the main parameters of these two hydropower stations are listed in table 1 discretization schemes for storage characteristic values and inflow representative values follow the method described in section 4 the number of storage characteristic values for every month is set to 21 for convenience of the calculation referred to karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 and 10 for inflow representative values determined with 50 years of historical inflows during 1953 2002 to verify the feasibility of the slp 1 model proposed in this work to maximize an unknown firm output and annual expected hydropower generation the reliability β is set to 87 90 92 95 and 97 respectively table 2 gives the maximum firm output obtained by solving the slp 1 model at different reliability levels for xiaowan and nuozhadu hydropower stations with the required reliability increasing from 87 to 97 the maximum firm output declines from 2 57gw to 2 16gw for xiaowan and 2 89gw to 2 41gw for nuozhadu with the firm outputs at different reliability levels determined with the slp 1 the slp 0 are then applicable to derive the operational policies when setting the firm output and reliability to 2 57gw 87 2 45gw 90 2 39gw 92 2 26gw 95 and 2 15gw 97 for xiaowan as well as 2 89gw 87 2 78gw 90 2 68gw 92 2 52gw 95 and 2 41gw 97 for nuozhadu for consistency the firm output at a certain reliability must be prespecified before solving the slp 0 table 3 compares the slp 0 with slp 1 on the expected annual hydropower production to be achieved at maximum which is almost the same when the slp 0 is assigned with the firm output derived with the slp 1 at certain reliability the consistency in deriving similar results enhance our confidence in the slp 1 to produce reliable results when the firm output is unknown to be maximized solving the slp 1 model gives the expected monthly hydropower generations at different reliabilities as shown in fig 2 for xiaowan and nuozhadu the within year hydropower generations from june to november are greater than in other months making it more likely to meet the firm output with higher reliabilities obviously the reliabilities to meet the firm output are much higher from june to november when the inflows mainly occur with two dimensional interpolation the operational policies derived from the slp 1 model are applied to simulate the operation of the reservoir with historical monthly inflows into xiaowan during years 1953 2014 and nuozhadu during 1953 2010 fig 3 gives the within year average storage processes derived from the simulation which tells that the storage usually rises to peaks in october then descends to the lowest until may fig 4 demonstrates the simulation results from 2003 to 2008 for xiaowan and nuozhadu with operational policies derived by the slp 1 model when the reliability is set to 97 spillage only occurs in september 2003 for both xiaowan and nuozhadu immediately before the storage reaches to its capacity the reliability of meeting a firm output can also be estimated by simulating the reservoir operation for years when historical inflows are available the procedure is straightforward when the power yield and operational policy have already been derived by solving the models simply dividing the number of months when the power yield is met in the simulation by the total number of months gives the reliability estimated with the simulation the slp 0 cannot deal with an unknown firm output which however can be assigned to the one derived with the slp 1 and then help itself obtain an optimal operation policy that is expected to perform in the simulation as well as the policy obtained with the slp 1 table 4 shows that the statistical reliability estimated in the simulation is less than the required reliability in solving the model usually due to the small sample size of historical data however the statistical reliabilities from the simulation of operational policies derived by slp 0 and slp 1 are almost the same as mentioned above the sdp model can also be applied by changing the penalty coefficient until a required reliability is achieved in the simulating operation process fig 5 shows the change process of reliability along with different penalty coefficients with regard to five different firm outputs derived by the slp 1 for xiaowan and nuozhadu respectively as shown in fig 5 for different firm outputs the reliability stops increasing with the increasing of penalty coefficients to a certain extent actually it is hard to make the reliability any closer to the required reliability when the firm output is set to be a higher value which can be seen from a and b in fig 5 when the prespecified firm output is set to be 87 2 57gw 90 2 45gw 92 2 39gw for xiaowan and 87 2 89gw 90 2 78gw 92 2 68gw for nuozhadu in slp 0 model respectively the statistical reliabilities can reach or exceed 80 which can be seen in table 4 at the same time the statistical reliabilities of the sdp model all fail to exceed 70 when the prespecified firm output is set to be in accordance with the slp 0 model the statistical reliabilities of sdp gradually increase to more than 85 when the firm output is set to 2 15gw for xiaowan and more than 90 when the firm output is set to 2 41gw for nuozhadu yet it is still lower than statistical reliabilities derived by the slp 0 model the differences in statistical reliability between the slp 0 and the sdp are from 6 4 92 1 85 7 to 42 33 78 5 36 17 for xiaowan and from 1 7 92 90 3 to 31 8 79 3 47 5 for nuozhadu respectively the comparison of reliabilities between the slp and sdp models shows that the slp can derive operational policy with higher reliabilities than the sdp model 6 discussion the framework of the slp models in lhro discussed above is based on markov processes and transition probabilities loucks and van beek 2017b which also lays the foundation of the sdp model in lhro we have advanced the research by combining with performance criteria reliability and vulnerability and the results applying to xiaowan and nuozhadu show the equivalence of the slp and sdp model without reliability and vulnerability constraints and the feasibility of the slp model in addressing reliability and vulnerability constraints chen et al 2018 when firm output is given theoretically the sdp model can only implicitly address the reliability issue with prespecified firm output but cannot deal with an unknown firm output yet to be maximized the feasibility and superiority of the slp in addressing unknown firm output given reliability have been demonstrated in the case studies on the long term operation of two hydropower reservoirs however the slp model presented in this work needs to discretize the reservoir storage and inflow causing a massive number of variables and making it quite hard to solve the number of decision variables almost doubles when an unknown firm output at certain reliability needs to be explicitly formulated into the model making the solution even more challenging this work attempts to make the model and solution more applicable for industrial power companies in which using super computers is usually not a common practice and taking too long is intolerable especially when the model needs to be evaluated by simulation under many engineering scenarios nonetheless this study has shown that the slp model we developed has superiority over the sdp model therefore solution efficiency is also of great concern and it deserves further efforts to rise to the much more significant challenges when applying the slp to a hydropower system with multiple cascaded reservoirs 7 conclusions this work improves the previous slp 0 with the present slp 1 to explicitly and precisely represent the reliability with firm output unknown yet to be maximized by introducing probability and binary variables to indicate whether or not the firm output is met the present model discretizes the initial storage inflow and final storage and assigning a probability variable to a decision at a state represented by an initial storage and an inflow makes it possible to precisely represent the nonlinear with linear constraints the case studies on two reservoirs on the lancang river demonstrate that the present slp 1 is efficient in exploring the firm output to its full extent at certain reliability while our previous slp 0 can manage to obtain nearly identical results to those derived by the slp 1 if the firm output is set as a parameter equal to what is derived by the slp 1 the results also show that the sdp using penalty function with the firm output set to what is derived by the slp 1 cannot achieve the expected same good reliabilities compared with the slp 0 model suggesting the superiority of the present slp model to the sdp not only theoretically but also
