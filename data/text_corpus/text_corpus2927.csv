14635,cyanobacteria are the most prevalent bloom forming harmful algae in freshwater systems around the world adequate sampling of affected systems is limited spatially temporally and fiscally remote sensing using space or ground based systems in large water bodies at spatial and temporal scales that are cost prohibitive to standard water quality monitoring has proven to be useful in detecting and quantifying cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms this study aimed to identify a regional universal multispectral reflectance model that could be used for rapid remote detection and quantification of cyanohabs in small to medium sized productive reservoirs such as those typical of oklahoma usa we aimed to include these small waterbodies in our study as they are typically overlooked in larger continental wide studies yet are widely distributed and used for recreation and drinking water supply we used landsat satellite reflectance and in situ pigment data spanning 16 years from 38 reservoirs in oklahoma to construct empirical linear models for predicting concentrations of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin two key algal pigments commonly used for assessing total and cyanobacterial algal abundances respectively we also used ground based hyperspectral reflectance and in situ pigment data from seven reservoirs across five years in oklahoma to build multispectral models predicting algal pigments from newly defined reflectance bands our oklahoma derived landsat and ground based models outperformed established reflectance pigment models on oklahoma reservoirs importantly our results demonstrate that ground based multispectral models were far superior to landsat based models and the cyanobacteria index ci for detecting cyanohabs in highly productive small to mid sized reservoirs in oklahoma providing a valuable tool for water management and public health while satellite based remote sensing approaches have proven effective for relatively large systems our novel results indicate that ground based remote sensing may offer better cyanohab monitoring for small or highly dendritic turbid lakes such as those throughout the southern great plains and thus prove beneficial to efforts aimed at minimizing public health risks associated with cyanohabs in supply and recreational waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria remote sensing chlorophyll a phycocyanin water quality harmful algal bloom monitoring data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs in freshwaters are a topic of global concern paerl and barnard 2020 blooms are increasing in frequency and magnitude due in part to increased anthropogenic nutrient loading paerl and paul 2012 cyanohabs are particularly problematic because many species of harmful algae produce toxins that pose health risks to humans and other animals through exposure by toxin consumption inhalation and topical contact hambright et al 2014 hilborn and beasley 2015 plaas and paerl 2021 while some cyanotoxins may be only dermatotoxic producing mild to moderate allergic reactions common cyanotoxins such as microcystin cylindrospermopsin saxitoxin and anatoxin are powerful hepato and neurotoxins that can cause chronic illness and death with increasing threats of cyanohab development in inland waters there is an equally increasing need for rigorous monitoring for cyanobacteria and their toxins to minimize public health risk associated with cyanohabs paerl and barnard 2020 unfortunately cyanohab monitoring today is highly insufficient for the needs of health risk management almuhtaram et al 2021 historically cyanohab assessment has been based on standard limnological monitoring of water quality with focus on criteria such as water clarity or concentrations of chlorophyll a and nutrients monitoring of cyanohab densities and cyanotoxins requires specialized skill and instrumentation and is thus generally conducted routinely only in lakes that provide water supply to large metropolitan communities similar routine cyanohab monitoring for the vast majority of lakes and reservoirs in rural settings is physically and economically impractical almuhtaram et al 2021 high frequency autonomous monitoring is possible with expensive high maintenance monitoring platforms coad et al 2014 however sufficient spatial coverage particularly for moderate to large sized dendritic reservoirs with tens to hundreds of semi enclosed bays and coves areas with high recreational use would be prohibitively expensive to minimize potential health risks associated with cyanohab toxin exposure in such systems lake management and public health agencies need new tools that are amenable to broad and simple implementation across multiple and diverse systems particularly those supporting high recreational tourism an early solution to the monitoring needs of public health protection emerged as remote measurement of solar reflectance by satellite based sensors was shown to be effective and economically beneficial in assessing general chlorophyll a concentrations in surface waters gons et al 2002 stroming et al 2020 satellite imagers have the potential to allow monitoring without the expensive person hours and equipment required for a physical visit to a lake or a permanent autosampler profiler due to their large spatial coverage 900 90 000 m2 which can collect images for many lakes simultaneously and their fine temporal resolution daily to fortnightly flyovers depending on satellite obviously satellites are expensive but many currently in use for earth observations were launched by public entities that offer users open access data images thus providing lake managers a low cost option for surface water observation successful application of satellite based remote sensing to cyanohab assessment particularly for large waterbodies coffer et al 2020 urquhart et al 2017 wynne et al 2010 has fueled a search for universal models that can predict concentrations of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin two key algal pigments commonly used for assessing total and cyanobacterial algal abundances shi et al 2019 however there are well known limitations that may interfere with a satellite based approach including significant loss of usable images due to cloud cover ju and roy 2008 and sun glint contamination overstreet and legleiter 2017 moreover satellite sensors frequently used for remote sensing of habs moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis aboard the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa terra and aqua satellites medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris aboard the european space agency s esa envisat 1 satellite and ocean land colour instrument olci a follow up to esa s meris were built for a combination of atmosphere terrestrial and oceanic applications barnes et al 1998 nieke et al 2012 rast et al 1999 the sensors on these satellites quantify reflectance from relatively large areas e g 250 250 to 500 500 m in each pixel this resolution is not amenable for observing most inland lakes and reservoirs that are either too small or are highly dendritic in structure such that many water pixels can be contaminated by littoral shoreline and terrestrial reflectance verpoorter et al 2014 wetzel 2001 additionally water levels in smaller water bodies fluctuate seasonally making the delineation between water and non water contamination notoriously difficult zou et al 2017 especially with low spatial resolution instruments these spatial resolution limitations have led to a lack of data for smaller waterbodies in the remote sensing literature and the call for development and use of satellites with spatial resolutions of 30 30 m or smaller beck et al 2016 urquhart et al 2017 coffer et al 2020 an alternative to satellite based remote sensing is the use of ground based sensors which do not suffer from the previously mentioned satellite limitations like atmospheric interference wu et al 2019 ground based instruments with multispectral sensors have many advantages to satellites like the ability to capture images with very fine spatial resolution flexible temporal resolution and rapid data turn around time studies suggest ground based instruments will provide better capability for monitoring cyanohabs than satellite based remote sensing wu et al 2019 there are commercially available sensors for use on ground based instruments but most were designed for terrestrial application no commercially available sensors have a band designed specifically for phycocyanin fernandez figueroa et al 2021 found commercially available cameras and multispectral sensors were more sensitive to chlorophyll a than phycocyanin in eutrophic ponds multispectral sensors built for detection of phycocyanin are needed for adequate monitoring of cyanohabs almuhtaram et al 2021 fernandez figueroa et al 2021 in this study we sought a universal multispectral reflectance model that could be used for rapid remote detection and quantification of cyanohabs in reservoirs that are relatively small or highly dendritic productive and often turbid like those in oklahoma we aimed to explore the effectiveness of satellite based multispectral models for predicting chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations in oklahoman reservoirs in comparison to new ground based multispectral models derived from the same oklahoma systems our results show that the published models had little to no predictive power with respect to assessing cyanohabs in a study system outside those used to establish the models and that ground based sensors and multispectral models particularly for phycocyanin were far superior to landsat based sensors and models for assessing cyanohabs in small dendritic productive reservoirs in oklahoma 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites oklahoma is an ideal study system for turbid small to medium sized reservoirs the majority of oklahoma lakes are smaller than the average american football field i e ca 0 5 ha zou et al 2017 or are highly dendritic with high shoreline to surface area ratios aka shoreline development wetzel 2001 oklahoma lakes are typical of lakes in the southern great plains with high turbidity high chlorophyll a and frequent cyanohabs oklahoma water resources board 2017 lakes in oklahoma are used primarily for water supply and recreation and therefore monitoring harmful algal blooms is necessary to protect public health smithee et al 2012 with these characteristics in mind we compared reflectance algal pigment models using landsat satellite data and ground based hyperspectral reflectance we built empirical models relating satellite spectral reflectance to chlorophyll a table s1 and phycocyanin table s2 concentrations from 38 lakes n 1060 paired observations sampled between 2001 2017 and ground based reflectance to chlorophyll a n 124 and phycocyanin n 125 concentrations from 7 lakes sampled between 2012 2016 see fig 1 a and b for map of sample locations we also compared our oklahoma specific models to published models 2 2 satellite reflectance data the enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and operational land imager oli are multispectral sensors onboard the landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellites respectively that consist of different spectral bands etm has eight bands and oli has 11 bands that record select areas of the electromagnetic spectrum please see irons et al 2012 for details on the sensors and bands these two satellites were chosen over other potential sensors e g meris olci msi for this study due to the relatively small pixel size 30 30 m of the etm and oli sensors and the eight day revisit time between the satellites sentinel 3a olci was not chosen due to its large pixel size of 300 m which is difficult to resolve on small dendritic oklahoma reservoirs see fig s6 for landsat and sentinel 3a image comparison and it only became operational in 2016 years after much of our in situ water sampling sentinel 2a msi has a smaller pixel size 10 and 20 m to landsat 30 m and a few more spectral bands that might be more useful than landsat one limitation of sentinel 2a msi much like landsat is that it does not have a spectral band to measure phycocyanin in addition it was launched in 2015 after which only 7 of our in situ samples occurred thus use of sentinel 2a msi would markedly decrease the data available for modeling in this study surface reflectance data were obtained from eros data center sioux falls sd usgs for each site date combination surface reflectance data are generated by the usgs from level 1 digital number dn products by applying a modis 6s atmospheric correction routine using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps software masek et al 2006 images n 247 were matched with in situ measurements within a 7 day window of the sampling date ensuring a difference of no more than seven days between the satellite image and the in situ measurements this window was informed by a concurrent study measuring temporal autocorrelation in cyanobacterial blooms in oklahoma beyer and hambright 2017 which showed that proxies chlorophyll a and phycocyanin for cyanobacterial abundance during bloom periods were strongly temporally autocorrelated over a period of 10 11 days images were visually screened for cloud cover and excluded if the lake area had 10 cloud cover since july 14 2003 the landsat 7 etm scan line corrector has been turned off due to an instrument failure leaving stripes of missing data across images markham et al 2004 to minimize the potential impact of missing data and to account for the anchored swing radius of the boat under changing winds and currents we averaged reflectance values from nine pixels a 3 3 grid consisting of the sampling point pixel and the eight surrounding pixels for each site this approach maximized the number of usable data points and achieved the most representative sample for each reflectance measure baban 1993 reflectance data were extracted from images using r r development core team 2014 see supplemental for code the data were then plotted and screened for high reflectance outliers reflectance greater than 1 water reflectance is much lower than land reflectance so high reflectance values could indicate shoreline or bottom interference or an object e g a boat in the pixel 2 3 ground based reflectance data we collected in situ hyperspectral reflectance data from seven lakes see fig 1c for map over a period spanning 2012 2016 using an asd fieldspec spectroradiometer malvern panalytical malvern united kingdom at each lake the asd was calibrated using a spectralon reflectance panel labsphere north sutton nh usa at each pelagic site n 14 and shoreline site on lake thunderbird n 12 the optical probe was held over the non shaded side of the boat or boat dock at a 45 degree angle to the water and five spectra were recorded these five spectra were averaged for each site to minimize the impact of sun glint or water waves and the resulting spectra were used in downstream analyses for many of these lakes we had repeat visits to multiple sites table s3 and where feasible we took measurements at multiple locations on the lake to increase our spatial coverage in total we collected hyperspectral data from 132 site date combinations quality control and quality assurance were performed on the spectra spectra were visually examined and six spectra were discarded three due to the loss of the raw files one due to an abnormal horizontal spike at 1000 nm one due to abnormal low reflectance values and another due to an outlier in the limnological data each spectrum was matched with same day in situ pigment data one additional site date combination was discarded due to lack of corresponding limnological data and another was missing only chlorophyll a data the final working sample size was 125 for phycocyanin and 124 for chlorophyll a 2 4 in situ surface water pigment data each satellite image and ground based measurement has a corresponding pigment measurement from an oklahoma lake these data were collected by personnel in the plankton ecology and limnology lab pell at the university of oklahoma as well as the oklahoma water resources board owrb and the grand river dam authority grda for the satellite dataset 38 lakes were sampled between 2001 2017 for a total of 1060 chlorophyll a data points fig s1 table s1 and 97 phycocyanin data points fig s3 table 2 for the ground based measurements seven lakes were sampled between 2012 2016 for a total of 124 chlorophyll a fig s4 table s3 and 125 phycocyanin data points fig s5 table s3 lake sampling by pell is briefly summarized here for details see hambright et al 2010 at each site a hydrolab ds5x ott hydromet kempten germany sonde was used to measure phycocyanin pcy concentrations starting in 2009 although pcy in nature will generally be bound within cells the hydrolab pcy sensor was calibrated using serial dilutions of biologically relevant levels of pure pcy solution sigma aldrich and thus provides an underestimate of the actual amount of pcy in lakes nevertheless relative changes can still provide meaningful insight into seasonality and site to site comparisons such pcy measurements have previously been found to correlate with cyanobacterial biomass thomson laing et al 2020 at deeper sites measurements were taken in the upper 10 m of the water column at 1 m intervals and at shallow sites measurements were taken at 0 5 meter intervals through the entire water column on average around 2 m phycocyanin measurements were averaged across the photic zone as determined by a li cor light meter li cor biosciences lincoln ne usa or 2 5 times the secchi depth for acetone extracted chlorophyll a depth integrated water samples were taken from the photic zone depth or the entire water column whichever was shallower and placed into acid washed deionized and sample rinsed nalgene bottles and kept on ice prior to filtration the water was filtered onto 25 mm diameter gf f filters and stored in the freezer until chlorophyll a extraction in a reduced light environment the filters were homogenized with a small volume of 70 acetone using a mortar and pestle then incubated in 70 acetone at 4 8 c for 6 24 h samples were centrifuged prior to analysis on a turner designs 700 pre 2012 or trilogy 2012 present bench top fluorometers arar and collins 1997 the owrb and grda collected water samples from the upper 0 5 m for chlorophyll analysis the agencies did not measure phycocyanin and both used the previously described epa chlorophyll a acetone extraction method for the satellite dataset owrb contributed 836 data points grda contributed 56 and pell contributed a total of 168 for the ground based dataset all chlorophyll a n 124 and phycocyanin n 125 pigment data points were contributed by pell 2 5 landsat multispectral models to quantify cyanohabs in oklahoma we built empirical linear regression models using the chlorophyll a phycocyanin and satellite reflectance values see fig 2 for methods diagram we used landsat band ratios as our predictors because spectral ratios have been shown to be more robust than single bands vincent et al 2004 we eliminated potential collinearity in the models using variance inflation factors vif by sequentially removing the predictors with the highest vif score until all scores were at the predetermined threshold of 10 zuur et al 2010 the spectral ratios used to determine the final chlorophyll a model included the following band ratios blue green red blue green red blue near infared nir and nir red and in the pcy model blue green green red nir red and red nir we used bayesian information criterion bic to select the model that explained the most variance in the response variable using the fewest predictors schwarz 1978 all statistical analyses were completed in the r environment version 4 2 1 to test how published models effectively predicted cyanohabs in oklahoma lakes we applied a set of chlorophyll a algorithms adapted to landsat 7 from the landsat 8 models landsat 8 bands 2 6 match landsat 7 bands 1 5 in beck et al 2016 table 1 the algorithms from the literature include the normalized difference chlorophyll index ndci mishra and mishra 2012 the surface algal bloom index sabi alawadi 2010 the fluorescence line height algorithm focusing on the blue band flh blue zhao et al 2010 the two band algorithm 2bda gitelson et al 2003 the three band algorithm 3bda dall olmo and gitelson 2005 and the three band like algorithm kivu brivio et al 2001 kneubühler et al 2007 we also used one established phycocyanin landsat algorithm from the literature vincent et al 2004 to compare with our landsat phycocyanin model table 1 these algorithms were chosen in part because they were built using landsat bands or because they have been shown to successfully predict chlorophyll a or phycocyanin each of the previously mentioned chlorophyll a models was applied to our oklahoma satellite reflectance data set n 1060 and compared to in situ chlorophyll a values to determine model accuracy as per the original use each algorithm was solved prior to regressing meaning there is a single regression coefficient for each algorithm for the vincent et al 2004 phycocyanin algorithm we fit a regression coefficient to each spectral ratio as was done in the original model to assess the fit of the regressions we compared the in situ observed pigment values with the predicted algorithm pigment values and evaluated the relationship using the root mean square error rmse lower values indicate better model fit and pearson s r correlation test range from 1 to 1 with numbers closer to 0 indicating no correlation table 3 we also report the adjusted r2 of each regression as this is a direct measure of model predictability ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values being more predictive in addition to the above described empirical models we built random forest models to explore the utility of machine learning as an approach for generating useful predictive models we used the randomforest function in the randomforest package in r liaw and wiener 2002 to grow random forests with ntree 500 for both chlorophyll a and phycocyanin models we used the non collinear predictors described above for the linear models we chose regression random forest because we are most interested in prediction across a range of pigment values and they are more comparable to previously described linear models we evaluated model performance similarly to the linear models using rmse and r2 but in addition we tested significance against a null model we extracted the performance statistics and significance using the rfutilities package in r using the rf regression and rf significance functions respectively https cran r project org web packages utility index html 2 6 ground based multispectral models we built a semi empirical model using the ground based measurements by first selecting five bands based on spectral properties of optical constituents of cyanobacteria and other non target components that could affect reflectance of light from oklahoma reservoirs specifically chlorophyll a phycocyanin and turbidity see fig 3 for methods diagram the medians of the bands were based on published values matthews 2011 and the width of the bands were optimized by comparing correlations of candidate bands with our measured optical constituents table 2 we calculated the average reflectance over the wavelengths included in the band using the bands described in table 2 we constructed candidate linear models for chlorophyll a including all possible combinations of ratios of the five bands and selected the best model using the corrected akaike information criterion aicc as prediction was our goal and not inferring causality we moved forward in analyzing the model with the lowest aicc value this process was repeated for phycocyanin we compared our models using adjusted r2 and rmse with the chlorophyll a and phycocyanin nested band models from randolph et al 2008 which have been found to accurately predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations using hyperspectral data see table 1 for algorithms and see eqs 4 and 5 in randolph et al 2008 for complete algorithms we also compared our models with the cyanobacterial index ci and updated cyanobacterial index ci multi matthews et al 2012 as defined in coffer et al 2020 which allows chlorophyll a reflectance to be attributed to cyanobacteria based off the spectral shape at wavelength 665 to implement the ci and ci multi algorithms we first resampled our ground based hyperspectral data to match the bands of meris by calculating the average reflectance over the wavelengths included in each band then we calculated ci and ci multi following the methods of coffer et al 2020 the ci multi algorithm is intended to filter out samples where phytoplankton composition is dominated by non cyanobacteria as such we removed samples from further analysis including model fit calculations if the algorithm indicated cyanobacteria were not present ci and ci multi were converted to chlorophyll a µg l using the equation in seegers et al 2021 3 results 3 1 satellite models for chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations in small lakes the best chlorophyll a model built using oklahoma data n 1060 contained four landsat etm and oli band ratios blue green red blue blue nir and nir red table 3 7 1 chl a 71 8 37 3 blue green 10 1 red blue 6 6 blue nir 3 8 nir red based on the adjusted r2 rmse and pearson s r correlation coefficient our oklahoma derived model outperformed all other models table 3 1 6 although they had relatively low predictive power of the literature algorithms the kivu algorithm adapted from beck et al 2016 performed the best having the lowest rmse and highest adjusted r2 values although it had low predictability the remainder of the literature models performed poorly with little to no predictive power for algal pigments in oklahoma lakes table 3 1 6 the initial performance of our chlorophyll a model was poor this poor performance could be due in part to the skewed nature of our data with the majority of the chlorophyll a values falling between 2 and 30 µg l fig s1 to test if this skew in the data was causing poor prediction in the model we resampled chlorophyll a data to create a more even distribution specifically the original data was sorted into 30 intervals the intervals containing the chlorophyll a values 2 37 µg l intervals 2 8 were randomly subsampled without replacement to reduce the whole data set by approximately half n 511 fig s2 we retained all higher chlorophyll a values because while we believe the original data distribution is reflective of total chlorophyll a values seen annually in oklahoma lakes we are interested in predicting the higher chlorophyll a values that would be associated with a bloom we then applied the best chlorophyll a model eq 1 to the new data set n 511 and found the predictability did not improve from the full data set the literature algorithms were also tested on the reduced dataset and there was no improvement in performance table s4 1 6 all models including our own showed systematic bias where samples with medium to high 30 150 µg l observed chlorophyll a values had much lower predicted values never exceeding 30 µg l fig 4 a the best phycocyanin n 97 model built using oklahoma data used two band ratios blue green and red nir table 3 10 2 pcy 146 7 124 5 blue green 16 7 red nir this phycocyanin model underpredicted at higher values meaning it predicted much lower phycocyanin values than were observed fig 4b we also tested a phycocyanin model from the literature the vincent et al 2004 model on the oklahoma dataset the vincent et al 2004 model performed better than the model from this paper table 3 9 the chlorophyll a random forest model constructed using satellite data performed poorly only explaining 3 07 of the variance table 3 11 and it was not significantly different when tested against a null model built with the same data the phycocyanin random forest explained 32 9 of the variance and performed better than our linear two band ratio model but not as well as vincent s satellite phycocyanin model table 3 9 10 11 3 2 ground based models for chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations in small lakes to test the efficacy of ground based sensors at quantifying cyanohabs in oklahoma we built a semi empirical multispectral model using hyperspectral data taken from oklahoma lakes over a variety of conditions to predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations respectively the best chlorophyll a model included six band ratios 1 3 1 5 2 3 3 4 3 5 4 5 see table 2 for band information see eq s1 for full equation the ci ci multi and randolph et al 2008 chlorophyll a nested band ratio model were also applied to the oklahoma lakes data and resulted in slightly lower performance compared to our six band ratio multispectral model table 4 1 4 fig 5 our best phycocyanin model included seven band ratios 1 2 1 5 2 3 2 4 3 4 3 5 4 5 see table 2 for band information see eq s2 for full equation comparison of the predictions of our phycocyanin seven band ratio multispectral model with those of a common nested band ratio model randolph et al 2008 ci and ci multi revealed increased accuracy with the seven band ratio approach table 4 5 8 fig 6 4 discussion the frequency and magnitude of cyanohabs are increasing globally in pace with climate and land use change and increasing nutrient pollution huisman et al 2018 detecting and tracking blooms in a timely manner for risk management has proven to be difficult and costly almuhtaram et al 2021 remote sensing has the potential to alleviate the insufficiencies of traditional monitoring by providing fast and less expensive information while allowing the end user to monitor many lakes simultaneously ground based remote sensing has increased in popularity in recent years and appears more adaptable for many different systems and scenarios thus it could be better for monitoring cyanohabs here we assessed the possibility of using satellite and ground based remote sensing for quantifying cyanohabs in oklahoma reservoirs we were unsuccessful in finding a universal satellite pigment model for oklahoma lakes our landsat based models for chlorophyll a derived from oklahoma reservoirs were only marginally better than published algorithms and none of them were sufficiently predictive r2 0 035 for implementation in monitoring programs even though we were using mostly landsat 7 data our results corroborate those of beck et al 2016 who applied these algorithms to landsat 8 simulated imagery and found poor performance across the board except with the fluorescence line height violet algorithm we were unable to use this algorithm because landsat 7 lacks a comparable band to landsat 8 s coastal aerosol band 1 0 435 0 451 nm used in the algorithm while it was our best performing literature algorithm we expected better performance from the kivu 3 band like algorithm because it performed well on lake garda when adapted from meris bands to landsat 5 tm bands brivio et al 2001 which are comparable to landsat 7 etm bands the other algorithms were originally created using other sensors such as meris and modis or hyperspectral data that was translated to match landsat satellite bands this cross sensor translation was likely another contributor to the poor performance of the models beck et al 2016 the poor prediction of the algorithm may also reflect the size of our data set consisting of 1060 paired data points much larger than previous studies and a large number of waterbodies used n 38 the reflectance values we measured ranged from 0 0025 to 0 37 and landsat surface reflectance values ranged from 0 to 1 meaning instrument saturation is unlikely the cause of the poor performance landsat surface reflectance data 2015 instead this prediction bias is likely due to the distribution of the original data where the majority of the chlorophyll a values ranged 2 30 µg l considering the wide temporal nature of our data 2001 2017 all months retained we believe this chlorophyll a distribution is representative of natural conditions even when the data were subsampled to reduce the potential bias of abundant values in the low medium chlorophyll a range the models did not improve in accurately predicting chlorophyll a the previously published models also displayed this bias with no model accurately predicting values of chlorophyll a greater than 30 µg l and following a similar shape as displayed in fig 4a with the lack of correspondence between high observed and predicted chlorophyll a values it seems unlikely a universal landsat algorithm will accurately predict chlorophyll a concentrations in oklahoma the phycocyanin satellite models performed better than the chlorophyll a models and specifically the phycocyanin model from vincent et al 2004 outperformed our model table 3 the better performance by the phycocyanin models was a surprising finding considering current landsat sensor bands are not optimized for detecting phycocyanin this pigment found only in cyanobacteria is characterized by an absorption trough around 621 nm almuhtaram et al 2021 due to the lack of a specific band for phycocyanin cyanobacteria are detected using bands associated with chlorophyll a when using landsat satellites making cyanobacteria frequently indistinguishable from aquatic macrophytes oyama et al 2015 the detection of cyanobacteria is also confounded by turbidity as bands commonly used in chlorophyll a retrieval algorithms are susceptible to interference by suspended sediment almuhtaram et al 2021 shi et al 2019 in fact others have hypothesized the vincent et al 2004 algorithm is simply detecting turbidity or chlorophyll a which are correlated with phycocyanin hunter et al 2010 the phycocyanin dataset n 97 was an order of magnitude smaller than chlorophyll a dataset and only represented two lakes lake thunderbird and lake texoma the small number of lakes could contribute to the increased predictability in these models potentially due to a decrease in noise by fewer optical characteristic combinations in the data as discussed above since our phycocyanin model outperformed our chlorophyll a model we suggest implementing the phycocyanin model if satellites are the only possible source of spectral data unlike chlorophyll a phycocyanin has been shown to be well correlated with cyanobacterial biomass thomson lang 2020 we utilized multiple commonly used metrics for determining model performance of the satellite models including r2 rmse and pearson s r the next step would be to validate these models by collecting additional ground reference data and using the independent dataset to measure model performance we did not do this for the chlorophyll a and phycocyanin landsat models simply due to their poor performance on the initial data pool as for our random forest models built using satellite data the chlorophyll a random forest regression model performed better than all of the literature models but slightly worse than our satellite linear model the phycocyanin random forest model was better than our model but not better than the best phycocyanin model the vincent model we thought because random forests are based on non linear models that they would outperform the multiple linear regression models in our dataset but this was not the case while random forest modeling is a newer machine learning approach that might be touted as a better solution to model problems one of the drawbacks is the difficulty of implementation of the model as you cannot see the model or report a formula describing the forest trying more sophisticated modeling techniques may not be the correct solution if your underlying data is not showing any predictive trends using simpler modeling methods many of the current standard algorithms were calibrated or validated on very few ground reference data points from a small number of lakes literature algorithms were calibrated on five or fewer lakes the number of unique optical characteristics such as different colors and levels of turbidity and suspended solids would likely increase with lake number thus increasing the overall variability in satellite reflectance values one of the obvious goals of universal algorithms is to predict cyanohabs across many different lakes and seasons therefore we think it is important to include a wide range of training data for model building the lack of representative training data could be why the published satellite based algorithms for which training data does not include data from oklahoma lakes perform worse than our model on oklahoma lakes given the failure of satellite based models in predicting chlorophyll a within a single u s state we are doubtful that a truly universal model can be developed the disconnect between satellite observations and actual pigment concentrations could also be due to satellite sensors not capturing all water leaving reflectance due to atmospheric interference or cloud cover and not capturing data below the surface of the water column because the satellite sensors only measure chlorophyll a at the surface but in situ measurements of chlorophyll a are generally taken across the photic zone for mid column bloom formers this would cause mid column blooming cyanobacteria or well mixed blooms to appear less concentrated or less pigmented than surface blooms coffer et al 2021a in oklahoma lakes for example we frequently experience raphidiopsis blooms and other non surface bloomers antunes et al 2015 these problems would be less of an issue for ground based sensors that are not affected by atmospheric aerosols and when suspended close to the water surface can capture a large majority of the water leaving reflectance our ground based multispectral models reliably predicted both chlorophyll a and phycocyanin in oklahoma lakes and performed remarkably better than the satellite models the chlorophyll a six band ratio model we developed slightly outperformed randolph et al 2008 nested band ratio chlorophyll a model with both models having similar r2 values the ci and ci multi performed substantially worse than our model and randolph et al 2008 model all four models generally underpredicted at very high levels of chlorophyll a our phycocyanin seven band ratio model outperformed the phycocyanin nested band ratio model from randolph et al 2008 the ci model and ci multi model notably our model performed better on extreme phycocyanin values 50 µg l compared with the established model which had systematic underprediction of high phycocyanin events while coffer et al 2021b 2021a 2020 and handler et al 2023 have successfully used meris and olci data to detect cyanobacteria in larger oklahoma reservoirs we did not corroborate these results with our simulated data the ci multi includes a filtering step with the aim of removing non cyanobacterial blooms after calculating the ci coffer et al 2020 this filtering step is meant to remove samples that are not from cyanobacteria dominated systems i e classified as ci noncyano this step seemed to fail in our system with 87 samples filtered out with the exception of one high outlier the phycocyanin in these samples ranged between 3 and 71 µg l phycocyanin which are low to moderate levels of phycocyanin we know that many of the lakes removed at this step are cyanobacteria dominated systems for example both lake texoma and grand lake o the cherokees have a rich history of cyanobacteria blooms this failure of the ci multi algorithm is problematic because predicting these low to moderate phycocyanin concentrations allows us to detect blooms as they develop if detected early measures may be taken to lower risks to humans like closing swim beaches and posting educational signs false negatives model returning no bloom when blooms are present could lead to failure to act to protect the public pets and livestock our ground based models including the simulated ci models outperformed all of the landsat models the poor performance of landsat models is possibly due in part to the landsat s band limitations with limited band number and wavelength range we found that even with a variety of algorithms employing different band math strategies landsat was not useful for detecting pigments in reservoirs researchers have moved away from using band ratios in recent years in favor of spectral shape algorithms such as ci or maximum peak height algorithms coffer et al 2020 matthews and odermatt 2015 we did find that our satellite models relying on band ratios were substantially worse than the ci models our results suggest that satellites where the ci could be implemented such as sentinel 3 would be better able to detect cyanobacteria blooms than landsat in oklahoma we found that ground based instruments show more promise than satellite based instruments for monitoring cyanohabs but other methods exist for cyanobacteria bloom detection with different accuracy scale and cost trade offs these alternative approaches include various satellite sensors ground based remote sensing airplane based sensors and fluorometry options satellites with freely available images excel in the category of low cost but as we have demonstrated they lack accuracy and do not sample at spatial scales relevant to small or dendritic reservoirs fig s6 additionally clouds are often an underestimated problem in collecting regular satellite images which may limit timely detection of algal blooms ju and roy 2008 as we have shown ground based remote sensing offers high accuracy at a fine scale but has an upfront cost for multi or hyper spectral sensors as a bonus such sensors could be deployed aerially giving broader coverage for example the national ecological observatory network neon has deployed airplane based hyperspectral sensors at neon sites to measure land cover and vegetation metrics at a fine scale without the interference of clouds https www neonscience org data collection imaging spectrometer one trade off of ground based sensors is they are spatially limited compared to satellites a multispectral sensor suspended above a lake would cover a very small area a sensor attached to a drone or airplane would afford increased spatial coverage at the limitation of drone battery life or airplane fly time another option deployed sondes have high up front and maintenance costs but provide highly accurate measurements on a fine scale manual sampling of water followed by in lab extraction of chlorophyll has a high cost of human hours but is accurate and operates on a fine scale almuhtaram et al 2021 given our results we suggest that ground based remote sensing offers the best of both worlds in terms of cost accuracy and scale for many scenarios however the needs of the researcher or water quality manager will determine which of these approaches best meet their needs based on cost accuracy and scale our finding that models using ground based multispectral data better predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations compared to models built using landsat imagery is likely applicable to small lakes and reservoirs around the globe though transferring models such as ours to other systems may require additional ground reference data and model adjustment that is we do not propose our model as a universal model but rather we suggest our approach of ground based remote sensing coupled with custom spectral bands and band ratios the lakes we analyzed in oklahoma range from 49 to 42 695 hectares in size table s1 and are representative of smaller lakes and reservoirs across the southern great plains there are millions of small lakes in the world verpoorter et al 2014 cael and seekell 2016 and reservoirs cover approximately 0 26 mkm2 globally downing et al 2006 many of these small waterbodies experience cyanohabs that cannot be clearly resolved by larger satellite pixels because of this resolution limitation small lakes and reservoirs are likely underrepresented in remote sensing monitoring programs while landsat has the appropriate pixel size for sensing small waterbodies it does not have a band useful for detecting phycocyanin as previously concluded by beck et al 2016 future satellite based remote sensing for cyanohabs will require higher resolution 30 m pixels or less and more appropriate bands that are narrower and similar to those of worldview 2 3 and sentinel 3 in the meantime ground based sensors offer an excellent alternative for small to mid sized lakes timely and effective monitoring of water quality in small to moderate size lakes cannot rely on satellite sensors with inappropriate spatial resolution and spectral band design instead we recommend the novel and herein demonstrated successful approach of ground based remote sensing with customized bands our approach will be a valuable addition to water quality monitoring efforts in small and dendritic reservoirs 5 conclusion based on a multi year multi lake comparison of in situ algal pigment data with landsat and ground derived reflectance models we conclude that oklahoma derived landsat and ground based models outperform established reflectance pigment models for oklahoma reservoirs ground based multispectral models are superior to landsat based models for predicting cyanohabs in oklahoma reservoirs ground based and multispectral sensors can offer cost efficient solutions for cyanohab monitoring in small to mid sized lakes where satellite images may not be appropriate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14635,cyanobacteria are the most prevalent bloom forming harmful algae in freshwater systems around the world adequate sampling of affected systems is limited spatially temporally and fiscally remote sensing using space or ground based systems in large water bodies at spatial and temporal scales that are cost prohibitive to standard water quality monitoring has proven to be useful in detecting and quantifying cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms this study aimed to identify a regional universal multispectral reflectance model that could be used for rapid remote detection and quantification of cyanohabs in small to medium sized productive reservoirs such as those typical of oklahoma usa we aimed to include these small waterbodies in our study as they are typically overlooked in larger continental wide studies yet are widely distributed and used for recreation and drinking water supply we used landsat satellite reflectance and in situ pigment data spanning 16 years from 38 reservoirs in oklahoma to construct empirical linear models for predicting concentrations of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin two key algal pigments commonly used for assessing total and cyanobacterial algal abundances respectively we also used ground based hyperspectral reflectance and in situ pigment data from seven reservoirs across five years in oklahoma to build multispectral models predicting algal pigments from newly defined reflectance bands our oklahoma derived landsat and ground based models outperformed established reflectance pigment models on oklahoma reservoirs importantly our results demonstrate that ground based multispectral models were far superior to landsat based models and the cyanobacteria index ci for detecting cyanohabs in highly productive small to mid sized reservoirs in oklahoma providing a valuable tool for water management and public health while satellite based remote sensing approaches have proven effective for relatively large systems our novel results indicate that ground based remote sensing may offer better cyanohab monitoring for small or highly dendritic turbid lakes such as those throughout the southern great plains and thus prove beneficial to efforts aimed at minimizing public health risks associated with cyanohabs in supply and recreational waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria remote sensing chlorophyll a phycocyanin water quality harmful algal bloom monitoring data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs in freshwaters are a topic of global concern paerl and barnard 2020 blooms are increasing in frequency and magnitude due in part to increased anthropogenic nutrient loading paerl and paul 2012 cyanohabs are particularly problematic because many species of harmful algae produce toxins that pose health risks to humans and other animals through exposure by toxin consumption inhalation and topical contact hambright et al 2014 hilborn and beasley 2015 plaas and paerl 2021 while some cyanotoxins may be only dermatotoxic producing mild to moderate allergic reactions common cyanotoxins such as microcystin cylindrospermopsin saxitoxin and anatoxin are powerful hepato and neurotoxins that can cause chronic illness and death with increasing threats of cyanohab development in inland waters there is an equally increasing need for rigorous monitoring for cyanobacteria and their toxins to minimize public health risk associated with cyanohabs paerl and barnard 2020 unfortunately cyanohab monitoring today is highly insufficient for the needs of health risk management almuhtaram et al 2021 historically cyanohab assessment has been based on standard limnological monitoring of water quality with focus on criteria such as water clarity or concentrations of chlorophyll a and nutrients monitoring of cyanohab densities and cyanotoxins requires specialized skill and instrumentation and is thus generally conducted routinely only in lakes that provide water supply to large metropolitan communities similar routine cyanohab monitoring for the vast majority of lakes and reservoirs in rural settings is physically and economically impractical almuhtaram et al 2021 high frequency autonomous monitoring is possible with expensive high maintenance monitoring platforms coad et al 2014 however sufficient spatial coverage particularly for moderate to large sized dendritic reservoirs with tens to hundreds of semi enclosed bays and coves areas with high recreational use would be prohibitively expensive to minimize potential health risks associated with cyanohab toxin exposure in such systems lake management and public health agencies need new tools that are amenable to broad and simple implementation across multiple and diverse systems particularly those supporting high recreational tourism an early solution to the monitoring needs of public health protection emerged as remote measurement of solar reflectance by satellite based sensors was shown to be effective and economically beneficial in assessing general chlorophyll a concentrations in surface waters gons et al 2002 stroming et al 2020 satellite imagers have the potential to allow monitoring without the expensive person hours and equipment required for a physical visit to a lake or a permanent autosampler profiler due to their large spatial coverage 900 90 000 m2 which can collect images for many lakes simultaneously and their fine temporal resolution daily to fortnightly flyovers depending on satellite obviously satellites are expensive but many currently in use for earth observations were launched by public entities that offer users open access data images thus providing lake managers a low cost option for surface water observation successful application of satellite based remote sensing to cyanohab assessment particularly for large waterbodies coffer et al 2020 urquhart et al 2017 wynne et al 2010 has fueled a search for universal models that can predict concentrations of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin two key algal pigments commonly used for assessing total and cyanobacterial algal abundances shi et al 2019 however there are well known limitations that may interfere with a satellite based approach including significant loss of usable images due to cloud cover ju and roy 2008 and sun glint contamination overstreet and legleiter 2017 moreover satellite sensors frequently used for remote sensing of habs moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis aboard the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa terra and aqua satellites medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris aboard the european space agency s esa envisat 1 satellite and ocean land colour instrument olci a follow up to esa s meris were built for a combination of atmosphere terrestrial and oceanic applications barnes et al 1998 nieke et al 2012 rast et al 1999 the sensors on these satellites quantify reflectance from relatively large areas e g 250 250 to 500 500 m in each pixel this resolution is not amenable for observing most inland lakes and reservoirs that are either too small or are highly dendritic in structure such that many water pixels can be contaminated by littoral shoreline and terrestrial reflectance verpoorter et al 2014 wetzel 2001 additionally water levels in smaller water bodies fluctuate seasonally making the delineation between water and non water contamination notoriously difficult zou et al 2017 especially with low spatial resolution instruments these spatial resolution limitations have led to a lack of data for smaller waterbodies in the remote sensing literature and the call for development and use of satellites with spatial resolutions of 30 30 m or smaller beck et al 2016 urquhart et al 2017 coffer et al 2020 an alternative to satellite based remote sensing is the use of ground based sensors which do not suffer from the previously mentioned satellite limitations like atmospheric interference wu et al 2019 ground based instruments with multispectral sensors have many advantages to satellites like the ability to capture images with very fine spatial resolution flexible temporal resolution and rapid data turn around time studies suggest ground based instruments will provide better capability for monitoring cyanohabs than satellite based remote sensing wu et al 2019 there are commercially available sensors for use on ground based instruments but most were designed for terrestrial application no commercially available sensors have a band designed specifically for phycocyanin fernandez figueroa et al 2021 found commercially available cameras and multispectral sensors were more sensitive to chlorophyll a than phycocyanin in eutrophic ponds multispectral sensors built for detection of phycocyanin are needed for adequate monitoring of cyanohabs almuhtaram et al 2021 fernandez figueroa et al 2021 in this study we sought a universal multispectral reflectance model that could be used for rapid remote detection and quantification of cyanohabs in reservoirs that are relatively small or highly dendritic productive and often turbid like those in oklahoma we aimed to explore the effectiveness of satellite based multispectral models for predicting chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations in oklahoman reservoirs in comparison to new ground based multispectral models derived from the same oklahoma systems our results show that the published models had little to no predictive power with respect to assessing cyanohabs in a study system outside those used to establish the models and that ground based sensors and multispectral models particularly for phycocyanin were far superior to landsat based sensors and models for assessing cyanohabs in small dendritic productive reservoirs in oklahoma 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites oklahoma is an ideal study system for turbid small to medium sized reservoirs the majority of oklahoma lakes are smaller than the average american football field i e ca 0 5 ha zou et al 2017 or are highly dendritic with high shoreline to surface area ratios aka shoreline development wetzel 2001 oklahoma lakes are typical of lakes in the southern great plains with high turbidity high chlorophyll a and frequent cyanohabs oklahoma water resources board 2017 lakes in oklahoma are used primarily for water supply and recreation and therefore monitoring harmful algal blooms is necessary to protect public health smithee et al 2012 with these characteristics in mind we compared reflectance algal pigment models using landsat satellite data and ground based hyperspectral reflectance we built empirical models relating satellite spectral reflectance to chlorophyll a table s1 and phycocyanin table s2 concentrations from 38 lakes n 1060 paired observations sampled between 2001 2017 and ground based reflectance to chlorophyll a n 124 and phycocyanin n 125 concentrations from 7 lakes sampled between 2012 2016 see fig 1 a and b for map of sample locations we also compared our oklahoma specific models to published models 2 2 satellite reflectance data the enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and operational land imager oli are multispectral sensors onboard the landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellites respectively that consist of different spectral bands etm has eight bands and oli has 11 bands that record select areas of the electromagnetic spectrum please see irons et al 2012 for details on the sensors and bands these two satellites were chosen over other potential sensors e g meris olci msi for this study due to the relatively small pixel size 30 30 m of the etm and oli sensors and the eight day revisit time between the satellites sentinel 3a olci was not chosen due to its large pixel size of 300 m which is difficult to resolve on small dendritic oklahoma reservoirs see fig s6 for landsat and sentinel 3a image comparison and it only became operational in 2016 years after much of our in situ water sampling sentinel 2a msi has a smaller pixel size 10 and 20 m to landsat 30 m and a few more spectral bands that might be more useful than landsat one limitation of sentinel 2a msi much like landsat is that it does not have a spectral band to measure phycocyanin in addition it was launched in 2015 after which only 7 of our in situ samples occurred thus use of sentinel 2a msi would markedly decrease the data available for modeling in this study surface reflectance data were obtained from eros data center sioux falls sd usgs for each site date combination surface reflectance data are generated by the usgs from level 1 digital number dn products by applying a modis 6s atmospheric correction routine using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps software masek et al 2006 images n 247 were matched with in situ measurements within a 7 day window of the sampling date ensuring a difference of no more than seven days between the satellite image and the in situ measurements this window was informed by a concurrent study measuring temporal autocorrelation in cyanobacterial blooms in oklahoma beyer and hambright 2017 which showed that proxies chlorophyll a and phycocyanin for cyanobacterial abundance during bloom periods were strongly temporally autocorrelated over a period of 10 11 days images were visually screened for cloud cover and excluded if the lake area had 10 cloud cover since july 14 2003 the landsat 7 etm scan line corrector has been turned off due to an instrument failure leaving stripes of missing data across images markham et al 2004 to minimize the potential impact of missing data and to account for the anchored swing radius of the boat under changing winds and currents we averaged reflectance values from nine pixels a 3 3 grid consisting of the sampling point pixel and the eight surrounding pixels for each site this approach maximized the number of usable data points and achieved the most representative sample for each reflectance measure baban 1993 reflectance data were extracted from images using r r development core team 2014 see supplemental for code the data were then plotted and screened for high reflectance outliers reflectance greater than 1 water reflectance is much lower than land reflectance so high reflectance values could indicate shoreline or bottom interference or an object e g a boat in the pixel 2 3 ground based reflectance data we collected in situ hyperspectral reflectance data from seven lakes see fig 1c for map over a period spanning 2012 2016 using an asd fieldspec spectroradiometer malvern panalytical malvern united kingdom at each lake the asd was calibrated using a spectralon reflectance panel labsphere north sutton nh usa at each pelagic site n 14 and shoreline site on lake thunderbird n 12 the optical probe was held over the non shaded side of the boat or boat dock at a 45 degree angle to the water and five spectra were recorded these five spectra were averaged for each site to minimize the impact of sun glint or water waves and the resulting spectra were used in downstream analyses for many of these lakes we had repeat visits to multiple sites table s3 and where feasible we took measurements at multiple locations on the lake to increase our spatial coverage in total we collected hyperspectral data from 132 site date combinations quality control and quality assurance were performed on the spectra spectra were visually examined and six spectra were discarded three due to the loss of the raw files one due to an abnormal horizontal spike at 1000 nm one due to abnormal low reflectance values and another due to an outlier in the limnological data each spectrum was matched with same day in situ pigment data one additional site date combination was discarded due to lack of corresponding limnological data and another was missing only chlorophyll a data the final working sample size was 125 for phycocyanin and 124 for chlorophyll a 2 4 in situ surface water pigment data each satellite image and ground based measurement has a corresponding pigment measurement from an oklahoma lake these data were collected by personnel in the plankton ecology and limnology lab pell at the university of oklahoma as well as the oklahoma water resources board owrb and the grand river dam authority grda for the satellite dataset 38 lakes were sampled between 2001 2017 for a total of 1060 chlorophyll a data points fig s1 table s1 and 97 phycocyanin data points fig s3 table 2 for the ground based measurements seven lakes were sampled between 2012 2016 for a total of 124 chlorophyll a fig s4 table s3 and 125 phycocyanin data points fig s5 table s3 lake sampling by pell is briefly summarized here for details see hambright et al 2010 at each site a hydrolab ds5x ott hydromet kempten germany sonde was used to measure phycocyanin pcy concentrations starting in 2009 although pcy in nature will generally be bound within cells the hydrolab pcy sensor was calibrated using serial dilutions of biologically relevant levels of pure pcy solution sigma aldrich and thus provides an underestimate of the actual amount of pcy in lakes nevertheless relative changes can still provide meaningful insight into seasonality and site to site comparisons such pcy measurements have previously been found to correlate with cyanobacterial biomass thomson laing et al 2020 at deeper sites measurements were taken in the upper 10 m of the water column at 1 m intervals and at shallow sites measurements were taken at 0 5 meter intervals through the entire water column on average around 2 m phycocyanin measurements were averaged across the photic zone as determined by a li cor light meter li cor biosciences lincoln ne usa or 2 5 times the secchi depth for acetone extracted chlorophyll a depth integrated water samples were taken from the photic zone depth or the entire water column whichever was shallower and placed into acid washed deionized and sample rinsed nalgene bottles and kept on ice prior to filtration the water was filtered onto 25 mm diameter gf f filters and stored in the freezer until chlorophyll a extraction in a reduced light environment the filters were homogenized with a small volume of 70 acetone using a mortar and pestle then incubated in 70 acetone at 4 8 c for 6 24 h samples were centrifuged prior to analysis on a turner designs 700 pre 2012 or trilogy 2012 present bench top fluorometers arar and collins 1997 the owrb and grda collected water samples from the upper 0 5 m for chlorophyll analysis the agencies did not measure phycocyanin and both used the previously described epa chlorophyll a acetone extraction method for the satellite dataset owrb contributed 836 data points grda contributed 56 and pell contributed a total of 168 for the ground based dataset all chlorophyll a n 124 and phycocyanin n 125 pigment data points were contributed by pell 2 5 landsat multispectral models to quantify cyanohabs in oklahoma we built empirical linear regression models using the chlorophyll a phycocyanin and satellite reflectance values see fig 2 for methods diagram we used landsat band ratios as our predictors because spectral ratios have been shown to be more robust than single bands vincent et al 2004 we eliminated potential collinearity in the models using variance inflation factors vif by sequentially removing the predictors with the highest vif score until all scores were at the predetermined threshold of 10 zuur et al 2010 the spectral ratios used to determine the final chlorophyll a model included the following band ratios blue green red blue green red blue near infared nir and nir red and in the pcy model blue green green red nir red and red nir we used bayesian information criterion bic to select the model that explained the most variance in the response variable using the fewest predictors schwarz 1978 all statistical analyses were completed in the r environment version 4 2 1 to test how published models effectively predicted cyanohabs in oklahoma lakes we applied a set of chlorophyll a algorithms adapted to landsat 7 from the landsat 8 models landsat 8 bands 2 6 match landsat 7 bands 1 5 in beck et al 2016 table 1 the algorithms from the literature include the normalized difference chlorophyll index ndci mishra and mishra 2012 the surface algal bloom index sabi alawadi 2010 the fluorescence line height algorithm focusing on the blue band flh blue zhao et al 2010 the two band algorithm 2bda gitelson et al 2003 the three band algorithm 3bda dall olmo and gitelson 2005 and the three band like algorithm kivu brivio et al 2001 kneubühler et al 2007 we also used one established phycocyanin landsat algorithm from the literature vincent et al 2004 to compare with our landsat phycocyanin model table 1 these algorithms were chosen in part because they were built using landsat bands or because they have been shown to successfully predict chlorophyll a or phycocyanin each of the previously mentioned chlorophyll a models was applied to our oklahoma satellite reflectance data set n 1060 and compared to in situ chlorophyll a values to determine model accuracy as per the original use each algorithm was solved prior to regressing meaning there is a single regression coefficient for each algorithm for the vincent et al 2004 phycocyanin algorithm we fit a regression coefficient to each spectral ratio as was done in the original model to assess the fit of the regressions we compared the in situ observed pigment values with the predicted algorithm pigment values and evaluated the relationship using the root mean square error rmse lower values indicate better model fit and pearson s r correlation test range from 1 to 1 with numbers closer to 0 indicating no correlation table 3 we also report the adjusted r2 of each regression as this is a direct measure of model predictability ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values being more predictive in addition to the above described empirical models we built random forest models to explore the utility of machine learning as an approach for generating useful predictive models we used the randomforest function in the randomforest package in r liaw and wiener 2002 to grow random forests with ntree 500 for both chlorophyll a and phycocyanin models we used the non collinear predictors described above for the linear models we chose regression random forest because we are most interested in prediction across a range of pigment values and they are more comparable to previously described linear models we evaluated model performance similarly to the linear models using rmse and r2 but in addition we tested significance against a null model we extracted the performance statistics and significance using the rfutilities package in r using the rf regression and rf significance functions respectively https cran r project org web packages utility index html 2 6 ground based multispectral models we built a semi empirical model using the ground based measurements by first selecting five bands based on spectral properties of optical constituents of cyanobacteria and other non target components that could affect reflectance of light from oklahoma reservoirs specifically chlorophyll a phycocyanin and turbidity see fig 3 for methods diagram the medians of the bands were based on published values matthews 2011 and the width of the bands were optimized by comparing correlations of candidate bands with our measured optical constituents table 2 we calculated the average reflectance over the wavelengths included in the band using the bands described in table 2 we constructed candidate linear models for chlorophyll a including all possible combinations of ratios of the five bands and selected the best model using the corrected akaike information criterion aicc as prediction was our goal and not inferring causality we moved forward in analyzing the model with the lowest aicc value this process was repeated for phycocyanin we compared our models using adjusted r2 and rmse with the chlorophyll a and phycocyanin nested band models from randolph et al 2008 which have been found to accurately predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations using hyperspectral data see table 1 for algorithms and see eqs 4 and 5 in randolph et al 2008 for complete algorithms we also compared our models with the cyanobacterial index ci and updated cyanobacterial index ci multi matthews et al 2012 as defined in coffer et al 2020 which allows chlorophyll a reflectance to be attributed to cyanobacteria based off the spectral shape at wavelength 665 to implement the ci and ci multi algorithms we first resampled our ground based hyperspectral data to match the bands of meris by calculating the average reflectance over the wavelengths included in each band then we calculated ci and ci multi following the methods of coffer et al 2020 the ci multi algorithm is intended to filter out samples where phytoplankton composition is dominated by non cyanobacteria as such we removed samples from further analysis including model fit calculations if the algorithm indicated cyanobacteria were not present ci and ci multi were converted to chlorophyll a µg l using the equation in seegers et al 2021 3 results 3 1 satellite models for chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations in small lakes the best chlorophyll a model built using oklahoma data n 1060 contained four landsat etm and oli band ratios blue green red blue blue nir and nir red table 3 7 1 chl a 71 8 37 3 blue green 10 1 red blue 6 6 blue nir 3 8 nir red based on the adjusted r2 rmse and pearson s r correlation coefficient our oklahoma derived model outperformed all other models table 3 1 6 although they had relatively low predictive power of the literature algorithms the kivu algorithm adapted from beck et al 2016 performed the best having the lowest rmse and highest adjusted r2 values although it had low predictability the remainder of the literature models performed poorly with little to no predictive power for algal pigments in oklahoma lakes table 3 1 6 the initial performance of our chlorophyll a model was poor this poor performance could be due in part to the skewed nature of our data with the majority of the chlorophyll a values falling between 2 and 30 µg l fig s1 to test if this skew in the data was causing poor prediction in the model we resampled chlorophyll a data to create a more even distribution specifically the original data was sorted into 30 intervals the intervals containing the chlorophyll a values 2 37 µg l intervals 2 8 were randomly subsampled without replacement to reduce the whole data set by approximately half n 511 fig s2 we retained all higher chlorophyll a values because while we believe the original data distribution is reflective of total chlorophyll a values seen annually in oklahoma lakes we are interested in predicting the higher chlorophyll a values that would be associated with a bloom we then applied the best chlorophyll a model eq 1 to the new data set n 511 and found the predictability did not improve from the full data set the literature algorithms were also tested on the reduced dataset and there was no improvement in performance table s4 1 6 all models including our own showed systematic bias where samples with medium to high 30 150 µg l observed chlorophyll a values had much lower predicted values never exceeding 30 µg l fig 4 a the best phycocyanin n 97 model built using oklahoma data used two band ratios blue green and red nir table 3 10 2 pcy 146 7 124 5 blue green 16 7 red nir this phycocyanin model underpredicted at higher values meaning it predicted much lower phycocyanin values than were observed fig 4b we also tested a phycocyanin model from the literature the vincent et al 2004 model on the oklahoma dataset the vincent et al 2004 model performed better than the model from this paper table 3 9 the chlorophyll a random forest model constructed using satellite data performed poorly only explaining 3 07 of the variance table 3 11 and it was not significantly different when tested against a null model built with the same data the phycocyanin random forest explained 32 9 of the variance and performed better than our linear two band ratio model but not as well as vincent s satellite phycocyanin model table 3 9 10 11 3 2 ground based models for chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations in small lakes to test the efficacy of ground based sensors at quantifying cyanohabs in oklahoma we built a semi empirical multispectral model using hyperspectral data taken from oklahoma lakes over a variety of conditions to predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations respectively the best chlorophyll a model included six band ratios 1 3 1 5 2 3 3 4 3 5 4 5 see table 2 for band information see eq s1 for full equation the ci ci multi and randolph et al 2008 chlorophyll a nested band ratio model were also applied to the oklahoma lakes data and resulted in slightly lower performance compared to our six band ratio multispectral model table 4 1 4 fig 5 our best phycocyanin model included seven band ratios 1 2 1 5 2 3 2 4 3 4 3 5 4 5 see table 2 for band information see eq s2 for full equation comparison of the predictions of our phycocyanin seven band ratio multispectral model with those of a common nested band ratio model randolph et al 2008 ci and ci multi revealed increased accuracy with the seven band ratio approach table 4 5 8 fig 6 4 discussion the frequency and magnitude of cyanohabs are increasing globally in pace with climate and land use change and increasing nutrient pollution huisman et al 2018 detecting and tracking blooms in a timely manner for risk management has proven to be difficult and costly almuhtaram et al 2021 remote sensing has the potential to alleviate the insufficiencies of traditional monitoring by providing fast and less expensive information while allowing the end user to monitor many lakes simultaneously ground based remote sensing has increased in popularity in recent years and appears more adaptable for many different systems and scenarios thus it could be better for monitoring cyanohabs here we assessed the possibility of using satellite and ground based remote sensing for quantifying cyanohabs in oklahoma reservoirs we were unsuccessful in finding a universal satellite pigment model for oklahoma lakes our landsat based models for chlorophyll a derived from oklahoma reservoirs were only marginally better than published algorithms and none of them were sufficiently predictive r2 0 035 for implementation in monitoring programs even though we were using mostly landsat 7 data our results corroborate those of beck et al 2016 who applied these algorithms to landsat 8 simulated imagery and found poor performance across the board except with the fluorescence line height violet algorithm we were unable to use this algorithm because landsat 7 lacks a comparable band to landsat 8 s coastal aerosol band 1 0 435 0 451 nm used in the algorithm while it was our best performing literature algorithm we expected better performance from the kivu 3 band like algorithm because it performed well on lake garda when adapted from meris bands to landsat 5 tm bands brivio et al 2001 which are comparable to landsat 7 etm bands the other algorithms were originally created using other sensors such as meris and modis or hyperspectral data that was translated to match landsat satellite bands this cross sensor translation was likely another contributor to the poor performance of the models beck et al 2016 the poor prediction of the algorithm may also reflect the size of our data set consisting of 1060 paired data points much larger than previous studies and a large number of waterbodies used n 38 the reflectance values we measured ranged from 0 0025 to 0 37 and landsat surface reflectance values ranged from 0 to 1 meaning instrument saturation is unlikely the cause of the poor performance landsat surface reflectance data 2015 instead this prediction bias is likely due to the distribution of the original data where the majority of the chlorophyll a values ranged 2 30 µg l considering the wide temporal nature of our data 2001 2017 all months retained we believe this chlorophyll a distribution is representative of natural conditions even when the data were subsampled to reduce the potential bias of abundant values in the low medium chlorophyll a range the models did not improve in accurately predicting chlorophyll a the previously published models also displayed this bias with no model accurately predicting values of chlorophyll a greater than 30 µg l and following a similar shape as displayed in fig 4a with the lack of correspondence between high observed and predicted chlorophyll a values it seems unlikely a universal landsat algorithm will accurately predict chlorophyll a concentrations in oklahoma the phycocyanin satellite models performed better than the chlorophyll a models and specifically the phycocyanin model from vincent et al 2004 outperformed our model table 3 the better performance by the phycocyanin models was a surprising finding considering current landsat sensor bands are not optimized for detecting phycocyanin this pigment found only in cyanobacteria is characterized by an absorption trough around 621 nm almuhtaram et al 2021 due to the lack of a specific band for phycocyanin cyanobacteria are detected using bands associated with chlorophyll a when using landsat satellites making cyanobacteria frequently indistinguishable from aquatic macrophytes oyama et al 2015 the detection of cyanobacteria is also confounded by turbidity as bands commonly used in chlorophyll a retrieval algorithms are susceptible to interference by suspended sediment almuhtaram et al 2021 shi et al 2019 in fact others have hypothesized the vincent et al 2004 algorithm is simply detecting turbidity or chlorophyll a which are correlated with phycocyanin hunter et al 2010 the phycocyanin dataset n 97 was an order of magnitude smaller than chlorophyll a dataset and only represented two lakes lake thunderbird and lake texoma the small number of lakes could contribute to the increased predictability in these models potentially due to a decrease in noise by fewer optical characteristic combinations in the data as discussed above since our phycocyanin model outperformed our chlorophyll a model we suggest implementing the phycocyanin model if satellites are the only possible source of spectral data unlike chlorophyll a phycocyanin has been shown to be well correlated with cyanobacterial biomass thomson lang 2020 we utilized multiple commonly used metrics for determining model performance of the satellite models including r2 rmse and pearson s r the next step would be to validate these models by collecting additional ground reference data and using the independent dataset to measure model performance we did not do this for the chlorophyll a and phycocyanin landsat models simply due to their poor performance on the initial data pool as for our random forest models built using satellite data the chlorophyll a random forest regression model performed better than all of the literature models but slightly worse than our satellite linear model the phycocyanin random forest model was better than our model but not better than the best phycocyanin model the vincent model we thought because random forests are based on non linear models that they would outperform the multiple linear regression models in our dataset but this was not the case while random forest modeling is a newer machine learning approach that might be touted as a better solution to model problems one of the drawbacks is the difficulty of implementation of the model as you cannot see the model or report a formula describing the forest trying more sophisticated modeling techniques may not be the correct solution if your underlying data is not showing any predictive trends using simpler modeling methods many of the current standard algorithms were calibrated or validated on very few ground reference data points from a small number of lakes literature algorithms were calibrated on five or fewer lakes the number of unique optical characteristics such as different colors and levels of turbidity and suspended solids would likely increase with lake number thus increasing the overall variability in satellite reflectance values one of the obvious goals of universal algorithms is to predict cyanohabs across many different lakes and seasons therefore we think it is important to include a wide range of training data for model building the lack of representative training data could be why the published satellite based algorithms for which training data does not include data from oklahoma lakes perform worse than our model on oklahoma lakes given the failure of satellite based models in predicting chlorophyll a within a single u s state we are doubtful that a truly universal model can be developed the disconnect between satellite observations and actual pigment concentrations could also be due to satellite sensors not capturing all water leaving reflectance due to atmospheric interference or cloud cover and not capturing data below the surface of the water column because the satellite sensors only measure chlorophyll a at the surface but in situ measurements of chlorophyll a are generally taken across the photic zone for mid column bloom formers this would cause mid column blooming cyanobacteria or well mixed blooms to appear less concentrated or less pigmented than surface blooms coffer et al 2021a in oklahoma lakes for example we frequently experience raphidiopsis blooms and other non surface bloomers antunes et al 2015 these problems would be less of an issue for ground based sensors that are not affected by atmospheric aerosols and when suspended close to the water surface can capture a large majority of the water leaving reflectance our ground based multispectral models reliably predicted both chlorophyll a and phycocyanin in oklahoma lakes and performed remarkably better than the satellite models the chlorophyll a six band ratio model we developed slightly outperformed randolph et al 2008 nested band ratio chlorophyll a model with both models having similar r2 values the ci and ci multi performed substantially worse than our model and randolph et al 2008 model all four models generally underpredicted at very high levels of chlorophyll a our phycocyanin seven band ratio model outperformed the phycocyanin nested band ratio model from randolph et al 2008 the ci model and ci multi model notably our model performed better on extreme phycocyanin values 50 µg l compared with the established model which had systematic underprediction of high phycocyanin events while coffer et al 2021b 2021a 2020 and handler et al 2023 have successfully used meris and olci data to detect cyanobacteria in larger oklahoma reservoirs we did not corroborate these results with our simulated data the ci multi includes a filtering step with the aim of removing non cyanobacterial blooms after calculating the ci coffer et al 2020 this filtering step is meant to remove samples that are not from cyanobacteria dominated systems i e classified as ci noncyano this step seemed to fail in our system with 87 samples filtered out with the exception of one high outlier the phycocyanin in these samples ranged between 3 and 71 µg l phycocyanin which are low to moderate levels of phycocyanin we know that many of the lakes removed at this step are cyanobacteria dominated systems for example both lake texoma and grand lake o the cherokees have a rich history of cyanobacteria blooms this failure of the ci multi algorithm is problematic because predicting these low to moderate phycocyanin concentrations allows us to detect blooms as they develop if detected early measures may be taken to lower risks to humans like closing swim beaches and posting educational signs false negatives model returning no bloom when blooms are present could lead to failure to act to protect the public pets and livestock our ground based models including the simulated ci models outperformed all of the landsat models the poor performance of landsat models is possibly due in part to the landsat s band limitations with limited band number and wavelength range we found that even with a variety of algorithms employing different band math strategies landsat was not useful for detecting pigments in reservoirs researchers have moved away from using band ratios in recent years in favor of spectral shape algorithms such as ci or maximum peak height algorithms coffer et al 2020 matthews and odermatt 2015 we did find that our satellite models relying on band ratios were substantially worse than the ci models our results suggest that satellites where the ci could be implemented such as sentinel 3 would be better able to detect cyanobacteria blooms than landsat in oklahoma we found that ground based instruments show more promise than satellite based instruments for monitoring cyanohabs but other methods exist for cyanobacteria bloom detection with different accuracy scale and cost trade offs these alternative approaches include various satellite sensors ground based remote sensing airplane based sensors and fluorometry options satellites with freely available images excel in the category of low cost but as we have demonstrated they lack accuracy and do not sample at spatial scales relevant to small or dendritic reservoirs fig s6 additionally clouds are often an underestimated problem in collecting regular satellite images which may limit timely detection of algal blooms ju and roy 2008 as we have shown ground based remote sensing offers high accuracy at a fine scale but has an upfront cost for multi or hyper spectral sensors as a bonus such sensors could be deployed aerially giving broader coverage for example the national ecological observatory network neon has deployed airplane based hyperspectral sensors at neon sites to measure land cover and vegetation metrics at a fine scale without the interference of clouds https www neonscience org data collection imaging spectrometer one trade off of ground based sensors is they are spatially limited compared to satellites a multispectral sensor suspended above a lake would cover a very small area a sensor attached to a drone or airplane would afford increased spatial coverage at the limitation of drone battery life or airplane fly time another option deployed sondes have high up front and maintenance costs but provide highly accurate measurements on a fine scale manual sampling of water followed by in lab extraction of chlorophyll has a high cost of human hours but is accurate and operates on a fine scale almuhtaram et al 2021 given our results we suggest that ground based remote sensing offers the best of both worlds in terms of cost accuracy and scale for many scenarios however the needs of the researcher or water quality manager will determine which of these approaches best meet their needs based on cost accuracy and scale our finding that models using ground based multispectral data better predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations compared to models built using landsat imagery is likely applicable to small lakes and reservoirs around the globe though transferring models such as ours to other systems may require additional ground reference data and model adjustment that is we do not propose our model as a universal model but rather we suggest our approach of ground based remote sensing coupled with custom spectral bands and band ratios the lakes we analyzed in oklahoma range from 49 to 42 695 hectares in size table s1 and are representative of smaller lakes and reservoirs across the southern great plains there are millions of small lakes in the world verpoorter et al 2014 cael and seekell 2016 and reservoirs cover approximately 0 26 mkm2 globally downing et al 2006 many of these small waterbodies experience cyanohabs that cannot be clearly resolved by larger satellite pixels because of this resolution limitation small lakes and reservoirs are likely underrepresented in remote sensing monitoring programs while landsat has the appropriate pixel size for sensing small waterbodies it does not have a band useful for detecting phycocyanin as previously concluded by beck et al 2016 future satellite based remote sensing for cyanohabs will require higher resolution 30 m pixels or less and more appropriate bands that are narrower and similar to those of worldview 2 3 and sentinel 3 in the meantime ground based sensors offer an excellent alternative for small to mid sized lakes timely and effective monitoring of water quality in small to moderate size lakes cannot rely on satellite sensors with inappropriate spatial resolution and spectral band design instead we recommend the novel and herein demonstrated successful approach of ground based remote sensing with customized bands our approach will be a valuable addition to water quality monitoring efforts in small and dendritic reservoirs 5 conclusion based on a multi year multi lake comparison of in situ algal pigment data with landsat and ground derived reflectance models we conclude that oklahoma derived landsat and ground based models outperform established reflectance pigment models for oklahoma reservoirs ground based multispectral models are superior to landsat based models for predicting cyanohabs in oklahoma reservoirs ground based and multispectral sensors can offer cost efficient solutions for cyanohab monitoring in small to mid sized lakes where satellite images may not be appropriate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14636,high energy consumption and formation of harmful byproducts are two challenges faced by advanced oxidation processes aops while much research efforts have been devoted to improving the treatment efficiency byproduct formation and control calls for more attention in this study the underlying mechanism of bromate formation inhibition during a novel plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process with silver doped spinel ferrite 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 as the catalysts was investigated by scrutinizing the effects of each factor i e irradiation catalyst ozone as well as the combinations of different factors on major br species involved in bromate formation examining the distribution of br species and probing the reactive oxygen species partaking in the reactions it was found that accelerated ozone decomposition which inhibited two main bromate formation pathways and surface reduction of br species e g hobr obr and bro3 contributed to the inhibition of bromate formation both of which can be enhanced by the plasmonic effects of ag and the good affinity between ag and br a kinetic model was developed by simultaneously solving 95 reactions to predict the aqueous concentrations of br species during different ozonation processes the good agreement between the model prediction and experimental data further corroborated the hypothesized reaction mechanism graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bromate heterogeneous catalytic ozonation plasmonic effects silver doped spinel ferrite data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ozone o3 has long been used for disinfection and oxidation in water treatment rice et al 1981 although it is a strong oxidant ozone molecule has an electrophilic character and reacts selectively with unsaturated bonds aromatic systems and amino groups beltran 2003 broséus et al 2009 leading to incomplete removal of some contaminants furthermore free radicals such as hydroxyl radical oh can be formed during the decomposition of ozone in aqueous solution resulting in the indirect reaction pathway that is faster and unselective beltran 2003 von gunten 2003 hence ozone based advanced oxidation processes aops usually involve addition of different stimuli such as chemical agents e g h2o2 light irradiation e g uv or catalysts which can promote o3 decomposition to initiate and propagate the formation of reactive species ikehata and gamal el din 2005 however oxidative processes are usually limited by intensive use of energy or chemicals and formation of harmful byproducts mauter meagan s ines zucker francois perreault jay r werber jae hong kim 2018 while much research efforts have been devoted to improving the treatment efficiency investigation on the formation and control of toxic byproducts calls for more attention in water wastewater treatment processes involving ozone bromate bro3 a probable human carcinogen can be formed through the reaction of o3 oh with naturally occurring bromide br paul westerhoff rengao song gary amy 1998 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 von gunten et al 1995 von gunten and oliveras 1998 since bromide concentrations vary from 10 μg l to 1000 μg l in fresh waters formation of bromate is relevant in water treatment and is regulated at 10 µg l in drinking water in several countries heeb m b criquet j zimmermann steffens s g and von gunten 2014 li et al 2015 methods for inhibiting bromate formation during ozonation with each having its own limitations include ph depression control of bromide content as well as ozone dose and contact time and addition of ammonia nawrocki 2013 soltermann et al 2017 on the other hand heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco which was first reported in late 1970s and has experienced fast growth since 1990s has drawn much interest ascribed to its high efficiency and versatility issaka et al 2022 wang and chen 2020 in particular besides the enhanced efficiency of organics removal many hco studies have reported less bromate formation than ozonation alone under similar conditions wu 2023 generally addition of solid catalysts may affect bromate formation due to the following reasons dissolved o3 decomposition huang et al 2021 h2o2 production nie et al 2014 and interactions of o3 and br species with catalysts chen et al 2020 some studies attribute the inhibition efficiency of bromate formation to the accelerated decomposition of dissolved o3 in this system which leads to the suppression of the initial oxidation of bromide to hobr obr by o3 resulting in reduced bromate formation aoudj et al 2015 huang et al 2021 li et al 2015 other studies have suggested that the lower bromate formation in hco is due to the rapid reactions of the deprotonated form of generated h2o2 h2o during the hco process which effectively reduces hobr obr to bromide gurol and akata 1996 furthermore several studies have reported the occurrence of cyclic redox reactions involving surface metal species e g ce iii ce iv mn ii mn iii mn iv with bromine species thus serving as one of the inhibitory mechanisms against bromate formation chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 li et al 2015 however it is worth emphasizing that hco is a highly heterogeneous system and to understand the underlying mechanism and delineate the reaction pathways can be a challenging task as for bromate formation the multiple species and pathways involved and the possible interactions between different species phases make it relatively easy to propose an explanation for the experimental results but difficult to reach convincing conclusions especially when a rigorous experimental design and comprehensive investigation is lacking for example bromate can be formed via both direct o3 oxidation and indirect oh oxidation pathways fischbacher et al 2015 von gunten et al 1995 von gunten and oliveras 1998 when catalysts accelerate the o3 decomposition and increases oh generation should bromate formation be inhibited or promoted nonetheless this has been used to explain both experimental observations i e inhibition and promotion in our previous study we have developed a novel heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process utilizing the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of ag plasmonic nanoparticles doped on the spinel ferrite substrate e g ag mnfe2o4 where a high efficiency for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants was achieved in both synthetic solutions and real environmental matrices when irradiated at ag plasmon band e g 470 nm yang et al 2021 yang and wu 2022 we think the plasmon mediated enhancement was realized through energy transferred from plasmonic ag nanostructures to ozone adsorptive sites during lspr decay leading to accelerated ozone decomposition and subsequent radical generation at both existing and newly activated catalytic active sites yang et al 2021 furthermore less bromate formation was observed in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation pe catalytic ozonation than in catalytic ozonation and ozonation alone under otherwise same conditions in different matrices yang et al 2021 yang and wu 2022 however the underlying mechanism of the observed inhibition was unclear hence here we report the first study on the mechanistic investigation of bromate formation inhibition in the novel pe catalytic ozonation process over ag doped spinel ferrite the addition of light irradiation certainly makes our system even more complicated than typical hco therefore we have conducted a comprehensive study through scrutinizing the effects of each factor as well as the combinations of different factors on all major br species involved in bromate formation moreover the mass balance of br was examined to reveal and confirm the distribution of different br species during the process effects of different reactive species and characteristics of the catalysts after different treatment provided insights into the underlying mechanism in particular the role of ag plasmonic effects the unique feature of this novel treatment process was discussed lastly we developed a kinetic model to predict the time depended concentration profiles of main br species in the aqueous phase the good agreement between the experimental results and model prediction also demonstrates the validity of the proposed mechanism for bromate formation and inhibition in different processes 2 experimental

inside a house made chamber two blue led lights 470 10 nm were fixed on the sides of the chamber and provided light irradiation as needed ozonated working solution was prepared by continuously feeding ozone gas into the reactor using an ozone generator mp5000 a2z ozone inc with pure oxygen as the feed gas to reach a desired dissolved ozone do3 concentration to start the experiment appropriate amounts of catalysts and br stock solution br bro3 or hobr obr were added to the ozonated solution 150 ml which was stirred at 500 rpm at room temperature 22 1 c samples were taken at predetermined time intervals and residual o3 was removed by purging the sample with an ultra pure n2 gas stream for 30 s preliminary tests confirmed n2 purging did not change concentrations of the bromine species description of different experimental conditions is summarized in table s1 all the experiments were conducted in un buffered solutions to eliminate the interfering effects of other inorganic ions yang and wu 2019 the initial ph was controlled at 7 00 0 02 as shown in fig s1 the ph quickly increased and generally stabilized at 7 6 7 7 during the runs all the experiments were conducted at least twice and the error bars in the figures indicate standard deviations 2 4 analytical methods concentrations of br and bro3 were measured by an ion chromatography system ics 1600 dionex us using a dionex ionpac as19 4 250 mm column at 35 c 20 mm koh was used as the mobile phase and the eluent flow rate was 1 ml min the limit of quantification loq was 2 µg l the concentration of hobr obr was measured using two methods a spectrophotometric method with abts scott et al 1993 loq 0 005 µm and a phenol quenching method followed by hplc analysis loq 0 01 µm pinkernell and von gunten 2001 do3 and h2o2 were determined using the reported spectrophotometric methods with modifications taylor 1991 detailed information of analytical methods as well as preparation and standardization of hobr obr stock solution is provided in text s3 2 5 kinetic modeling kinetic modeling was performed using the software package kintecus 6 01 ianni 2017 the model contained 95 reactions among which 12 were derived based on the results and discussion of this study and 83 were from the literature table s2 the model can be used to predict the evolution of aqueous concentrations of major br species during different ozonation processes 3 results and discussion 3 1 bro3 formation and br species distribution in different processes bro3 formation during ozonation catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation is shown in fig 1 ozonation of 2 µm br resulted in the generation of 0 87 µm bromate in 30 min in contrast addition of catalyst and further catalyst with light irradiation dramatically reduced bro3 formation to 0 089 µm and 0 039 µm respectively in order to further delineate the effects of different factors we examined bro3 formation under all seven conditions as shown in fig s2 no appreciable bro3 was generated during adsorption photolysis or photocatalysis but 0 581 µm was produced in photo ozonation these results demonstrate that while ozone appeared to be the main promotor for bro3 formation both catalysts and light irradiation seemed to play an inhibitor role it is well documented that hobr obr is the major intermediate during bro3 formation in ozonation processes fig s3 von gunten et al 1995 to further track the transformation of br we monitored concentrations of different br species in the solution in all treatment processes fig s4 similar to that of bro3 the concentration of hobr obr was much higher in ozonation and photo ozonation moreover while a good mass balance of br was achieved in the absence of catalysts results of figs s4d s4g showed after 30 min 40 50 of br probably ended up in the solid phase to examine the distribution of br species during catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation we collected the catalysts and conducted desorption tests text s4 after different time of treatment as can be seen in fig 2 90 of br was recovered in all cases at 30 min the amount of adsorbed bro3 was equivalent to 0 274 µm and 0 174 µm in solution leading to total bro3 formation aq ads of 0 363 µm and 0 213 µm in catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation respectively in contrast to 0 87 µm in ozonation concentrations of hobr obr in both aqueous phase fig s5 and solid phase exhibited the characteristic for an intermediate i e first increased and then decreased but compared with catalytic ozonation hobr obr peaked at a later time and much less was formed only detected at 2 5 min in solution moreover total solid phase br species generally increased with time in both processes 3 2 transformation of hobr obr and bro3 in order to further investigate the pathway of bro3 formation inhibition in pe catalytic ozonation we evaluated the transformation of hobr obr and bro3 under different conditions as shown in fig 3 a irradiation of 2 µm hobr obr solution resulted in the generation of 0 38 µm br and 0 098 µm bro3 control test in dark fig s6 hobr obr is light responsive and both br and bro3 can be formed starting with reaction 1 zhang and parker 2018 similar results were reported for uv irradiation of hobr obr fang and shang 2012 1 hobr h v oh br ozonation of hobr obr led to the formation of 0 314 µm bro3 fig 3b which was actually much lower than that in ozonation of br under otherwise identical conditions fig 1 the initial oxidation of br to br by oh proceeds much faster than br to hobr obr by o3 eqs 32 89 90 in table s2 these results indicate that the reaction pathway of br o h br o 3 bro bro2 fig s3 played an important role in the final bro3 production here when the addition of catalyst accelerated do3 decomposition and promoted oh generation the inhibition of following oxidation steps by o3 i e br o 3 bro should be one reason as important as the inhibition of initial oxidation of br to hobr obr for less bro3 formation this argument is also partially supported by the results of photo ozonation fig 3c although photolysis of o3 may generate h2o2 which can reduce hobr obr to br higher bro3 was formed than ozonation this may be explained by the fact that photolysis of hobr obr led to the generation of the important intermediate br eq 1 it should also be mentioned that von gunten and hoigne reported higher bro3 production with obr as the starting compound than with br as the starting compound at ph 11 in their study von gunten et al 1995 we think the key difference here is the ph which affects o3 half life as well as species distribution of hobr in our study ph was 7 6 and hobr mainly existed in the protonated form pka 8 8 von gunten and oliveras 1997 whereas o3 reacts much faster with obr than hobr von gunten et al 1995 as illustrated in fig 3d the catalyst adsorbed 87 of hobr obr showing a much higher affinity towards hobr obr than br and bro3 figs s4d and s7d photocatalysis of hobr obr resulted in the generation of 0 287 µm br in the solution fig 3e indicating photocatalytic reduction occurred since majority of hobr obr was adsorbed and the aqueous concentration did not differ much with or without irradiation this may be ascribed to redox reactions that took place on the catalyst surface facilitated by the metal species and photo generated electrons parrino et al 2014 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2010 presence of o3 accelerated the depletion of aqueous hobr obr as well as generation of bro3 due to oxidation of hobr obr by o3 while reduction of hobr obr to br still occurred figs 3f 3g reactive oxygen species ros such as o2 generated during catalytic o3 decomposition has been reported to contribute to the reduction process chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 moreover light irradiation enhanced the reduction and inhibited the oxidation process leading to higher br and lower bro3 in the solution in pe catalytic ozonation results of bro3 transformation in different processes are shown in fig s7 like hobr obr bro3 exhibited light responsiveness and its reduction to hobr obr and br occurred under light irradiation even in the presence of o3 adsorption of bro3 by the catalyst was similar to that of br catalytic reduction of bro3 was observed in photocatalysis catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation as discussed below photo generated electron redox cycle of metal species on the catalyst and produced ros should have contributed to bro3 reduction all of which can be enhanced in pe catalytic ozonation thus resulting in higher production of br than in catalytic ozonation 3 3 mechanistic investigation during ozonation of br containing water the formation of bro3 depends on the total oxidant budget e g o3 and oh and the dominant reaction pathways in the system changes of the dissolved ozone do3 concentration during ozonation of 2 µm br in different processes are shown in fig 4 a the addition of catalyst significantly accelerated do3 depletion and light irradiation further expedited this with no do3 detected after 10 15 min as can be seen in the inset of fig 1 and in fig 2 bro3 concentration remained almost constant after 15 min in pe catalytic ozonation whereas it kept on increasing in catalytic ozonation and ozonation hence presence of do3 is critical for bro3 formation in our system on the other hand as reported in our previous study accelerated o3 decomposition led to enhanced generation of ros yang et al 2021 which can play important roles in promoting or inhibiting the formation of bro3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is one common ros generated in ozonation processes as illustrated in fig 4b profiles of the h2o2 concentration followed a similar trend in all the processes where the concentration rose quickly at the beginning before it decreased to 0 in 8 15 min moreover the time to reach the peak and complete depletion followed the order pe catalytic ozonation catalytic ozonation ozonation whereas the peak concentration was in the opposite order these results were in accordance with do3 evolution indicating h2o2 was generated during ozone decomposition the effects of h2o2 are multifold in ozonation processes on one hand h2o2 can react with different intermediate br species e g br bro and bro2 and reduce them to br gurol and akata 1996 on the other hand it can react with o3 and generate oh but at the same time it may act as a oh scavenger especially when in excess it has been reported that there is a threshold of h2o2 concentration at which the optimum synergistic effect of o3 and oh with respective to bro3 formation is achieved von gunten et al 1995 this threshold is usually 0 35 0 5 molar ratio of h2o2 o3 and when the actual ratio is lower presence of h2o2 facilitates bro3 generation the higher the h2o2 concentration the higher the bro3 production chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 2018 in this study the h2o2 concentration was generally lower than the typical threshold value also although the peak concentration was higher in the catalytic processes the overall h2o2 production was higher in ozonation alone which was consistent with the higher bro3 formation in order to study the roles of other ros we employed tert butyl alcohol tba 1 4 benzoquinone and nan3 as the probe compound for oh o2 and 1o2 respectively and conducted a set of scavenging tests fig 5 table 1 it should be mentioned that generation of these ros have been investigated and confirmed using this scavenger method and in electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments in our previous study yang et al 2021 as expected addition of tba clearly inhibited bro3 formation demonstrating the important role of oh as discussed previously br o h br o 3 bro bro2 and br o 3 hobr obr o h bro bro2 are two dominant pathways for bro3 formation under our experimental conditions and scavenging oh could suppress both pathways scavenging o2 led to a higher generation of bro3 in both catalytic processes in contrast 1o2 seemed to play a limited role in bro3 formation first o2 can react with hobr obr and generate br eqs 63 71 in table s2 which hinders the production of bro and hence bro2 bro3 in processes where o3 are quickly depleted second o2 actively involves in the redox cycle of the metal species on the catalyst surface which facilitates the reduction of br species as discussed below chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 in addition to the ros probe compounds phosphate was added as a strong lewis base to substitute the surface oh which were important active sites for dissociative o3 adsorption yang et al 2021 addition of phosphate slowed down o3 decomposition resulting in higher bro3 generation to further investigate the role of the redox cycle of surface metal species on the catalysts in bro3 formation we conducted xps analysis of the catalyst before and after different treatment fig 6 for o1s spectra the ratio of p1 lattice oxygen to p2 surface hydroxyl oh and other surface adsorbed o decreased after treatment indicating the consumption of lattice oxygen and or formation of oh or other chemisorbed o yang et al 2021 zhan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 among the three metal species clear valence changes occurred to ag and mn but not fe which means the former two species actively involved in the reactions through changes of their own oxidation state moreover as can be seen in fig 6b 6c such changes were further augmented by light irradiation regardless of the presence of o3 reduction of br compounds e g hobr bro2 bro3 by the surface metal species e g mn2 3 ag0 is thermodynamically feasible given the standard electrode potential of several relevant redox couples mn4 mn3 0 906 v mn4 mn2 1 224 v ag ag 0 799 v br5 br 1 44 v br br 1 33 v bai et al 2007 bard 1985 huang et al 2021 in catalytic ozonation metal metal oxides are often the active sites where o2 can be generated during o3 decomposition o2 can then reduce the higher oxidation state metal species thus completing the redox cycle afzal et al 2017 nie et al 2013 in addition ag is characterized by the excellent electron transport properties and can facilitate an efficient electron shuttling at the nearby redox sites e g mn sites choi et al 2017 wang et al 2018 under light irradiation at ag plasmon band 470 nm all these processes can be greatly enhanced due the excitation of lspr or under the influence of the elevated electric field built by lspr decay of lspr can lead to energy transfer from the plasmonic nanostructure to its surrounding environment via both radiative e g electromagnetic field and non radiative processes e g formation of energetic electrons linic suljo umar aslam calvin boerigter 2015 linic et al 2011 in our previous study we have experimentally demonstrated the presence of photo generated electrons which was only observed under light irradiation at 470 nm no other wavelengths further confirming the ag plasmonic effect yang et al 2021 these energetic electrons can partake in the reduction of br species directly and also contribute to o2 generation through reactions with o2 in the absence of o3 processes of d e in fig 6 we think o2 plays an important role in the redox cycles of surface metal species as can be seen in fig s8 in contrast to the results of processes b c shown in fig 6 minimal changes of the metal species distribution were observed after catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation of br in presence of the o2 scavenger besides plasmonic effects and electron shuttling ag may also improve affinity of the catalysts towards br compounds since ag doped carbon materials have been developed to remove br from water chen et al 2017 gong et al 2013 sánchez polo et al 2007 to this end we prepared mnfe2o4 following the same procedure but without addition of ag and tested its adsorption and photocatalysis of br and bro3 as illustrated in figs s9 s10 both the adsorption and photocatalytic reduction capacity decreased compared with that of 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 figs s4 s7 as adsorption is usually the first step for catalytic transformation of the target compound in heterogeneous processes such enhanced affinity should be advantageous especially when the concentration is low it could also help protect br and other intermediate species from being oxidized by oxidants in the aqueous phase e g o3 and oh 3 4 effects of natural organic matter nom organic matters e g nom are ubiquitous in environmental waters and can play multiple roles in ozonation processes in general nom can act as either initiators promoters or inhibitor that affect the stability of o3 by participating in both the direct reaction with o3 and the indirect oxidation involving with oh jothinathan and hu 2018 staehelin and hoigne 1985 yong and lin 2013 2012 consequently it will also affect the formation of bromate hence here we also examined the bro3 formation in the presence of nom 3 mg l as toc at two different o3 doses mass ratio o3 toc 0 9 and o3 toc 1 5 as shown in fig s11 at o3 toc 0 9 no aqueous bro3 was detected in catalytic ozonation or pe catalytic ozonation while 0 451 µm was generated in ozonation representing a 48 decrease as compared to that in ozonation without nom at o3 toc 1 5 the bro3 concentrations in the solution were 0 514 µm 0 018 µm and 0 016 µm for ozonation catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation respectively the observed inhibition on bro3 formation may be ascribed to the competitive consumption of the oxidants e g o3 and oh by nom legube et al 2004 wert et al 2009 moreover recent studies suggest that the presence of nom can increase the adsorption capacity of the catalyst for bromine species by enhancing its surface charge this in turn facilitates the reduction of bro3 and hobr obr the adsorption of nom on the catalyst surface also promotes its redox activity by participating directly in the electron transfer process additionally the adsorbed nom facilitates electron transfer which aids in the transformation of ozone into hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical this lowers the ozone exposure and further inhibits the formation of bromate jothinathan and hu 2018 yi et al 2019 on the other hand hobr obr and other intermediate br species may also react with nom and form brominated organic byproducts instead of bromate han et al 2019 heeb et al 2014 sharma et al 2014 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 which can be more toxic than the chlorinated ones here the very low hobr obr detected during pe catalytic ozonation may also hint possible inhibition in this aspect nom can also promote the generation of h2o2 hence effects of nom on bro3 formation can be complicated depending on the experimental and chemical conditions nonetheless formation of organic byproducts as well as transformation of bulk organics and the consequent effects on the production of disinfection byproducts dbps in the downstream disinfection processes is an important research topic for the development and practical application of novel aops which warrants a dedicated investigation and is out of the scope of this study 3 5 kinetic modeling based on the results and discussion above we conclude that the main mechanism governing the observed inhibition of bro3 formation in pe catalytic ozonation includes 1 much accelerated do3 decomposition which suppressed all bro3 formation pathways br o h br o 3 bro bro2 br o 3 hobr obr o h bro bro2 and br o 3 hobr obr o 3 bro2 2 adsorption of br species by the catalyst which facilitated heterogeneous catalytic reduction and prevented further oxidation in the solution 3 photolysis of br species hobr obr and bro3 and 4 catalytic reduction of br species on the catalyst the plasmonic effect of ag can enhance 1 3 and 4 while the presence of ag can improve 2 for kinetic modeling we first conducted different sets of experiments to determine the rate constants of reactions that account for the main mechanism 1 12 reactions table s2 by combining with 83 reactions involving oxygen and bromine species reported in the literature we developed kinetic models to predict the aqueous concentrations of main br species during different ozonation processes fig 7 table s3 the good agreement between the model prediction and experimental data further corroborates the hypothesized reaction mechanism it should also be noted that since the rate constants were determined in separate experiments the modeling process is not a curve fitting exercise hence it is possible to correlate the relevant rate constants with operating parameters e g light intensity and catalyst dose and enable model predictions for different conditions 4 conclusion while improving the energy efficiency and treatment performance of aops is certainly important formation and control of harmful byproducts during these processes deserves equal attention for practical applications through a combined experimental and modeling approach here we have delineated the mechanism controlling the formation of bromate in a novel plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process compared with ozonation and catalytic ozonation ag lspr further accelerated dissolved ozone decomposition and surface reduction of br species both of which inhibited bromate formation the enhanced affinity toward br induced by the presence of ag facilitated surface reactions which together with photolysis of br species also contributed to less bromate formation a kinetic model consisting of 95 elemental reactions was successfully developed to predict the evolution of br species during different ozonation

14636,high energy consumption and formation of harmful byproducts are two challenges faced by advanced oxidation processes aops while much research efforts have been devoted to improving the treatment efficiency byproduct formation and control calls for more attention in this study the underlying mechanism of bromate formation inhibition during a novel plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process with silver doped spinel ferrite 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 as the catalysts was investigated by scrutinizing the effects of each factor i e irradiation catalyst ozone as well as the combinations of different factors on major br species involved in bromate formation examining the distribution of br species and probing the reactive oxygen species partaking in the reactions it was found that accelerated ozone decomposition which inhibited two main bromate formation pathways and surface reduction of br species e g hobr obr and bro3 contributed to the inhibition of bromate formation both of which can be enhanced by the plasmonic effects of ag and the good affinity between ag and br a kinetic model was developed by simultaneously solving 95 reactions to predict the aqueous concentrations of br species during different ozonation processes the good agreement between the model prediction and experimental data further corroborated the hypothesized reaction mechanism graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bromate heterogeneous catalytic ozonation plasmonic effects silver doped spinel ferrite data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ozone o3 has long been used for disinfection and oxidation in water treatment rice et al 1981 although it is a strong oxidant ozone molecule has an electrophilic character and reacts selectively with unsaturated bonds aromatic systems and amino groups beltran 2003 broséus et al 2009 leading to incomplete removal of some contaminants furthermore free radicals such as hydroxyl radical oh can be formed during the decomposition of ozone in aqueous solution resulting in the indirect reaction pathway that is faster and unselective beltran 2003 von gunten 2003 hence ozone based advanced oxidation processes aops usually involve addition of different stimuli such as chemical agents e g h2o2 light irradiation e g uv or catalysts which can promote o3 decomposition to initiate and propagate the formation of reactive species ikehata and gamal el din 2005 however oxidative processes are usually limited by intensive use of energy or chemicals and formation of harmful byproducts mauter meagan s ines zucker francois perreault jay r werber jae hong kim 2018 while much research efforts have been devoted to improving the treatment efficiency investigation on the formation and control of toxic byproducts calls for more attention in water wastewater treatment processes involving ozone bromate bro3 a probable human carcinogen can be formed through the reaction of o3 oh with naturally occurring bromide br paul westerhoff rengao song gary amy 1998 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 von gunten et al 1995 von gunten and oliveras 1998 since bromide concentrations vary from 10 μg l to 1000 μg l in fresh waters formation of bromate is relevant in water treatment and is regulated at 10 µg l in drinking water in several countries heeb m b criquet j zimmermann steffens s g and von gunten 2014 li et al 2015 methods for inhibiting bromate formation during ozonation with each having its own limitations include ph depression control of bromide content as well as ozone dose and contact time and addition of ammonia nawrocki 2013 soltermann et al 2017 on the other hand heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco which was first reported in late 1970s and has experienced fast growth since 1990s has drawn much interest ascribed to its high efficiency and versatility issaka et al 2022 wang and chen 2020 in particular besides the enhanced efficiency of organics removal many hco studies have reported less bromate formation than ozonation alone under similar conditions wu 2023 generally addition of solid catalysts may affect bromate formation due to the following reasons dissolved o3 decomposition huang et al 2021 h2o2 production nie et al 2014 and interactions of o3 and br species with catalysts chen et al 2020 some studies attribute the inhibition efficiency of bromate formation to the accelerated decomposition of dissolved o3 in this system which leads to the suppression of the initial oxidation of bromide to hobr obr by o3 resulting in reduced bromate formation aoudj et al 2015 huang et al 2021 li et al 2015 other studies have suggested that the lower bromate formation in hco is due to the rapid reactions of the deprotonated form of generated h2o2 h2o during the hco process which effectively reduces hobr obr to bromide gurol and akata 1996 furthermore several studies have reported the occurrence of cyclic redox reactions involving surface metal species e g ce iii ce iv mn ii mn iii mn iv with bromine species thus serving as one of the inhibitory mechanisms against bromate formation chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 li et al 2015 however it is worth emphasizing that hco is a highly heterogeneous system and to understand the underlying mechanism and delineate the reaction pathways can be a challenging task as for bromate formation the multiple species and pathways involved and the possible interactions between different species phases make it relatively easy to propose an explanation for the experimental results but difficult to reach convincing conclusions especially when a rigorous experimental design and comprehensive investigation is lacking for example bromate can be formed via both direct o3 oxidation and indirect oh oxidation pathways fischbacher et al 2015 von gunten et al 1995 von gunten and oliveras 1998 when catalysts accelerate the o3 decomposition and increases oh generation should bromate formation be inhibited or promoted nonetheless this has been used to explain both experimental observations i e inhibition and promotion in our previous study we have developed a novel heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process utilizing the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of ag plasmonic nanoparticles doped on the spinel ferrite substrate e g ag mnfe2o4 where a high efficiency for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants was achieved in both synthetic solutions and real environmental matrices when irradiated at ag plasmon band e g 470 nm yang et al 2021 yang and wu 2022 we think the plasmon mediated enhancement was realized through energy transferred from plasmonic ag nanostructures to ozone adsorptive sites during lspr decay leading to accelerated ozone decomposition and subsequent radical generation at both existing and newly activated catalytic active sites yang et al 2021 furthermore less bromate formation was observed in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation pe catalytic ozonation than in catalytic ozonation and ozonation alone under otherwise same conditions in different matrices yang et al 2021 yang and wu 2022 however the underlying mechanism of the observed inhibition was unclear hence here we report the first study on the mechanistic investigation of bromate formation inhibition in the novel pe catalytic ozonation process over ag doped spinel ferrite the addition of light irradiation certainly makes our system even more complicated than typical hco therefore we have conducted a comprehensive study through scrutinizing the effects of each factor as well as the combinations of different factors on all major br species involved in bromate formation moreover the mass balance of br was examined to reveal and confirm the distribution of different br species during the process effects of different reactive species and characteristics of the catalysts after different treatment provided insights into the underlying mechanism in particular the role of ag plasmonic effects the unique feature of this novel treatment process was discussed lastly we developed a kinetic model to predict the time depended concentration profiles of main br species in the aqueous phase the good agreement between the experimental results and model prediction also demonstrates the validity of the proposed mechanism for bromate formation and inhibition in different processes 2 experimental

catalyst demonstrated the presence of multivalent ag mn and fe on the catalyst surface 2 3 experimental setup and procedure all the experiments were conducted in a batch quartz reactor diameter 5 cm inside a house made chamber two blue led lights 470 10 nm were fixed on the sides of the chamber and provided light irradiation as needed ozonated working solution was prepared by continuously feeding ozone gas into the reactor using an ozone generator mp5000 a2z ozone inc with pure oxygen as the feed gas to reach a desired dissolved ozone do3 concentration to start the experiment appropriate amounts of catalysts and br stock solution br bro3 or hobr obr were added to the ozonated solution 150 ml which was stirred at 500 rpm at room temperature 22 1 c samples were taken at predetermined time intervals and residual o3 was removed by purging the sample with an ultra pure n2 gas stream for 30 s preliminary tests confirmed n2 purging did not change concentrations of the bromine species description of different experimental conditions is summarized in table s1 all the experiments were conducted in un buffered solutions to eliminate the interfering effects of other inorganic ions yang and wu 2019 the initial ph was controlled at 7 00 0 02 as shown in fig s1 the ph quickly increased and generally stabilized at 7 6 7 7 during the runs all the experiments were conducted at least twice and the error bars in the figures indicate standard deviations 2 4 analytical methods concentrations of br and bro3 were measured by an ion chromatography system ics 1600 dionex us using a dionex ionpac as19 4 250 mm column at 35 c 20 mm koh was used as the mobile phase and the eluent flow rate was 1 ml min the limit of quantification loq was 2 µg l the concentration of hobr obr was measured

were determined using the reported spectrophotometric methods with modifications taylor 1991 detailed information of analytical methods as well as preparation and standardization of hobr obr stock solution is provided in text s3 2 5 kinetic modeling kinetic modeling was performed using the software package kintecus 6 01 ianni 2017 the model contained 95 reactions among which 12 were derived based on the results and discussion of this study and 83 were from the literature table s2 the model can be used to predict the evolution of aqueous concentrations of major br species during different ozonation processes 3 results and discussion 3 1 bro3 formation and br species distribution in different processes bro3 formation during ozonation catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation is shown in fig 1 ozonation of 2 µm br resulted in the generation of 0 87 µm bromate in 30 min in contrast addition of catalyst and further catalyst with light irradiation dramatically reduced bro3 formation to 0 089 µm and 0 039 µm respectively in order to further delineate the effects of different factors we examined bro3 formation under all seven conditions as shown in fig s2 no appreciable bro3 was generated during adsorption photolysis or photocatalysis but 0 581 µm was produced in photo ozonation these results demonstrate that while ozone appeared to be the main promotor for bro3 formation both catalysts and light irradiation seemed to play an inhibitor role it is well documented that hobr obr is the major intermediate during bro3 formation in ozonation processes fig s3 von gunten et al 1995 to further track the transformation of br we monitored concentrations of different br species in the solution in all treatment processes fig s4 similar to that of bro3 the concentration of hobr obr was much higher in ozonation and photo ozonation moreover while a good mass balance of br was achieved in the absence of catalysts results of figs s4d s4g showed after 30 min 40 50 of br probably ended up in the solid phase to examine the distribution of br species during catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation we collected the catalysts and conducted desorption tests text s4 after different time of treatment as can be seen in fig 2 90 of br was recovered in all cases at 30 min the amount of adsorbed bro3 was equivalent to 0 274 µm and 0 174 µm in solution leading to total bro3 formation aq ads of 0 363 µm and 0 213 µm in catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation respectively in contrast to 0 87 µm in ozonation concentrations of hobr obr in both aqueous phase fig s5 and solid phase exhibited the characteristic for an intermediate i e first increased and then decreased but compared with catalytic ozonation hobr obr peaked at a later time and much less was formed only detected at 2 5 min in solution moreover total solid phase br species generally increased with time in both processes 3 2 transformation of hobr obr and bro3 in order to further investigate the pathway of bro3 formation inhibition in pe catalytic ozonation we evaluated the transformation of hobr obr and bro3 under different conditions as shown in fig 3 a irradiation of 2 µm hobr obr solution resulted in the generation of 0 38 µm br and 0 098 µm bro3 control test in dark fig s6 hobr obr is light responsive and both br and bro3 can be formed starting with reaction 1 zhang and parker 2018 similar results were reported for uv irradiation of hobr obr fang and shang 2012 1 hobr h v oh br ozonation of hobr obr led to the formation of 0 314 µm bro3 fig 3b which was actually much lower than that in ozonation of br under otherwise identical conditions fig 1 the initial oxidation of br to br by oh proceeds much faster than br to hobr obr by o3 eqs 32 89 90 in table s2 these results indicate that the reaction pathway of br o h br o 3 bro bro2 fig s3 played an important role in the final bro3 production here when the addition of catalyst accelerated do3 decomposition and promoted oh generation the inhibition of following oxidation steps by o3 i e br o 3 bro should be one reason as important as the inhibition of initial oxidation of br to hobr obr for less bro3 formation this argument is also partially supported by the results of photo ozonation fig 3c although photolysis of o3 may generate h2o2 which can reduce hobr obr to br higher bro3 was formed than ozonation this may be explained by the fact that photolysis of hobr obr led to the generation of the important intermediate br eq 1 it should also be mentioned that von gunten and hoigne reported higher bro3 production with obr as the starting compound than with br as the starting compound at ph 11 in their study von gunten et al 1995 we think the key difference here is the ph which affects o3 half life as well as species distribution of hobr in our study ph was 7 6 and hobr mainly existed in the protonated form pka 8 8 von gunten and oliveras 1997 whereas o3 reacts much faster with obr than hobr von gunten et al 1995 as illustrated in fig 3d the catalyst adsorbed 87 of hobr obr showing a much higher affinity towards hobr obr than br and bro3 figs s4d and s7d photocatalysis of hobr obr resulted in the generation of 0 287 µm br in the solution fig 3e indicating photocatalytic reduction occurred since majority of hobr obr was adsorbed and the aqueous concentration did not differ much with or without irradiation this may be ascribed to redox reactions that took place on the catalyst surface facilitated by the metal species and photo generated electrons parrino et al 2014 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2010 presence of o3 accelerated the depletion of aqueous hobr obr as well as generation of bro3 due to oxidation of hobr obr by o3 while reduction of hobr obr to br still occurred figs 3f 3g reactive oxygen species ros such as o2 generated during catalytic o3 decomposition has been reported to contribute to the reduction process chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 moreover light irradiation enhanced the reduction and inhibited the oxidation process leading to higher br and lower bro3 in the solution in pe catalytic ozonation results of bro3 transformation in different processes are shown in fig s7 like hobr obr bro3 exhibited light responsiveness and its reduction to hobr obr and br occurred under light irradiation even in the presence of o3 adsorption of bro3 by the catalyst was similar to that of br catalytic reduction of bro3 was observed in photocatalysis catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation as discussed below photo generated electron redox cycle of metal species on the catalyst and produced ros should have contributed to bro3 reduction all of which can be enhanced in pe catalytic ozonation thus resulting in higher production of br than in catalytic ozonation 3 3 mechanistic investigation during ozonation of br containing water the formation of bro3 depends on the total oxidant budget e g o3 and oh and the dominant reaction pathways in the system changes of the dissolved ozone do3 concentration during ozonation of 2 µm br in different processes are shown in fig 4 a the addition of catalyst significantly accelerated do3 depletion and light irradiation further expedited this with no do3 detected after 10 15 min as can be seen in the inset of fig 1 and in fig 2 bro3 concentration remained almost constant after 15 min in pe catalytic ozonation whereas it kept on increasing in catalytic ozonation and ozonation hence presence of do3 is critical for bro3 formation in our system on the other hand as reported in our previous study accelerated o3 decomposition led to enhanced generation of ros yang et al 2021 which can play important roles in promoting or inhibiting the formation of bro3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is one common ros generated in ozonation processes as illustrated in fig 4b profiles of the h2o2 concentration followed a similar trend in all the processes where the concentration rose quickly at the beginning before it decreased to 0 in 8 15 min moreover the time to reach the peak and complete depletion followed the order pe catalytic ozonation catalytic ozonation ozonation whereas the peak concentration was in the opposite order these results were in accordance with do3 evolution indicating h2o2 was generated during ozone decomposition the effects of h2o2 are multifold in ozonation processes on one hand h2o2 can react with different intermediate br species e g br bro and bro2 and reduce them to br gurol and akata 1996 on the other hand it can react with o3 and generate oh but at the same time it may act as a oh scavenger especially when in excess it has been reported that there is a threshold of h2o2 concentration at which the optimum synergistic effect of o3 and oh with respective to bro3 formation is achieved von gunten et al 1995 this threshold is usually 0 35 0 5 molar ratio of h2o2 o3 and when the actual ratio is lower presence of h2o2 facilitates bro3 generation the higher the h2o2 concentration the higher the bro3 production chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 2018 in this study the h2o2 concentration was generally lower than the typical threshold value also although the peak concentration was higher in the catalytic processes the overall h2o2 production was higher in ozonation alone which was consistent with the higher bro3 formation in order to study the roles of other ros we employed tert butyl alcohol tba 1 4 benzoquinone and nan3 as the probe compound for oh o2 and 1o2 respectively and conducted a set of scavenging tests fig 5 table 1 it should be mentioned that generation of these ros have been investigated and confirmed using this scavenger method and in electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments in our previous study yang et al 2021 as expected addition of tba clearly inhibited bro3 formation demonstrating the important role of oh as discussed previously br o h br o 3 bro bro2 and br o 3 hobr obr o h bro bro2 are two dominant pathways for bro3 formation under our experimental conditions and scavenging oh could suppress both pathways scavenging o2 led to a higher generation of bro3 in both catalytic processes in contrast 1o2 seemed to play a limited role in bro3 formation first o2 can react with hobr obr and generate br eqs 63 71 in table s2 which hinders the production of bro and hence bro2 bro3 in processes where o3 are quickly depleted second o2 actively involves in the redox cycle of the metal species on the catalyst surface which facilitates the reduction of br species as discussed below chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 in addition to the ros probe compounds phosphate was added as a strong lewis base to substitute the surface oh which were important active sites for dissociative o3 adsorption yang et al 2021 addition of phosphate slowed down o3 decomposition resulting in higher bro3 generation to further investigate the role of the redox cycle of surface metal species on the catalysts in bro3 formation we conducted xps analysis of the catalyst before and after different treatment fig 6 for o1s spectra the ratio of p1 lattice oxygen to p2 surface hydroxyl oh and other surface adsorbed o decreased after treatment indicating the consumption of lattice oxygen and or formation of oh or other chemisorbed o yang et al 2021 zhan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 among the three metal species clear valence changes occurred to ag and mn but not fe which means the former two species actively involved in the reactions through changes of their own oxidation state moreover as can be seen in fig 6b 6c such changes were further augmented by light irradiation regardless of the presence of o3 reduction of br compounds e g hobr bro2 bro3 by the surface metal species e g mn2 3 ag0 is thermodynamically feasible given the standard electrode potential of several relevant redox couples mn4 mn3 0 906 v mn4 mn2 1 224 v ag ag 0 799 v br5 br 1 44 v br br 1 33 v bai et al 2007 bard 1985 huang et al 2021 in catalytic ozonation metal metal oxides are often the active sites where o2 can be generated during o3 decomposition o2 can then reduce the higher oxidation state metal species thus completing the redox cycle afzal et al 2017 nie et al 2013 in addition ag is characterized by the excellent electron transport properties and can facilitate an efficient electron shuttling at the nearby redox sites e g mn sites choi et al 2017 wang et al 2018 under light irradiation at ag plasmon band 470 nm all these processes can be greatly enhanced due the excitation of lspr or under the influence of the elevated electric field built by lspr decay of lspr can lead to energy transfer from the plasmonic nanostructure to its surrounding environment via both radiative e g electromagnetic field and non radiative processes e g formation of energetic electrons linic suljo umar aslam calvin boerigter 2015 linic et al 2011 in our previous study we have experimentally demonstrated the presence of photo generated electrons which was only observed under light irradiation at 470 nm no other wavelengths further confirming the ag plasmonic effect yang et al 2021 these energetic electrons can partake in the reduction of br species directly and also contribute to o2 generation through reactions with o2 in the absence of o3 processes of d e in fig 6 we think o2 plays an important role in the redox cycles of surface metal species as can be seen in fig s8 in contrast to the results of processes b c shown in fig 6 minimal changes of the metal species distribution were observed after catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation of br in presence of the o2 scavenger besides plasmonic effects and electron shuttling ag may also improve affinity of the catalysts towards br compounds since ag doped carbon materials have been developed to remove br from water chen et al 2017 gong et al 2013 sánchez polo et al 2007 to this end we prepared mnfe2o4 following the same procedure but without addition of ag and tested its adsorption and photocatalysis of br and bro3 as illustrated in figs s9 s10 both the adsorption and photocatalytic reduction capacity decreased compared with that of 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 figs s4 s7 as adsorption is usually the first step for catalytic transformation of the target compound in heterogeneous processes such enhanced affinity should be advantageous especially when the concentration is low it could also help protect br and other intermediate species from being oxidized by oxidants in the aqueous phase e g o3 and oh 3 4 effects of natural organic matter nom organic matters e g nom are ubiquitous in environmental waters and can play multiple roles in ozonation processes in general nom can act as either initiators promoters or inhibitor that affect the stability of o3 by participating in both the direct reaction with o3 and the indirect oxidation involving with oh jothinathan and hu 2018 staehelin and hoigne 1985 yong and lin 2013 2012 consequently it will also affect the formation of bromate hence here we also examined the bro3 formation in the presence of nom 3 mg l as toc at two different o3 doses mass ratio o3 toc 0 9 and o3 toc 1 5 as shown in fig s11 at o3 toc 0 9 no aqueous bro3 was detected in catalytic ozonation or pe catalytic ozonation while 0 451 µm was generated in ozonation representing a 48 decrease as compared to that in ozonation without nom at o3 toc 1 5 the bro3 concentrations in the solution were 0 514 µm 0 018 µm and 0 016 µm for ozonation catalytic ozonation and pe catalytic ozonation respectively the observed inhibition on bro3 formation may be ascribed to the competitive consumption of the oxidants e g o3 and oh by nom legube et al 2004 wert et al 2009 moreover recent studies suggest that the presence of nom can increase the adsorption capacity of the catalyst for bromine species by enhancing its surface charge this in turn facilitates the reduction of bro3 and hobr obr the adsorption of nom on the catalyst surface also promotes its redox activity by participating directly in the electron transfer process additionally the adsorbed nom facilitates electron transfer which aids in the transformation of ozone into hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical this lowers the ozone exposure and further inhibits the formation of bromate jothinathan and hu 2018 yi et al 2019 on the other hand hobr obr and other intermediate br species may also react with nom and form brominated organic byproducts instead of bromate han et al 2019 heeb et al 2014 sharma et al 2014 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 which can be more toxic than the chlorinated ones here the very low hobr obr detected during pe catalytic ozonation may also hint possible inhibition in this aspect nom can also promote the generation of h2o2 hence effects of nom on bro3 formation can be complicated depending on the experimental and chemical conditions nonetheless formation of organic byproducts as well as transformation of bulk organics and the consequent effects on the production of disinfection byproducts dbps in the downstream disinfection processes is an important research topic for the development and practical application of novel aops which warrants a dedicated investigation and is out of the scope of this study 3 5 kinetic modeling based on the results and discussion above we conclude that the main mechanism governing the observed inhibition of bro3 formation in pe catalytic ozonation includes 1 much accelerated do3 decomposition which suppressed all bro3 formation pathways br o h br o 3 bro bro2 br o 3 hobr obr o h bro bro2 and br o 3 hobr obr o 3 bro2 2 adsorption of br species by the catalyst which facilitated heterogeneous catalytic reduction and prevented further oxidation in the solution 3 photolysis of br species hobr obr and bro3 and 4 catalytic reduction of br species on the catalyst the plasmonic effect of ag can enhance 1 3 and 4 while the presence of ag can improve 2 for kinetic modeling we first conducted different sets of experiments to determine the rate constants of reactions that account for the main mechanism 1 12 reactions table s2 by combining with 83 reactions involving oxygen and bromine species reported in the literature we developed kinetic models to predict the aqueous concentrations of main br species during different ozonation processes fig 7 table s3 the good agreement between the model prediction and experimental data further corroborates the hypothesized reaction mechanism it should also be noted that since the rate constants were determined in separate experiments the modeling process is not a curve fitting exercise hence it is possible to correlate the relevant rate constants with operating parameters e g light intensity and catalyst dose and enable model predictions for different conditions 4 conclusion while improving the energy efficiency and treatment performance of aops is certainly important formation and control of harmful byproducts during these processes deserves equal attention for practical applications through a combined experimental and modeling approach here we have delineated the mechanism controlling the formation of bromate in a novel plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process compared with ozonation and catalytic ozonation ag lspr further accelerated dissolved ozone decomposition and surface reduction of br species both of which inhibited bromate formation the enhanced affinity toward br induced by the presence of ag facilitated surface reactions which together with photolysis of br species also contributed to less bromate formation a kinetic model consisting of 95 elemental reactions was successfully developed to predict the evolution of br species during different ozonation

14637,the insecticide and current use pesticide chlorpyrifos clp is transported via global distillation to the arctic where it may pose a threat to this ecosystem clp is readily detected in arctic environmental compartments but current research has not studied its partitioning between water and dissolved organic matter dom nor the role of photochemistry in clp s fate in aquatic systems here the partition coefficients of clp were quantified with various types of dom isolated from the arctic and an international humic substances society ihss reference material suwannee river natural organic matter srnom while clp readily partitions to dom clp exhibits a significantly higher binding constant with arctic lacustrine dom relative to fluvial dom or srnom the experimental partitioning coefficients kdoc were compared to a calculated value estimated using poly parameter linear free energy relationship pp lfer and was found to be in good agreement with srnom but none of the arctic doms we found that arctic kdoc values decrease with increasing suva254 but no correlations were observed for the other dom compositional parameters dom also mediates the photodegradation of clp with stark differences in photo kinetics using arctic dom isolated over time and space this work highlights the chemo diversity of arctic dom relative to ihss reference materials and highlights the need for in depth characterization of dom that transcends the current paradigm based upon terrestrial and microbial precursors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter

pesticides and have been detected in environmental compartments air water biota sediment globally khairy et al 2016 hageman et al 2019 balmer et al 2019 iturburu et al 2019 and references there in multiple studies provide evidence of cups persisting in the environment bioaccumulating and showing some degree of toxicity to various organisms huang et al 2020 cáceres et al 2007 cup usage has steadily increased due to agricultural applications and as a consequence remote locations such as the arctic have also experienced a higher incidence of detection of these compounds balmer et al 2019 according to the arctic monitoring and assessment program amap cups have made the list of chemicals of emerging concern amap 2017 chlorpyrifos clp is an organophosphate cup that is widely applied to

chiou et al 1986 chin et al 1997 neale et al 2011 wei haas et al 2014 liu et al 2019 2020 peña et al 2022 vitale et al 2019 and references therein clp has multiple characteristics that make it partition to dom most notably its hydrophobicity as quantified by its high octanol water partitioning coefficient when clp interacts with dom this can alter its bioavailability and transport within a freshwater system grannas et al 2012 akkanen et al 2004 uhle et al 1999 further the interaction of clp and dom may influence its photo fate an important attenuation process in arctic surface waters during the ice free summer season dom is ubiquitous in aquatic environments and is unique to their specific geographic location dom is composed of a matrix of degraded carbon either being allochthonous or autochthonous i e carbon from the watershed or from within the water source respectively wei hass et al 2014 dom from alaskan arctic surface waters is composed of plant and soil precursors that creates a rich dom environment found across the arctic grannas et al 2012 the variable dom concentrations in arctic surface waters makes the partition coefficient an important parameter to determine clp s fate in arctic surface waters for example in rivers and wetlands high in dom these complexes may shield organisms from the toxic effects of clp while photochemical production of reactive species from the irradiation of dom could facilitate the transformation of clp single and poly parameter linear free energy relationships sp lfer and pp lfer respectively have been used to predict the partitioning of organic molecules to dom sp lfer is most often used but is limited in its application because of its reliance on a single compound property such as the octanol water partition coefficient kow burkhard 2000 pp lfers conversely utilize multiple parameters that better define the solute and properties that characterize the partitioning system therefore pp lfer models better estimate the partitioning interaction between organic molecules and dom we studied the partitioning between clp and dom using arctic dom isolated from various surface waters and suwannee river natural organic matter srnom which is an international humic substances society ihss reference material the solubility enhancement method was used to determine the partitioning coefficients for clp these values were compared to the calculated theoretical value pp lfer using solute and dom descriptors goss et al 2001 we also characterized dom spectroscopic properties to elucidate the possible moieties responsible for clp dom partitioning in addition we also examined the role of dom in mediating the photolysis of clp 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description dom samples were collected

hydrologically connect it to the local watershed and receives a small but relatively constant source of terrestrially derived dom throughout the ice free season in contrast fog 1 lacks any such

associated values 3 results 3 1 dom site composition spatial temporal and geochemical differences exist across the different environments from which dom is derived that may influence both partitioning and contaminant transformation processes guerard et al 2009 we isolated dom from two different arctic lakes toolik and fog 1 the inlet stream to toolik lake and two different tundra meltwater seeps to capture the diversity of arctic dom composition on influencing clp partitioning to dom to assess temporal variability we utilized toolik lake and oksrukuyik seep dom isolates collected over a period of 7 years and or different points in the season the arctic isolates display a wide range of characteristics dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations ranged from as low as 3 mg c l 1 in fog 1 lake to upwards of 15 mg c l 1 in the meltwater seeps table s1 specific conductivity and ph were similar across all sites and percent recovery of dom as carbon by the ppl isolation process was on average a little over 60 elemental composition for each dom isolate is similar to the range reported for other arctic and ihss reference and standard doms cory et al 2007 the arctic dom had lower c n compared to srnom and may reflect a somewhat more autochthonous character of dom in arctic water bodies but is not as low as that reported for pony lake fulvic acid plfa uv visible spectroscopy absorbance curves reflected typical spectra observed for all dom showing broad relatively featureless profiles with decreases in absorbance with increasing wavelength specific absorbance at 254 nm suva254 ranged from 2 84 plfa up to 4 95 srnom l mg c 1 m 1 while e2 e3 also showed variability ranging from 5 12 to 7 47 table 1 and are similar to ihss reference natural organic matter and reported literature values for a wide range of dom derived globally wei haas et al 2014 cawley et al 2013 cory et al 2010 guerard et al 2009 fluorescence eems fig s6 were used to determine the humification index hix biological index bix and fluorescence index fi hix did not vary greatly among samples while bix and fi revealed greater variability that reflects differences in the composition of the dom precursor materials bix fi and suva254 values for srnom and plfa reflect their respective biogeochemical end member status with opposite bix suva and fi values table 1 our arctic dom samples had bix fi and suva range that more resemble a material derived from a combination of organic matter autochthonous and allochthonous represented by these endmembers table 1 relative functional group composition varied across all dom isolates nmr spectra highlight broad features due to the diversity of signals within the dom but overall are extremely similar across all arctic samples fig 1 some individual peaks with enough resolution to see peak splitting can be observed in the proton spectra fig s4 and the degree to which these are present does differ between samples however they are not well resolved enough for identification solid state carbon spectra however reveal consistent broad features including three distinct bumps in the aromatic region for all arctic samples despite the visual similarity in the nmr spectra relative abundances across functional group regions varies and in some cases widely the dom extracts with the greatest and lowest percent of molecules derived from linear terpenoids mdlt 0 6 1 6 ppm are plfa and srfa respectively which are our biogeochemical endmembers table s3 likewise dom isolates also bound the relative carbohydrate 3 2 4 5 ppm and aromatic regions 1h nmr 6 5 8 4 ppm 13c nmr 90 160 ppm the greatest and lowest percent composition of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules crams was observed in the plfa and toolik 19 mid summer isolate respectively arctic isolates with relatively high aromaticity include toolik 21 freshet and oksrukuyik seep 19 fog 1 isolate had a relatively low aromaticity similar to plfa at 23 3 aliphatic to aromatic al ar ratios also reflected these trends with the summer toolik isolates more in the middle of this range 3 2 partitioning coefficients of clp to dom there is strong partitioning log kdoc 3 5 between clp and dom as determined by solubility enhancement fig 2 overall solubility enhancement is linear with increasing doc concentration fig s5 chlorpyrifos exhibits a relatively wide range of binding constants with arctic dom that span half an order of magnitude the strongest partitioning was observed for arctic lacustrine dom isolates fig 2 toolik lake tl isolates were all collected by ppl at differing points in the summer season tl 21 spring freshet tl19 early summer tl13 mid summer but only tl13 differs in log kdoc p 0 01 including from fog 1 despite differences in suva254 and other optical properties table 1

isolate in this study compared to suwannee river nom p 0 05 for all doms vs sr 3 3 comparing log kdoc pp lfer model and experimental results the pp lfer estimate for the log kdoc for chlorpyrifos based on the system parameters derived from a generic pool of fulvic acids kipka and ditoro 2011 is comparable to our experimentally derived value for srnom 0 2 log units fig 2 table s4 this is not surprising given that the system parameters for this pp lfer model was derived from a training set which includes suwannee river fulvic acid the most common dom used in partitioning studies which is compositionally similar to srnom kipka and ditoro 2011 clp kdoc values for arctic dom however are all significantly higher by near an order of magnitude from the pp lfer estimate the pp lfer descriptors accurately estimate clp partitioning to the specific system in our case srnom but cannot be universally applied to dom derived from other sources 3 4 photodegradation of clp in the presence of dom clp photodegraded rather slowly by direct photolysis with a half life 17 h loss of clp over time followed a pseudo first order kinetic model fig s7 with average r2 values 0 96 table s5 overall apparent quantum yields aqys ranged from 6 23 10 5 to 2 28 10 4 table s5 at circumneutral ph nearly all isolates enhanced the photodegradation of clp relative to direct photolysis fig 3 the fastest rates of degradation were observed in the presence of toolik19 early summer dom isolate the light screening corrected degradation rate constants kcorr in the presence of srfa fog 1 and toolik19 mid summer dom were not statistically different from each other only one dom isolate toolik 21 freshet did not significantly enhance the photodegradation of clp fig 3 acidic ph 5 and basic ph 9 solution conditions resulted in some enhanced direct photodegradation relative to ph 7 and clp degradation was enhanced by dom relative to direct photolysis at high ph for all isolates tested fig s8 no differences in the indirect photolysis rate constants of low ph solutions were observed in the presence of dom except for fog 1 which was the only dom isolate where increased clp degradation occurred under both low and high ph conditions results of clp degradation in the presence of sensitizers and quenchers for specific mechanisms are described in section s10 3 5 relationship between dom character and clp behavior linear regressions were performed between aqy log kdoc and dom characterization properties table s6 log kdoc was found to correlate positively with c p 0 01 and negatively correlate with suva254 p 0 046 fig 4 other potential trends in relationship to log kdoc may be e2 e3 percent aromaticity and s which all had r2 0 4 but p 0 05 possibly due to low sample size fig s10 aqy derived from our photodegradation data did not significantly correlate to any parameters of dom characterization optical properties fi hix bix suva254 e2 e3 nmr integrations or elemental composition while a significant correlation was found between aqy and log kdoc the small sample size prevents interpretation as a significant conclusion more studies are needed to test the significance of this relationship table s6 despite suva254 being typically correlated with aromaticity no such trend in aromaticity and suva was found among the isolates in this study r2 0 14 p 0 32 fig s10 4 discussion 4 1 arctic dom composition trends in seasonality and source dom has been isolated from toolik lake in a few prior studies over at least the last two decades either using poly methylmethacrylate resins xad 8 or by ppl solid phase extraction michaelson et al 1998 cory et al 2007 wei haas et al 2014 these isolates have been typically characterized by optical fluorescence and absorbance elemental composition and nmr though some studies have also investigated redox properties fimmen et al 2007 photoreactivity cory et al 2007 ward and cory 2020 and association with contaminants grannas et al 2012 wei haas et al 2014 toolik spring freshet waters ranged from 7 to 15 mg c l 1 across three dom extractions using different spe resins from 1996 to 2021 michaelson et al 1998 cory et al 2007 this study xad 8 extraction efficiencies ranged from 39 to 45 while ppl extraction efficiency are as high as 70 3 despite these differences in extraction method fi of the isolate remained relatively similar 1 24 in 2003 from cory et al 2007 vs 1 39 in 2021 as did the 13c nmr integrations 23 6 in 2003 from cory et al 2007 vs 21 0 aromaticity as defined from 110 to 160 ppm and elemental composition for toolik lake summer isolations there was more variability in extraction efficiency 15 and 34 respectively for xad 8 in 1996 and 2002 and 60 72 and 45 for ppl in 2013 2019 may and 2019 jul despite that fi varies only slightly 1 37 from ward and cory 2020 to 1 49 from wei haas et al 2014 and differences in suva254 values are smaller 3 2 3 8 l mg c 1 m 1 percent aromaticity was also relatively stable over these samplings ranging from 17 7 to 19 1 110 160 ppm c n differed more with the largest c n from the 2002 xad 8 isolate 59 6 from cory et al 2007 and the lowest from 2019 mid summer 45 3 overall despite differences in the extraction method used dom isolates from toolik lake have remained considerably stable in chemical composition throughout its sampling history that has spanned a quarter century arctic lacustrine waters are known to be oligotrophic so presumably the dom from these sources often exhibit allochthonous characteristics derived from terrestrial inputs cory et al 2007 toolik lake is thought to be ultraoligotrophic due to its low primary production rate 12 g carbon m 2 y 1 however bacterial organic matter production was found to be 3 8 g carbon m 2 y 1 and makes up as much as 66 of the organic matter production in the pelagic zone crump et al 2003 this high efficiency of bacterial production is associated with rapid bacterial growth and this process coupled with the production of phytoplankton dom is the source of the autochthonous dom crump et al 2003 regardless dom character over time and space can be altered as a result of the humification processes and our hix values suggest our arctic dom has roughly undergone some degree of humification table 1 humic substances and other dom components derived from terrestrial sources have been characterized as being more aromatic and possess higher suva254 and lower fi mcknight et al 2001 guerard et al 2009 cawley et al 2013 cory et al 2007 fimmen et al 2007 and many others the optical properties fi hix bix suva254 and e2 e3 of our arctic isolates fall within the range established for terrestrial and microbial dom which would suggest that the dom in these lakes is sourced from a mix of both terrestrial and microbial sources there is variability within the doms examined however for example tl21 freshet has nearly as high an aromaticity as srnom or srfa whereas fog 1 dom and sagavanirktok seep dom both have low aromaticity and are similar to plfa optical properties also reflect these trends and suggest that toolik 21 freshet is more terrestrial in nature and fog 1 dom may be more microbial in composition despite being separated by only 20 km over the course of the summer season aromatic content in the lacustrine dom gradually decreases from 21 1 down to 18 6 which may indicate the incorporation of pelagic primary productivity components into the dom pool suva254 also steadily declines from 4 09 down to 3 25 in isolates sampled as the season progressed and is also reflected in the higher n and s content in our dom summer samples relative to spring freshet tl21 indeed fog 1 dom has the highest n content which may indicate the incorporation of pelagic biomass from primary producers over the course of the season at the end of spring ice melt there is a decrease in runoff from catchments which decreases the amount of terrestrial dom inputs crump et al 2003 4 2 clp sorption to arctic dom isolates despite the trends in seasonality with suva254 decreasing over the summer season in toolik lake dom isolates there was a statistically significant negative relationship between log kdoc for chlorpyrifos and suva254 fig 4 and yet a positive though not significant slope with aromaticity suva254 has historically correlated with aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 however the aromaticity of the dom isolates in this study were not found to be correlated to suva254 and if anything may suggest a negative relationship between these two fig s10 suggesting the presence of other chromophores giving rise to absorbance e g ketones metal complexes etc and potentially moieties that influence clp sorption to arctic dom isolates in past studies solubility enhancement experiments were conducted with legacy contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons chiou et al 1986 chin et al 1997 uhle et al 1999 these legacy contaminants are relatively simple in structure and their distribution in environmental compartments is largely dictated by their fugacity parnis and mackay 2020 while poly parameter lfers refined the simple fugacity and single parameter lfer models it cannot consider all solute and dom specific properties for example ortho substitution of halogens in biphenyl based compounds results in non coplanar configurations that cause weaker partitioning and cannot be incorporated into pp lfers uhle et al 1999 this difference in steric properties explains the large disparity in partitioning behavior to the same dom for ortho substituted and co planar pcb isomers unlike many legacy contaminants clp possesses multiple regions of functionality a phosphorus thionate with two non rigid ethoxy groups and a rigid chlorinated pyridine aromatic ring while clp s aromatic ring may provide potential for π π stacking with aromatic moieties in the dom and favorable association of arctic dom with aromatic contaminants has been observed previously for hexachlorobenzene hcb grannas et al 2012 and pdbes wei haas et al 2014 other analyte dom interactions are also important unfortunately few data in the literature exist to compare log kdoc values of chlorpyrifos neale et al 2011 determined the log kdoc for clp and aldrich humic acid to be 4 36 0 12 which is surprisingly similar to the lacustrine kdoc values reported here typically the partitioning of hydrophobic analytes to commercial humic acids are significantly larger than aquatic derived dom chin et al 1997 and demonstrates that other interactions between clp and arctic dom aside from aromaticity and hydrophobicity influence partitioning the pp lfer only predicted log kdoc reasonably well for the arctic seep dom samples and srnom the reasonable estimates with respect to the latter is in large part due to the system parameters which were derived from fulvic acid log kdoc training sets mostly suwannee river fulvic acid the much poorer pp lfer estimates for the lacustrine dom clp system again suggest that other interactions are responsible for our observations while these solute and system poly parameters considers some of the electron distribution through h donor and acceptor interactions they cannot take into account other properties that might be unique to clp functional groups such as phosphorous thionate in addition mcgowan estimates of molar volumes does not consider the conformational flexibility of the larger ethoxy groups future work would benefit from chemical computational modeling of clp with probe dom surrogate molecules to study the potential binding dynamics with different moieties within clp 4 3 clp photodegradation in arctic dom isolates unlike the summer toolik and fog 1 lake doms tl21 surprisingly did not enhance photodegradation of clp relative to direct photolysis as their log kdoc values are extremely similar to each other this implies that photo enhancement of clp degradation may not entirely be a function of partitioning processes instead this suggests that dom composition differs enough to impact either the production and or scavenging of reactive transients responsible for clp photodegradation indeed clp degradation in tl21 dom showed little change in degradation rates unless a sensitizer was added whereas in fog 1 dom degradation seems to be potentially influenced by ros oh 1o2 fig s9 it is possible that tl21 dom moieties act as efficient scavengers of produced reactive transients dom has been shown to inhibit photo oxidative processes through its antioxidant properties wenk and canonica 2012 yang et al 2022 however srfa which has been shown to have significant antioxidant moieties wenk and canonica 2012 aeschbacher et al 2012 did enhance clp photodegradation to better understand this process it would be helpful to quantify these arctic dom isolates by their antioxidant properties wenk and canonica 2012 aeschbacher et al 2012 insight into their electron donating and accepting capacity may better indicate the role of dom in clp photodegradation clp does oxidize and is suspected to form the oxon p o product in all photodegradation experiments with the largest peak areas occurring in the presence of oh sensitizers and smallest in the presence of oh scavengers see supporting information s10 surprisingly we observed no significant correlation between clp aqy and dom composition table s6 however this may be due to the fact that clp is potentially sensitive to multiple reactive transients complicating its photochemistry with respect to dom composition the ihss isolates srfa and plfa often thought of as endmembers of dom reactivity and composition based upon its fluorescent properties and aromaticity fig s11 however this simplified model did not explain dom s role in the enhancement of clp photodegradation in fact with respect to photoreactivity arctic doms over time and space possess higher variability than can be explained based upon precursor composition thus a broad allochthonous vs autochthonous comparison of dom composition may not be specific enough for describing the functionalities that govern clp interactions with dom in general in other studies dom properties and reactivity are no longer bound by the old paradigm based upon two biogeochemical endmembers d andrilli et al 2022 gagné et al 2023 chin et al 2023 clp s partitioning and photoreactivity to arctic dom is a reflection of this new complex model of dom 5 conclusion arctic dom composition is remarkably stable in toolik lake on a scale of decades and yet despite temporal stability over the long term there are compositional shifts within a single season in dom properties chlorpyrifos a multifunctional molecule and emerging contaminant in the arctic provides a nuanced lens through which to observe the temporal and spatial compositional heterogeneity of arctic dom through studying its sorption to dom and its photochemical behavior clp partitioning to dom is complicated and potential interactions with dom heteroatoms and conformational flexibility may cause predictive pp lfer models to underestimate its partition coefficient clp photodegradation is also significantly enhanced in the presence of dom but does not correlate with any bulk compositional property of dom in summary clp may be a useful probe molecule

14637,the insecticide and current use pesticide chlorpyrifos clp is transported via global distillation to the arctic where it may pose a threat to this ecosystem clp is readily detected in arctic environmental compartments but current research has not studied its partitioning between water and dissolved organic matter dom nor the role of photochemistry in clp s fate in aquatic systems here the partition coefficients of clp were quantified with various types of dom isolated from the arctic and an international humic substances society ihss reference material suwannee river natural organic matter srnom while clp readily partitions to dom clp exhibits a significantly higher binding constant with arctic lacustrine dom relative to fluvial dom or srnom the experimental partitioning coefficients kdoc were compared to a calculated value estimated using poly parameter linear free energy relationship pp lfer and was found to be in good agreement with srnom but none of the arctic doms we found that arctic kdoc values decrease with increasing suva254 but no correlations were observed for the other dom compositional parameters dom also mediates the photodegradation of clp with stark differences in photo kinetics using arctic dom isolated over time and space this work highlights the chemo diversity of arctic dom relative to ihss reference materials and highlights the need

multiple studies provide evidence of cups persisting in the environment bioaccumulating and showing some degree of toxicity to various organisms huang et al 2020 cáceres et al 2007 cup usage has steadily increased due to agricultural applications and as a consequence remote locations such as the arctic have also experienced a higher incidence of detection of these compounds balmer et al 2019 according to the arctic monitoring and assessment program amap cups have made the list of chemicals of emerging concern amap 2017 chlorpyrifos clp is an organophosphate cup that is widely applied to

partition to dom most notably its hydrophobicity as quantified by its high octanol water partitioning coefficient when clp interacts with dom this can alter its bioavailability and transport within a freshwater system grannas et al 2012 akkanen et al 2004 uhle et al 1999 further the interaction of clp and dom may influence its photo fate an important attenuation process in arctic surface waters during the ice free summer season dom is ubiquitous in aquatic environments and is unique to their specific geographic location dom is composed of a matrix of degraded carbon either being allochthonous or autochthonous i e carbon from the watershed or from within the water source respectively wei hass et al 2014 dom from alaskan arctic surface waters is composed of plant and soil precursors that creates a rich dom environment found across the arctic grannas et al 2012 the variable dom concentrations in arctic surface waters makes the partition coefficient an important parameter to determine clp s fate in arctic surface waters for example in rivers and wetlands high in dom these complexes may shield organisms from the toxic effects of clp while photochemical production of reactive species from the irradiation of dom could facilitate the transformation of clp single and poly parameter linear free energy relationships sp lfer and pp lfer respectively have been used to predict the partitioning of organic molecules to dom sp lfer is most often used but is limited in its application because of its reliance on a single compound property such as the octanol water partition coefficient kow burkhard 2000 pp lfers conversely utilize multiple parameters that better define the solute and properties that characterize the partitioning system therefore pp lfer models better estimate the partitioning interaction between organic molecules and dom we studied the partitioning between clp and dom using arctic dom isolated from various surface waters and suwannee river natural organic matter srnom which is an international humic substances society ihss reference material the solubility enhancement method was used to determine the partitioning coefficients for clp these values were compared to the calculated theoretical value pp lfer using solute and dom descriptors goss et al 2001 we also characterized dom spectroscopic properties to elucidate the possible moieties responsible for clp dom partitioning in addition we also examined the role of dom in mediating the photolysis of clp 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description dom samples were collected from four arctic locations on the north slope of the brooks range alaska toolik lake 68 63 n 149 59 w fog 1 lake 68 67 n 149 09 w and two tundra seeps adjacent to the sagavanirktok sag 68 88 n 148 87

hydrologically connect it to the local watershed and receives a small but relatively constant source of terrestrially derived dom throughout the ice free season in contrast fog 1 lacks any such

ditoro 2011 specifically for suwannee river fulvic acid table s2 2 5 photolysis experiments stock solutions of clp 20 mm were prepared in methanol and 450 μl were plated inside 500 ml amber glass

associated values 3 results 3 1 dom site composition spatial temporal and geochemical differences exist across the different environments from which dom is derived that may influence both partitioning and contaminant transformation processes guerard et al 2009 we isolated dom from two different arctic lakes toolik and fog 1 the inlet stream to toolik lake and two different tundra meltwater seeps to capture the diversity of arctic dom composition on influencing clp partitioning to dom to assess temporal variability we utilized toolik lake and oksrukuyik seep dom isolates collected over a period of 7 years and or different points in the season the arctic isolates display a wide range of characteristics dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations ranged from as low as 3 mg c l 1 in fog 1 lake to upwards of 15 mg c l 1 in the meltwater seeps table s1 specific conductivity and ph were similar across all sites and percent recovery of dom as carbon by the ppl isolation process was on average a little over 60 elemental composition for each dom isolate is similar to the range reported for other arctic and ihss reference and standard doms cory et al 2007 the arctic dom had lower c n compared to srnom and may reflect a somewhat more autochthonous character of dom in arctic water bodies but is not as low as that reported for pony lake fulvic acid plfa uv visible spectroscopy absorbance curves reflected typical spectra observed for all dom showing broad relatively featureless profiles with decreases in absorbance with increasing wavelength specific absorbance at 254 nm suva254 ranged from 2 84 plfa up to 4 95 srnom l mg c 1 m 1 while e2 e3 also showed variability ranging from 5 12 to 7 47 table 1 and are similar to ihss reference natural organic matter and reported literature values for a wide range of dom derived globally wei haas et al 2014 cawley et al 2013 cory et al 2010 guerard et al 2009 fluorescence eems fig s6 were used to determine the humification index hix biological index bix and fluorescence index fi hix did not vary greatly among samples while bix and fi revealed greater variability that reflects differences in the composition of the dom precursor materials bix fi and suva254 values for srnom and plfa reflect their respective biogeochemical end member status with opposite bix suva and fi values table 1 our arctic dom samples had bix fi and suva range that more resemble a material derived from a combination of organic matter autochthonous and allochthonous represented by these endmembers table 1 relative functional group composition varied across all dom isolates nmr spectra highlight broad features due to the diversity of signals within the dom but overall are extremely similar across all arctic samples fig 1 some individual peaks with enough resolution to see peak splitting can be observed in the proton spectra fig s4 and the degree to which these are present does differ between samples however they are not well resolved enough for identification solid state carbon spectra however reveal consistent broad features including three distinct bumps in the aromatic region for all arctic samples despite the visual similarity in the nmr spectra relative abundances across functional group regions varies and in some cases widely the dom extracts with the greatest and lowest percent of molecules derived from linear terpenoids mdlt 0 6 1

nmr 90 160 ppm the greatest and lowest percent composition of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules crams was observed in the plfa and toolik 19 mid summer isolate respectively arctic isolates with relatively high aromaticity include toolik 21 freshet and oksrukuyik seep 19 fog 1 isolate had a relatively low aromaticity similar to plfa at 23 3 aliphatic to aromatic al ar ratios also reflected these trends with the summer toolik isolates more in the middle of this range 3 2 partitioning coefficients of clp to dom there is strong partitioning log kdoc 3 5 between clp and dom as determined by solubility enhancement fig 2 overall solubility enhancement is linear with increasing doc concentration fig s5 chlorpyrifos exhibits a relatively wide range of binding constants with arctic dom that span half an order of magnitude the strongest partitioning was observed for arctic lacustrine dom isolates fig 2 toolik lake tl isolates were all collected by ppl at differing points in the summer season tl 21 spring freshet tl19 early summer tl13 mid summer but only tl13 differs in log kdoc p 0 01 including from fog 1 despite differences in suva254 and other optical properties table 1

isolate in this study compared to suwannee river nom p 0 05 for all doms vs sr 3 3 comparing log kdoc pp lfer model and experimental results the pp lfer estimate for the log kdoc for chlorpyrifos based on the system parameters derived from a generic pool of fulvic acids kipka and ditoro 2011 is comparable to our experimentally derived value for srnom 0 2 log units fig 2 table s4 this is not surprising given that the system parameters for this pp lfer model was derived from a training set which includes suwannee river fulvic acid the most common dom used in partitioning studies which is compositionally similar to srnom kipka and ditoro 2011 clp kdoc values for arctic dom however are all significantly higher by near an order of magnitude from the pp lfer estimate the pp lfer descriptors accurately estimate clp partitioning to the specific system in our case srnom but cannot be universally applied to dom derived from other sources 3 4 photodegradation of clp in the presence of dom clp photodegraded rather slowly by direct photolysis with a half life 17 h loss of clp over time followed a pseudo first order kinetic model fig s7 with average r2 values 0 96 table s5 overall apparent quantum yields aqys ranged from 6 23 10 5 to 2 28 10 4 table s5 at circumneutral ph nearly all isolates enhanced the photodegradation of clp relative to direct photolysis fig 3 the fastest rates of degradation were observed in the presence of toolik19 early summer dom isolate the light screening corrected degradation rate constants kcorr in the presence of srfa fog 1 and toolik19 mid summer dom were not statistically different from each other only one dom isolate toolik 21 freshet did not significantly enhance the photodegradation of clp fig 3 acidic ph 5 and basic ph 9 solution conditions resulted in some enhanced direct photodegradation relative to ph 7 and clp degradation was enhanced by dom relative to direct photolysis at high ph for all isolates tested fig s8 no differences in the indirect photolysis rate constants of low ph solutions were observed in the presence of dom except for fog 1 which was the only dom isolate where increased clp degradation occurred under both low and high ph conditions results of clp degradation in the presence of sensitizers and quenchers for specific mechanisms are described in section s10 3 5 relationship between dom character and clp behavior linear regressions were performed between aqy log kdoc and dom characterization properties table s6 log kdoc was found to correlate positively with c p 0 01 and negatively correlate with suva254 p 0 046 fig 4 other potential trends in relationship to log kdoc may be e2 e3 percent aromaticity and s which all had r2 0 4 but p 0 05 possibly due to low sample size fig s10 aqy derived from our photodegradation data did not significantly correlate to any parameters of dom characterization optical properties fi hix bix suva254 e2 e3 nmr integrations or elemental

significance of this relationship table s6 despite suva254 being typically correlated with aromaticity no such trend in aromaticity and suva was found among the isolates in this study r2 0 14 p 0 32 fig s10 4 discussion 4 1 arctic dom composition trends in seasonality and source dom has been isolated from toolik lake in a few prior studies over at least the last two decades either using poly methylmethacrylate resins xad 8 or by ppl solid phase extraction michaelson et al 1998 cory et al 2007 wei haas et al 2014 these isolates have been typically characterized by optical fluorescence and absorbance elemental composition and nmr though some studies have also investigated redox properties fimmen et al 2007 photoreactivity cory et al 2007 ward and cory 2020 and association with contaminants grannas et al 2012 wei haas et al 2014 toolik spring freshet waters ranged from 7 to 15 mg c l 1 across three dom extractions using different spe resins from 1996 to 2021 michaelson et al 1998 cory et al 2007 this study xad 8 extraction efficiencies ranged from 39 to 45 while ppl extraction efficiency are as high as 70 3 despite these differences in extraction method fi of the isolate remained relatively similar 1 24 in 2003 from cory et al 2007 vs 1 39 in 2021 as did the 13c nmr integrations 23 6 in 2003 from cory et al 2007 vs 21 0 aromaticity as defined from 110 to 160 ppm and elemental composition for toolik lake summer isolations there was more variability in extraction efficiency 15 and 34 respectively for xad 8 in 1996 and 2002 and 60 72 and 45 for ppl in 2013 2019 may and 2019 jul despite that fi varies only slightly 1 37 from ward and cory 2020 to 1 49 from wei haas et al 2014 and differences in suva254 values are smaller 3 2 3 8 l mg c 1 m 1 percent aromaticity was also relatively stable over these samplings ranging from 17 7 to 19 1 110 160 ppm c n differed more with the largest c n from the 2002 xad 8 isolate 59 6 from cory et al 2007 and the lowest from 2019 mid summer 45 3 overall despite differences in the extraction method used dom isolates from toolik lake have remained considerably stable in chemical composition throughout its sampling history that has spanned a quarter century arctic lacustrine waters are known to be oligotrophic so presumably the dom from these sources often exhibit allochthonous characteristics derived from terrestrial inputs cory et al 2007 toolik lake is thought to be ultraoligotrophic due to its low primary production rate 12 g carbon m 2 y 1 however bacterial organic matter production was found to be 3 8 g carbon m 2 y 1 and makes up as much as 66 of the organic matter production in the pelagic zone crump et al 2003 this high efficiency of bacterial production is associated with rapid bacterial growth and this process coupled with the production of phytoplankton dom is the source of the autochthonous dom crump et al 2003 regardless dom character over time and space can be altered as a result of the humification processes and our hix values suggest our arctic dom has roughly undergone some degree of humification table 1 humic substances and other dom components derived from terrestrial sources have been characterized as being more aromatic and possess higher suva254 and lower fi mcknight et al 2001 guerard et al 2009 cawley et al 2013 cory et al 2007 fimmen et al 2007 and many others the optical properties fi hix bix suva254 and e2 e3 of our arctic isolates fall within the range established for terrestrial and microbial dom which would suggest that the dom in these lakes is sourced from a mix of both terrestrial and microbial sources there is variability within the doms examined however for example tl21 freshet has nearly as high an aromaticity as srnom or srfa whereas fog 1 dom and sagavanirktok seep dom both have low aromaticity and are similar to plfa optical properties also reflect these trends and suggest that toolik 21 freshet is more terrestrial in nature and fog 1 dom may be more microbial in composition despite being separated by only 20 km over the course of the summer season aromatic content in the lacustrine dom gradually decreases from 21 1 down to 18 6 which may indicate the incorporation of pelagic primary productivity components into the dom pool suva254 also steadily declines from 4 09 down to 3 25 in isolates sampled as the season progressed and is also reflected in the higher n and s content in our dom summer samples relative to spring freshet tl21 indeed fog 1 dom has the highest n content which may indicate the incorporation of pelagic biomass from primary producers over the course of the season at the end of spring ice melt there is a decrease in runoff from catchments which decreases the amount of terrestrial dom inputs crump et al 2003 4 2 clp sorption to arctic dom isolates despite the trends in seasonality with suva254 decreasing over the summer season in toolik lake dom isolates there was a statistically significant negative relationship between log kdoc for chlorpyrifos and suva254 fig 4 and yet a positive though not significant slope with aromaticity suva254 has historically correlated with aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 however the aromaticity of the dom isolates in this study were not found to be correlated to suva254 and if anything may suggest a negative relationship between these two fig s10 suggesting the presence of other chromophores giving rise to absorbance e g ketones metal complexes etc and potentially moieties that influence clp sorption to arctic dom isolates in past studies solubility enhancement experiments were conducted with legacy contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons chiou et al 1986 chin et al 1997 uhle et al 1999 these legacy contaminants are relatively simple in structure and their distribution in environmental compartments is largely dictated by their fugacity parnis and mackay 2020 while poly parameter lfers refined the simple fugacity and single parameter lfer models it cannot consider all solute and dom specific properties for example ortho substitution of halogens in biphenyl based compounds results in non coplanar configurations that cause weaker partitioning and cannot be incorporated into pp lfers uhle et al 1999 this difference in steric properties explains the large disparity in partitioning behavior to the same dom for ortho substituted and co planar pcb isomers unlike many legacy contaminants clp possesses multiple regions of functionality a phosphorus thionate with two non rigid ethoxy groups and a rigid chlorinated pyridine aromatic ring while clp s aromatic ring may provide potential for π π stacking with aromatic moieties in the dom and favorable association of arctic dom with aromatic contaminants has been observed previously for hexachlorobenzene hcb grannas et al 2012 and pdbes wei haas et al 2014 other analyte dom interactions are also important unfortunately few data in the literature exist to compare log kdoc values of chlorpyrifos neale et al 2011 determined the log kdoc for clp and aldrich humic acid to be 4 36 0 12 which is surprisingly similar to the lacustrine kdoc values reported here typically the partitioning of hydrophobic analytes to commercial humic acids are significantly larger than aquatic derived dom chin et al 1997 and demonstrates that other interactions between clp and arctic dom aside from aromaticity and hydrophobicity influence partitioning the pp lfer only predicted log kdoc reasonably well for the arctic seep dom samples and srnom the reasonable estimates with respect to the latter is in large part due to the system parameters which were derived from fulvic acid log kdoc training sets mostly suwannee river fulvic acid the much poorer pp lfer estimates for the lacustrine dom clp system again suggest that other interactions are responsible for our observations while these solute and system poly parameters considers some of the electron distribution through h donor and acceptor interactions they cannot take into account other properties that might be unique to clp functional groups such as phosphorous thionate in addition mcgowan estimates of molar volumes does not consider the conformational flexibility of the larger ethoxy groups future work would benefit from chemical computational modeling of clp with probe dom surrogate molecules to study the potential binding dynamics with different moieties within clp 4 3 clp photodegradation in arctic dom isolates unlike the summer toolik and fog 1 lake doms tl21 surprisingly did not enhance photodegradation of clp relative to direct photolysis as their log kdoc values are extremely similar to each other this implies that photo enhancement of clp degradation may not entirely be a function of partitioning processes instead this suggests that dom composition differs enough to impact either the production and or scavenging of reactive transients responsible for clp photodegradation indeed clp degradation in tl21 dom showed little change in degradation rates unless a sensitizer was added whereas in fog 1 dom degradation seems to be potentially influenced by ros oh 1o2 fig s9 it is possible that tl21 dom moieties act as efficient scavengers of produced reactive transients dom has been shown to inhibit photo oxidative processes through its antioxidant properties wenk and canonica 2012 yang et al 2022 however srfa which has been shown to have significant antioxidant moieties wenk and canonica 2012 aeschbacher et al 2012 did enhance clp photodegradation to better understand this process it would be helpful to quantify these arctic dom isolates by their antioxidant properties wenk and canonica 2012 aeschbacher et al 2012 insight into their electron donating and accepting capacity may better indicate the role of dom in clp photodegradation clp does oxidize and is suspected to form the oxon p o product in all photodegradation experiments with the largest peak areas occurring in the presence of oh sensitizers and smallest in the presence of oh scavengers see supporting information s10 surprisingly we observed no significant correlation between clp aqy and dom composition table s6 however this may be due to the fact that clp is potentially sensitive to multiple reactive transients complicating its photochemistry with respect to dom composition the ihss isolates srfa and plfa often thought of as endmembers of dom reactivity and composition based upon its fluorescent properties and aromaticity fig s11 however this simplified model did not explain dom s role in the enhancement of clp photodegradation in fact with respect to photoreactivity arctic doms over time and space possess higher variability than can be explained based upon precursor composition thus a broad allochthonous vs autochthonous comparison of dom composition may not be specific enough for describing the functionalities that govern clp interactions with dom in general in other studies dom properties and reactivity are no longer bound by the old paradigm based upon two biogeochemical endmembers d andrilli et al 2022 gagné et al 2023 chin et al 2023 clp s partitioning and photoreactivity to arctic dom is a reflection of this new complex model of dom 5 conclusion arctic dom composition is remarkably stable in toolik lake on a scale of decades and yet despite temporal stability over the long term there are compositional shifts within a single season in dom properties chlorpyrifos a multifunctional molecule and emerging contaminant in the arctic provides a nuanced lens through which to observe the temporal and spatial compositional heterogeneity of arctic dom through studying its sorption to dom and its photochemical behavior clp partitioning to dom is complicated and potential interactions with dom heteroatoms and conformational flexibility may cause predictive pp lfer models to underestimate its partition coefficient clp photodegradation is also significantly enhanced in the presence of dom but does not correlate with any bulk compositional property of dom in summary clp may be a useful probe molecule

14638,in addition to the organic pollutants and disturbance to the microbial plant and animal systems oil contamination can also enrich opportunistic pathogens but little is known about whether and how the most common coastal oil contaminated water bodies act as reservoirs for pathogens here we delved into the characteristics of pathogenic bacteria in coastal zones by constructing seawater based microcosms with diesel oil as a pollutant 16s rrna gene full length sequencing and genomic exploration revealed that pathogenic bacteria with genes involved in alkane or aromatic degradation were significantly enriched under oil contamination providing a genetic basis for them to thrive in oil contaminated seawater moreover high throughput qpcr assays showed an increased abundance of the virulence gene and enrichment in antibiotics resistance genes args especially those related to multidrug resistance efflux pumps and their high relevance to pseudomonas enabling this genus to achieve high levels of pathogenicity and environmental adaptation more importantly infection experiments with a culturable p aeruginosa strain isolated from an oil contaminated microcosm provided clear evidence that the environmental strain was pathogenic to grass carp ctenopharyngodon idellus and the highest lethality rate was found in the oil pollutant treatment demonstrating the synergistic effect of toxic oil pollutants and pathogens on infected fish a global genomic investigation then revealed that diverse environmental pathogenic bacteria with oil degradation potential are widely distributed in marine environments especially in coastal zones suggesting extensive pathogenic reservoir risks in oil contaminated sites overall the study uncovered a hidden microbial risk showing that oil contaminated seawater could be a high risk pathogen reservoir and provides new insights and potential targets for environmental risk assessment and control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oil contamination pathogen reservoir pathogenicity antibiotics resistance genes infection data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid economic growth has been accompanied by increasing oil consumption which causes accidental and inevitable oil discharges resulting in large scale oil contamination of aquatic environments ma et al 2021 coastal zones acting as hotpots for shipping mariculture and recreational functions and are regarded as marine environments most closely linked to human activities the frequent oil contamination and bioremediation that occurs in these areas present some of the most serious global environmental issues and there is rising concern about the negative influences crude oil has on human and environmental health and an urgent demand for oil removal varjani and upasani 2017 bacteria are well known to play a critical role in crude oil degradation and numerous studies have demonstrated that bacteria capable of degrading hazardous petroleum constituents such as alcanivorax thalassolituus cycloclasticus and colwellia are enriched in oil contaminated environments campeão et al 2017 these oil degrading bacteria are consistently isolated and applied in bioremediation sarkar et al 2016 however a cursory look at the catalog of oil degrading microorganisms shows that it is not uncommon to find species that are opportunistic pathogens for humans animals and plants such as pseudomonas aeruginosa burkholderia cepacia xylella fastidiosa and acinetobacter baumannii redak et al 2003 trivedi et al 2015 for instance a verified efficient degrader of crude oil pseudomonas stutzeri is also a cause of knee arthritis in children nithya and babu 2017 this finding not only raises concerns about the control of environmental risks associated with the use of these microbes in bioremediation which has not yet been investigated but also suggests that the oil utilization capabilities of pathogenic bacteria may be responsible for their ability to thrive in oil contaminated environments since pathogen reservoirs are a part of the infectious disease cycle all bacterial pathogens must have at least one reservoir in which the pathogen is normally viable and from which infection of hosts can occur both animate reservoirs e g humans or animals and inanimate reservoirs such as water soil or food are common reservoirs as early as 1999 a strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from oil contaminated soil and it was verified to be capable of invading epithelial cells alonso et al 1999 in an investigation of the microbial diversity associated with tarball contamination formed after an oil spill event fernandes et al fernandes et al 2020 detected 36 potential human pathogens from tarballs especially an unusual surge of vibrio which is an important pathogen accumulated in seafood in tarball contaminated seawater compared to tarball free seawater indicating pathogen enrichment in oil related environments furthermore the increasing incidences of vibrio infected skin lesions or sores in fish were reported in the aftermath of severe oil spill accidents in the gulf of mexico murawski et al 2014 suggesting an emerging infection risk hidden in oil contamination these investigations imply the possibility that oil contaminated marine environments may be reservoirs for pathogens which serve as hotbeds for their survival and infectivity but our knowledge of pathogens in oil contaminated sites is still lacking more comprehensive studies are essential to discern whether and how oil contaminated sites act as reservoirs for petroleum degrading pathogenic bacteria which in turn may greatly improve the safety and efficacy of bioremediation for oil polluted environments therefore in the present study laboratory experiments and large scale data investigations were conducted simultaneously to test the hypothesis that oil contaminated areas in coastal zones may function as reservoirs for oil degrading pathogenic bacteria coastal seawater based microcosms were constructed with diesel oil as a contaminant and 16s rrna full length sequencing and ht qpcr assays were employed to comprehensively explore the effects of oil contamination on the microbial diversity oil degradation potential virulence factors and antibiotic resistance of potential pathogenic bacteria and animal experiments were further conducted to find evidence for the identification of pathogenic reservoirs furthermore a global investigation was conducted to screen pathogens with oil degradation potential and their environmental reservoirs to uncover more potentially extensive oil induced pathogen reservoirs in the present study oil contaminated seawater environments are evaluated as reservoirs for pathogens based on their occurrence oil utilization ability and pathogenicity providing valuable clues for bioremediation strategies and potential indicators for environmental safety

port 24 26 58 3 n 118 4 40 0 e in xiamen china through which busy passenger and cargo ships pass every day the seawater samples 2 l from each port were kept in sterile containers transported to the laboratory within 4 h at room temperature and mixed thoroughly in equal portions to establish the microcosms the microcosms were established by adding 320 ml of collected seawater and 80 ml of inorganic salt culture solution 0 108 mg feso₃ 5 476 mg kh2po4 and 0 92 g nh4 2so4 to 1 l triangular flasks as well as 0 5 1 and 5 diesel oil filtered through a 0 22 μm polyamide filter jinteng representing three levels of oil contamination persistent oil exposure caused by daily offshore shipping mirvakili et al 2013 highly anthropogenically impacted area pollution discharge and oil spill accident fields et al 2014 kumazawa morais et al 2016 here diesel oil was chosen as the signature pollutant by considering that diesel is the main shipping fuel and therefore a major source of oil pollution in surface seawater in coastal zones microcosms that did not contain oil were also established as controls the microcosms were incubated at room temperature and manually shaken periodically to simulate tidal induced fluctuations in surface seawater three replicates were set up for each treatment 2 2 full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis samples were collected from microcosms on days 0 7 14 and 21 for dna extraction bacteria were collected from seawater samples using a 0 22 µm polyethersulfone filter jinteng and from oil contaminated microcosms by centrifugation the process of dna extraction and sequencing was listed in supplementary methods samples from day 0 day 7 and day 14 were selected for full length 16s rrna gene sequencing resulting in 27 sequencing

minpredictedaccuracy 0 9 forwards and reverse primers were identified using cutadapt v2 7 martin 2011 and ccs reads without primers and those out of length range 1200 1650 bp were discarded then the dada2 method was used for denoising of qc postsequencing data on the qiime2 platform version 2020 6 bolyen et al 2019 the asvs were assigned using the rdp classifier version 2 2 against the silva

origin 9 0 or the r platform 2 4 pathogenicity determination of a potential representative pathogenic strain samples from day 7 day 14 and day 21 were selected for strain isolation the water samples were diluted into a series of concentrations 10 10 7 with sterilized mm2 medium liang et al 2021 and 100 μl of diluted solution was placed directly onto 2216e liang et al 2021 and mm2 solid medium for cultivation the colonies were quadrant streaked several times for purification followed by 16s rrna gene amplification with universal bacterial primers 27f and 1492r then the products were sequenced on an abi prism 3730xl sequencer the taxonomic assignment of these isolates was performed by aligning the 16s rrna gene sequences against the ezbiocloud database to determine the pathogenicity and oil degradation capability of pseudomonas aeruginosa pa2 15 isolated from microcosm under high level oil contamination infection experiments and oil degradation rate assay were conducted the details were shown in supplementary methods 2 5 oil degradation potential and environmental distribution investigation of pathogenic bacteria the genomes of pathogenic bacteria were collected according to disease records in the bv brc database and other sources an et al 2020 fang et al 2018 marchese et al 2019 olson et al 2023 resulting in 1358 genomes constituting a curated pathogenic bacteria database these genomes were subjected to functional annotation against the kegg database and their oil degradation related genes were retrieved and summarized their 16s rrna gene sequences were also retrieved from these 1358 genomes to generate another curated pathogenic bacterial 16s rrna gene database alignment of these 16s rrna gene sequences was achieved on the mafft platform katoh et al 2019 and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method with bootstrap analysis for 1000 replicates the phylogenetic tree was further edited on the chiplot platform https www chiplot online tvbot html to assess potential risks from oil degrading pathogenic bacteria their global distribution in marine environments was further investigated using shotgun sequencing datasets from tara oceans prokaryote enriched samples project prjeb1787 n 136 the corresponding taxonomic assignment matrix was downloaded from study mgys00000410 in the mgnify platform and the samples sequenced on the 454 gs flx titanium platform and those with few reads were filtered finally 99 samples remained then the relative abundances of the oil degrading pathogenic bacteria were calculated and extracted from the reshaped taxonomic assignment matrix and their visualization of global distribution was achieved using the rworldmap package on the r platform the main workflow is shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 oil contamination altered the microbial diversity and community structure in seawater the time series samples subjected to full length 16s rrna gene sequencing generated 313 971 reads and 754 asvs oil contamination led to a decrease in the number of asvs in seawater and the higher the oil concentration was the lower the number of asvs for the alpha diversity the richness shannon and pd indices all decreased significantly in oil contaminated samples in comparison to controls p 0 0001 for richness and pd indices p 0 05 for shannon wilcox test fig 2 the only exception was the shannon indices of samples under medium level of oil contamination the diversity indices of these samples were lowest under high level oil contamination principal coordinate analysis illustrated that the nonoil contaminated samples were separated from oil contaminated samples and community structures were also significantly different among samples under different oil contamination levels permanova p 0 01 fig 2b with respect to taxonomic distribution a total of 17 bacterial phyla were observed among all samples predominated by proteobacteria 54 03 100 epsilonbacteraeota 0 27 91 campilobacterota 0 12 12 and bacteroidetes 0 16 28 however the number of phyla in microbial communities decreased sharply from 17 to 3 after oil contamination most phyla disappeared after oil treatment except proteobacteria which had an absolute advantage in oil contaminated samples 93 40 100 fig 3 a at the family level the relative abundance of pseudomonadaceae increased with oil concentration reaching 81 7 2 6 in oil contaminated samples at high level oil contamination at the genus level fig 3b 169 genera were detected in total therein 138 genera were unique in nonoil contaminated samples when neptuniibacter predominated 3 06 36 40 in contrast 17 genera only occurred in oil contaminated samples with predominance of pseudomonas 25 13 82 21 acinetobacter 0 32 03 and thalassospira 3 48 19 21 pseudomonas overwhelmingly dominated the oil contaminated samples and its relative abundance significantly increased with the oil contamination level reaching 82 21 on day 7 and 81 10 on day 14 under high level oil contamination acinetobacter was detected only in oil contaminated samples at a low level with a relative abundance of 32 03 on day 7 and 20 50 on day 14 thalassospira exhibited comparable relative abundance under different oil contamination levels but showed a clear temporal increase reaching 12 77 15 79 on day 14 in addition neptunomonas displayed the highest relative abundance in oil contaminated samples at medium level 15 45 on day 7 and 4 88 on day 14 furthermore lefse analysis indicated that pseudomonas was the main biomarker for oil contamination supplementary fig s1 at the species level fig 3c pseudomonas oleovorans was dominant 15 followed by pseudomonas pachastrellae 6 8 and pseudomonas alcaligenes 5 2 the heatmap further grouped the top 50 species in terms of relative abundance into two distinct clusters fig 3d the populations in cluster 1 included species dominant in nonoil contaminated samples such as neptuniibacter sp and bacterium whc3 3 while the dominant populations in oil contaminated samples such as pseudomonas oleovorans and pseudomonas pachastrellae were almost all in cluster 2 3 2 enrichment of the pathogenic microbial community under oil contamination to track alterations in the pathogenic microbial communities in response to oil contamination the 16s rrna gene datasets were further assigned against the curated pathogen database eight pathogenic species were detected in total and the number of species sharply increased under oil contamination from 1 to 7 fig 4 a pcoa further revealed the presence of different pathogenic microbial communities under different oil treatments at the species level fig 4b fusobacterium nucleatum was the only pathogen detected in the nonoil contaminated samples and it was detected only once at a low relative abundance of 0 22 on day 14 seven pathogenic bacteria were detected in the oil contaminated samples and the relative abundance of pathogens increased with the oil contamination level accounting for 3 43 at low level 0 6 50 6 52 at medium level 4 41 8 61 and 18 42 at high level 0 48 74 82 on average temporal increases in the relative abundance of pathogens were also observed from 12 08 on day 7 to 18 on day 14 on average we also found that different oil contamination levels enriched different pathogenic populations fig 4c two pathogens acinetobacter junii and thalassospira profundimaris were enriched under oil contamination at low levels and acinetobacter junii 0 1 07 only appeared under this treatment the microbial communities under oil contamination at medium levels were enriched with 4 pathogenic bacteria achromobacter xylosoxidans pseudomonas mendocina pseudomonas stutzeri and thalassospira profundimaris and achromobacter xylosoxidans 0 5 was a unique species the microbial communities under high level oil contamination were enriched in 5 pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa pseudomonas mendocina pseudomonas putida pseudomonas stutzeri and thalassospira profundimaris while pseudomonas putida 0 64 90 and p aeruginosa 0 9 92 only appeared in high level oil contaminated samples in addition thalassospira profundimaris was enriched across all oil contamination levels but exhibited the highest relative abundance at medium level oil contamination 3 07 6 83 simultaneously high throughput qpcr assays showed that a total of 8 pathogenic marker genes were detected affiliated with 6 genera species marker genes for p aeruginosa were detected under high level oil contamination with the regulatory exotoxin gene rega reaching 5 7 1010 copies l relative abundance was 0 0139 and the ecfx involved in haem uptake or virulence was detected at an average of 1 34 1011 copies l relative abundance was 0 0185 supplementary table s1 the potential of these pathogenic bacteria to degrade crude oil was further investigated by genomic analysis fig 4c supplementary fig s2 other than fusobacterium nucleatum the only pathogen that occurred in nonoil contaminated samples and acinetobacter junii which was only present in the samples under oil contamination at low levels the other pathogens possessed genes for the degradation of alkane or and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds suggesting the possibility that pathogens enriched under oil contamination use oil as a carbon source all pseudomonas spp enriched in the samples under oil contamination at high levels essentially contained the most diverse degrading genes such as the key alkane degradation gene alkb the long chain alkane degradation gene lada and the gene encoding erythrin oxygen reducing protein reductase rubb as well as benzoate dioxygenase and catechol dioxygenase for the degradation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and the key enzyme protocatechuate dioxygenase for the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons strains of achromobacter xylosoxidans enriched in the samples under oil contamination at medium levels were among the few strains with naphthalene dioxygenase a key gene for pah degradation and two of them possessed the long chain alkane degradation gene lada 3 3 the impact of oil contamination on the antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria considering the derived risks caused by antibiotic resistance the profiles of args and mges were also revealed in total 110 args and 26 mges were detected with more args detected in the oil contaminated samples the abundance of args and mges increased under oil contamination fig 5 a with the highest abundance of args 0 9 copies cell at day 14 of oil contamination 8 times more than that of nonoil contaminated samples the relative abundances of args and megs which were dominated by multidrug resistance genes and transposon genes respectively increased along with the oil contamination level from day 0 to 14 and then decreased on day 21 with respect to resistance mechanisms antibiotic deactivation type args were dominant in nonoil contaminated samples 62 and the proportion of antibiotic efflux related args increased from 10 before oil contamination to 39 4 under high level oil contamination fig 5b a significant positive correlation between the relative abundance of args and mges was determined r2 0 89 p 0 0001 based on cca analysis significant positive correlations between mges total args total multidrug resistance genes pseudomonas and high level oil contamination were revealed fig 5c then a cooccurrence network was constructed to identify the potential hosts of args and megs pseudomonas stutzeri cooccurred with two multidrug resistance genes mexe mera marko and an mge gene is5 is1182 and p aeruginosa may be a potential host for beta lactam resistance genes blafoxnew blagob acinetobacter junii may carry aminoglycoside genes aac 3 id ie when pseudomonas putida was a potential host for blagob genes and thalassospira profundimaris may carry two mges ispps1 pseud pbs228 incp 1α fig 5d 3 4 pathogenicity validation of the isolated pseudomonas aeruginosa strain under oil contamination to verify whether these potential pathogens exhibit characteristics for both oil utilization and pathogenicity strains were isolated from the enrichment systems resulting in 40 strains supplementary table s2 of which 8 species were also detected in high throughput sequencing datasets as shown in fig 4 a potential pathogenic bacterial strain affiliated with p aeruginosa named pa2 15 displayed strong degradation capability for a variety of petroleum hydrocarbons fig 6 a then the strain was employed in an infection experiment to validate its pathogenicity in grass carp oil exposure had an impact on the vitality of fish especially their motility with death occurring at day 2 after the first infection of strain pa2 15 solution and some significant symptoms of p aeruginosa were observed at day 3 including haemolytic ascites cloacal hemorrhage lesions of the tail fin and pathological changes in the liver fig 6c confirming the pathogenicity of strain pa2 15 since only a few deaths were discovered but several fish displayed injuries and symptoms the fish were infected a second time with double the concentration and dose eight out of ten fish 80 in oepch died by day 6 the day after the second infection but only 3 fish in pch 30 and 1 fish in oepc l oepc m and pc l died fig 6b and supplementary table s3 in addition some fish appeared skin hemorrhage especially along the abdomen fins and gills showing symptoms similar to red skin disease weichert et al 2021 fig 6d finally the lethality of oepch reached 100 which was higher than that of pch 70 the lethality rates of the oil exposure groups were all higher than those of the groups without oil contamination in addition the lethality of the samples infected with environmental strain pa2 15 was higher than that of samples infected with clinical strain boston 41 501 which is a quality control strain often used in pathogen research 3 5 the oil degradation potential and environmental distribution of the discovered pathogens to assess whether more diverse oil degrading pathogens and their potential reservoirs exist the oil degradation potential of pathogenic bacteria discovered thus far was explored and their environmental distribution was investigated in total 1358 genomes of pathogenic bacteria were collected and their oil degradation potential was investigated fig 7 a supplementary figs s4 and s5 supplementary table s4 and s5 in total 221 strains possessing genes for alkane degradation were observed across 34 genera dominated by mycobacterium 59 pseudomonas 32 burkholderia 30 and acinetobacter 26 at the species level 83 species were detected and mycobacterium tuberculosis 29 acinetobacter baumannii 23 p aeruginosa 13 and burkholderia pseudomallei 12 were the most dominant species among all the genes involved in alkane degradation the key degrading genes alkb and lada were the most frequently detected genes 149 and 142 strains respectively and existed in most strains of the dominant species while most mycobacterium tuberculosis strains only possessed alkb acinetobacter baumannii and p aeruginosa strains had both genes with regard to aromatic degradation 576 strains were detected to have related degradation genes across 56 genera and 181 species among them bacillus cereus 40 staphylococcus aureus 29 salmonella enterica 24 listeria monocytogenes 23 and acinetobacter baumannii 23 were the most dominant species cate hgd pcah and pcag were the most frequently detected genes in 257 255 224 and 176 strains respectively furthermore their global distribution in marine environments was investigated based on tara oceans shotgun sequencing samples fig 7b and supplementary table s6 in total 23 pathogenic bacteria with oil degradation potential were detected at 58 stations across 22 provinces covering 4 marine pelagic biomes including coastal trades westerlies and polar biomes the samples with high relative abundance 0 01 and species richness 5 of oil degrading pathogenic bacteria were mainly distributed in coastal and trades biomes while most coastal samples simultaneously exhibited high relative abundance and richness 5 coastal samples 2 trades biomes and 0 other biomes therein the chile peru current coastal province 0 06 6 and eastern africa coastal province 0 02 9 seemed to face more serious microbial risk among these pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri and staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent species occurring in 59 59 6 and 45 samples 45 5 respectively 4 discussion coastal zones are important recreational areas and humans regularly make contact with the waters of these zones even though these areas experience constant oil spills these sudden or long term oil incidents often result in microbial community shifts presumably driven by the response characteristics of microbial populations such as their hydrocarbon degradation capability and resistance to toxics and derived adverse conditions overwhelmingly pseudomonas was the biomarker genus for oil contamination with a dose dependent increase in relative abundance many previous studies have also detected the dominance of pseudomonas in oil contaminated environments atlas et al 2015 patowary et al 2017 and pseudomonas species are well known for their affinity and strong degradation capacity for various petroleum components xue et al 2015 however this genus also includes many pathogens therefore combining full length 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing approach with a curated pathogen database we resolved a more precise profile of the potential pathogenic bacterial community the results indicated that oil contamination increased the microbial diversity of pathogenic bacteria dominated by 4 pseudomonas species and the number and relative abundance increased proportionally to the extent of oil contamination indicating that oil contamination could cause a directional shift in bacterial communities from nonpathogenic communities with high biodiversity to pathogen dominated communities with low biodiversity increasing microbial risks to marine life and human health considering the significance of biodiversity to ecosystem stability pennekamp et al 2018 this alteration also poses a threat to the multifunctionality of coastal ecosystems in terms of the origin of these pathogens it is interesting to find that only fusobacterium nucleatum was discovered in pre oil samples which is a bacterial pathogen of oral origin rubinstein et al 2013 those pathogens enriched in oil contaminated seawater were all opportunists that have broad environmental reservoirs lai and shao 2012 ren et al 2014 ruggiero et al 2016 which are often encountered and isolated from oil or pah contaminated sites and have been verified to have great potential in eliminating oil pollution dave et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 2014 in agreement with our investigation showing that their genomes all possessed degradation genes for alkanes or and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds thus their oil utilization capability is likely an important reason why they thrive in oil contaminated seawater furthermore their different utilizing preferences for petroleum components may lead to their varied competitiveness under oil contamination for example thalassospira profundimaris showed dominance under medium level oil contamination according to its genomic content thalassospira profundimaris possessed two key genes encoding enzyme subunits catalyzing protocatechuic acid cleavage without any alkane degradation gene suggesting its potential in utilizing downstream intermediates of pah degradation and its narrow range of carbon sources provides a clue to their lower competitiveness under low level and high level oil contamination in addition it raises a vital question of whether pathogens or oil degraders are recognized in the first place for example as a chemoheterotrophic bacterium widespread in marine environments thalassospira profundimaris captured growing interest because of their capability for pah degradation and vital role in phosphorus cycling when the first strain was isolated as a petroleum degrading microbe in 2007 lai and shao 2012 however the first case of human disease caused by this species via contact with seawater was reported in 2013 marchese et al 2019 this time lag raises concerns the next important question is whether these environmental strains could lead to a substantial risk of death or injury to address this issue not only genomic investigation but also animal experiments were conducted in our study regarding virulence factors p aeruginosa was detected to carry a high abundance of the rega gene which regulates toxin a in oil contaminated samples indicative of its potential pathogenicity a similar increase in virulence genes was also reported in oil contaminated deep seawater which showed values three times higher than that in uncontaminated areas lee et al 2013 furthermore infection experiments involving the isolated p aeruginosa strain in the present study confirmed that these opportunistic oil degrading pathogens can retain their pathogenicity even posing a more serious threat to grass carp than the quality control strain previous studies also compared clinical and environmental strains of p aeruginosa and the results indicated that they were functionally equivalent in terms of alkane utilization ability and clinically relevant traits alonso et al 1999 several environmental strains are even responsible for infections in cystic fibrosis patients kaszab et al 2016 suggesting that the difference between virulent and nonvirulent strains is not yet clear for opportunistic pathogens but one thing should be noted that the cell number of p aeruginosa strain injected in this study was higher than that in the environments so it may take longer to exhibit the harmfulness of the pathogenic strain in the actual oil contaminated aquatic environments more importantly our results also revealed earlier death occurrence and higher lethality under oil contamination demonstrating that pathogenicity could be further enhanced by oil contamination previous toxicity studies have shown that a broad range of petroleum fractions are responsible for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms generally leading to alterations in innate adaptive immune responses hosts whose immune systems are compromised will be more easily infected by opportunistic pathogens bayha et al 2017 also suggested that oil exposure is able to impair the immune functions of southern flounder increasing their susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens thus in addition to the intrinsic virulence of the pathogen these results implied a synergistic effect of oil contamination on opportunistic pathogen hazards leading to nonnegligible risks previous studies have illustrated that pollutants can facilitate resistance gene exchange guo et al 2018 nõlvak et al 2018 wang et al 2020 in our study it was found that oil contamination enriched args accelerating their spread among pathogens and a high proportion of args encoding the efflux pump system were detected many bacteria contain multidrug resistance mdr efflux pumps which can be induced by pollutants such as crude oil associated metals and organic pollutants nicklisch et al 2014 shaw and dussan 2015 and activated efflux pump systems can function in extruding toxic components li et al 1998 as well as resistance to antibiotics siriyong et al 2017 even contributing to their virulence by exporting invasion determinants and facilitating biofilm formation hirakata et al 2009 miryala et al 2019 making a large contribution to environmental adaptation and pathogenicity of bacteria in polluted habitats lubelski et al 2007 one national study zilberberg and shorr 2013 reported that multidrug resistant p aeruginosa were responsible for a 22 and 14 7 prevalence of pneumonia and blood stream infections stressing the increasing danger caused by multidrug resistance although only p stutzeri was identified as a potential host for mdr genes in our study other pathogens enriched under oil contamination have also been reported to possess mdr efflux pumps marchese et al 2019 traglia et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 signifying the better adaptability of pathogens in oil contaminated seawater in addition to the microcosm experiments the global genomic investigation demonstrated that a staggering proportion of existing pure cultures of pathogenic bacteria possessed petroleum degrading genes across a variety of genera among the high ranking species in addition to p aeruginosa which occurred in this study acinetobacter baumannii and burkholderia pseudomallei also have broad environmental reservoirs liu et al 2016 wiersinga et al 2006 although mycobacterium tuberculosis and klebsiella pneumoniae mainly inhabit human and clinical environments a few environmental strains have also been isolated from aquatic and soil environments akita et al 2021 niemelä and väätänen 1982 velayati et al 2015 these strains of m tuberculosis in contaminated soils can remain culturable for long periods reinforcing our idea that contamination may benefit their proliferation their distribution in global marine environments further revealed the extensive pathogenic risk that exists especially in coastal zones these results suggested a wanted list of pathogenic bacteria that can be promoted by oil contamination and highlighted that oil induced pathogen reservoirs may be ubiquitous 5 conclusions in the present study molecular evidence animal experiments and global genomic data analysis were combined to comprehensively characterize the occurrence metabolic potential antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity of pathogenic bacteria under oil contamination the results revealed significant enrichment of opportunistic pathogens that retain pathogenicity suggesting that oil contaminated coastal seawaters are pathogen reservoirs that can not only enrich these oil degrading pathogens and induce args increasing but also disrupt the immune system of hosts implying that oil contamination may be a driving force for pathogenic bacterial enrichment and related to high lethality leading to increased hazards in addition to the key pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas discovered in sampling sites in this study the global investigation extends our knowledge of oil induced pathogen risks covering more diverse potentially oil degrading pathogenic bacteria and broader distributions in marine environments taken together the present study highlighted that oil contaminated sites are overlooked pathogen reservoirs and pathogen control should be incorporated into oil pollution bioremediation strategies in which oil degrading nonpathogenic bacterial strains may be used as antagonists of these pathogens by competing for petroleum compounds funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41976141 and the open project funding of key

14638,in addition to the organic pollutants and disturbance to the microbial plant and animal systems oil contamination can also enrich opportunistic pathogens but little is known about whether and how the most common coastal oil contaminated water bodies act as reservoirs for pathogens here we delved into the characteristics of pathogenic bacteria in coastal zones by constructing seawater based microcosms with diesel oil as a pollutant 16s rrna gene full length sequencing and genomic exploration revealed that pathogenic bacteria with genes involved in alkane or aromatic degradation were significantly enriched under oil contamination providing a genetic basis for them to thrive in oil contaminated seawater moreover high throughput qpcr assays showed an increased abundance of the virulence gene and enrichment in antibiotics resistance genes args especially those related to multidrug resistance efflux pumps and their high relevance to pseudomonas enabling this genus to achieve high levels of pathogenicity and environmental adaptation more importantly infection experiments with a culturable p aeruginosa strain isolated from an oil contaminated microcosm provided clear evidence that the environmental strain was pathogenic to grass carp ctenopharyngodon idellus and the highest lethality rate was found in the oil pollutant treatment demonstrating the synergistic effect of toxic oil pollutants and pathogens on infected fish a global genomic investigation then revealed that diverse environmental pathogenic bacteria with oil degradation potential are widely distributed in marine environments especially in coastal zones suggesting extensive pathogenic reservoir risks in oil contaminated sites overall the study uncovered a hidden microbial risk showing that oil contaminated seawater could be a high risk pathogen reservoir and provides new insights and potential targets for environmental risk assessment and control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oil contamination pathogen reservoir pathogenicity antibiotics resistance genes infection data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid economic growth has been accompanied by increasing oil consumption which causes accidental and inevitable oil discharges resulting in large scale oil contamination of aquatic environments ma et al 2021 coastal zones acting as hotpots for shipping mariculture and recreational functions and are regarded as marine environments most closely linked to human activities the frequent oil contamination and bioremediation that occurs in these areas present some of the most serious global environmental issues and there is rising concern about the negative influences crude oil has on human and environmental health and an urgent demand for oil removal varjani and upasani 2017 bacteria are well known to play a critical role in crude oil degradation and numerous studies have demonstrated that bacteria capable of degrading hazardous petroleum constituents such as alcanivorax thalassolituus cycloclasticus and colwellia are enriched in oil contaminated environments campeão et al 2017 these oil degrading bacteria are consistently isolated and applied in bioremediation sarkar et al 2016 however a cursory look at the catalog of oil degrading microorganisms shows that it is not uncommon to find species that are opportunistic pathogens for humans animals and plants such as pseudomonas aeruginosa burkholderia cepacia xylella fastidiosa and acinetobacter baumannii redak et al 2003 trivedi et al 2015 for instance a verified efficient degrader of crude oil pseudomonas stutzeri is also a cause of knee arthritis in children nithya and babu 2017 this finding not only raises concerns about the control of environmental risks associated with the use of these microbes in bioremediation which has not yet been investigated but also suggests that the oil utilization capabilities of pathogenic bacteria may be responsible for their ability to thrive in oil contaminated environments since pathogen reservoirs are a part of the infectious disease cycle all bacterial pathogens must have at least one reservoir in which the pathogen is normally viable and from which infection of hosts can occur both animate reservoirs e g humans or animals and inanimate reservoirs such as water soil or food are common reservoirs as early as 1999 a strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from oil contaminated soil and it was verified to be capable of invading epithelial cells alonso et al 1999 in an investigation of the microbial diversity associated with tarball contamination formed after an oil spill event fernandes et al fernandes et al 2020 detected 36 potential human pathogens from tarballs especially an unusual surge of vibrio which is an important pathogen accumulated in seafood in tarball contaminated seawater compared to tarball free seawater indicating pathogen enrichment in oil related environments furthermore the increasing incidences of vibrio infected skin lesions or sores in fish were reported in the aftermath of severe oil spill accidents in the gulf of mexico murawski et al 2014 suggesting an emerging infection risk hidden in oil contamination these investigations imply the possibility that oil contaminated marine environments may be reservoirs for pathogens which serve as hotbeds for their survival and infectivity but our knowledge of pathogens in oil contaminated sites is still lacking more comprehensive studies are essential to discern whether and how oil contaminated sites act as reservoirs for petroleum degrading pathogenic bacteria which in turn may greatly improve the safety and efficacy of bioremediation for oil polluted environments therefore in the present study laboratory experiments and large scale data investigations were conducted simultaneously to test the hypothesis that oil contaminated areas in coastal zones may function as reservoirs for oil degrading pathogenic bacteria coastal seawater based microcosms were constructed with diesel oil as a contaminant and 16s rrna full length sequencing and ht qpcr assays were employed to comprehensively explore the effects of oil contamination on the microbial diversity oil degradation potential virulence factors and antibiotic resistance of potential pathogenic bacteria and animal experiments were further conducted to find evidence for the identification of pathogenic reservoirs furthermore a global investigation was conducted to screen pathogens with oil degradation potential and their environmental reservoirs to uncover more potentially extensive oil induced pathogen reservoirs in the present study oil contaminated seawater environments are evaluated as reservoirs for pathogens based on their occurrence oil utilization ability and pathogenicity providing valuable clues for bioremediation strategies and potential indicators for environmental safety

laboratory within 4 h at room temperature and mixed thoroughly in equal portions to establish the microcosms the microcosms were established by adding 320 ml of collected seawater and 80 ml of inorganic salt culture solution 0 108 mg feso₃ 5 476 mg kh2po4 and 0 92 g nh4 2so4 to 1 l triangular flasks as well as 0 5 1 and 5 diesel oil filtered through a 0 22 μm polyamide filter jinteng representing three levels of oil contamination persistent oil exposure caused by daily offshore shipping mirvakili et al 2013 highly anthropogenically impacted area pollution discharge and oil spill accident fields et al 2014 kumazawa morais et al 2016 here diesel oil was chosen as the signature pollutant by considering that diesel is the main shipping fuel and therefore a major source of oil pollution in surface seawater in coastal zones microcosms that did not contain oil were also established as controls the microcosms were incubated at room temperature and manually shaken periodically to simulate tidal induced fluctuations in surface seawater three replicates were set up for each treatment 2 2 full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis samples were collected from microcosms

cultivation the colonies were quadrant streaked several times for purification followed by 16s rrna gene amplification with universal bacterial primers 27f and 1492r then the products were sequenced on an abi prism 3730xl sequencer the taxonomic assignment of these isolates was performed by aligning the 16s rrna gene sequences against the ezbiocloud database to determine the pathogenicity and oil degradation capability of pseudomonas aeruginosa pa2 15 isolated from microcosm under high level oil contamination infection experiments and oil degradation rate assay were conducted the details were shown in supplementary methods 2 5 oil degradation potential and environmental distribution investigation of pathogenic bacteria the genomes of pathogenic bacteria were collected according to disease records in the bv brc database and other sources an et al 2020 fang et al 2018 marchese et al 2019 olson et al 2023 resulting in 1358 genomes constituting a curated pathogenic bacteria database these genomes were subjected to functional annotation against the kegg database and their oil degradation related genes were retrieved and summarized their 16s rrna gene sequences were also retrieved from these 1358 genomes to generate another curated pathogenic bacterial 16s rrna gene database alignment of these 16s rrna gene sequences was achieved on the mafft platform katoh et al 2019 and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method with bootstrap analysis for 1000 replicates the phylogenetic tree was further edited on the chiplot platform https www chiplot online tvbot html to assess potential risks from oil degrading pathogenic bacteria their global distribution in marine environments was further investigated using shotgun sequencing datasets from tara oceans prokaryote enriched samples project prjeb1787 n 136 the corresponding taxonomic assignment matrix was downloaded from study mgys00000410 in the mgnify platform and the samples sequenced on the 454 gs flx titanium platform and those with few reads were filtered finally 99 samples remained then the relative abundances of the oil degrading pathogenic bacteria were calculated and extracted from the reshaped taxonomic assignment matrix and their visualization of global distribution was achieved using the rworldmap package on the r platform the main workflow is shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 oil contamination altered the microbial diversity and community structure in seawater the time series samples subjected to full length 16s rrna gene sequencing generated 313 971 reads and 754 asvs oil contamination led to a decrease in the number of asvs in seawater and the higher the oil concentration was the lower the number of asvs for the alpha diversity the richness shannon and pd indices all decreased significantly in oil contaminated samples in comparison to controls p 0 0001 for richness and pd indices p 0 05 for shannon wilcox test fig 2 the only exception was the shannon indices of samples under medium level of oil contamination the diversity indices of these samples were lowest under high level oil contamination principal coordinate analysis illustrated that the nonoil contaminated samples were separated from oil contaminated samples and community structures were also significantly different among samples under different oil contamination levels permanova p 0 01 fig 2b with respect to taxonomic distribution a total of 17 bacterial phyla were observed among all samples predominated by proteobacteria 54 03 100 epsilonbacteraeota 0 27 91 campilobacterota 0 12 12 and bacteroidetes 0 16 28 however the number of phyla in microbial communities decreased sharply from 17 to 3 after oil contamination most phyla disappeared after oil treatment except proteobacteria which had an absolute advantage in oil contaminated samples 93 40 100 fig 3 a at the family level the relative abundance of pseudomonadaceae increased with oil concentration reaching 81 7 2 6 in oil contaminated samples at high level oil contamination at the genus level fig 3b 169 genera were detected in total therein 138 genera were unique in nonoil contaminated samples when neptuniibacter predominated 3 06 36 40 in contrast 17 genera only occurred in oil contaminated samples with predominance of pseudomonas 25 13 82 21 acinetobacter 0 32 03 and thalassospira 3 48 19 21 pseudomonas overwhelmingly dominated the oil contaminated samples and its relative abundance significantly increased with the oil contamination level reaching 82 21 on day 7 and 81 10 on day 14 under high level oil contamination acinetobacter was detected only in oil contaminated samples at a low level with a relative abundance of 32 03 on day 7 and 20 50 on day 14 thalassospira exhibited comparable relative abundance under different oil contamination levels but showed a clear temporal increase reaching 12 77 15 79 on day 14 in addition neptunomonas displayed the highest relative abundance in oil contaminated samples at medium level 15 45 on day 7 and 4 88 on day 14 furthermore lefse analysis indicated that pseudomonas was the main biomarker for oil contamination supplementary fig s1 at the species level fig 3c pseudomonas oleovorans was dominant 15 followed by pseudomonas pachastrellae 6 8 and pseudomonas alcaligenes 5 2 the heatmap further grouped the top 50 species in terms of relative abundance into two distinct clusters fig 3d the populations in cluster 1 included species dominant in nonoil contaminated samples such as neptuniibacter sp and bacterium whc3 3 while the dominant populations in oil contaminated samples such as pseudomonas oleovorans and pseudomonas pachastrellae were almost all in cluster 2 3 2 enrichment of the pathogenic microbial community under oil contamination to track alterations in the pathogenic microbial communities in response to oil contamination the 16s rrna gene datasets were further assigned against the curated pathogen database eight pathogenic species were detected in total and the number of species sharply increased under oil contamination from 1 to 7 fig 4 a pcoa further revealed the presence of different pathogenic microbial communities under different oil treatments at the species level fig 4b fusobacterium nucleatum was the only pathogen detected in the nonoil contaminated samples and it was detected only once at a low relative abundance of 0 22 on day 14 seven pathogenic bacteria were detected in the oil contaminated samples and the relative abundance of pathogens increased with the oil contamination level accounting for 3 43 at low level 0 6 50 6 52 at medium level 4 41 8 61 and 18 42 at high level 0 48 74 82 on average temporal increases in the relative abundance of pathogens were also observed from 12 08 on day 7 to 18 on day 14 on average we also found that different oil contamination levels enriched different pathogenic populations fig 4c two pathogens acinetobacter junii and thalassospira profundimaris were enriched under oil contamination at low levels and acinetobacter junii 0 1 07 only appeared under this treatment the microbial communities under oil contamination at medium levels were enriched with 4 pathogenic bacteria achromobacter xylosoxidans pseudomonas mendocina pseudomonas stutzeri and thalassospira profundimaris and achromobacter xylosoxidans 0 5 was a unique species the microbial communities under high level oil contamination were enriched in 5 pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa pseudomonas mendocina pseudomonas putida pseudomonas stutzeri and thalassospira profundimaris while pseudomonas putida 0 64 90 and p aeruginosa 0 9 92 only appeared in high level oil contaminated samples in addition thalassospira profundimaris was enriched across all oil contamination levels but exhibited the highest relative abundance at medium level oil contamination 3 07 6 83 simultaneously high throughput qpcr assays showed that a total of 8 pathogenic marker genes were detected affiliated with 6 genera species marker genes for p aeruginosa were detected under high level oil contamination with the regulatory exotoxin gene rega reaching 5 7 1010 copies l relative abundance was 0 0139 and the ecfx involved in haem uptake or virulence was detected at an average of 1 34 1011 copies l relative abundance was 0 0185 supplementary table s1 the potential of these pathogenic bacteria to degrade crude oil was further investigated by genomic analysis fig 4c supplementary fig s2 other than fusobacterium nucleatum the only pathogen that occurred in nonoil contaminated samples and acinetobacter junii which was only present in the samples under oil contamination at low levels the other pathogens possessed genes for the degradation of alkane or and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds suggesting the possibility that pathogens enriched under oil contamination use oil as a carbon source all pseudomonas spp enriched in the samples under oil contamination at high levels essentially contained the most diverse degrading genes such as the key alkane degradation gene alkb the long chain alkane degradation gene lada and the gene encoding erythrin oxygen reducing protein reductase rubb as well as benzoate dioxygenase and catechol dioxygenase for the degradation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and the key enzyme protocatechuate dioxygenase for the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons strains of achromobacter xylosoxidans enriched in the samples under oil contamination at medium levels were among the few strains with naphthalene dioxygenase a key gene for pah degradation and two of them possessed the long chain alkane degradation gene lada 3 3 the impact of oil contamination on the antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria considering the derived risks caused by antibiotic resistance the profiles of args and mges were also revealed in total 110 args and 26 mges were detected with more args detected in the oil contaminated samples the abundance of args and mges increased under oil contamination fig 5 a with the highest abundance of args 0 9 copies cell at day 14 of oil contamination 8 times more than that of nonoil contaminated samples the relative abundances of args and megs which were dominated by multidrug resistance genes and transposon genes respectively increased along with the oil contamination level from day 0 to 14 and then decreased on day 21 with respect to resistance mechanisms antibiotic deactivation type args were dominant in nonoil contaminated samples 62 and the proportion of antibiotic efflux related args increased from 10 before oil contamination to 39 4 under high level oil contamination fig 5b a significant positive correlation between the relative abundance of args and mges was determined r2 0 89 p 0 0001 based on cca analysis significant positive correlations between mges total args total multidrug resistance genes pseudomonas and high level oil contamination were revealed fig 5c then a cooccurrence network was constructed to identify the potential hosts of args and megs pseudomonas stutzeri cooccurred with two multidrug resistance genes mexe mera marko and an mge gene is5 is1182 and p aeruginosa may be a potential host for beta lactam resistance genes blafoxnew blagob acinetobacter junii may carry aminoglycoside genes aac 3 id ie when pseudomonas putida was a potential host for blagob genes and thalassospira profundimaris may carry two mges ispps1 pseud pbs228 incp 1α fig 5d 3 4 pathogenicity validation of the isolated pseudomonas aeruginosa strain under oil contamination to verify whether these potential pathogens exhibit characteristics for both oil utilization and pathogenicity strains were isolated from the enrichment systems resulting in 40 strains supplementary table s2 of which 8 species were also detected in high throughput sequencing datasets as shown in fig 4 a potential pathogenic bacterial strain affiliated with p aeruginosa named pa2 15 displayed strong degradation capability for a variety of petroleum hydrocarbons fig 6 a then the strain was employed in an infection experiment to validate its pathogenicity in grass carp oil exposure had an impact on the vitality of fish especially their motility with death occurring at day 2 after the first infection of strain pa2 15 solution and some significant symptoms of p aeruginosa were observed at day 3 including haemolytic ascites cloacal hemorrhage lesions of the tail fin and pathological changes in the liver fig 6c confirming the pathogenicity of strain pa2 15 since only a few deaths were discovered but several fish displayed injuries and symptoms the fish were infected a second time with double the concentration and dose eight out of ten fish 80 in oepch died by day 6 the day after the second infection but only 3 fish in pch 30 and 1 fish in oepc l oepc m and pc l died fig 6b and supplementary table s3 in addition some fish appeared skin hemorrhage especially along the abdomen fins and gills showing symptoms similar to red skin disease weichert et al 2021 fig 6d finally the lethality of oepch reached 100 which was higher than that of pch 70 the lethality rates of the oil exposure groups were all higher than those of the groups without oil contamination in addition the lethality of the samples infected with environmental strain pa2 15 was higher than that of samples infected with clinical strain boston 41 501 which is a quality control strain often used in pathogen research 3 5 the oil degradation potential and environmental distribution of the discovered pathogens to assess whether more diverse oil degrading pathogens and their potential reservoirs exist the oil degradation potential of pathogenic bacteria discovered thus far was explored and their environmental distribution was investigated in total 1358 genomes of pathogenic bacteria were collected and their oil degradation potential was investigated fig 7 a supplementary figs s4 and s5 supplementary table s4 and s5 in total 221 strains possessing genes for alkane degradation were observed across 34 genera dominated by mycobacterium 59 pseudomonas 32 burkholderia 30 and acinetobacter 26 at the species level 83 species were detected and mycobacterium tuberculosis 29 acinetobacter baumannii 23 p aeruginosa 13 and burkholderia pseudomallei 12 were the most dominant species among all the genes involved in alkane degradation the key degrading genes alkb and lada were the most frequently detected genes 149 and 142 strains respectively and existed in most strains of the dominant species while most mycobacterium tuberculosis strains only possessed alkb acinetobacter baumannii and p aeruginosa strains had both genes with regard to aromatic degradation 576 strains were detected to have related degradation genes across 56 genera and 181 species among them bacillus cereus 40 staphylococcus aureus 29 salmonella enterica 24 listeria monocytogenes 23 and acinetobacter baumannii 23 were the most dominant species cate hgd pcah and pcag were the most frequently detected genes in 257 255 224 and 176 strains respectively furthermore their global distribution in marine environments was investigated based on tara oceans shotgun sequencing samples fig 7b and supplementary table s6 in total 23 pathogenic bacteria with oil degradation potential were detected at 58 stations across 22 provinces covering 4 marine pelagic biomes including coastal trades westerlies and polar biomes the samples with high relative abundance 0 01 and species richness 5 of oil degrading pathogenic bacteria were mainly distributed in coastal and trades biomes while most coastal samples simultaneously exhibited high relative abundance and richness 5 coastal samples 2 trades biomes and 0 other biomes therein the chile peru current coastal province 0 06 6 and eastern africa coastal province 0 02 9 seemed to face more serious microbial risk among these pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri and staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent species occurring in 59 59 6 and 45 samples 45 5 respectively 4 discussion coastal zones are important recreational areas and humans regularly make contact with the waters of these zones even though these areas experience constant oil spills these sudden or long term oil incidents often result in microbial community shifts presumably driven by the response characteristics of microbial populations such as their hydrocarbon degradation capability and resistance to toxics and derived adverse conditions overwhelmingly pseudomonas was the biomarker genus for oil contamination with a dose dependent increase in relative abundance many previous studies have also detected the dominance of pseudomonas in oil contaminated environments atlas et al 2015 patowary et al 2017 and pseudomonas species are well known for their affinity and strong degradation capacity for various petroleum components xue et al 2015 however this genus also includes many pathogens therefore combining full length 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing approach with a curated pathogen database we resolved a more precise profile of the potential pathogenic bacterial community the results indicated that oil contamination increased the microbial diversity of pathogenic bacteria dominated by 4 pseudomonas species and the number and relative abundance increased proportionally to the extent of oil contamination indicating that oil contamination could cause a directional shift in bacterial communities from nonpathogenic communities with high biodiversity to pathogen dominated communities with low biodiversity increasing microbial risks to marine life and human health considering the significance of biodiversity to ecosystem stability pennekamp et al 2018 this alteration also poses a threat to the multifunctionality of coastal ecosystems in terms of the origin of these pathogens it is interesting to find that only fusobacterium nucleatum was discovered in pre oil samples which is a bacterial pathogen of oral origin rubinstein et al 2013 those pathogens enriched in oil contaminated seawater were all opportunists that have broad environmental reservoirs lai and shao 2012 ren et al 2014 ruggiero et al 2016 which are often encountered and isolated from oil or pah contaminated sites and have been verified to have great potential in eliminating oil pollution dave et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 2014 in agreement with our investigation showing that their genomes all possessed degradation genes for alkanes or and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds thus their oil utilization capability is likely an important reason why they thrive in oil contaminated seawater furthermore their different utilizing preferences for petroleum components may lead to their varied competitiveness under oil contamination for example thalassospira profundimaris showed dominance under medium level oil contamination according to its genomic content thalassospira profundimaris possessed two key genes encoding enzyme subunits catalyzing protocatechuic acid cleavage without any alkane degradation gene suggesting its potential in utilizing downstream intermediates of pah degradation and its narrow range of carbon sources provides a clue to their lower competitiveness under low level and high level oil contamination in addition it raises a vital question of whether pathogens or oil degraders are recognized in the first place for example as a chemoheterotrophic bacterium widespread in marine environments thalassospira profundimaris captured growing interest because of their capability for pah degradation and vital role in phosphorus cycling when the first strain was isolated as a petroleum degrading microbe in 2007 lai and shao 2012 however the first case of human disease caused by this species via contact with seawater was reported in 2013 marchese et al 2019 this time lag raises concerns the next important question is whether these environmental strains could lead to a substantial risk of death or injury to address this issue not only genomic investigation but also animal experiments were conducted in our study regarding virulence factors p aeruginosa was detected to carry a high abundance of the rega gene which regulates toxin a in oil contaminated samples indicative of its potential pathogenicity a similar increase in virulence genes was also reported in oil contaminated deep seawater which showed values three times higher than that in uncontaminated areas lee et al 2013 furthermore infection experiments involving the isolated p aeruginosa strain in the present study confirmed that these opportunistic oil degrading pathogens can retain their pathogenicity even posing a more serious threat to grass carp than the quality control strain previous studies also compared clinical and environmental strains of p aeruginosa and the results indicated that they were functionally equivalent in terms of alkane utilization ability and clinically relevant traits alonso et al 1999 several environmental strains are even responsible for infections in cystic fibrosis patients kaszab et al 2016 suggesting that the difference between virulent and nonvirulent strains is not yet clear for opportunistic pathogens but one thing should be noted that the cell number of p aeruginosa strain injected in this study was higher than that in the environments so it may take longer to exhibit the harmfulness of the pathogenic strain in the actual oil contaminated aquatic environments more importantly our results also revealed earlier death occurrence and higher lethality under oil contamination demonstrating that pathogenicity could be further enhanced by oil contamination previous toxicity studies have shown that a broad range of petroleum fractions are responsible for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms generally leading to alterations in innate adaptive immune responses hosts whose immune systems are compromised will be more easily infected by opportunistic pathogens bayha et al 2017 also suggested that oil exposure is able to impair the immune functions of southern flounder increasing their susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens thus in addition to the intrinsic virulence of the pathogen these results implied a synergistic effect of oil contamination on opportunistic pathogen hazards leading to nonnegligible risks previous studies have illustrated that pollutants can facilitate resistance gene exchange guo et al 2018 nõlvak et al 2018 wang et al 2020 in our study it was found that oil contamination enriched args accelerating their spread among pathogens and a high proportion of args encoding the efflux pump system were detected many bacteria contain multidrug resistance mdr efflux pumps which can be induced by pollutants such as crude oil associated metals and organic pollutants nicklisch et al 2014 shaw and dussan 2015 and activated efflux pump systems can function in extruding toxic components li et al 1998 as well as resistance to antibiotics siriyong et al 2017 even contributing to their virulence by exporting invasion determinants and facilitating biofilm formation hirakata et al 2009 miryala et al 2019 making a large contribution to environmental adaptation and pathogenicity of bacteria in polluted habitats lubelski et al 2007 one national study zilberberg and shorr 2013 reported that multidrug resistant p aeruginosa were responsible for a 22 and 14 7 prevalence of pneumonia and blood stream infections stressing the increasing danger caused by multidrug resistance although only p stutzeri was identified as a potential host for mdr genes in our study other pathogens enriched under oil contamination have also been reported to possess mdr efflux pumps marchese et al 2019 traglia et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 signifying the better adaptability of pathogens in oil contaminated seawater in addition to the microcosm experiments the global genomic investigation demonstrated that a staggering proportion of existing pure cultures of pathogenic bacteria possessed petroleum degrading genes across a variety of genera among the high ranking species in addition to p aeruginosa which occurred in this study acinetobacter baumannii and burkholderia pseudomallei also have broad environmental reservoirs liu et al 2016 wiersinga et al 2006 although mycobacterium tuberculosis and klebsiella pneumoniae mainly inhabit human and clinical environments a few environmental strains have also been isolated from aquatic and soil environments akita et al 2021 niemelä and väätänen 1982 velayati et al 2015 these strains of m tuberculosis in contaminated soils can remain culturable for long periods reinforcing our idea that contamination may benefit their proliferation their distribution in global marine environments further revealed the extensive pathogenic risk that exists especially in coastal zones these results suggested a wanted list of pathogenic bacteria that can be promoted by oil contamination and highlighted that oil induced pathogen reservoirs may be ubiquitous 5 conclusions in the present study molecular evidence animal experiments and global genomic data analysis were combined to comprehensively characterize the occurrence metabolic potential antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity of pathogenic bacteria under oil contamination the results revealed significant enrichment of opportunistic pathogens that retain pathogenicity suggesting that oil contaminated coastal seawaters are pathogen reservoirs that can not only enrich these oil degrading pathogens and induce args increasing but also disrupt the immune system of hosts implying that oil contamination may be a driving force for pathogenic bacterial enrichment and related to high lethality leading to increased hazards in addition to the key pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas discovered in sampling sites in this study the global investigation extends our knowledge of oil induced pathogen risks covering more diverse potentially oil degrading pathogenic bacteria and broader distributions in marine environments taken together the present study highlighted that oil contaminated sites are overlooked pathogen reservoirs and pathogen control should be incorporated into oil pollution bioremediation strategies in which oil degrading nonpathogenic bacterial strains may be used as

14639,previous studies have demonstrated that e sox can regulate the sedimentary release of phosphorus p in brackish and marine sediments when e sox is active an iron fe and manganese mn oxide rich layer is formed near the sediment surface which prevents p release when e sox becomes inactive the metal oxide layer is reduced via sulfide mediated dissolution and p is subsequently released to the water column cable bacteria have been shown to also occur in freshwater sediments in these sediments sulfide production is limited and the metal oxide layer would thus dissolve less efficiently leaving the p trapped at the sediment surface this lack of an efficient dissolution mechanism implies that e sox could play an important role in the regulation of p availability in eutrophied freshwater streams to test this hypothesis we incubated sediments from a eutrophic freshwater river to investigate the impact of cable bacteria on sedimentary cycling of fe mn and p high resolution depth profiling of ph o2 and σh2s complemented with fish analysis and high throughput gene sequencing showed that the development of e sox activity was closely linked to the enrichment of cable bacteria in incubated sediments cable bacteria activity caused a strong acidification in the suboxic zone leading to the dissolution of fe and mn minerals and consequently a strong release of dissolved fe2 and mn2 to the porewater oxidation of these mobilized ions at the sediment surface led to the formation of a metal oxide layer that trapped dissolved p as shown by the enrichment of p bearing metal oxides in the top layer of the sediment and low phosphate in the pore and overlying water after e sox activity declined the metal oxide layer did not dissolve and p remained trapped at the surface overall our results suggested cable bacteria can play an important role to counteract eutrophication in freshwater systems keywords cable bacteria iron manganese phosphorus sediment geochemistry freshwater sediment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cable bacteria couple the oxidation of dissolved sulfide h2s in anoxic sediment with oxygen o2 or nitrate reduction in surface sediments in a process called electrogenic sulfur oxidation e sox nielsen et al 2010 pfeffer et al 2012 schauer et al 2014 in sediments inhabited by active cable bacteria electrons are transported via their conductive periplasmic fibers over a distance of several centimeters thus allowing the interactions between electron acceptors and electron donors in spatially separated regions risgaard petersen et al 2014 meysman et al 2019 this process differs strongly from the conventional sequence of redox reactions in sediments and exerts a large impact on sediment biogeochemistry nielsen and risgaard petersen 2015 by separating the reactions of oxidation and reduction in space e sox activity typically leads to a wide suboxic zone and strong ph gradients in porewater nielsen et al 2010 meysman et al 2015 as a direct consequence of proton consumption by o2 reduction a ph peak develops in the oxic zone and as a result of proton production via σh2s oxidation the ph decreases considerably in deeper sediment the extensive acidification of the sulfidic zone facilitates the acidic dissolution of reduced metal minerals such as iron sulphides and manganese carbonates in the deeper sedimentary layers resulting in the release of dissolved ferrous iron fe2 and manganese mn2 in the porewater rao et al 2016 sulu gambari et al 2016a when these mobilized ions diffuse upwards they become oxidized by o2 nitrate or mn oxides for fe2 and deposit as iron and manganese oxides at the sediment surface risgaard petersen et al 2012 seitaj et al 2015 sulu gambari et al 2016a rao et al 2016 recent studies demonstrated that cable bacteria play a key role in controlling the cycling of fe sulu gambari et al 2016a van de velde et al 2016 hermans et al 2019a mn sulu gambari et al 2016a van de velde et al 2016 rao et al 2016 p sulu gambari et al 2016b rao et al 2016 hermans et al 2020 2021 and trace elements van de velde et al 2017 2022 in surface sediments of coastal systems importantly the biogeochemical impact on the sedimentary release of dissolved species to the upper water column and affect ecosystem functions at system scale in seasonally hypoxic lake grevelingen the netherlands cable bacteria stimulate the production of fe or mn oxides in surface sediments which mitigates the benthic release of phosphate during periods of e sox activity and the benthic release of sulfide during the hypoxic season seitaj et al 2015 sulu gambari et al 2016b cable bacteria are a widespread phenomenon in marine risgaard petersen et al 2015 burdorf et al 2016 2017 brackish scholz et al 2021 dam et al 2021 and freshwater sediments sandfeld et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in marine and brackish sediments it has been shown that the metal oxide layer that is formed during e sox activity dissolves through sulfide mediated dissolution when e sox activity stops seitaj et al 2015 sulu gambari et al 2016a concurrently any elements that are trapped in this metal oxide layer such as phosphate and arsenic are released to the water column sulu gambari et al 2016b van de velde et al 2022 in freshwater sediments however sulfide production is limited as a result the trapping mechanism of the metal oxide layer could remain active after e sox activity decline which could decrease the phosphate load of the water column in freshwater systems huo et al 2022 a recent study demonstrated a close correlation of species richness and distribution of cable bacteria with water quality in freshwater river systems dong et al 2022 implying that rivers with deteriorated water quality could be hotspots for cable bacteria here a laboratory incubation experiment was used to assess the impact of cable bacteria in sediments from a eutrophic freshwater river on the sedimentary dynamics of fe mn and p high resolution depth profiling of ph o2 and σh2s was conducted to track the temporal variations of e sox activity during the incubation period the population dynamics of cable bacteria and its vertical distribution in sediments are determined by fluorescence microscopy observation and high throughput gene sequencing the combination of novel sedimentary dgt techniques and conventional sequential extraction methods were applied to investigate the speciation and depth profiling of fe mn and p in sediments our results demonstrate that cable bacteria stimulate sedimentary p retention in freshwater sediments and that this trapping mechanism remains active after their activity declines which suggests they can help to reduce the riverine p load in eutrophied rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the wenyu river is a typical urbanized eutrophic river located in beijing china belongs to the temperate continental monsoon climate the basin area of the wenyu river is 2478 km2 with a total length of 47 5 km and a mean water depth of 1 5 m yang et al 2012 this river flow through the central region of the beijing city more than 70 runoff of this river was composed of treated or untreated industrial effluents and domestic sewages due to rapid urbanization high concentrations of organic matter and nutrients have been continuously discharged in this river in the past several decades zhang et al 2012 together with the shallow water depth and low flow velocity this river has been subjected to a long history of eutrophication liu et al 2015 as the implementation of the water pollution control action plan external p inputs have been decreasing in this river in recent years zhu et al 2020 bottom water and samples from the top 5 cm of the sediment were collected from one site 40 07 00 36 n 116 16 27 57 e of the wenyu river the presence of cable bacteria in the surface sediments of this sampling site has previously been confirmed by xu et al 2021 the detailed physiochemical properties of the sediment and bottom water from sampling site are provided in table s1 upon return to the laboratory the bottom water samples were immediately filtered 0 45 μm and stored at 4 c until further experimental work sediment samples were asphyxiated with nitrogen for two weeks and then passed through a 0 5 mm mesh to remove the macrofauna and then completely homogenized subsequently the homogenized sediments were transferred into twenty four glass beakers 200 ml and submerged in three incubation aquaria filled with the filtered overlying water the heights of sediment core and overlying water were 15 cm and 10 cm respectively eighteen of these beakers were immersed without lid in the continuously aerated aquaria for the enrichment of cable bacteria aerobic treatment the other six beakers were sealed with gas tight lids and incubated anoxically control treatment all aquaria were kept at constant temperature 15 c the annual mean temperature of the sampling site and in the dark distilled water was added to the aquaria every two days to replenish the evaporated water during the incubation experiment data were collected on day 3 10 20 30 53 and 75 by retrieving high resolution depth profiles of o2 ph and σh2s deployment of dgt probes and description of sediment stratification on each sampling day three oxic cores and one anoxic core were randomly selected for high resolution depth profiling of ph o2 and σh2s using microsensors subsequently dgt probes were inserted in the same sediment cores to determine fe mn and p production rates after retrieval of the dgt probes a sediment mini core 8 cm height was taken from the undisturbed portion of the sediment core using a cutoff sterile syringe diameter 5 cm these mini cores were then transferred to an anaerobic chamber and sliced at 0 5 cm resolution under n2 atmosphere each sediment slice was homogenized and separated into three subsamples one subsample 0 5 ml was fixed with 96 ethanol and frozen at 20 c for fish analysis the other subsample 1 g was immediately frozen at 80 c for 16s rrna gene sequencing and the remaining subsample was frozen at 20 c under anoxic conditions for the determination of water content porosity and sedimentary fe mn and p contents 2 2 high resolution depth profiling high resolution depth profiles of ph o2 and σh2s during the incubation period were measured by commercial microelectrodes unisense a s denmark all three electrodes were calibrated prior to each operation following the methods provided by the micro sensor manufacturer as described in xu et al 2021 total porewater sulfide σh2s h2s hs s2 was calculated using the method proposed by jeroschewski et al 1996 the suboxic zone width diffusive o2 uptake dou cathodic o2 consumption coc rate and current density were estimated using the ph o2 and σh2s microsensor profiles as described in previous studies seitaj et al 2015 malkin et al 2014 müller et al 2016 the detailed description on the calibration of micro sensors and the calculation of coc rate are provided in supplementary information 2 3 dgt measurements two types of dgt probes with different binding phases were purchased from dgt research ltd easysensor ltd china for the measurement of labile fe mn and p concentrations in porewater and the overlying water chelex dgt probes were used for fe and mn and zro agi dgt probes were used for p detection the sampling window of the dgt probe was 150 mm height 20 mm width before deployment the dgt probe were submerged in a 0 01 m nan3 solution and deoxygenated using n2 for more than 16 h then the deoxygenated probes were vertically inserted into the sediment cores and retrieved after 24 h retrieved dgt probes were cleaned with ultrapure water to remove the sediment stuck to the surface the rectangular binding gel was sliced into 2 mm intervals using a ceramic blade each slice was then separately placed in a 2 ml centrifuge tube and submerged in 0 8 ml extraction solution for 16 h 1 m hno3 solution was used to extract fe and mn and 1 m naoh solution was used to extract p concentrations of fe and p in the extracted solutions were quantified by spectrophotometric methods apha 2005 and mn was determined by icp ms agilent 7800 usa dgt gels irreversibly bind the solute of interest thereby creating an artificial sink in the sediment pore water this will lead to the diffusion of solutes from the porewater to the gel surface and thus a depletion of the solute in the pore water which will lead to a decrease in the concentration gradient and thus diffusion to the gel surface to be able to calculate pore water concentrations from the amount of solute accumulated on the gel we have to be sure that the rate of resupply to the porewater matches the flux to the gel surface because this assumption is hard to confirm and would likely lead to an underestimation of the actual porewater concentration value we use the dgt process to calculate a flux to the gel surface instead of a porewater concentration this flux is in essence a proxy for the production rate of our solute in the sediment the flux of fe mn and p fdgt can be calculated using the standard dgt equations described as below zhang and davison 1995 ding et al 2012 amato et al 2016 1 m c e v e v g f e where m is the accumulated mass of target element in the binding gel during the duration of deployment ce is the concentration of the target element in the eluted solution µg l vg and ve are the volumes of the binding gel and the eluent ml and fe is the elution efficiency 2 fdgt m a t where a is the surface area for ion diffusion of each slice cm2 t is the deployment time 24 h 2 4 solid phase analyses sedimentary acid volatile sulfide avs representing fes contents were measured by a cold distillation method kallmeyer et al 2004 firstly wet sediments 0 5 1 0 g were weighed in a distillation flask connected to a zinc acetate trap 5 znac next 15 ml of a hcl 9 m solution was added and the released h2s was stripped with nitrogen gas and transported to the znac trap sulfide concentration in the trapped solution was then quantified using the spectrophotometry method of cline 1969 as described by reese et al 2011 wet sediment was freeze dried ground and sieved 100 μm for solid phase fe and p analyses the reduced fe ii and labile fe iii oxides in sediment was fractionated followed the method developed by poulton and canfield 2005 specifically 100 mg freeze dried sediments was extracted with 1 m hcl 10 ml for 4 h the reduced fe ii content in which was quantified using the standard method described in apha 2005 this method was also applied for the determination of total fe concentrations after the addition of 1 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the extracts to reduce fe iii into fe ii labile fe iii oxides was then calculated by subtracting reduced fe from the total fe kraal et al 2017 exchangeable p and fe bound p in sediment was fractionated using the sedex sequential extraction method ruttenberg 1992 as modified by slomp et al 1996 after extraction p contents in 1 m mgcl2 solutions representing exchangeable p were determined colorimetrically murphy and riley 1958 and the concentrations of p representing fe bound p and mn in the citrate dithionite bicarbonate cbd extracts were analyzed by icp oes spectrogreen arcos germany the content of mn extracted in cbd solutions was assumed to represent reactive mn oxides as described in hermans et al 2019b the inventories is of fes labile fe iii oxides fe bound p and exchangeable p in sediment were calculated as the depth integral of solid phase content using the following equation i s 0 h 1 φ x ρ s c x d x where φ x is the depth profile of porosity c x is the content of target compound in solid phase µmol per g dry sediment h is the depth range over which the inventory is calculated cm and ρs is the density of sediment g cm 3 porosity was estimated from the water content assuming a sediment density of 2 65 g cm 3 burdige 2006 2 5 microscopy observation and high throughput gene sequencing scanning electron microscope sem imaging was performed to identify the existence of cable bacteria in incubated sediments following risgaard petersen et al 2015 top 1 1 5 cm of the sediment layer after 30 days incubation was preserved and diluted in 10 µl ethanol subsequently the samples were observed under light microscopy to find the cable filaments and then washed three times using sterilized water and pipetted onto a silicon wafer with a homemade glass hook after drying the sample were coated with a gold layer with a thickness of 5 nm high resolution images of the isolated filaments were then retrieved using sem zeiss gemini 300 germany operated under 60 pa vacuum and a low voltage 3 kv mode fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was conducted to investigate the depth profiles of cable bacteria density in the incubated sediments in brief the filaments of cable bacteria were marked with fish probe dsb706 combined with dapi staining and then observed under an epifluorescence microscopy lücker et al 2007 risgaard petersen et al 2015 the volumetric density m cm 3 of cable bacteria at each depth and the integrated density per sediment surface area m cm 2 was calculated according to previously reported protocols schauer et al 2014 moreover 16 rrna sequencing data was used to determine the relative abundance of cable bacteria was quantified after geelhoed et al 2020 in brief the relative abundance was estimated by calculating the ratio of the number of reads that correspond to cable bacteria species identified in this study to the total number of reads obtained for all bacterial species present the specific procedures of fish observation and 16s rrna gene sequencing including dna extraction amplification and sequencing data analysis are described in supplementary information the 16s rrna amplicon data have been uploaded to the database of national center for biotechnology information ncbi the accession number is prjna964499 3 results 3 1 high resolution depth profiles of ph o2 and σh2s the σh2s appearance depth sad defined as the shallowest depth where σh2s 1 µm is comparable with that of o2 penetration depth opd defined as the deepest depth where o2 1 µm at the beginning of the incubation fig 1 a throughout the incubation the sad gradually increases generating a distinct suboxic zone where o2 and σh2s are undetectable fig 1a the thickness of suboxic zone increases over time and reached its maximum of 1 75 cm at day 30 after which it decreases to 1 20 cm after 53 days fig 2 the o2 penetration depth was relatively constant 13 15 mm within the first 20 days and slightly increased 17 20 mm later during incubation table 1 high resolution microsensor profiling reveals a clear ph peak in the top layer of the sediment at day 20 concurrent with a strong decrease of ph in the deeper sediment fig 1 the extent of porewater acidification deeper in the sediment reached its peak at day 30 with a ph minimum of 6 61 after which ph gradually recovers to 7 0 table 1 during the same period the distinct ph peak at the subsurface sediment declines after 30 days and disappears completely by day 53 concurrently with the typical ph profile the coc rate and current density increase with incubation time reaching a maxima of 1 59 mmol m 2 d 1 and 7 10 ma m 2 at day 30 respectively after that the coc rate and current density decrease to zero fig 1 table 1 the temporal change of current density shows a similar trend compared to the coc rate in the anoxic control treatment no suboxic zone and the ph fingerprint typical to that of cable bacteria activity were observed during the whole incubation periods fig 1b 3 2 the development of cable bacteria cable bacteria density gradually increases over the first 53 days and then declines afterwards fig 3 the maximum cable bacteria density is reached at day 53 with a depth integrated filament density of 132 m cm2 the depth distribution of fish based filament densities fig 4 a is similar to that of the relative abundance determined by high throughput gene sequencing fig 4b both show a strong enrichment of cable bacteria within the top 2 cm of the sediment and a lower abundance in the deeper sedimentary layers the volumetric density of cable filaments in the top 0 0 5 cm sediment is 4 5 m cm 3 at day 3 and then increases to 120 m cm 3 at day 53 fig 4a consistently the relative abundance of cable bacteria reaches its peak value 0 82 in the depth of 0 0 5 cm sediments at day 53 and declines afterwards fig 4b depth profiling by fish shows that cable filaments are restricted to the top 1 5 cm sediment at the beginning of incubation and gradually expanded downwards reaching a maximum sediment depth of 6 cm at day 30 fig 4a at the end of the incubation the zone in which cable bacteria were found was reduced to 0 3 5 cm sem imaging revealed that the outer surface of the fish identified filaments have orderly arranged parallel ridges and grooves along the longitudinal axis fig 4c which is the typical morphology characteristic of cable bacteria pfeffer et al 2012 thus providing further confirmation of the presence of cable bacteria in the aerobically incubated sediments 3 3 dgt profiles of dissolved fe mn and p dgt flux profiles of fe2 mn2 and po3 4 determined by dgt are shown in fig 5 in the oxic treatment the flux of fe2 developed a subsurface peak with time reaching its maximum at day 30 at 2 cm depth where the fe2 flux is 7 91 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 5a afterwards this distinct peak progressively declined and the maximum dissolved fe2 flux decreased to 1 81 mmol m 2 d 1 at day 75 temporal dynamics of dissolved mn2 were similar to dissolved fe2 reaching a maximum flux of 0 87 mmol m 2 d 1 at day 30 within the suboxic zone fig 5b no flux of dissolved of fe2 and mn2 was observed in the anoxic control treatment dissolved po3 4 fluxes in the oxic treatment were low at all time points in the top sedimentary layer and increased with depth from 0 01 to 1 62 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 5c dissolved po3 4 flux in the overlying water is less than 0 09 mmol m 2 d 1 throughout the incubation in the anoxic control treatment the dissolved po3 4 flux in the surface sediment increases with time at day 75 the dissolved po3 4 flux in the top 0 2 cm sediment was up to 2 66 mmol m 2 d 1 which is several times higher than in the oxic treatment concurrent with this a high dissolved po3 4 flux was observed in the overlying water of the anoxic cores indicative of benthic release of po3 4 to the overlying water fig 5c to quantify the release of phosphate from the sediment into the overlying water we integrated the p fluxes of the part of the dgt that was in the overlying water and use that as a metric for a benthic flux fig s1 the benthic release rate of phosphate in anoxic control treatment was greatly higher than that observed in oxic treatment especially at the later incubation stages at day 75 the benthic p flux in the anoxic incubations 3 28 mmol m 2d 1 was more than 50 times higher than that of the oxic incubations 0 06 mmol m 2d 1 3 4 solid phase profiles of fe mn and p solid phase fes concentrations gradually reduce over time in the surface sedimentary layers of the aerobically incubated cores fig 6 a during the first 20 days the depletion of fes only occurred in the top 0 1 cm sediment afterwards the fes depletion extended further down at day 75 60 fes within in the depth range of 0 3 cm sediment is consumed concurrently with the depletion of fes reactive fe oxides gradually increases over time in the surface sedimentary layers of the aerobically incubated cores the enrichment of fe oxides extends from the top 0 0 5 cm sediments day 20 to the deeper sediment layers 0 1 5 cm at day 75 fig 6b at day 75 the fe oxides in the top 0 5 cm sediment reached 68 μmol g 1 which was 2 2 times higher than what observed at day 3 a similar enrichment of mn oxides is also observed in the surface sediment 0 0 5 cm in the oxic treatment with the content increasing from 0 42 to 2 3 μmol g 1 over the incubation period fig 6c the fe bound p content in the surface sediments begins to increase from day 30 onwards specifically fe bound p content increase to 41 μmol g 1 in the 0 0 5 cm sediments at day 75 which is twice as high as at day 3 fig 6e a slight increase was also observed for exchangeable p in the surface sediment of the oxic cores fig 6d for control treatment depth distribution of fe mn and p in solid phase was determined at the beginning day 3 fig s1 and the end of incubation day 75 the results demonstrated no significant variations in solid phase distribution of fe mn and p between these two time points and thus we only show the data of day 75 in fig 6 the solid phase fes did not get consumed in sediment cores from the anoxic treatment fig 6a which coincides with the absence of fe and mn oxides enrichments in the same cores consistent with this the contents of fe bound p and exchangeable p did not vary considerably with depth in anoxic treatment 4 discussion 4 1 succession dynamics of cable bacteria the development of e sox activity was confirmed by high resolution depth profiling of ph o2 and σh2s in the porewater at different time points in the oxic sediment cores e sox activity increased considerably within 20 days as indicated by the concurrent development of a suboxic zone fig 2 and the appearance of a subsurface ph maximum and minimum table 1 these distinct geochemical signatures are typical fingerprints of cable bacteria activity meysman et al 2015 rao et al 2016 vasquez cardenas et al 2015 the maximum coc rate in our incubations was 1 6 mmol m 2 d 1 at day 30 which translates into a current density of 7 1 ma m 2 the current density is lower than generally observed in marine sediments 11 8 234 ma m 2 nielsen et al 2010 risgaard petersen et al 2014 schauer et al 2014 malkin and meysman 2015 vasquez gardenas et al 2015 rao et al 2016 but comparable with the values obtained in our previous studies using sediment from the same site 1 06 2 53 ma m 2 xu et al 2021 2022 and in other freshwater sediments 1 5 14 4 ma m 2 risgaard petersen et al 2015 müller et al 2016 this may be due to the sulfide is less abundant in freshwater sediments compared to marine sediments and thus limiting the e sox activity and the proliferation of cable bacteria populations hermans et al 2019a xu et al 2022 previous studies suggested that the population size of cable bacteria in some marine habitats are comparable to those found in freshwater sediments while the impacts of cable bacteria on sediment geochemistry are much smaller than what is observed in freshwater sediments risgaard petersen et al 2015 marzocchi et al 2018 hermans et al 2019a xu et al 2021 this indicates that the metabolic activity of cable bacteria can have a greater biogeochemical impact on freshwater sediments than marine sediments which may be due to the low buffering capacity i e low contents of fes and carbonates in freshwater sediments hermans et al 2020 sandfeld et al 2020 the growth dynamics of cable bacteria population followed a boom to bust pattern that is characterized by a fast proliferation to the highest abundance and subsequently a rapid decline with time this growth pattern is widely observed in laboratory enrichment experiments with cable bacteria rao et al 2016 burdorf et al 2018 schauer et al 2014 and was also found during seasonal studies of natural cable bacteria populations seitaj et al 2015 malkin et al 2022 after reaching the peak metabolic activity on day 30 the density of cable bacteria continued to increase and peaked at day 53 with a maximum volumetric density of 120 m cm 3 which accounts for 0 81 of the total bacteria community in top 0 0 5 cm sediments this temporal deviation between the reaching of peak activity and maximum abundance is also observed in other laboratory studies schauer et al 2014 burdorf et al 2018 this may be due to the fact that the abundance of cable bacteria is the result of the population growth dynamics which cannot completely reflect the metabolic activity that is also constrained by the availability of metabolic substrates and other environmental factors schauer et al 2014 currently the exact causes for the decline of cable bacteria population are not fully understood according to previous studies several mechanisms may be responsible for the decline of cable bacteria in laboratory incubations the first one is the depletion of resources that supply sulfide for the metabolism of cable bacteria risgaard petersen et al 2012 meysman et al 2015 rao et al 2016 sulfide production in sediments is primarily derived from sulfate reduction and the dissolution of fes the release potential of sulfide from these two pathways is dependent on the storage of labile organic matter and fes respectively malkin et al 2014 hermans et al 2020 based on the depth profiles of so2 4 fig s3 and fe2 in pore water the relative importance of sulfate reduction and fes dissolution in sulfide production was estimated during incubation the results revealed that sulfate reduction was the major source of sulfide production accounting for over 95 and the rate of sulfate reduction significantly decreased at the end of incubation table s2 therefore from the perspective of resource depletion the level of labile organic matter storage not fes is more likely to limit the activity of cable bacteria in this study another possible reason that may limit the bloom of cable bacteria is the extreme acidic condition in suboxic zone or alkaline condition in oxic layer caused by the activity of cable bacteria which may exceed their critical physiological values and thus resulting in decreased activity nielsen and risgaard petersen 2015 evidence suggested that the periplasm proteins of cable bacteria are adapted to neutral ph and may become denatured under alkaline conditions ph 8 5 leading to the collapse of cable bacteria population collected from marine habitats kjeldsen et al 2019 in this study the observed ph values in oxic sediment zone at peak e sox activity day 30 is up to 8 60 whether this level of alkalinity is harmful for cable bacteria inhabiting in freshwater sediments remain unknown however the acidity tolerance threshold of cable bacteria has not been reported until now 4 2 the impact of e sox activity on fe and mn cycling accompanied with the development of cable bacteria significant biogeochemical changes occur in the incubated cores from the oxic treatment the sulfide oxidation associated with e sox induces acid production in subsurface sediment which subsequently cause the dissolution of metal minerals at these depths as indicated by the depth overlap between the increase of fe2 and mn2 fluxes fig 5a b and the sharp decrease of ph fig 1 the maximum peak of fe and mn production in the porewater develops at day 30 which coincided with the appearance of maximum acidification ph minimum 6 61 in the suboxic zone at peak e sox activity fig 5a b table 1 higher release of dissolved fe2 compared to dissolved mn2 may be due to the low availability of mn minerals in incubation sediments hermans et al 2020 or the faster dissolution mechanics of fes vs mnco3 lenstra et al 2020 the peaks of fe2 and mn2 production widen with time and extend a depth range of 4 0 cm in sediments which is smaller than generally observed in marine sediments rigaard petersen et al 2012 van de velde et al 2016 hermans et al 2020 the extended depth of fe2 and mn2 release as a result of the metabolism of cable bacteria can reach up to 7 10 cm in marine sediments van de velde et al 2016 2017 hermans et al 2020 this is probably attributed to the higher presence of organic matter and iron sulfide in marine sediments which provides a more conducive environment for the proliferation of cable bacteria population as compared to freshwater sediments a fraction of the mobilized fe2 and mn2 subsequently diffuses downwards where they can be trapped by reprecipitation as fes or as carbonate minerals fig 5a b the rest is transported upward to the oxic zone where they are converted into oxidized iron and manganese minerals in surface sediments fig 6 rao et al 2016 iron production decreases sharply before reaching the oxic zone which suggests that the oxidation of fe2 is mostly coupled to the reduction of manganese oxides fig 5a sulu gambari et al 2016a the metabolism of cable bacteria produced a current density of 7 1 ma m 2 at its peak activity which would stimulate the upward diffusion of positively charge irons such as fe2 and mn2 because of the ionic drift created by the electric field risgaard petersen et al 2014 rao et al 2016 van de velde et al 2016 in line with the enrichment of iron and manganese oxides fes gradually depleted over time after 3 days of incubation the fes inventory decreased by 33 mmol m 2 relative to the anoxic control treatment table 2 most of the fes was consumed in the 0 0 5 cm depth layer which suggests that oxidation of fes was the cause of the depletion fig 6a as the ph minimum develops at day 20 the depletion of fes extends to the deeper sediments fig 6a at the end of incubation experiment a total of 270 mmol m 2 was consumed in the depth of 0 4 cm sediments which matched the increased amount of fe oxides 260 mmol m 2 table 2 the solid phase depth profiles show that the increased deposition of fe oxides also occurs below the oxygen penetration depth 0 13 0 17 cm further confirming that mn oxides are responsible for the reoxidation of the reduced iron fig 5 sulu gambari et al 2016a the formation of and fe oxide layer near the sediment surface will affect the release of p from the sediment 4 3 the impact of e sox activity on p cycling dgt flux profiles of po3 4 in porewater show a substantial decrease of po4 3 flux within the top 0 2 cm surface sediment with increasing of e sox activity fig 5c the removal of p in porewater is more obvious at the later incubation stages day 53 to day 70 which coincide with the prominent enrichment of fe mn oxides below the oxic layer of sediments similar temporal patterns also develop in the fe oxide bound p and exchangeable p at the sediment surface fig 6d e the depth of the p enrichment in the solid phase was comparable with that of iron and manganese oxides suggesting that the formation of a metal oxide layer controlled the removal of p from the pore water similarly as observed in lake grevelingen and the baltic sea sulu gambari et al 2016a herman et al 2020 throughout the whole incubation period the flux of po3 4 to the dgt gel in the overlying water from the oxic treatment remains at a very low level 0 09 mmol m 2 d 1 which shows that the increased subsurface enrichment of metal oxides caused by the e sox activity efficiently acted as a firewall to prevent the sedimentary p release into bottom water sulu gambari et al 2016b interestingly the depth range where po3 4 fluxes decrease was broader than that of the iron and manganese oxides enrichment in particular at day 53 where the enrichment of fe and mn oxides only occurs within the depth of top 0 1 cm sediments the decrease in po3 4 flux extends down to 2 cm fig 5c because po3 4 removal does not happen in the anoxic control core other cable bacteria related mechanisms besides the buildup of iron and manganese oxides may be responsible for this phenomenon rao et al 2016 proposed that the metabolism of cable bacteria creates a suboxic zone characterized by low levels of sulfide and high levels of dissolved fe and p which favors the formation of vivianite leading to the sequestration of p in deeper sediments however this remains to be demonstrated cellular internalization may be another mechanism for p sequestration in sediments with active cable bacteria previous studies have demonstrated that several groups of sulfur oxidizing bacteria e g beggiatoaceae sulforimunas thiomargarita namibiensis can facilitate a remarkably high storage of polyphosphate inclusions within their lipid p membranes and thereby greatly alter sedimentary p dynamics schulz and schulz 2005 rydin et al 2023 such polyphosphate inclusions are also present in cable bacteria sulu gambari et al 2016b geerlings et al 2022 however the amount of cellular internalized p is much lower than that of p bearing fe oxides sulu gambari et al 2016b hence further research is required to unravel the role of cable bacteria on these alternative mechanisms after cable bacteria activity has declined on day 53 the iron oxide layer as well as the associated p enrichments remained stable fig 5a c the oxygenated conditions of overlying water during incubation may have contributed to the prevention of fe oxides bound p dissolution in surface sediment however this mechanism was restricted to the oxygen permeant depth opd of 0 13 0 17 cm our results demonstrated the increased reactive fe oxides below the opd account for 60 of the total increase observed at day 75 fig 6 the stable presence of metal oxides layer in deeper sediments likely due to the minimal sulfide build up in our freshwater sediments which could readily dissolved the iron oxides on day 75 even though the activity of cable bacteria had almost disappeared a noticeable suboxic zone remain persisted beneath the oxic layer fig 1a in this study the increased amount of fe oxides in oxic treatment at the end of incubation is approximately 0 18 mol fe m 2 as calculated from the inventory difference in fe oxides between oxic and control treatments at the 0 2 cm depth given the sulfide efflux rate of 0 50 mmol h2s m 2 d 1 as the calculated σh2s flux is 0 46 mmol m 2 d 1 in control treatment at day 75 this fe oxides pool is potentially capable of buffering h2s production for up to 360 d under anoxic conditions this period is greatly exceeds the lasted duration of the metal oxides and p enriched layers that estimated or observed 60 days during hypoxic periods in marine sediments even though more reactive iron oxides 0 95 mol fe m 2 are generated in these environments when cable bacteria are active seitaj et al 2015 sulu gambari et al 2016b this discrepancy may be ascribed to the limited sulfide production typically found in sediments in freshwater habitats of cable bacteria in comparison to that of their marine habitats as illustrated in table s3 these findings implied that cable bacteria could prevent sedimentary p release for a much longer time in freshwater system than commonly observed in marine systems especially under hypoxia conditions to further confirm this conclusion more laboratory or field studies are needed to examine the formation and the stability of metal oxides and p enriched layers on various freshwater habitats under different redox conditions in addition to the activity of cable bacteria the enrichment of metal oxides bound p in surface sediments can also occur in oxygenated conditions in their absence however in sediments with active cable bacteria the enhanced dissolution of fe and mn minerals in deeper sediment layers leads to higher upward fluxes of fe2 and mn2 to the surface sediment and subsequently resulting in an increased oxidation of these elements in the near surface sediment over a given time period rao et al 2016 thus it is expected that the enrichment of fe and mn oxides in subsurface sediment will be more pronounced and significant in sediments hosting active cable bacteria than in those without them under comparable environmental conditions this has been verified by several field studies on marine sediments sulu gambari et al 2016a b found that the conversion of fes in surface sediment to fe oxides during spring march when cable bacteria were highly abundant was over 10 folds greater than observed during fall november when there were no cable bacteria present in both seasons the bottom water is well oxygenated coincide with this less buildup of fe oxides bound p was observed the mean benthic flux of phosphate in november 0 095 µmol cm 2 d was more than 8 folds higher than that observed in march 0 011 µmol cm 2 d comparable findings were also documented by seitaj et al 2015 in their research conducted in the same basin owing to limitations in experimental design a direct comparison of the dynamics of fe mn and p in surface sediment under oxic conditions with or without cable bacteria was not possible in this study however this information is necessary for a more accurate evaluation of the contribution of cable bacteria to the retention of p in surface sediments in freshwater system and thus requiring further research 5 environmental implications internal p loading from sediments has been considered as a major cause for eutrophication and bottom water hypoxia in freshwater systems especially in shallow aquatic environments with a long history of nutrients loading orihel et al 2017 paytan et al 2017 qin et al 2019 sedimentary p dynamics are governed by organic matter availability and the redox chemistry of fe or mn which in turn is driven by oxygen levels in the bottom waters mortimer et al 1942 jilbert et al 2022 under anoxic conditions sedimentary p release is promoted by the reductive dissolution of p bearing fe and mn oxides and preferential p generation from organic matter sundby et al 1992 ingall and jahnke 1994 rydin 2000 whereas under oxic conditions p is typically sequestered by the labile fe and mn oxides and in some cases by mn ii phosphates in surface sediments consequently reducing benthic p release orihel et al 2017 hermans et al 2019b 2021 our results demonstrated that activity of cable bacteria can strongly govern internal p dynamics in eutrophic freshwater sediments this is in concert with what has been previously observed in brackish and marine sediments sulu gambari et al 2016b hermans et al 2021 however due to the less efficient dissolution of fe oxides bound p in freshwater systems the reduction of benthic p release caused by cable bacteria may active over a longer time scale compared to marine systems in the present study the retention of p the sum of fe bound p and exchangeable p increased more than 240 mmol m 2 day 75 in the top 0 2 cm sediment due to cable bacteria activity compared to the initial incubation stage day 3 table 2 the average depth of the studied river is about 1 5 m if all of the additionally retained p in surface sediment is released will lead to an increase of 5 mg l p in the water body under static conditions without water exchange this implied that cable bacteria could play an important role in regulating internal p release in eutrophic freshwater environments however the findings of this study are based on a single laboratory incubation experiment conducted under specific conditions the extent to which these impacts will occur in eutrophic shallow freshwater systems under natural conditions is not fully understood additionally it is uncertain whether these conclusions can be generalized to other types of freshwater systems with different biogeochemical characteristics therefore it is imperative to conduct further research on various types of sediments under realistic field conditions to gain an in depth understanding of the exact role of cable bacteria in controlling the internal release of phosphorus in eutrophic freshwater systems declaration of competing

14639,previous studies have demonstrated that e sox can regulate the sedimentary release of phosphorus p in brackish and marine sediments when e sox is active an iron fe and manganese mn oxide rich layer is formed near the sediment surface which prevents p release when e sox becomes inactive the metal oxide layer is reduced via sulfide mediated dissolution and p is subsequently released to the water column cable bacteria have been shown to also occur in freshwater sediments in these sediments sulfide production is limited and the metal oxide layer would thus dissolve less efficiently leaving the p trapped at the sediment surface this lack of an efficient dissolution mechanism implies that e sox could play an important role in the regulation of p availability in eutrophied freshwater streams to test this hypothesis we incubated sediments from a eutrophic freshwater river to investigate the impact of cable bacteria on sedimentary cycling of fe mn and p high resolution depth profiling of ph o2 and σh2s complemented with fish analysis and high throughput gene sequencing showed that the development of e sox activity was closely linked to the enrichment of cable bacteria in incubated sediments cable bacteria activity caused a strong acidification in the suboxic zone leading to the dissolution of fe and mn minerals and consequently a strong release of dissolved fe2 and mn2 to the porewater oxidation of these mobilized ions at the sediment surface led to the formation of a metal oxide layer that trapped dissolved p as shown by the enrichment of p bearing metal oxides in the top layer of the sediment and low phosphate in the pore and overlying water after e sox activity declined the metal oxide layer did not dissolve and p remained trapped at the surface overall our results suggested cable bacteria can play an important role to counteract eutrophication in freshwater systems keywords cable bacteria iron manganese phosphorus sediment geochemistry freshwater sediment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cable bacteria couple the oxidation of dissolved sulfide h2s in anoxic sediment with oxygen o2 or nitrate reduction in surface sediments in a process called electrogenic sulfur oxidation e sox nielsen et al 2010 pfeffer et al 2012 schauer et al 2014 in sediments inhabited by active cable bacteria electrons are transported via their conductive periplasmic fibers over a distance of several centimeters thus allowing the interactions between electron acceptors and electron donors in spatially separated regions risgaard petersen et al 2014 meysman et al 2019 this process differs strongly from the conventional sequence of redox reactions in sediments and exerts a large impact on sediment biogeochemistry nielsen and risgaard petersen 2015 by separating the reactions of oxidation and reduction in space e sox activity typically leads to a wide suboxic zone and strong ph gradients in porewater nielsen et al 2010 meysman et al 2015 as a direct consequence of proton consumption by o2 reduction a ph peak develops in the oxic zone and as a result of proton production via σh2s oxidation the ph decreases considerably in deeper sediment the extensive acidification of the sulfidic zone facilitates the acidic dissolution of reduced metal minerals such as iron sulphides and manganese carbonates in the deeper sedimentary layers resulting in the release of dissolved ferrous iron fe2 and manganese mn2 in the porewater rao et al 2016 sulu gambari et al 2016a when these mobilized ions diffuse upwards they become oxidized by o2 nitrate or mn oxides for fe2 and deposit as iron and manganese oxides at the sediment surface risgaard petersen et al 2012 seitaj et al 2015

sediments of coastal systems importantly the biogeochemical impact on the sedimentary release of dissolved species to the upper water column and affect ecosystem functions at system scale in seasonally hypoxic lake grevelingen the netherlands cable bacteria stimulate the production of fe or mn oxides in surface sediments which mitigates the benthic release of phosphate during periods of e sox activity and the benthic release of sulfide during the hypoxic season seitaj et al 2015 sulu gambari et al 2016b cable bacteria are a widespread phenomenon in marine risgaard petersen et al 2015 burdorf et al 2016 2017 brackish scholz et al 2021 dam et al 2021 and freshwater sediments sandfeld et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in marine and brackish sediments it has been shown that the metal oxide layer that is formed during e sox activity dissolves through sulfide mediated dissolution when e sox activity stops seitaj et al 2015 sulu gambari et al 2016a concurrently any elements that are trapped in this metal oxide layer such as phosphate and arsenic are released to the water column sulu gambari et al 2016b van de velde et al 2022 in freshwater sediments however sulfide production is limited as a result the trapping mechanism of the metal oxide layer could remain active after e sox activity decline which could decrease the phosphate load of the water column in freshwater systems huo et al 2022 a recent study demonstrated a close correlation of species richness and distribution of cable bacteria with water quality in freshwater river systems dong et al 2022 implying that rivers with deteriorated water quality could be hotspots for cable bacteria here a laboratory incubation experiment was used to assess the impact of cable bacteria in sediments from a eutrophic freshwater river on the sedimentary dynamics of fe mn and p high resolution depth profiling of ph o2 and σh2s was conducted to track the temporal variations of e sox activity during the incubation period the population dynamics of cable bacteria and its vertical distribution in sediments are determined by fluorescence microscopy observation and high throughput gene sequencing the combination of novel sedimentary dgt techniques and conventional sequential extraction methods were applied to investigate the speciation and depth profiling of fe mn and p in sediments our results demonstrate that cable bacteria stimulate sedimentary p retention in freshwater sediments and that this trapping mechanism remains active after their activity declines which suggests they can help to reduce the riverine p load in eutrophied rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the wenyu river is a typical urbanized eutrophic river located in beijing china belongs to the temperate continental monsoon climate the basin area of the wenyu river is 2478 km2 with a total length of 47 5 km and a mean water depth of 1 5 m yang et al 2012 this river flow through the central region of the beijing city more than 70 runoff of this river was composed of treated or untreated industrial effluents and domestic sewages due to rapid urbanization high concentrations of organic matter and nutrients have been continuously discharged in this river in the past several decades zhang et al 2012 together with the shallow water depth and low flow velocity this river has been subjected to a long history of eutrophication liu et al 2015 as the implementation of the water pollution control action plan external p inputs have been decreasing in this river in recent years zhu et al 2020 bottom water and samples from the top 5 cm of the sediment were collected from one site 40 07 00 36 n 116 16 27 57 e of the wenyu river the presence of cable bacteria in the surface sediments of this sampling site has previously been confirmed by xu et al 2021 the detailed physiochemical properties of the sediment and bottom water from sampling site are provided in table s1 upon return to the laboratory the bottom water samples were immediately filtered 0 45 μm and stored at 4 c until further experimental work sediment samples were asphyxiated with nitrogen for two weeks and then passed through a 0 5 mm mesh to remove the macrofauna and then completely homogenized subsequently the homogenized sediments were transferred into twenty four glass beakers 200 ml and submerged in three incubation aquaria filled with the filtered overlying water the heights of sediment core and overlying water were 15 cm and 10 cm respectively eighteen of these beakers were immersed without lid in the continuously aerated aquaria for the enrichment of cable bacteria aerobic treatment the other six beakers were sealed with gas tight lids and incubated anoxically control treatment all aquaria were kept at constant temperature 15 c the annual mean temperature of the sampling site and in the dark distilled water was added to the aquaria every two days to replenish the evaporated water during the incubation experiment data were collected on day 3 10 20 30 53 and 75 by retrieving high resolution depth profiles of o2 ph and σh2s deployment of dgt probes and description of sediment stratification on each sampling day three oxic cores and one anoxic core were randomly selected for high resolution depth profiling of ph o2 and σh2s using microsensors subsequently dgt probes were inserted in the same sediment cores to determine fe mn and p production rates after retrieval of the dgt probes a sediment mini core 8 cm height was taken from the undisturbed portion of the sediment core using a cutoff sterile syringe diameter 5 cm these mini cores were then transferred to an anaerobic chamber and sliced at 0 5 cm resolution under n2 atmosphere each sediment slice was homogenized and separated into three subsamples one subsample 0 5 ml was fixed with 96 ethanol and frozen at 20 c for fish analysis the other subsample 1 g was immediately frozen at 80 c for 16s rrna gene sequencing and the remaining subsample was frozen at 20 c under anoxic conditions for the determination of water content porosity and sedimentary fe mn and p contents 2 2 high resolution depth profiling high resolution depth profiles of ph o2 and σh2s during the incubation period were measured by commercial microelectrodes unisense a s denmark all three electrodes were calibrated prior to each operation following the methods provided by the micro sensor manufacturer as described in xu et al 2021 total porewater sulfide σh2s h2s hs s2 was calculated using the method proposed by jeroschewski et al 1996 the suboxic zone width diffusive o2 uptake dou cathodic o2 consumption coc rate and current density were estimated using the ph o2 and σh2s microsensor profiles as described in previous studies seitaj et al 2015 malkin et al 2014 müller et al 2016 the detailed description on the calibration of micro sensors and the calculation of coc rate are provided in supplementary information 2 3 dgt measurements two types of dgt probes with different binding phases were purchased from dgt research ltd easysensor ltd china for the measurement of labile fe mn and p concentrations in porewater and the overlying water chelex dgt probes were used for fe and mn and zro agi dgt probes were used for p detection the sampling window of the dgt probe was 150 mm height 20 mm width before deployment the dgt probe were submerged in a 0 01 m nan3 solution and deoxygenated using n2 for more than 16 h then the deoxygenated probes were vertically inserted into the sediment cores and retrieved after 24 h retrieved dgt probes were cleaned with ultrapure water to remove the sediment stuck to the surface the rectangular binding gel was sliced into 2 mm intervals using a ceramic blade each slice was then separately placed in a 2 ml centrifuge tube and submerged in 0 8 ml extraction solution for 16 h 1 m hno3 solution was used to extract fe and mn and 1 m naoh solution was used to extract p concentrations of fe and p in the extracted solutions were quantified by spectrophotometric methods apha 2005 and mn was determined by icp ms agilent 7800 usa dgt gels irreversibly bind the solute of interest thereby creating an artificial sink in the sediment pore water this will lead to the diffusion of solutes from the porewater to the gel surface and thus a depletion of the solute in the pore water which will lead to a decrease in the concentration gradient and thus diffusion to the gel surface to be able to calculate pore water concentrations from the amount of solute accumulated on the gel we have to be sure that the rate of resupply to the porewater matches the flux to the gel surface because this assumption is hard to confirm and would likely lead to an underestimation of the actual porewater concentration value we use the dgt process to calculate a flux to the gel surface instead of a porewater concentration this flux is in essence a proxy for the production rate of our solute in the sediment the flux of fe mn and p fdgt can be calculated using the standard dgt equations described as below zhang and davison 1995 ding et al 2012 amato et al 2016 1 m c e v e v g f e where m is the accumulated mass of target element in the binding gel during the duration of deployment ce is the concentration of the target element in the eluted solution µg l vg and ve are the volumes of the binding gel and the eluent ml and fe is the elution efficiency 2 fdgt m a t where a is the surface area for ion diffusion of each slice cm2 t is the deployment time 24 h 2 4 solid phase analyses sedimentary acid volatile sulfide avs representing fes contents were measured by a cold distillation method kallmeyer et al 2004 firstly wet sediments 0 5 1 0 g were weighed in a distillation flask connected to a zinc acetate trap 5 znac next 15 ml of a hcl 9 m solution was added and the released h2s was stripped with nitrogen gas and transported to the znac trap sulfide concentration in the trapped solution was then quantified using the spectrophotometry method of cline 1969 as described by reese et al 2011 wet sediment was freeze dried ground and sieved 100 μm for solid phase fe and p analyses the reduced fe ii and labile fe iii oxides in sediment was fractionated followed the method developed by poulton and canfield 2005 specifically 100 mg freeze dried sediments was extracted with 1 m hcl 10 ml for 4 h the reduced fe ii content in which was quantified using the standard method described in apha 2005 this method was also applied for the determination of total fe concentrations after the addition of 1 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the extracts to reduce fe iii into fe ii labile fe iii oxides was then calculated by subtracting reduced fe from the total fe kraal et al 2017 exchangeable p and fe bound p in sediment was fractionated using the sedex sequential extraction method ruttenberg 1992 as modified by slomp et al 1996 after extraction p contents in 1 m mgcl2 solutions representing exchangeable p were determined colorimetrically murphy and riley 1958 and the concentrations of p representing fe bound p and mn in the citrate dithionite bicarbonate cbd extracts were analyzed by icp oes spectrogreen arcos germany the content of mn extracted in cbd solutions was assumed to represent reactive mn oxides as described in hermans et al 2019b the inventories is of fes labile fe iii oxides fe bound p and exchangeable p in sediment were calculated as the depth integral of solid phase content using the following equation i s 0 h 1 φ x ρ s c x d x where φ x is the depth profile of porosity c x is the content of target compound in solid phase µmol per g dry sediment h is the depth range over which the inventory is calculated cm and ρs is the density of sediment g cm 3 porosity was estimated from the water content assuming a sediment density of 2 65 g cm 3 burdige 2006 2 5 microscopy observation and high throughput gene sequencing scanning electron microscope sem imaging was performed to identify the existence of cable bacteria in incubated sediments following risgaard petersen et al 2015 top 1 1 5 cm of the sediment layer after 30 days incubation was preserved and diluted in 10 µl ethanol subsequently the samples were observed under light microscopy to find the cable filaments and then washed three times using sterilized water and pipetted onto a silicon wafer with a homemade glass hook after drying the sample were coated with a gold layer with a thickness of 5 nm high resolution images of the isolated filaments were then retrieved using sem zeiss gemini 300 germany operated under 60 pa vacuum and a low voltage 3 kv mode fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was conducted to investigate the depth profiles of cable bacteria density in the incubated sediments in brief the filaments of cable bacteria were marked with fish probe dsb706 combined with dapi staining and then observed under an epifluorescence microscopy lücker et al 2007 risgaard petersen et al 2015 the volumetric density m cm 3 of cable bacteria at each depth and the integrated density per sediment surface area m cm 2 was calculated according to previously reported protocols schauer et al 2014 moreover 16 rrna sequencing data was used to determine the relative abundance of cable bacteria was quantified after geelhoed et al 2020 in brief the relative abundance was estimated by calculating the ratio of the number of reads that correspond to cable bacteria species identified in this study to the total number of reads obtained for all bacterial species present the specific procedures of fish observation and 16s rrna gene sequencing including dna extraction amplification and sequencing data analysis are described in

depth where o2 1 µm at the beginning of the incubation fig 1 a throughout the incubation the sad gradually increases generating a distinct suboxic zone where o2 and σh2s are undetectable fig 1a the thickness of suboxic zone increases over time and reached its maximum of 1 75 cm at day 30 after which it decreases to 1 20 cm after 53 days fig 2 the o2 penetration depth was relatively constant 13 15 mm within the first 20 days and slightly increased 17 20 mm later during incubation table 1 high resolution microsensor profiling reveals a clear ph peak in the top layer of the sediment at day 20 concurrent with a strong decrease of ph in the deeper sediment fig 1 the extent of porewater acidification deeper in the sediment reached its peak at day 30 with a ph minimum of 6 61 after which ph gradually recovers to 7 0 table 1 during the same period the distinct ph peak at the subsurface sediment declines after 30 days and disappears completely by day 53 concurrently with the typical ph profile the coc rate and current density increase with incubation time reaching a maxima of 1 59 mmol m 2 d 1 and 7 10 ma m 2 at day 30 respectively after that the coc rate and current density decrease to zero fig 1 table 1 the temporal change of current density shows a similar trend compared to the coc rate in the anoxic control treatment no suboxic zone and the ph fingerprint typical to

then declines afterwards fig 3 the maximum cable bacteria density is reached at day 53 with a depth integrated filament density of 132 m cm2 the depth distribution of fish based filament densities fig 4 a is similar to that of the relative abundance determined by high throughput gene sequencing fig 4b both show a strong enrichment of cable bacteria within the top 2 cm of the sediment and a lower abundance in the deeper sedimentary layers the volumetric density of cable filaments in the top 0 0 5 cm sediment is 4 5 m cm 3 at day 3 and then increases to 120 m cm 3 at day 53 fig 4a consistently the relative abundance of cable bacteria reaches its peak value 0 82 in the depth of 0 0 5 cm sediments at day 53 and declines afterwards fig 4b depth profiling by fish shows that cable filaments are restricted to the top 1 5 cm sediment at the beginning of incubation and gradually expanded downwards reaching a maximum sediment depth of 6 cm at day 30 fig 4a at the end of the incubation the zone in which cable bacteria were found was reduced to 0 3 5 cm sem imaging revealed that the outer surface of the fish identified filaments have orderly arranged parallel ridges and grooves along the longitudinal axis fig 4c which is the typical morphology characteristic of cable bacteria pfeffer et al 2012 thus providing further confirmation of the presence of cable bacteria in the aerobically incubated sediments 3 3 dgt profiles of dissolved fe mn and p dgt flux profiles of fe2 mn2 and po3 4 determined by dgt are shown in fig 5 in the oxic treatment the flux of fe2 developed a subsurface peak with time reaching its maximum at day 30 at 2 cm depth where the fe2 flux is 7 91 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 5a afterwards this distinct peak progressively declined and the maximum dissolved fe2 flux decreased to 1 81 mmol m 2 d 1 at day 75 temporal dynamics of dissolved mn2 were similar to dissolved fe2 reaching a maximum flux of 0 87 mmol m 2 d 1 at day 30 within the suboxic zone fig 5b no flux of dissolved of fe2 and mn2 was observed in the anoxic control treatment dissolved po3 4 fluxes in the oxic treatment were low at all time points in the top sedimentary layer and increased with depth from 0 01 to 1 62 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 5c dissolved po3 4 flux in the overlying water is less than 0 09 mmol m 2 d 1 throughout the incubation in the anoxic control treatment the dissolved po3 4 flux in the surface sediment increases with time at day 75 the dissolved po3 4 flux in the top 0 2 cm sediment was up to 2 66 mmol m 2 d 1 which is several times higher than in the oxic treatment concurrent with this a high dissolved po3 4 flux was observed in the overlying water of the anoxic cores indicative of benthic release of po3 4 to the overlying water fig 5c to quantify the release of phosphate from the sediment into the overlying water we integrated the p fluxes of the part of the dgt that was in the overlying water and use that as a metric for a benthic flux fig s1 the benthic release rate of phosphate in anoxic control treatment was greatly higher than that observed in oxic treatment especially at the later incubation stages at day 75 the benthic p flux in the anoxic incubations 3 28 mmol m 2d 1 was more than 50 times higher than that of the oxic incubations 0 06 mmol m 2d 1 3 4 solid phase profiles of fe mn and p solid phase fes concentrations gradually reduce over time in the surface sedimentary layers of the aerobically incubated cores fig 6 a during the first 20 days the depletion of fes only occurred in the top 0 1 cm sediment afterwards the fes depletion extended further down at day 75 60 fes within in the depth range of 0 3 cm sediment is consumed concurrently with the depletion of fes reactive fe oxides gradually increases over time in the surface sedimentary layers of the aerobically incubated cores the enrichment of fe oxides extends from the top 0 0 5 cm sediments day 20 to the deeper sediment layers 0 1 5 cm at day 75 fig 6b at day 75 the fe oxides in the top 0 5 cm sediment reached 68 μmol g 1 which was 2 2 times higher than what observed at day 3 a similar enrichment of mn oxides is also observed in the surface sediment 0 0 5 cm in the oxic treatment with the content increasing from 0 42 to 2 3 μmol g 1 over the incubation period fig 6c the fe bound p content in the surface sediments begins to increase from day 30 onwards specifically fe bound p content increase to 41 μmol g 1 in the 0 0 5 cm sediments at day 75 which is twice as high as at day 3 fig 6e a slight increase was also observed for exchangeable p in the surface sediment of the oxic cores fig 6d for control treatment depth distribution of fe mn and p in solid phase was determined at the beginning day 3 fig s1 and the end of incubation day 75 the results demonstrated no significant variations in solid phase distribution of fe mn and p between these two time points and thus we only show the data of day 75 in fig 6 the solid phase fes did not get consumed in sediment cores from the anoxic treatment fig 6a which coincides with the absence of fe and mn oxides enrichments in the same cores consistent with this the contents of fe bound p and exchangeable p did not vary considerably with depth in anoxic treatment 4 discussion 4 1 succession dynamics of cable bacteria the development of e sox activity was confirmed by high resolution depth profiling of ph o2 and σh2s in the porewater at different time points in the oxic sediment cores e sox activity increased considerably within 20 days as indicated by the concurrent development of a suboxic zone fig 2 and the appearance of a subsurface ph maximum and minimum table 1 these distinct geochemical signatures are typical fingerprints of cable bacteria activity meysman et al 2015 rao et al 2016 vasquez cardenas et al 2015 the maximum coc rate in our incubations was 1 6 mmol m 2 d 1 at day 30 which translates into a current density of 7 1 ma m 2 the current density is lower than generally observed in marine sediments 11 8 234 ma m 2 nielsen et al 2010 risgaard petersen et al 2014 schauer et al 2014 malkin and meysman 2015 vasquez gardenas et al 2015 rao et al 2016 but comparable with the values obtained in our previous studies using sediment from the same site 1 06 2 53 ma m 2 xu et al 2021 2022 and in other freshwater sediments 1 5 14 4 ma m 2 risgaard petersen et al 2015 müller et al 2016 this may be due to the sulfide is less abundant in freshwater sediments compared to marine sediments and thus limiting the e sox activity and the proliferation of cable bacteria populations hermans et al 2019a xu et al 2022 previous studies suggested that the population size of cable bacteria in some marine habitats are comparable to those found in freshwater sediments while the impacts of cable bacteria on sediment geochemistry are much smaller than what is observed in freshwater sediments risgaard petersen et al 2015 marzocchi et al 2018 hermans et al 2019a xu et al 2021 this indicates that the metabolic activity of cable bacteria can have a greater biogeochemical impact on freshwater sediments than marine sediments which may be due to the low buffering capacity i e low contents of fes and carbonates in freshwater sediments hermans et al 2020 sandfeld et al 2020 the growth dynamics of cable bacteria population followed a boom to bust pattern that is characterized by a fast proliferation to the highest abundance and subsequently a rapid decline with time this growth pattern is widely observed in laboratory enrichment experiments with cable bacteria rao et al 2016 burdorf et al 2018 schauer et al 2014 and was also found during seasonal studies of natural cable bacteria populations seitaj et al 2015 malkin et al 2022 after reaching the peak metabolic activity on day 30 the density of cable bacteria continued to increase and peaked at day 53 with a maximum volumetric density of 120 m cm 3 which accounts for 0 81 of the total bacteria community in top 0 0 5 cm sediments this temporal deviation between the reaching of peak activity and maximum abundance is also observed in other laboratory studies schauer et al 2014 burdorf et al 2018 this may be due to the fact that the abundance of cable bacteria is the result of the population growth dynamics which cannot completely reflect the metabolic activity that is also constrained by the availability of metabolic substrates and other environmental factors schauer et al 2014 currently the exact causes for the decline of cable bacteria population are not fully understood according to previous studies several mechanisms may be responsible for the decline of cable bacteria in laboratory incubations the first one is the depletion of resources that supply sulfide for the metabolism of cable bacteria risgaard petersen et al 2012 meysman et al 2015 rao et al 2016 sulfide production in sediments is primarily derived from sulfate reduction and the dissolution of fes the release potential of sulfide from these two pathways is dependent on the storage of labile organic matter and fes respectively malkin et al 2014 hermans et al 2020 based on the depth profiles of so2 4 fig s3 and fe2 in pore water the relative importance of sulfate reduction and fes dissolution in sulfide production was estimated during incubation the results revealed that sulfate reduction was the major source of sulfide production accounting for over 95 and the rate of sulfate reduction significantly decreased at the end of incubation table s2 therefore from the perspective of resource depletion the level of labile organic matter storage not fes is more likely to limit the activity of cable bacteria in this study another possible reason that may limit the bloom of cable bacteria is the extreme acidic condition in suboxic zone or alkaline condition in oxic layer caused by the activity of cable bacteria which may exceed their critical physiological values and thus resulting in decreased activity nielsen and risgaard petersen 2015 evidence suggested that the periplasm proteins of cable bacteria are adapted to neutral ph and may become denatured under alkaline conditions ph 8 5 leading to the collapse of cable bacteria population collected from marine habitats kjeldsen et al 2019 in this study the observed ph values in oxic sediment zone at peak e sox activity day 30 is up to 8 60 whether this level of alkalinity is harmful for cable bacteria inhabiting in freshwater sediments remain unknown however the acidity tolerance threshold of cable bacteria has not been reported until now 4 2 the impact of e sox activity on fe and mn cycling accompanied with the development of cable bacteria significant biogeochemical changes occur in the incubated cores from the oxic treatment the sulfide oxidation associated with e sox induces acid production in subsurface sediment which subsequently cause the dissolution of metal minerals at these depths as indicated by the depth overlap between the increase of fe2 and mn2 fluxes fig 5a b and the sharp decrease of ph fig 1 the maximum peak of fe and mn production in the porewater develops at day 30 which coincided with the appearance of maximum acidification ph minimum 6 61 in the suboxic zone at peak e sox activity fig 5a b table 1 higher release of dissolved fe2 compared to dissolved mn2 may be due to the low availability of mn minerals in incubation sediments hermans et al 2020 or the faster dissolution mechanics of fes vs mnco3 lenstra et al 2020 the peaks of fe2 and mn2 production widen with time and extend a depth range of 4 0 cm in sediments which is smaller than generally observed in marine sediments rigaard petersen et al 2012 van de velde et al 2016 hermans et al 2020 the extended depth of fe2 and mn2 release as a result of the metabolism of cable bacteria can reach up to 7 10 cm in marine sediments van de velde et al 2016 2017 hermans et al 2020 this is probably attributed to the higher presence of organic matter and iron sulfide in marine sediments which provides a more conducive environment for the proliferation of cable bacteria population as compared to freshwater sediments a fraction of the mobilized fe2 and mn2 subsequently diffuses downwards where they can be trapped by reprecipitation as fes or as carbonate minerals fig 5a b the rest is transported upward to the oxic zone where they are converted into oxidized iron and manganese minerals in surface sediments fig 6 rao et al 2016 iron production decreases sharply before reaching the oxic zone which suggests that the oxidation of fe2 is mostly coupled to the reduction of manganese oxides fig 5a sulu gambari et al 2016a the metabolism of cable bacteria produced a current density of 7 1 ma m 2 at its peak activity which would stimulate the upward diffusion of positively charge irons such as fe2 and mn2 because of the ionic drift created by the electric field risgaard petersen et al 2014 rao et al 2016 van de velde et al 2016 in line with the enrichment of iron and manganese oxides fes gradually depleted over time after 3 days of incubation the fes inventory decreased by 33 mmol m 2 relative to the anoxic control treatment table 2 most of the fes was consumed in the 0 0 5 cm depth layer which suggests that oxidation of fes was the cause of the depletion fig 6a as the ph minimum develops at day 20 the depletion of fes extends to the deeper sediments fig 6a at the end of incubation experiment a total of 270 mmol m 2 was consumed in the depth of 0 4 cm sediments which matched the increased amount of fe oxides 260 mmol m 2 table 2 the solid phase depth profiles show that the increased deposition of fe oxides also occurs below the oxygen penetration depth 0 13 0 17 cm further confirming that mn oxides are responsible for the reoxidation of the reduced iron fig 5 sulu gambari et al 2016a the formation of and fe oxide layer near the sediment surface will affect the release of p from the sediment 4 3 the impact of e sox activity on p cycling dgt flux profiles of po3 4 in porewater show a substantial decrease of po4 3 flux within the top 0 2 cm surface sediment with increasing of e sox activity fig 5c the removal of p in porewater is more obvious at the later incubation stages day 53 to day 70 which coincide with the prominent enrichment of fe mn oxides below the oxic layer of sediments similar temporal patterns also develop in the fe oxide bound p and exchangeable p at the sediment surface fig 6d e the depth of the p enrichment in the solid phase was comparable with that of iron and manganese oxides suggesting that the formation of a metal oxide layer controlled the removal of p from the pore water similarly as observed in lake grevelingen and the baltic sea sulu gambari et al 2016a herman et al 2020 throughout the whole incubation period the flux of po3 4 to the dgt gel in the overlying water from the oxic treatment remains at a very low level 0 09 mmol m 2 d 1 which shows that the increased subsurface enrichment of metal oxides caused by the e sox activity efficiently acted as a firewall to prevent the sedimentary p release into bottom water sulu gambari et al 2016b interestingly the depth range where po3 4 fluxes decrease was broader than that of the iron and manganese oxides enrichment in particular at day 53 where the enrichment of fe and mn oxides only occurs within the depth of top 0 1 cm sediments the decrease in po3 4 flux extends down to 2 cm fig 5c because po3 4 removal does not happen in the anoxic control core other cable bacteria related mechanisms besides the buildup of iron and manganese oxides may be responsible for this phenomenon rao et al 2016 proposed that the metabolism of cable bacteria creates a suboxic zone characterized by low levels of sulfide and high levels of dissolved fe and p which favors the formation of vivianite leading to the sequestration of p in deeper sediments however this remains to be demonstrated cellular internalization may be another mechanism for p sequestration in sediments with active cable bacteria previous studies have demonstrated that several groups of sulfur oxidizing bacteria e g beggiatoaceae sulforimunas thiomargarita namibiensis can facilitate a remarkably high storage of polyphosphate inclusions within their lipid p membranes and thereby greatly alter sedimentary p dynamics schulz and schulz 2005 rydin et al 2023 such polyphosphate inclusions are also present in cable bacteria sulu gambari et al 2016b geerlings et al 2022 however the amount of cellular internalized p is much lower than that of p bearing fe oxides sulu gambari et al 2016b hence further research is required to unravel the role of cable bacteria on these alternative mechanisms after cable bacteria activity has declined on day 53 the iron oxide layer as well as the associated p enrichments remained stable fig 5a c the oxygenated conditions of overlying water during incubation may have contributed to the prevention of fe oxides bound p dissolution in surface sediment however this mechanism was restricted to the oxygen permeant depth opd of 0 13 0 17 cm our results demonstrated the increased reactive fe oxides below the opd account for 60 of the total increase observed at day 75 fig 6 the stable presence of metal oxides layer in deeper sediments likely due to the minimal sulfide build up in our freshwater sediments which could readily dissolved the iron oxides on day 75 even though the activity of cable bacteria had almost disappeared a noticeable suboxic zone remain persisted beneath the oxic layer fig 1a in this study the increased amount of fe oxides in oxic treatment at the end of incubation is approximately 0 18 mol fe m 2 as calculated from the inventory difference in fe oxides between oxic and control treatments at the 0 2 cm depth given the sulfide efflux rate of 0 50 mmol h2s m 2 d 1 as the calculated σh2s flux is 0 46 mmol m 2 d 1 in control treatment at day 75 this fe oxides pool is potentially capable of buffering h2s production for up to 360 d under anoxic conditions this period is greatly exceeds the lasted duration of the metal oxides and p enriched layers that estimated or observed 60 days during hypoxic periods in marine sediments even though more reactive iron oxides 0 95 mol fe m 2 are generated in these environments when cable bacteria are active seitaj et al 2015 sulu gambari et al 2016b this discrepancy may be ascribed to the limited sulfide production typically found in sediments in freshwater habitats of cable bacteria in comparison to that of their marine habitats as illustrated in table s3 these findings implied that cable bacteria could prevent sedimentary p release for a much longer time in freshwater system than commonly observed in marine systems especially under hypoxia conditions to further confirm this conclusion more laboratory or field studies are needed to examine the formation and the stability of metal oxides and p enriched layers on various freshwater habitats under different redox conditions in addition to the activity of cable bacteria the enrichment of metal oxides bound p in surface sediments can also occur in oxygenated conditions in their absence however in sediments with active cable bacteria the enhanced dissolution of fe and mn minerals in deeper sediment layers leads to higher upward fluxes of fe2 and mn2 to the surface sediment and subsequently resulting in an increased oxidation of these elements in the near surface sediment over a given time period rao et al 2016 thus it is expected that the enrichment of fe and mn oxides in subsurface sediment will be more pronounced and significant in sediments hosting active cable bacteria than in those without them under comparable environmental conditions this has been verified by several field studies on marine sediments sulu gambari et al 2016a b found that the conversion of fes in surface sediment to fe oxides during spring march when cable bacteria were highly abundant was over 10 folds greater than observed during fall november when there were no cable bacteria present in both seasons the bottom water is well oxygenated coincide with this less buildup of fe oxides bound p was observed the mean benthic flux of phosphate in november 0 095 µmol cm 2 d was more than 8 folds higher than that observed in march 0 011 µmol cm 2 d comparable findings were also documented by seitaj et al 2015 in their research conducted in the same basin owing to limitations in experimental design a direct comparison of the dynamics of fe mn and p in surface sediment under oxic conditions with or without cable bacteria was not possible in this study however this information is necessary for a more accurate evaluation of the contribution of cable bacteria to the retention of p in surface sediments in freshwater system and thus requiring further research 5 environmental implications internal p loading from sediments has been considered as a major cause for eutrophication and bottom water hypoxia in freshwater systems especially in shallow aquatic environments with a long history of nutrients loading orihel et al 2017 paytan et al 2017 qin et al 2019 sedimentary p dynamics are governed by organic matter availability and the redox chemistry of fe or mn which in turn is driven by oxygen levels in the bottom waters mortimer et al 1942 jilbert et al 2022 under anoxic conditions sedimentary p release is promoted by the reductive dissolution of p bearing fe and mn oxides and preferential p generation from organic matter sundby et al 1992 ingall and jahnke 1994 rydin 2000 whereas under oxic conditions p is typically sequestered by the labile fe and mn oxides and in some cases by mn ii phosphates in surface sediments consequently reducing benthic p release orihel et al 2017 hermans et al 2019b 2021 our results demonstrated that activity of cable bacteria can strongly govern internal p dynamics in eutrophic freshwater sediments this is in concert with what has been previously observed in brackish and marine sediments sulu gambari et al 2016b hermans et al 2021 however due to the less efficient dissolution of fe oxides bound p in freshwater systems the reduction of benthic p release caused by cable bacteria may active over a longer time scale compared to marine systems in the present study the retention of p the sum of fe bound p and exchangeable p increased more than 240 mmol m 2 day 75 in the top 0 2 cm sediment due to cable bacteria activity compared to the initial incubation stage day 3 table 2 the average depth of the studied river is about 1 5 m if all of the additionally retained p in surface sediment is released will lead to an increase of 5 mg l p in the water body under static conditions without water exchange this implied that cable bacteria could play an important role in regulating internal p release in eutrophic freshwater environments however the findings of this study are based on a single laboratory incubation experiment conducted under specific conditions the extent to which these impacts will occur in eutrophic shallow freshwater systems under natural conditions is not fully understood additionally it is uncertain whether these conclusions can be generalized to other types of freshwater systems with different biogeochemical characteristics therefore it is imperative to conduct further research on various types of sediments under realistic field conditions to gain an in depth understanding of the exact role of cable bacteria in controlling the internal release of phosphorus in eutrophic freshwater systems declaration of competing
